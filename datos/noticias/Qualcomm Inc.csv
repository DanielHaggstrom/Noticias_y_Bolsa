Mr Mollenkopf was given the $3.6m award of full-vested shares last year after Apple and Qualcomm announced the dismissal of all litigation between the parties and agreed to a historic six-year licence agreement in April. The dispute had been weighing on investor sentiment at Qualcomm. When it was resolved, the company’s shares surged 40 per cent in a week.Qualcomm declined to comment but in a January filing it said that “one-time grants” between $250,000 and $3.6m were issued to executives “to recognise outstanding efforts in entering into multiyear licence and chipset supply agreements with Apple.” Its Compensation Committee considered the payments appropriate, given “the anticipated long-term stockholder value” of the agreement.BlackRock acknowledged the event’s “importance” but said that Qualcomm “did not provide sufficient justification for why this outcome with Apple is outside Mr Mollenkopf’s realm of responsibilities as CEO, which are already covered in the company’s long-term executive compensation plan.”It added: “Ultimately, granting this one-off award suggests a pay plan that is not aligned with shareholders’ long-term interests, which is difficult to reconcile with ongoing underperformance versus Qualcomm’s peers, raising a perceived pay-for-performance disconnect.”After criticism mounted, Qualcomm issued a “supplemental” filing explaining that during its two-year dispute with Apple equity grant values had been “depressed” by its lower stock price. “For instance, for our CEO, only 26 per cent of Performance Stock Unit (PSU) target shares were earned, in large part because of the ongoing dispute.” The one-time special reward was meant to make up for this.The fund manager also voted against the re-election of Harish Manwani, the longest-tenured member of the company’s remuneration committee. According to Capital IQ, the data provider, BlackRock holds more than 7 per cent of Qualcomm’s shares. BlackRock rarely publicly criticises companies, instead focusing on private conversations with board directors to try to influence businesses. In January, however, BlackRock boss Larry Fink announced plans to be more transparent about its voting record at annual meetings and its discussions with companies. The rebuke of Qualcomm marks the first time BlackRock has outlined why it voted against a US company at an annual meeting since Mr Fink’s announcement, although the asset manager criticised Siemens over its role in a controversial Australia coal-mining project earlier this year following the German company’s annual meeting. It also outlined why it did not back a so-called digital dividend at a special meeting of Overstock.com last month.The rebellion by shareholders over pay will prove embarrassing to Qualcomm. Only 3 per cent of US companies lost their pay votes last year, according to data from Willis Towers Watson.Ahead of Qualcomm’s annual meeting, ISS had called on shareholders to vote against executive pay at the company. The proxy adviser gives Qualcomm a compensation score of nine, its second-worst possible rating, citing a lack of performance criteria and two years of “significant” special rewards.
1;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-02-09T13:37:02Z;US regulators face off in court tussle over Qualcomm;DoJ fears an FTC case against chipmaker could weaken US in its battle against China’s Huawei;The Trump administration is set for an unusual courtroom showdown on Thursday between lawyers of two federal antitrust agencies who will argue opposite sides of a Qualcomm case that could help shape the race to develop 5G technology.The Department of Justice has taken the US chipmaker’s side as Qualcomm tries to overturn its loss at trial last year in a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit filed in the final days of the Obama administration.Lawyers for the DoJ’s antitrust division, headed by Makan Delrahim, a former Qualcomm lobbyist recused from the case, have argued that US national security is at stake, while FTC attorneys have accused the DoJ of interfering with antitrust enforcement.“This is not just unusual, it’s more directly confrontational than anything I’ve ever seen,” said Bill Baer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has headed competition enforcement under Democratic presidents at both the DoJ and the FTC.The controversial move by the DoJ is just one example of the interventionist approach increasingly taken by parts of the Trump administration as the White House tries to chip away at the lead China has taken in the development of 5G communications.Qualcomm is accused of overcharging for patents that smartphone makers have to buy to meet industry standards for cellular communications. A district judge ruled in May last year the US chipmaker had “strangled competition” and ordered drastic changes to its sales practices.The DoJ argued that even if Qualcomm had charged “unreasonably high” prices, that would be allowed under US competition law, saying that to find otherwise could “radically undermine important incentives to innovate”.Its lawyers have argued that a loss for Qualcomm could damage national security by “potentially undermining US leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests”.In 2018, the US cited national security concerns when it blocked a $142bn bid for Qualcomm by Singapore’s Broadcom.More recently, the administration had countenanced radical steps such as purchasing direct controlling stakes in competitors to Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment provider, to help secure US 5G capabilities.The DoJ’s intervention in the FTC’s Qualcomm case has given the chipmaker much-needed support in a lawsuit that could deal a serious blow to its business after a series of similar cases across the world.But it has also fuelled tensions between the two agencies, which have become more apparent as both the DoJ and the FTC have pursued parallel and sweeping investigations of possible antitrust violations by Big Tech companiesBoth the DoJ and the FTC have responsibility for civil enforcement of US competition law. But they have historically avoided interfering in each other’s cases, instead allocating investigations to each other through a clearance process.Joseph Simons, the FTC’s chairman, who is also recused from the lawsuit because his former law firm worked for Qualcomm, has called the DoJ’s intervention “highly unusual”.“I’m sure they would not be happy if we did that to their case. So, you can imagine what the reaction was over here,” he told the Financial Times in an interview last year.The FTC first sued Qualcomm in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, when two of its five commissioner positions were vacant. The vote to file the case was 2-1.After a trial last year, the DoJ intervened to urge Judge Lucy Koh not to impose tough remedies on Qualcomm. The DoJ also helped Qualcomm secure a partial stay on Judge Koh’s ruling as it supported the company’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit.FTC lawyers have hit back at the DoJ’s involvement, arguing that its position amounts to giving Qualcomm immunity from “any financial consequences for violating the antitrust laws”.In filings, Qualcomm has said its negotiations with phonemakers are in effect between equal parties, saying they “negotiate hard” and it “takes steps to preserve its patent rights”.“There is no basis for the FTC’s attempt to recharacterize this common bargaining between sophisticated companies as federal antitrust violations,” it said in a December filing. The company also seized on the DoJ’s intervention to bolster its position. “The dubious quality of the District Court’s reasoning is also underscored by regulators’ own stark disagreement about this case,” it wrote.The litigation has highlighted a broader programme of intervening in non-DoJ lawsuits spearheaded by Mr Delrahim, as well a deeper ideological dispute about the proper role of competition enforcement in matters involving patents.Mr Delrahim, a patent lawyer by training, has argued forcefully that antitrust law has little role to play in disputes over the licensing of intellectual property.Though his signature is absent from filings in the FTC v. Qualcomm case, he has made his views clear in a series of speeches and by backing his former client in a related class-action lawsuit whose allegations are similar to the FTC’s.His views are shared by at least one Republican FTC commissioner, Christine Wilson, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal last year that the district court ruling against Qualcomm was “far outside the mainstream”.“I encourage higher courts to reconsider the wisdom of the judge’s conclusions,” she wrote.Mr Simons’ recusal has left the FTC in effect deadlocked on the case, unable to signal clear political support for the litigation, nor to reach a settlement with Qualcomm.Without his vote, the agency is split between the remaining two Republicans, including Ms Wilson, and two Democratic commissioners.In November, William Rinner, Mr Delrahim’s chief of staff, said at a conference that the FTC’s case was going “forward like a ship without a rudder”.He argued that history would view the DoJ’s actions as “probably one of the least controversial aspects of the case”.Spokespeople for DoJ, FTC and Qualcomm had no comment for this piece.
2;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-01-19T13:00:12Z;Tech innovation needs a level playing field;Big companies can use lawyers to protect IP while smaller players go to the wall;America used to be the world’s premier technology innovator and China its best duplicator. But the roles are shifting, as has been shown by two major business stories of 2020: the signing of phase one of a US-China trade agreement, and the battle between Google and the wireless speaker maker Sonos.The administration of US president Donald Trump touted the former as a major concession by China, which has vowed to strengthen its intellectual property protection. In fact, the deal merely repackages changes that China has already made over the past two years, strengthening court jurisdiction over IP cases and making it easier for US companies to collect damages.It is telling that American chipmaker Qualcomm was able to win its multi-continental lawsuits against Apple for non-essential patent infringement in part because it decided to pursue the case in Germany and China rather than the US. It was easier to get injunctive relief in those countries. The fact that China was quicker to enforce Qualcomm’s patents than the US is a sign of the changing times.History shows it is no surprise that China has been strengthening patent protection. Countries always do as they move up the economic ladder and have more intellectual property of their own to protect. Of course, the enforcement of court rulings can be speeded up or slowed down by Beijing. But it’s worth noting that Chinese intellectual property payments to foreigners have grown on average 20 per cent per year since 2000. I have spoken to numerous venture capitalists, IP lawyers and consultants who say that, in terms of the legal system at least, China has actually become a very good place to protect innovation.The US, on the other hand, seems to be going in the opposite direction. I’ve written previously about the way in which the American patent system was reshaped under the second term of President Barack Obama’s administration to favour the interests of Big Tech over those of smaller companies — those whose viability depends not on the network effect, but on protecting discrete bits of innovation. This shift threatens entrepreneurship in many areas, from life sciences and artificial intelligence to quantum computing.The battles between Sonos and both Google and Amazon are a case in point. Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them via Amazon. While developing its business over the past several years, it has worked closely with both companies, building its own products around theirs.Google and Amazon then turned around and launched their own cut-price smart speakers, eating into Sonos’s business in a white-hot market (smart speaker sales increased over 18 per cent in the six months leading up to the 2019 holiday season). In the process, Sonos claims, Google infringed on multiple patents.Sonos could only afford to take on one Big Tech company at a time, so it chose Google, with which it claims to have reached a standstill. One of the problems in such David-and-Goliath battles is that the smaller companies not only have fewer lawyers, they can go out of business waiting for legal battles to be resolved.This is basically what happened to Foundem, the UK search firm that eventually won an EU antitrust case against Google, for algorithmically burying the smaller company’s position in search results, after fighting in and out of court for 12 years. Those sorts of cases are one reason that EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager wants to put the burden of proof in such instances on the Big Tech companies themselves.Creating an even playing field will require both monopoly scrutiny and a close examination of whether the pendulum in the patent system has swung too far towards benefiting tech companies that depend more on data and networks than patents, or have an interest in making it tougher to obtain patents.Because their own products (for example, smartphones) require so many different bits of technology, the companies have an interest in keeping these inputs as cheap as possible. They can deploy legions of lawyers to protect any crucial IP of their own while “efficiently infringing” on the patents that belong to others (that’s the term for violations done knowingly by big companies as a cost of doing business).The US, in particular, has work to do there. “Our leadership on the global stage depends on our ability to promote and protect the innovations of American creators, engineers, and scientists,” said Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who has sponsored bipartisan legislation to strengthen America’s own IP protection. “I’m concerned that while our competitors — like China — strengthen their intellectual property regimes, we have been weakening our own innovation ecosystem.”But the US has another problem — that of trying to compete with a state-run economy like China’s when it has no national innovation strategy. While large American companies are busy fighting each other in expensive legal battles to see who gets to set standards for smart speakers (or 5G, or AI, or a host of other areas), China is using its Belt and Road Initiative to roll out its own equipment, technology standards and interests across nations from Asia to Southern Europe. That’s not duplication. It’s just smart.rana.foroohar@ft.comFollow Rana Foroohar with myFT and on Twitter
3;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-11-06T21:43:59Z;Qualcomm brushes off trade war concerns with strong fourth quarter;US chipmaker predicts its investments in 5G will start to pay off in the new year;Qualcomm dispelled some of the concerns about the effects on its business from the US trade war with China and attack on Huawei, as it posted stronger than expected results for the final quarter of its fiscal year.The news pushed the company’s shares up by 3 per cent in after-market trading, adding to a rally that had already seen them rise 24 per cent since an earnings disappointment three months ago.The rebound has come as Wall Street looks ahead to a promised business pick-up from 5G in 2020, with the US chipmaker predicting that its investments in the new mobile technology will start to pay off in the first quarter of the new year.For the three months to the end of September, Qualcomm reported revenue of $4.8bn, or $1bn less than the year before, with pro forma earnings per share falling by 12 per cent, to 78 cents. The decline has come as the US has barred its tech companies from supplying Huawei, hampering access to the Chinese market just as 5G sales start to build.However, revenue was still $100m ahead of analysts’ expectations, with earnings per share 7 cents ahead.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive officer, said the figures reflected a “solid performance” from the company’s licensing division. Despite recording no sales from Huawei in the quarter, Qualcomm said its licensing revenue grew by 4 per cent, to $1.16bn, while earnings before taxes from licensing rose 11 per cent, to $792m.By contrast, revenue from the company’s chipset business fell 22 per cent, to $3.6bn, while pre-tax earnings fell 37 per cent, to $499m.Qualcomm said an interim licensing agreement under which it had received $450m from Huawei ended in its third fiscal quarter, and that “although negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement” with the Chinese handset maker.
4;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-08-23T16:14:04Z;Qualcomm wins partial stay on antitrust ruling;;Qualcomm has won a partial stay on a court ruling that threatened to upend its business, a victory for the US chipmaker as it seeks to overturn an antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.The ninth circuit court of appeals on Friday granted Qualcomm a stay on certain remedies imposed by a lower court that found the company had “strangled competition” and kept its royalty rates “unreasonably high”.The ruling by the appeals court in the controversial case, which has seen the Department of Justice take the unusual step of intervening to side with Qualcomm, suggested the judges have some scepticism towards the arguments made by the FTC.“While the FTC prosecuted this antitrust enforcement action, the DOJ filed a statement of interest expressing its stark disagreement that Qualcomm has any antitrust duty to deal with rival chip suppliers,” the ruling said.“We are satisfied that Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination that Qualcomm has an antitrust duty to license its [standard essential patents] to rival chip suppliers,” it added.The stay means Qualcomm will, for now, not have to renegotiate its license agreements, make “exhaustive” standard essential patent licenses available to its competitors, or stop linking chip sales to the purchase of patent licenses.Bruce Hoffman, director of the FTC’s bureau of competition, said he was disappointed in the decision and noted that the partial stay meant several of the district court’s remedies remained in effect.“While I am disappointed in the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay part of the district court’s order, we respect the decision and look forward to defending the district court’s decision on the merits,” he said in a statement.Don Rosenberg, general counsel for Qualcomm, welcomed the decision and said it “keeps intact Qualcomm’s patent-licensing practices”.“We are pleased that the Ninth Circuit granted our request and believe the district court decision will be overturned once the merits of our appeal have been considered,” he said in a statement.A justice department spokesman had no comment.

6;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-07-31T23:17:08Z;Qualcomm’s gloomy outlook sends shares sliding;US chipmaker sees weakness in China and poor smartphone demand;Chipmaker Qualcomm laid bare the effects of a slowdown in the global smartphone market and tensions between the US and China on Wednesday, disappointing investors with weak sales guidance for the rest of the year.The US company blamed “continued weakness in China”, where it said phonemaker Huawei was gaining market share. It also pointed to slowing global demand for 4G devices, as the market prepares to transition to next generation 5G wireless technology.The market was “not seeing the usual seasonal uptick” from device makers preparing for the holiday season, it said.Shares fell 5 per cent in after-hours trading, following its quarterly update. The company said it anticipated fourth-quarter sales of between $4.3bn and $5.1bn, compared with $5.8bn in 2018 and below the $5.7bn expected by Wall Street, according to a consensus of analyst forecasts compiled by FactSet.Adjusted earnings were likely to be between 65 cents and 75 cents, compared with 89 cents last year and below expectations of $1.09, the company said.The Trump administration’s ban on American companies doing business with Huawei had not only hit Qualcomm’s direct sales to the Chinese manufacturer. The Chinese company has been growing its market share at home at the expense of foreign rivals.Chipmakers have complained of slowing smartphone sales for months. AMD signalled weakening demand in its results on Tuesday evening, which sent its shares down more than 10 per cent on Wednesday, although other semiconductor companies have expressed more optimism recently.Qualcomm reported adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents for the three months to June 30, its fiscal third quarter. That was a 20 per cent decline year on year but ahead of analyst estimates of 76 cents. Although revenue jumped 73 per cent to $9.6bn, the surge was entirely due to a $4.7bn one-off payment from phonemaker Apple, as part of a significant legal settlement agreed earlier this year.The third quarter also saw Apple resume royalty payments to Qualcomm, which it had suspended when the two companies first came to blows in 2017.Stripping out the big Apple payment, Qualcomm’s third-quarter sales were $4.9bn, down from last year and below expectations of $5.1bn. Chip sales fell, as did revenues in the company’s more profitable licensing arm, which slipped 10 per cent to $1.29bn. That was better than expectations of $1.27bn, however.Settling its tangle of legal cases with Apple has not meant the end of Qualcomm’s litigation woes, since the company remains embroiled in a dispute with Huawei. It said the Chinese company had made its final payment of $150m in licensing fees in the quarter, as part of an interim agreement that had now come to an end, but that this did not represent the full amount of royalties due.“Although negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement with Huawei. If no agreement is reached, Huawei may not make any other payments or may not make full payments under the underlying license agreement,” Qualcomm said.
7;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-07-18T10:47:53Z;EU hits Qualcomm with €242m fine over pricing;Penalty imposed on US chipmaker as antitrust chief Vestager prepares to leave office;The US chip giant Qualcomm was hit with a €242m fine on Thursday by the European Commission for abusing its dominant market position by using predatory pricing, concluding a nine-year case just as Brussels’ antitrust chief prepares to leave office.The commission’s investigation found that Qualcomm from 2009 to 2011 sold its own chipsets to two big customers without covering the cost of manufacturing them, with the explicit aim of pushing out smaller competitors such as the British start-up Icera.The case is the second major penalty handed out by Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, to the US group for using unlawful business practices to muscle out competing 3G and 4G chipsets.Last year Qualcomm was fined €997m by the EU for abusing its dominant market position by paying Apple billions of dollars to exclusively use its products in its iPhones and iPads, blocking alternative providers.The commission’s decision on Thursday relates to how Qualcomm illegally offered Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE lower-priced products known as baseband chipsets, which allowed 3G mobile connectivity back in 2009.“Dominant companies have a special responsibility not to impair competition in the market. They can sell at low prices but not below costs, with the intention of eliminating a competitor,” said Ms Vestager.“To make sure Icera’s business could not reach a size that could endanger the market position of Qualcomm, Qualcomm took what it describes in internal documents as ‘preventive actions’. This means offering very targeted price concessions to two strategically important customers, namely Huawei and ZTE.”Qualcomm has said it will appeal against the findings, which it said was “unsupported by the law, economic principles or market facts”.Don Rosenberg, executive vice-president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said: “The commission spent years investigating sales to two customers, each of whom said that they favoured Qualcomm chips not because of price but because rival chipsets were technologically inferior.”In 2010, Qualcomm sold 60 per cent of these chipsets worldwide, and Bristol-based Icera was one of just two other companies in the world that had a working 3G chip. At the time, the eight-year-old start-up was collaborating with Huawei, but Huawei said it could not sell Icera’s product because Qualcomm had threatened to increase its licence fee if it did, according to a source close to the complaint.Qualcomm’s tactics led to Icera losing business, and was one of the contributing factors to the company’s eventual sale to Nvidia for $352m in 2011, the person said.Defending the amount of the fine, which has been set at 1.27 per cent of Qualcomm’s turnover in 2018, Ms Vestager said the commission’s investigation did show predatory pricing, but “can’t show definitely that this is what pushed Icera to be bought by another company and eventually out of the baseband chipset market”.The Qualcomm case is one of the last big decisions of Ms Vestager’s five-year term as competition commissioner, which has smashed competition enforcement records by hitting Google with more than €8bn in fines and forcing Apple to pay €14bn in back taxes.
8;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-07-17T19:33:56Z;Vestager’s parting shot at big tech aims for Amazon and Qualcomm;Brussels competition chief questions how US giants use data and exploit dominance;The EU has launched a formal investigation into Amazon and is preparing to fine US chipmaker Qualcomm as Europe’s antitrust chief prepares a final assault on US tech groups before she leaves office.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said she had opened the investigation into how Amazon uses data from other merchants selling goods on its websites. Brussels is also poised to conclude a four-year probe into US chipmaker Qualcomm by fining the company for abuse of dominant position, according to two people briefed on the investigation.The two cases come close to the end of Ms Vestager’s five-year term as competition commissioner, a period in which she built an international reputation as a tough enforcer focused on market-rigging, consumer mistreatment and tax evasion. The Dane will change jobs on November 1, becoming a top deputy to new commission chef, Ursula von der Leyen.Many of the biggest cases of her mandate feature big tech companies such as Google, which Brussels has collectively fined more than €8bn in three separate antitrust cases, and Apple, which was ordered to pay €13bn in back taxes to the Irish governmentThe latest moves come only weeks after President Donald Trump accused Ms Vestager of hating the US.The Amazon case casts doubt over an important part of the online retailer’s business model in Europe.Brussels has been conducting a preliminary investigation into Amazon’s business practices since last year, exploring the company’s dual role as both a retailer and a host of rival third-party merchants — sellers that use Amazon as a platform to market their goods.Brussels said that its formal investigation would look at the “standard agreements” between Amazon and third-party merchants and how “the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition.”The commission is also probing how retailers qualify for the “Buy Box” — the button that allows customers to add a product directly to their online shopping cart. For a retailer, “winning” the buy box means that when a customer searches for a particular product, and then clicks to buy it, that retailer’s offer is chosen ahead of competitors.A formal probe could ultimately lead to fines or force Amazon to change its business practices. That could include altering the conditions it places on third parties, or placing restrictions on how their data can be used to develop competing Amazon productsThe commission rarely opens formal investigations on big companies without being confident it can build a solid case.Amazon said in a statement that it would “co-operate fully with the European Commission”.The commission said that its investigation would be taken forward as “a matter of priority”.On Qualcomm, the commission is expected to announce within days that it is fining the company for price dumping on some of its chipsets. The fine, which two people briefed on the case said would be less than €1bn, comes on top of a €997m penalty handed down by Brussels last year for separate antitrust abuses. The fine could be announced as soon as Thursday.The Brussels moves come in the same week that Amazon and other big tech companies including Google, Facebook and Apple were grilled by the US Congress during an antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill.Amazon’s lawyer, Nate Sutton, faced questions on its use of third-party seller data by David Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, who accused Amazon of being a “trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data on millions of purchases and billions in commerce and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and favour its own product”.
9;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-07-16T23:55:37Z;US government agencies push to stall Qualcomm ruling;DoJ backs chipmaker’s appeal on antitrust case in ‘national interest’;The Department of Justice and other US government agencies have weighed in on behalf of Qualcomm in an effort to stall an antitrust ruling that could severely damage the American chip company’s business.The push, made in submissions to the ninth circuit appeals court, marks the latest intervention from Washington to back Qualcomm at a critical moment, and brought a 5 per cent jump in its share price in after-market trading on Tuesday.The Trump administration, which has argued that the company’s mobile chip technology is key to the US being globally competitive in 5G mobile technology, last year blocked a hostile takeover bid from rival chipmaker Broadcom.The latest move follows a ruling by a district court in May that Qualcomm had “strangled competition” in the market for smartphone modems in order to keep its own royalty rates “unreasonably high”. Judge Lucy Koh, backing a complaint from the Federal Trade Commission, ordered the company to change the way it sells its chips and licenses its patent portfolio. Qualcomm has asked for a delay pending its appeal.In a filing on Tuesday, the justice department exposed a rift between the agencies charged with applying federal antitrust law when it backed the call for a delay and said it believed Qualcomm’s appeal had “a likelihood of success on the merits”.The lower court ruling “threatens competition, innovation and national security”, it argued, while “potentially undermining US leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests”.In other US government submissions backing Qualcomm, officials from the energy and defence departments argued that the company’s technology was vital to their agencies and could be harmed if the lower court ruling was applied.Even a short-term dent to Qualcomm could “significantly impact US national security”, leaving an opening for foreign companies to take over leadership of setting 5G standards in a way that could expose America to future cyber espionage, the DoJ said. The ruling against Qualcomm comes at a time when the US trying to limit Huawei’s influence over the next-generation mobile technology, though the Chinese equipment maker was not named in the court submission.The justice department went on to argue that Judge Koh’s ruling “ignores established antitrust principles and imposes and overly broad remedy”, giving Qualcomm a good chance of succeeding in its appeal.The intervention is the latest step in a legal back-and-forth over Qualcomm’s business practices that has brought huge volatility to its stock price in recent months. In April its shares rose more than 40 per cent after it resolved a long-running dispute with Apple, which had accused it of charging an excessive amount for its mobile technology.Resolving the dispute with its biggest US customer did not stop Judge Koh from upholding the FTC complaint against Qualcomm, however, sending its shares down again by almost a quarter.
10;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-23T12:23:38Z;Ruling challenges Qualcomm’s business model;Handset makers have balked at chip company’s success in extracting royalties;What do you get when you employ some of the world’s top mobile communications engineers alongside leading patent lawyers? A highly durable moneymaking machine called Qualcomm.Leading handset makers, from Nokia to Apple, have balked at the US chip company’s success in extracting royalties for its intellectual property. Over the past decade, Qualcomm has generated pre-tax profits of around $50bn by forcing handset makers to buy licences. That is more than double the profits from its chipmaking division, which sells the chipsets that power many of the world’s top smartphones.With the dawn of 5G, Qualcomm has its biggest opportunity yet — but only if it can fend off the latest antitrust challenge to its way of doing business.Of all the attempts to take Qualcomm down a peg or two, Judge Lucy Koh’s 233-page judgment, delivered in US federal court in San Jose on Tuesday night, must count as the most thorough. Ruling on a Federal Trade Commission challenge to the company, Judge Koh went back to Qualcomm’s success in CDMA technology in the 1990s to show how it built a self-reinforcing business model that has rolled through successive generations of mobile technology.It is the combination of two businesses under the same roof — IP licensing and chip making — that has made Qualcomm such a power in mobile communications technology, leaving the company with a number of levers it can pull to force customers to pay up.One involves only selling chips to handset makers that agree to license the company’s patent portfolio. Qualcomm has entered the past two generations of mobile communications with a head start in chips, giving it a captive customer base and making it more likely handset makers would have to pay up for the patents. A second practice — charging for its IP based on the value of a handset (up to $400) — has enabled Qualcomm to charge more than it might if the royalties were tied to the price of the silicon. Judge Koh challenged this, pointing out that pricing differences between handsets are based on a lot more than just Qualcomm’s technology.Qualcomm also gives incentives to customers for exclusivity — a practice that has a rich case history in antitrust law, including in successful past cases against Intel and Microsoft.Finally, it refuses to license its IP to other chipmakers, meaning that all handset makers have to come to it direct for a licence. That stops rival chip companies from offering an all-in price to handset customers, something that could bring more competition to the industry. You can look at Qualcomm’s tactics in one of two ways. On the one hand, they provide money that can be ploughed back into R&D, keeping the company at the cutting edge. This is the stance taken by the Trump White House, which has singled Qualcomm out as a national champion. On the other hand, however, the company could be said to have fed a self-sustaining market position that has made it easier to shut out competitors.By picking away at Qualcomm’s tactics, Judge Koh has raised an interesting question. If the ruling stands on appeal, would the company’s ability to earn such high rents from its technology start to unravel?This highlights an important reality about IP in the tech world. Its value usually can’t be measured based on any hard and fast formula. It is only worth as much as its owner is able to extract for its use. Qualcomm has had more success than anyone in this department, so reducing its leverage could feed through directly in the form of lower royalties.What this means in the 5G world that is just dawning is now the key question. Time appears to be on Qualcomm’s side. Legal appeals will drag on. In the meantime, the company already has a clear head start in 5G modems. Apple’s decision last month to settle its patent war underlines how much is at stake: with no credible alternative chip supplier, it didn’t make sense to keep fighting and risk being at Qualcomm’s mercy if the FTC case had gone the other way.But Judge Koh may just have prised open the door to a new era. If her ruling holds, Qualcomm’s customers should be in a stronger position to renegotiate royalties, applying the “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” test that is meant to hold for the use of industry-standard patents. Where royalty rates will settle is hard to judge.Forcing Qualcomm to license its IP to other chipmakers might also bring more competition to the market. Intel, after losing Apple as a customer, has just thrown in the towel and is looking to shed its modem operations. The chances are better now that another company will step in as a buyer and take on Qualcomm — perhaps even Apple itself.richard.waters@ft.com
11;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-22T22:41:52Z;Five ways Qualcomm is said to have squelched its competition;Smartphone chipmaker to appeal damning ruling that says it broke antitrust laws;"Judge Lucy Koh’s verdict that Qualcomm’s smartphone chips business violated US antitrust laws runs over 230 damning pages. The ruling set out a host of ways in which, in Judge Koh’s opinion, the company extracted oversized royalties and pushed competitors out of the market.Qualcomm said it “strongly disagrees” with her decision in favour of the Federal Trade Commission, and that it will appeal. Meanwhile, one of its customers, Samsung, has gone to court to try to have portions redacted, saying the ruling revealed previously secret details about a legal settlement between them.Here are some of Judge Koh’s principle arguments of anti-competitive behaviour that Qualcomm’s lawyers must rebut on appeal.At the heart of the allegations is Qualcomm’s practice of what Judge Koh calls “no licence, no chips” — the alleged requirement to purchase a patent licence in order to receive supplies of modems for smartphones. This approach was “unique within Qualcomm and unique in the industry”, she said.The ruling detailed Qualcomm’s dealings with more than 15 separate mobile phonemakers over almost two decades, including today’s market leaders Samsung, Apple and Huawei. Judge Koh described Qualcomm’s “carrot and stick” approach to its dealings with these companies. The various alleged sticks included cutting off a manufacturer’s chip supply (or threatening to do so), and withholding the sample chips, technical support and software necessary to design a device before it goes into full production. The carrots were “incentive funds” related to chip purchases to “induce” manufacturers to sign licence agreements, which Judge Koh said had the effect of giving Qualcomm “exclusivity and near-exclusivity” with customers.Apple and Qualcomm settled their own litigation over alleged overcharging for the chipmaker’s intellectual property just last month. But Judge Koh found plenty of material in the two companies’ relationship to convince her of Qualcomm’s wrongdoing. Qualcomm’s exclusive modem supply deal with Apple, which ran from 2011 to 2016, served to hurt rivals due to both the volumes and the prestige associated with being in the iPhone. “[T]here are significant strategic benefits as it is unlikely that there will be enough standalone modem volume to sustain a viable competitor without that slot,” Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, wrote in an email to his senior management team in August 2010. Other internal documents showed that Qualcomm was prepared to sacrifice its modem profit margins by as much as 20 per cent in 2015 and 2016 to retain Apple’s business, with its “billion-dollar” incentive payments to the iPhone maker. As well as tactics that served to lock rivals out of the iPhone, Judge Koh cited 10 instances of Qualcomm refusing to license its standard-essential patents, which covered cellular technology. The affected companies include modem development efforts at Intel, Samsung, Broadcom, and Taiwan-based MediaTek.“This practice has promoted rivals’ exits from the market, prevented rivals’ entry, and delayed or hampered the entry and success of other rivals,” she wrote.As it fended off antitrust complaints from around the world over the past decade, Qualcomm was prepared to pay substantial sums to make its legal issues go away, Judge Koh said. Last year, when Samsung and Qualcomm struck a new patent licensing agreement, the chipmaker paid the world’s largest smartphone maker $100m “to extinguish all of Samsung’s antitrust claims and to silence Samsung”, according to Tuesday’s ruling. That is in addition to several years’ worth of “chip incentive funds” that Samsung receives if it meets certain purchase volumes of Qualcomm’s modems. In 2015, Qualcomm settled with China’s National Development and Reform Commission over the agency’s complaint that it had violated Chinese anti-monopoly law. Alongside changes to its royalty scheme and a fine totalling $975m, Qualcomm announced at the time it would create a “China-specific investment fund” of $150m, to invest in “innovative Chinese companies”. But, drawing on evidence from an internal presentation to Qualcomm’s board, Judge Koh instead characterises that $150m as a “contribution to the Chinese government”. Judge Koh challenged the credibility of several Qualcomm executives’ testimony, including Irwin Jacobs, co-founder; Mr Mollenkopf, chief executive; Cristiano Amon, the head of its chips business, and Derek Aberle, former licensing chief. “The court finds Qualcomm’s internal, contemporaneous documents more persuasive than Qualcomm’s trial testimony prepared specifically for this antitrust litigation,” she wrote. “Many Qualcomm executives’ trial testimony was contradicted by these witnesses’ own contemporaneous emails, handwritten notes and recorded statements to the Internal Revenue Service.”Qualcomm’s executives spoke so quickly and appeared to be so well-rehearsed that their own legal counsel had to tell them to “slow down” when they gave testimony in court, she said, but they were “very reluctant and slow to answer” in cross-examination by the FTC.

12;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-22T21:51:48Z;Samsung asks court to redact details of Qualcomm settlement;;Phonemaker Samsung on Wednesday filed an emergency motion to redact “highly sensitive and confidential” details of its settlement with chipmaker Qualcomm that had “inadvertently” been made public.The details, which had previously been kept under seal, were disclosed as part of a damning verdict against Qualcomm’s smartphone chip business by Judge Lucy Koh.Samsung said the revelation that the chipmaker had agreed last year to pay the phonemaker $100m in a settlement would “irreparably harm” its business advantage, since competitors could negotiate “the same or better settlement terms”.The judge in the California court — who has previously overseen blockbuster trials between Apple and Samsung and antitrust litigation over anti-poaching agreements in Silicon Valley — ruled in favour of the US Federal Trade Commission and against Qualcomm on Tuesday.Her findings, which run over 230 pages, lifted the lid on details of the chipmaker’s negotiation and litigation tactics.In a ruling issued late Tuesday, Judge Koh said Qualcomm “strangled competition” in the market for smartphone modems to command “unreasonably high royalty rates” for its intellectual property. Qualcomm said it would seek an expedited appeal of the ruling.“Samsung continues to study the Court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which spans more than 230 pages, to ensure that other previously-sealed confidential material has not been inadvertently disclosed which may need re-sealing,” Samsung said in its motion.
13;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-22T14:15:25Z;US judge rules Qualcomm ‘strangled competition’;Court decision threatens to upset chipmaker’s business model again;Qualcomm “strangled competition” in the lucrative market for smartphone modems to command “unreasonably high royalty rates” for its intellectual property, a judge in California has ruled, in a decision that reopens longstanding complaints over the chipmaker’s business model. The decision on Tuesday came little more than a month after the San Diego-based company settled a multibillion-dollar lawsuit with Apple over complaints of anti-competitive behaviour. Qualcomm’s stock opened 10 per cent lower in early trading to about $70 in New York on Wednesday. Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose ruled in favour of the US Federal Trade Commission, which brought the antitrust case in January 2017, and ordered sweeping changes to the way Qualcomm sells its chips to the likes of Apple and Samsung, and to how it licenses its patent portfolio to rivals such as Intel. “Qualcomm has used its monopoly power . . . to engage in a wide variety of anticompetitive acts against [manufacturers],” Ms Koh wrote. “The evidence demonstrates that Qualcomm’s anticompetitive conduct is ongoing.” Qualcomm said it would seek an expedited appeal of the ruling. “We strongly disagree with the judge’s conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,” said Don Rosenberg, its general counsel.The FTC case set off a string of legal challenges against the chipmaker that many investors had hoped were now close to resolution, following a settlement with Apple last month.But in an unusual intervention earlier this month ahead of the ruling, the US Department of Justice warned that an “overly broad remedy” in the case “has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition”. Qualcomm’s dominance in the supply of modem chips that underpin smartphone connectivity meant that even large manufacturers such as Samsung were forced to agree unfairly high royalty rates, the judge said. “Qualcomm’s ability to charge monopoly prices on premium LTE modem chips over an extended period also shows that competitors were not able to quickly increase output,” she added. “In combination, Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and end consumers in the process,” Ms Koh wrote, making them an “unreasonable restraint of trade”, in breach of the US Sherman act.The judge ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate its current licensing agreements and to license its patents to rival chipmakers at fair prices. She also ordered Qualcomm to submit to monitoring for the next seven years to ensure it abides by the remedies.The ruling comes as President Donald Trump seeks to position Qualcomm as a national champion, forming a vital bulwark against China’s Huawei in the transition to next-generation 5G mobile networks. The White House sees 5G — a new networking standard, in the development of which Qualcomm has played a central role — as a core component of US national security. The Trump administration has pushed other countries to keep Huawei’s equipment out of their mobile infrastructure.
14;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-03T03:17:23Z;DoJ warns Qualcomm case could harm 5G competition;Judge in antitrust case urged to consider risks from a harsh penalty on the chipmaker;The US Department of Justice has requested a hearing to consider possible remedies if a judge rules against chipmaker Qualcomm in an antitrust case, citing possible harm to the 5G industry. In a filing on Thursday, the DoJ asked Judge Lucy Koh to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine an appropriate remedy if she rules against the chipmaker.The Department said there was a “plausible prospect” than an overly harsh ruling could “reduce competition and innovation” in next generation 5G technology and harm American consumers. The case was brought by the US Federal Trade Commission in 2017, which alleged Qualcomm had abused its “monopoly power” and deliberately made it difficult for competitors to innovate. Prosecutors claims Qualcomm had unfairly forced Apple to buy modem chips between 2011 and 2016 in return for charging lower royalty payments. In Thursday's filing, the DoJ said discussions of a remedy should carefully consider the principle that “although a proper remedy must restore any competition lost,” it should “work as little injury as possible to other public policies.” Such a hearing “is vital in monopolisation cases because the obligations the courts impose often have far reaching effects and can reshape entire industries,” it added.The DoJ said it did not take a view on the merits of the case. Judge Koh is expected to rule in the coming weeks.
15;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-05-01T21:11:30Z;Qualcomm outlines $4.7bn revenue boost from Apple settlement;Chipmaker resolved legal battle with the iPhone maker last month;The landmark deal ending legal hostilities between Qualcomm and Apple will boost the chipmaker’s revenues by up to $4.7bn in the coming quarter, the company said.Qualcomm, which reported sales and profits that were ahead of expectations for its fiscal second quarter, provided some financial details of the settlement for the first time in its earnings release on Wednesday.Apple agreed last month to make a one-off payment to settle the multibillion-dollar legal feud over royalty payments, paving the way for Qualcomm chips to be used again in future versions of the iPhone. Qualcomm said it expected to receive an extra $4.5bn-$4.7bn in third-quarter revenues as a result of the payment and the release of its obligations to pay Apple and the iPhone manufacturers certain customer-related liabilities.Chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said: “We are pleased to have reached multiyear agreements with Apple and look forward to continuing to support them as a customer.”Qualcomm’s “roll-out of 5G has officially begun,” he said, adding that this year marked a “tipping point” for the next generation technology and that the majority of 5G smartphones in China now contained Qualcomm chips.The settlement with Apple came as a relief to the chipmaker, whose products had been frozen out of the iPhone for two years. The legal challenge had also threatened its profitable licensing business, on which the company relies for roughly two-thirds of its annual earnings before tax.Earnings had plunged by $2.5bn over the two years, but Qualcomm said the deal with Apple — which included a six-year global patent licence and multiyear chip supply agreements — would return it roughly to where it had been before the legal battle, increasing its earnings per share by about $2 per year, a total of $2.4bn. Apple is expected to begin making licensing payments in the third quarter.In the three months to March 31, Qualcomm’s revenue fell 5 per cent year on year to $5bn, but ahead of analyst expectations of $4.8bn, according to Factset. Pro forma earnings per share came in at $0.77, down from $0.78 in the same quarter last year and ahead of analyst expectations of $0.71.Sales at the chip division fell 4 per cent to $3.7bn on “overall market weakness”, while revenues at the licensing division fell 8 per cent to $1.1bn.Qualcomm said it anticipated a continuation of the slowdown in smartphone sales, in China in particular, as people replaced their phones less often. The company’s shares reacted negatively to the outlook, slipping as much as 5 per cent in after-hours trading.The company said it anticipated sales of between $9.2bn-$10.2bn in its fiscal third quarter, including the one-time payment from Apple. Guidance for pro forma earnings per share was $0.70-$0.80, numbers that disappointed Wall Street analysts. Consensus had been for earnings of $0.87, while in the third quarter of 2018 that figure was $1.01.The company said it was well positioned for the wave of 5G smartphone launches expected this year and in 2020, which would bolster sales in the coming years. In addition to phones, Qualcomm said opportunities lay in the growing adoption of 5G in connected cars and the industrial ‘internet of things’.The adoption of 5G was “moving faster than we saw for 4G,” said Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon.Although Qualcomm said there would be a “dramatic decrease” in the amount of litigation over the next several years, it still has outstanding issues regarding licensing terms. The company is waiting for a judge’s ruling on a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission, which accused Qualcomm of using unfair practices to extract high royalty payments.The company is also yet to resolve a dispute with Huawei, over intellectual property and licensing. Qualcomm said it had booked the final $150m royalty payment from Huawei under an interim agreement with the Chinese telecoms group, but said that if a final deal was not brokered “Huawei may not make any other payments”.
16;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-04-21T22:30:24Z;The global race for 5G supremacy is not yet won;It is important which countries build their networks first, but it’s not the only factor in success;I find it amazing how quickly conventional wisdom about new technology can harden. It is commonly assumed today that 5G, the fifth generation mobile technology that has yet to become a large scale commercial reality, will be dominated by China.Proponents argue that China is moving ahead quickly to build out the necessary infrastructure, while the US and particularly Europe lag behind. China’s homegrown telecoms company Huawei is busy making deals in multiple countries, while the US chip champion, Qualcomm, has been bogged down in a multiyear, multi-continent legal battle with Apple, which came to an end last week.Finally, many believe that it will be easier for a surveillance state such as Beijing to own and harness the data that will be transferred via the 5G chips that will exist in all sorts of products from tyres, to tennis shoes, to foetal heart monitors. The key idea behind this thinking is that we’ve left the “innovation” stage of artificial intelligence use, and the only thing that matters is the data.I challenge this entire premise. Let’s start with the chip wars. Qualcomm, the pre-eminent American innovator in 5G, outspends its domestic peers on innovation, pouring a whopping 25 per cent of revenue into research and development. That focus was cited by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US last year when they pushed back against efforts by Broadcom to push through a hostile takeover of the chipmaker. (Qualcomm supporters argued that the US shouldn’t permit a foreign company to acquire a world-beating innovator in a key technology area.)The tri-continental battle with Apple over the appropriate licensing fee for Qualcomm’s chips really did hurt the company: licensing revenues plunged by $2.5bn during the fight.But now the two sides have settled and dropped all litigation. Apple gets access to Qualcomm’s patents, but the chipmaker is the bigger winner. Not surprisingly, its share price has soared, and management expects profits to return to roughly pre-dispute levels.The deal also means that the world’s most successful smartphone maker and the first company to launch a 5G chip set — both American — can get on with the business of rolling out next generation services. Their return to business as usual will also make it more attractive for Europeans to buy their 5G chips from Qualcomm rather than Huawei, which oddly has yet to make a deal in mainland China. Not only is the US company’s future no longer in doubt, but the Chinese provider has faced sustained criticism from the administration of President Donald Trump in the US, which argues that the use of Huawei equipment threatens American and European security.Secondly, China has been stacking the international telecom standards bodies with their own representatives over the past few years, and they have a head start on 5G network construction. But that does not equate to a lasting technological advantage. China was late to adopt 3G, but that did not stop their progress in 4G, for example. There is no reason to think that the US, or even Europe, cannot catch up in 5G.The Chinese government does have the advantage of being able to direct state-owned operators to build infrastructure, and its companies don’t have to purchase spectrum before offering 5G services. Yet the first country to have an operational 5G network will not be China, but South Korea.It’s important which countries build their networks first, but it’s not the only factor in success. The real advantages of 5G are going to come from the way in which individual companies and industries exploit the potential gains from mining all the data 5G will allow them to collect. Right now, it is impossible to say exactly where those advantages will come from. “Just as no one predicted that one of the major uses of 4G would be a new way of calling taxis, the most important uses for 5G technology are also difficult to predict before it’s actually available,” Dan Wang, an analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics, wrote recently.Just consider the magnitude of the information that is going to be generated by 5G. According to IDC, more than 5bn consumers globally interact with data every day and, by 2025, that number will be 6bn, or 75 per cent of the world’s population. In 2025, each connected person will have at least one data interaction every 18 seconds, it predicts. Many of these interactions will come via the “internet of things”, those 5G chips in everything from vending machines to medical devices.It is hard for me to believe, given that amount of change, and the variety of industries and companies involved, that we have left the innovation phase of AI. When has innovation ever stopped? Even the most expert prognosticators rarely get technological evolution completely right.Consider how the industrial revolution developed: the big things came first, like electricity and the combustion engine. But they were followed by spates of innovative products and services, ranging from automobiles and domestic appliances to wind turbines. There is no reason to think this time will be different — or that China, the US, and Europe can’t all have a piece of the pie. The battle for 5G isn’t set — and it doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game.rana.foroohar@ft.com
17;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-04-19T17:15:17Z;Qualcomm head proves his mettle fending off Apple;Steve Mollenkopf emerges as clear winner in epic legal battle against Tim Cook;There cannot be many chief executives who have faced as many crises as Steve Mollenkopf in his five years as chief executive of US mobile communications technology company Qualcomm.There was the campaign from an activist investor (Jana Partners) to break up the company, and the antitrust challenge that threatened to dry up revenue from Qualcomm’s largest market (China).Then there was the $121bn hostile takeover bid from Broadcom that might have succeeded if the White House had not intervened — not to mention the $44bn acquisition (of NXP) that was scrapped when China failed to approve it.It is almost an understatement when Tom Horton, who has just stepped down from Qualcomm’s board after 10 years as the company’s lead independent director, calls it “a pretty tumultuous time”.But none of that compares with what is set to be one of Mr Mollenkopf’s career-defining moments: facing down his counterpart at Apple, Tim Cook, in an epic global legal battle fought in courts on three continents. The dispute ended in face-to-face negotiations between the two that left Mr Mollenkopf the clear winner this week.He is an engineer in the best sense of the word: He is disciplined, analytical, smartApple has spent the last two years condemning Qualcomm’s fundamental business model. While the company sells mobile communications chips, it relies for most of its profits on charging a royalty on every handset that is sold, regardless of whether it has one of Qualcomm’s chips in it. Now, the iPhone maker has fallen back into line. Qualcomm’s shares jumped nearly 40 per cent, adding $28bn to its stock market value.By any standards it was a stunning victory, and a mark of a steely determination. It is easy to underestimate the Qualcomm chief. With a quiet, affable exterior, he is not given to the sort of messianic bursts that some other tech industry bosses favour.People who have worked with him all point to the same qualities: a calm, highly analytical style, and the self-confidence to stick to a position when he believes he is right. “He is an engineer in the best sense of the word: He is disciplined, analytical, smart,” said Mr Horton.At Qualcomm, he heads a company that has built a unique position in the mobile communications world through a combination of engineering vision and legal resolve. The creation 34 years ago of Irwin Jacobs, an inventor in San Diego who promoted a radical idea for packing more communications traffic into less bandwidth, Qualcomm’s technology has played a key role in the mobile industry since 3G, the industry’s first high-speed data standard.“It’s always been a place that values the science, that values the IP, that values the engineering,” said Scott Barshay, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer who has worked on Mr Mollenkopf’s biggest deals.Mr Mollenkopf arrived at Qualcomm 25 years ago, fresh from getting a masters degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan. His company biography credits him with being listed as an inventor on 38 patents. He rose to head the company’s chip division in 2008, putting him in line to succeed Mr Jacobs’ son, Paul, to become the first non-family member to run the company.On his rise to the top, Mr Mollenkopf was a driving force behind some of the company’s key technology decisions of recent years. He is credited with steering Qualcomm towards LTE, a wireless standard that did not have its roots inside the company, after it had earlier backed a rival technology.And he pushed the company to add computing capabilities alongside the core communications functions on its chips, said Mr Barshay — something that set Qualcomm up to be the leading supplier of the chipsets now used in high-end smartphones.The Qualcomm engineers would not have prospered without the lawyers, though. Its insistence on getting a royalty from all mobile handset makers has brought a series of legal attacks and regulatory challenges, including a bitter fight with Nokia that ended more than a decade agoThe Apple assault, launched in early 2017, rattled Qualcomm’s shareholders and became the ultimate test of Mr Mollenkopf’s ability to stay the course. “He analysed it correctly, he had the courage of his convictions, and he stuck to it,” said Mr Barshay.Neutralising the Apple threat will not end Mr Mollenkopf’s legal and regulatory headaches. The company is appealing against a €1bn antitrust fine last year from the European Union. In the US, a judge is considering an argument from the Federal Trade Commission that would hit at the company’s ability to charge royalties.And even if he succeeds in defending Qualcomm’s way of doing business, he still faces an overriding business question: whether he can use the coming wave of 5G technology to take Qualcomm beyond the maturing handset business into new markets. At the age of 50, and after the battle scars of his first half-decade, it may be just the start.
18;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-04-17T18:05:39Z;Qualcomm’s deal with Apple transforms 5G outlook;End to legal marathon boosts US supplier of next-generation technology;The Trump administration’s hopes of finding a national technology champion for the coming wave of 5G wireless communications may finally be bearing fruit.Qualcomm’s landmark legal settlement with Apple this week has resolved a serious question hanging over the leading supplier of modem technology for smartphones, prompting a further 10 per cent bounce in its share price on Wednesday morning.News that the iPhone maker had dropped its barrage of legal actions came in the same week that Huawei, the Chinese telecoms company thought to be leading the race to superfast connectivity, revealed it had no commercial contracts for 5G equipment in mainland China.In the space of two days, the tech landscape around 5G appeared to have shifted.Concerns have been increasing in DC that China will seize an insurmountable advantage in both the development and deployment of a communications technology with important national security implications.The news from each side of the Pacific will not resolve all those concerns, but it removes a cloud over a key US tech supplier while also suggesting that China may not be as far ahead in the race to roll out 5G networks as had been feared.Qualcomm had the most to gain and the most to lose. But they both ended up in a better placeAs the supplier of a significant part of the intellectual property in the 5G communications standards, a financially stronger Qualcomm could secure the US a stronger voice in the future of mobile communications. But it will still do little to resolve a nagging concern in the White House: that Huawei, which, unlike Qualcomm, also makes the infrastructure on which mobile networks depend, still poses a serious competitive threat and a national security risk.Tuesday’s settlement between Apple and Qualcomm put an end to one of the most acrimonious and expensive legal fights in US corporate history.The rivals announced they would drop “all litigation” worldwide and begin a new era of co-operation. After years of refusing to pay Qualcomm royalty fees on grounds the prices were too high, Apple agreed to a settlement in which it would once again license Qualcomm’s patents.It will also buy modem chips — the wireless radios inside smartphones — from Qualcomm, dropping supplier Intel. That announcement was quickly followed by the disclosure that Intel is abandoning plans to develop 5G smartphone chips of its own.“Qualcomm, in the matter of a day, has gone from embattled to emboldened in smartphone modems,” said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight.The deal may finally bring an end to a troubled period for the mobile tech company. Early last year, under legal fire from Apple and after years of unhappiness on Wall Street over its underperforming chip business, Qualcomm was on the receiving end of a hostile bid from Broadcom, which was legally based in Singapore.Worried that the US was about to lose its position in 5G altogether, the Trump White House blocked the deal. America’s leading wireless infrastructure maker, Lucent, had already succumbed to a takeover by France’s Alcatel in 2006, and Huawei, with its links to the Chinese government, has since taken the lead in that market.Eighteen months later, Qualcomm appears victorious. Its reconciliation with Apple strengthens the licensing business that supplies the bulk of its profits, and ends a $30bn claim from the phonemaker over its licensing practices.The settlement is also a relief for Apple, which had looked unlikely to release a 5G iPhone alongside competitors in 2020 as rumours had circulated that Intel would not be ready with a modem chip of its own.Though details of the deal with Apple were notably light, Qualcomm estimated the agreement would increase its earnings per share by $2 annually — a total of $2.4bn, and more than half its $3.69 pro forma earnings per share in 2018.It did not say how quickly its earnings would recover, however, leaving a question over whether it will see the full benefit of the extra income from Apple before the 5G mobile business takes off fully — something that could still be years away.But its forecast suggested it expects its relationship with Apple to get back to where it was before the legal war broke out: revenue from Qualcomm’s licensing business — almost all of which falls into profit — plunged by $2.5bn between its 2016 and 2018 fiscal years, the period of the Apple dispute.Apple had complained about Qualcomm’s practice of charging a royalty fee on all mobile handsets, calculated as a percentage of each handset’s total price rather than just the value of the chips it contains. Qualcomm also makes money by selling modem chips.It was unclear from this week’s settlement whether Apple would return to the old arrangement of paying a licence fee tied to iPhone sales prices, and how much of the money it pays to Qualcomm will instead be for buying that company’s chipsets.But Qualcomm’s success in returning its profits broadly to pre-dispute levels represents an accomplishment, since throughout the litigation Apple was bent on cutting its royalty payments for the mobile technology.Who blinked first — Apple or Intel — and prompted the settlement and Qualcomm’s resurgence is not yet clear. If Intel’s decision to withdraw from the 5G smartphone market pushed Apple to seek a deal, Qualcomm has not revealed at what price it acquiesced.Amid already-slowing iPhone sales, Apple was “running out of options” and “feeling the pressure” to keep up with its competitors and release a 5G phone in 2020, said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies.Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights, said the price Apple agreed to “can’t be radically different” from what Qualcomm negotiated with its other 5G customers. If it were, “that would cause a big problem for Qualcomm. The pricing is on Qualcomm’s side.”Meanwhile, Intel’s abrupt retreat from smartphone modems — Apple was its only customer, and Intel had maintained until Tuesday it was on track for the 2020 deadline — appeared to please investors, and its shares closed up 1 per cent following the news.In recent weeks, new chief executive Bob Swan has emphasised that Intel’s 5G future is in its growing networking and data processing business — though it had also placed an expensive bet on its smaller, riskier and unprofitable modem business.“For Intel to be successful in 5G has never been hinged upon being successful in 5G modems,” said Mr Blaber.Mr Moorhead said all three US companies appeared now to be where “they’re going to be most successful”.The settlement — which involves a six-year contract between Qualcomm and Apple, with a potential two-year extension — may not resolve tensions between the companies in the long run. Many tech observers still expect the company to explore developing its own 5G modems — a process that took Samsung and Huawei nearly a decade, and a product on which it would still need to pay Qualcomm royalties for the use of certain chip technology.But at least for now, a serious speed-bump in the run-up to 5G appears to have been removed. “Qualcomm had the most to gain and the most to lose,” said Mr Moorhead. “But they both ended up in a better place.”

So it's easy to see why Apple and Qualcomm settled out of court on Tuesday and a case that was expected to last one-and-a-half months was brought to a close after one-and-a-half days.5G was another, more pressing, reason for Apple to come to a worldwide resolution of its disputes with Qualcomm. Apple's reliance on Intel wireless modem chips for the latest generation of wireless communication was misplaced. IPhone 5G models expected next year risked delays as Intel was going to deliver much later than Qualcomm (and has now got out of the business on the back of yesterday's news).Now, Apple will make an unspecified one-off payment to Qualcomm in settlement, license its tech for at least six years, pay royalties and buy chipsets. Qualcomm shares opened around 15 per cent higher today after a 23 per cent rise on Tuesday on the positive news, which also boosted the US chip sector to a record high:Not only has Qualcomm received a huge revenue and share boost, it has also been relieved of a considerable legal burden. And yet it still faces more such challenges (see this chart on the Foss patents blog) with antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, European Union and Korea, as well as a big class action lawsuit in the US.

That followed a 3.5 per cent rise on Tuesday that was its largest one-day gain in nearly a month.Qualcomm was the biggest gainer in the Sox, followed by Intel with a 4 per cent increase, and Marvell Technology Group, up 3 per cent.Intel, whose modems replaced Qualcomm’s in the most recent generation of Apple iPhones, said after the settlement yesterday it was dropping plans to design chips for next-generation 5G smartphones.The Sox, which tracks 30 companies that design, distribute and manufacture semiconductors, has been trading in record territory since late March as a number of chipmakers gave upbeat outlooks and as the likelihood of the Federal Reserve keeping benchmark borrowing costs steady prompted investors to pile back in to high-growth sectors.

Just as a blockbuster trial was unfolding in a California court, the two tech frenemies settled simmering legal disputes around the world. The iPhone maker will once again source its chips from Qualcomm, whose royalty rates it had angrily disputed in recent years.Qualcomm’s shares jumped almost a quarter, for a market worth of $85bn. Apple shares were unchanged.Apple is trying to reduce its reliance on the saturated smartphone market. But the group still needs Qualcomm’s technology, particularly for of 5G phones. That has allowed Qualcomm to re-establish a vital relationship while easing doubts about its licensing unit. This produces two-thirds of pre-tax earnings. Both juggernauts are now free to deal with their other problems.Qualcomm receives hefty royalties for chips produced by other makers using its designs. Apple boss Tim Cook believed Qualcomm’s payback from iPhone sales exceeded the value of its input. The supplier, in his view, was piggybacking on Apple’s innovation.Apple has developed a relationship with Intel for 5G technology. But the company best known for its PC chips has yet to release its 5G product. Apple is trying to position itself as a services company. But almost two-thirds of its revenue is based on the iPhone. It could not risk bringing its next generation of phones to market late.Qualcomm‘s earnings per share for the year should be $2 higher thanks to the rapprochement. Even after the price surge, Qualcomm shares trade below their level of five years ago. The company fended off a hostile bid from rival Broadcom a few years back, which disappointed many shareholders.The division of spoils between intellectual property holders and customers is always contentious. This agreement looks like a victory for the designers, achieved through intelligent negotiation rather than courtroom fisticuffs. Just as well. Apple and Qualcomm will face the challenges of maturity more confidently as allies than foes.
22;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-04-17T01:31:48Z;Apple and Qualcomm sign peace deal to end litigation;Intel quits race to build 5G chips as rival is welcomed back as supplier to the iPhone;Apple and Qualcomm have agreed to put an end to one of the longest-running and most expensive disputes in the tech industry, settling their numerous multibillion-dollar legal fights and paving the way to bring Qualcomm chips back into the iPhone.The deal was quickly followed by an announcement by Intel, whose modems replaced Qualcomm’s in the most recent generation of iPhones, that it was abandoning its plan to design chips for next-generation 5G smartphones.Rumours had circulated for weeks that Intel had experienced delays and would not meet Apple’s 2020 deadline, although until Tuesday it had said its plans were on track.In a joint statement, Apple and Qualcomm said “all litigation between the two companies worldwide” had been dropped and that they had reached a six-year global patent licence agreement and a multiyear chip set supply agreement. The deal also included a one-time payment from Apple to Qualcomm of an undisclosed amount.Shares in Qualcomm climbed as much as 24 per cent on the news, the biggest single-day gain since December 1999. It said the deal was expected to increase its earnings per share by around $2 per year — a total of $2.4bn.“The multiyear deal is a huge vindication for Qualcomm and likely an acknowledgment by Apple that it had run out of options, particularly when it comes to 5G,” said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight. “There was a growing body of evidence that Intel, its current chip set provider, was struggling to deliver a 5G solution in a timely manner.”Intel chief executive Bob Swan said the company would continue to invest in its 5G network infrastructure business, but review production of 4G and 5G modems in PCs and “internet of things” devices.“We are very excited about the opportunity in 5G and the ‘cloudification’ of the network, but in the smartphone modem business it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns,” Mr Swan said.Apple and Qualcomm had been embroiled in a range of high-profile intellectual property and contract disputes around the world, with potentially severe implications for both companies. While the feud had made Apple reliant on Intel modems, Qualcomm relies on its licensing division for around two-thirds of its annual earnings before tax, and a ruling that the prices it was charging were monopolistic could have had lasting implications for its business model.The legal cases included a $30bn licensing dispute that went to trial on Monday, in which Apple was joined by four of its contract manufacturers in a suit against Qualcomm in San Diego. News of the settlement came while Qualcomm’s attorney, Evan Chesler, was still standing up in court delivering his opening argument.Apple and its suppliers argued Qualcomm had overcharged for royalties since 2013. They ceased paying the royalty fees in 2017, and Qualcomm had sought back payments as well as damages. As part of Tuesday’s peace deal, Apple will once again pay royalties to Qualcomm, they said in their joint statement.The fight between the two companies began when Apple said the prices Qualcomm was charging for the use of its technology were so high as to be anti-competitive, and the chipmaker accused Apple of stealing its intellectual property and giving it to rival chipmaker Intel.Outside the US, Qualcomm has won patent infringement cases against Apple in Germany and China, although import bans have not taken effect.In another case currently awaiting a judge’s ruling, the US Federal Trade Commission has alleged that Qualcomm unfairly forced Apple to buy its wireless chips between 2011 and 2016 in return for charging lower royalty payments.Since that case was an antitrust case brought by the government and is not a direct dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, Tuesday’s settlement does not bind the judge.Additional reporting by Tim BradshawUS Federal Trade Commission sues Qualcomm, alleging monopolistic behaviour and charging of excessive licence fees.

23;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-04-14T10:36:52Z;Apple takes on Qualcomm in $30bn legal battle;US court case between iPhone maker and chip supplier over chip royalties set to begin;About $30bn will be at stake in what could be one of the biggest US corporate lawsuits as Apple and Qualcomm, the chip company, head to court in San Diego on Monday.Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, is expected to give testimony in a four-week trial in a federal court in which the iPhone maker and four companies in its supply chain are suing Qualcomm for up to $27bn in damages for overcharged chip royalties. Qualcomm, which has denied wrongdoing, is seeking at least $7bn in back-payments from Apple and its suppliers in addition to billions in damages. “This is a huge dispute. The amount of money at stake potentially dwarfs any other intellectual property or antitrust case,” said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University. By comparison, Apple won $1bn from Samsung in a patent case in 2012, and Hewlett-Packard won $3bn from Oracle in a contract case in 2016. The San Diego trial is the centrepiece of a lengthy dispute between the two companies that has sprawled across the US, China and Europe and may affect Apple’s ability to launch a mobile phone equipped for 5G, the next generation of mobile internet. “This is by far the most significant [case] we’ve seen so far, for both sides,” said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. For Qualcomm, it “stands to shape the future of their business”, but it could also weaken Apple’s “bargaining power” and cost the iPhone maker billions. The dispute began in 2017 after Apple told its manufacturers — who paid Qualcomm royalties and were reimbursed by Apple — to stop paying the chipmaker, on grounds that prices were too high.Apple and its suppliers argued that Qualcomm overcharged for royalties since 2013 and that the high fees on each phone containing its chips represented anti-competitive gouging. Apple is also seeking $1bn in rebates it says Qualcomm withheld after a series of competition regulators opened investigations into its business model, and about $2bn in restitution for royalties.The outcome of the trial is particularly significant for Qualcomm’s licensing business, which generated 64 per cent of the company’s total earnings before tax in 2018 on less than a quarter of total sales. If the case tips in Apple’s favour, other Qualcomm licensees are likely to question the rates they are paying, and the “future of the business model” could come under pressure, said Mr Blaber.Qualcomm’s share price has been volatile since 2016, as investors have grappled with uncertainty and declining licensing revenues prompted by the dispute. Potential damages alone could be more than four times the $5.7bn Qualcomm generated in net income in 2016.If Apple wins on its licensing claims, that segment of Qualcomm’s business “would remain profitable — just less so”, said Joshua Landau, patent counsel at the Computer and Communications Industry Association. Qualcomm might also face a “short-term hit” from having to repay licence fees.But there are high stakes for Apple: it may be forced to pay hefty back-payments, while the dispute with Qualcomm has left it reliant on Intel, which has yet to release a 5G chip. If Apple’s 5G iPhone is delayed beyond its planned 2020 release, it may fall further behind in China in particular. Depending on which way the case appears to be moving, there may be “increasing pressure on Apple to settle”, said Mr Blaber.Apple declined to comment on the date by which it would need to have changed chip suppliers to include their hardware in phones released in 2020. The industry standard is around 10 to 12 months ahead of commercial launch.As the number one patent licenser by revenue worldwide, some of Qualcomm’s cellular IP is included in chips made by its rivals — which phonemakers must pay for. A win for Apple in San Diego could make it easier and cheaper to license Qualcomm’s technology and have a “pro-competitive impact on the industry as a whole”, said Mr Landau. That would be a boost to Apple if it wanted to design its own chips.In a related case, which is awaiting a judge’s ruling, the US Federal Trade Commission has alleged that Qualcomm unfairly forced Apple to buy its wireless chips between 2011 and 2016 in return for charging lower royalty payments.Judge Lucy Koh’s ruling could influence the judge and jury in San Diego if she reaches a verdict first. There is no guarantee such a ruling will come in time, however. While Judge Koh said she was “generally fairly fast”, a case of “this magnitude obviously is going to take longer than your average law and motion matter”.

It added that Dave Wise, a senior vice president and the company’s treasurer, would take over the CFO role while it searches for a permanent replacement.Intel later confirmed the move, and said Mr Davis would start in his new role as its CFO and executive vice president on Wednesday.The move to Intel will put Mr Davis in the spotlight at a time when Wall Street is hoping for greater financial discipline at the chip giant. After a period of expensive diversification that has taken it into a range of new products and markets, investors have been hoping that Intel will narrow its investment focus and train its capital spending onto fewer bets - an expectation that now falls on Mr Davis.Mr Swan signalled his awareness of those hopes, saying of Mr Davis’ appointment: “Our owners can expect a continued disciplined approach to capital allocation and a relentless focus on creating stockholder value.”The former Qualcomm executive already has close personal experience of working with his new boss. He was previously chief financial officer for Applied Materials, the producer of chip making equipment, at a time when Mr Swan sat on the company’s board and acted as head of its audit committee.
25;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm loses latest round to Apple over bid for iPhone import ban;Court rules one of chipmaker’s key patents as ‘invalid’;A court has ruled against banning the import of several models of the iPhone into the US, dealing a blow to the chipmaker Qualcomm in the latest of a series of high-profile patent cases with Apple.The International Trade Commission sided with the phonemaker in a final ruling on Tuesday, saying Apple had not violated a Qualcomm modem chip patent, which it deemed invalid, and so no ban was necessary.That overturned a preliminary finding by an ITC judge that Apple likely had infringed one of three patents that were being disputed — relating to a power savings feature — but that a ban was not in the public interest.The ruling marks an important victory for Apple, though came just hours after a judge in a second and similar ITC case said in an initial ruling the company was in violation of a different Qualcomm patent and recommended an import ban.“Qualcomm is using these cases to distract from having to answer for the real issues, their monopolistic business practices,” said an Apple spokesperson. Such behaviours were “harming consumers and stifling innovation”, they said.$31mthe amount a San Diego court ruled in March that Apple owed Qualcomm for violating its patentsA ban would have given Qualcomm significant power over Apple, at a time when the tech giant is experience waning iPhone sales and investors fear demand for the smartphone has peaked.While symbolically significant, Tuesday’s rulings relate to just two of the dozens of intellectual property lawsuits the two US companies are fighting around the world.Qualcomm had sought to ban the import to and sale in the US of certain iPhones made with rival chipmaker Intel’s hardware, and would have applied to the iPhone 7, 8 and X models with Intel chips that run on the AT&T and T-Mobile networks.However, the commission said the Qualcomm patent in question was “invalid”, a conclusion the US Patent and Trademark Office also recently drew. In addition, the patents being disputed in the second ITC case have been found preliminarily invalid by the USPTO.The long-running dispute dates back to 2017, when Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing its intellectual property and handing it to Intel, and of seeking to pay less than what was fair for its technology.Apple, meanwhile, accused Qualcomm of abusing its “monopoly power” in wireless modems to demand excessively high royalties. The phonemaker had exclusively used Qualcomm’s modem chips in its handsets between 2011 and 2015, but began using Intel chips in some models of the iPhone 7 in 2016.Outside the US, Qualcomm has won patent infringement cases against Apple in Germany and China, although import bans have not taken effect.Domestically, Qualcomm has looked to a California district court to force Apple to pay the patent royalties it says it is owed — something the ITC does not have the power to enforce.In March a San Diego court ruled Apple owed Qualcomm $31m, or $1.41 per relevant phone, for violating its patents. Another hotly anticipated California jury trial over licensing fees Qualcomm says Apple owes is set to begin in April.Key arguments during the ITC case centred on the future of 5G technology, with both companies seeking to persuade the commission that a win for the other would hurt innovation.Apple argued a ban would hamper the competition needed between the two major chipmakers to develop the next-generation mobile technology in the US. Intel also said that Qualcomm was seeking to “drive competition out of the market”.Qualcomm, however, argued there was sufficient international competition but that Apple’s refusal to pay for the use of new technology would hurt development in the US. The opposing perspectives come amid growing concerns from US lawmakers that the use of 5G developed by Chinese company Huawei could imperil national security.Qualcomm’s argument “sounded a lot better before it turned out their patent was not valid”, said Josh Landau, patent counsel at The Computer and Communications Industry Association. The company “is continuing to use tactics designed to obtain a ban over relatively minor features, to harm a competitor”.Last week the ITC agreed to hear a patent infringement case brought by US licensing company Innovative Foundry Technologies against companies including Qualcomm.
26;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-02-14T14:42:26Z;Apple to sell iPhones powered by Qualcomm chips in Germany;Phonemaker buckles to legal pressure after court banned sales;Apple has bowed to recent legal pressure from Qualcomm and decided to equip older iPhone models for sale in the German market with technology from the US chipmaker.The move followed a ruling by a court in Munich in December that banned the sale of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X, after finding that Apple had infringed on Qualcomm’s patents. Qualcomm — which is locked in a legal battle with Apple in multiple jurisdictions — subsequently posted security bonds worth €1.34bn to make the sales ban effective. The sum is supposed to cover Apple’s likely financial losses should the verdict be overturned on appeal. In a statement released on Thursday, Apple voiced harsh criticism of Qualcomm’s approach — but said it would use Qualcomm’s chips to comply with the court ruling: “To ensure all iPhone models can again be available to customers in Germany, we have no choice but to stop using Intel chips and ship our phones with Qualcomm chips in Germany.”It added: “Qualcomm is working to eliminate competition by any means they can, harming consumers and stifling industry innovation along the way.” There was no immediate response from Qualcomm. Apple said it would start producing specific phones for Germany, though it did not specify which models these would be. “These devices are for the German market. In the production process a switch has been made to using Qualcomm chips instead of the previously used Intel chips,” it said.Apple said: “Qualcomm is attempting to use injunctions against our products to try to get Apple to succumb to their extortionist demands. In many cases they are using patents they purchased or that have nothing to do with their cellular technology to harass Apple and other industry players.” It added: “We are as committed as ever to standing up for innovation and we will continue to fight for what’s right.” The Munich court found in favour of Qualcomm after Apple declined to explain the precise functioning of the chip used in the iPhone models, citing a need for business secrecy. “For procedural reasons the court had to base its decision on the assumption that the chip works in the way that the plaintiff [Qualcomm] had claimed,” the court said on December 20. 
27;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-01-30T22:49:45Z;Qualcomm sales hurt by loss of Apple, but earnings beat;;Qualcomm on Wednesday topped forecasts for quarterly earnings despite the impact of losing Apple as a chip customer.The San Diego-based chipmaker’s sales have come under pressure amid an ongoing feud with Apple, which filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm accusing it of breaking antitrust laws. The US government has also sued Qualcomm over its patent licensing practices in a trial that reached closing arguments this week. In September, Qualcomm accused the iPhone maker of stealing trade secrets.For its newest line of iPhone devices, Apple chose to use chips made by Qualcomm’s rival, Intel, dealing a blow to Qualcomm’s business.But Qualcomm said it expects to book revenue of $4.4bn to $5.2bn in its fiscal second quarter. The midpoint of that range matches Wall Street’s forecast of $4.8bn. The company estimated current-quarter earnings of 65 cents to 75 cents a share on an adjusted basis, compared with analysts’ forecast of 68 cents.Qualcomm also announced on Wednesday it struck a new interim agreement with Huawei Technologies, a deal that is seen boosting sales by $150m in the second quarter.Shares in Qualcomm gained 2.6 per cent to $51.49 in after-hours trading.The strong forecast comes after Nvidia, Intel and other chipmakers sparked fears a slowdown in China has dragged on sales across the industry. Earlier this week, Advanced Micro Devices helped ease those concerns with its own upbeat outlook.In its first quarter ending on December 30, Qualcomm earned net income of $1.07bn, or 87 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $5.98bn, or $4.05 a share, that included a $6bn tax charge. Earnings hit $1.20 a share on an adjusted basis, surpassing a consensus estimate of $1.09.Revenue dropped 20 per cent to $4.84bn. Analysts were looking for stronger sales of $4.9bn. Qualcomm shipped 186m modem chips during the quarter, a 22 per cent decline.
28;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2019-01-03T20:24:52Z;Qualcomm lays out cash to enforce Apple patent battle;Component maker posts €1.34bn with German court to trigger sales ban;Qualcomm said on Thursday that it had taken measures to enforce a sales ban of some Apple iPhone models in Germany, in the latest blow in a long-running patent battle between the two technology groups. Qualcomm said in a statement that it had posted security bonds worth €1.34bn with a court in Munich with the aim of triggering the sales ban. In a ruling issued on December 20, the court ruled in favour of Qualcomm’s claim that Apple had infringed one of Qualcomm’s patents, which helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals. But the court also said that Qualcomm could only enforce a sales ban of the relevant iPhone models if it agreed to post a security to cover potential losses suffered by Apple should the ruling be overturned on appeal. The ban covers the iPhones 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X. Apple has said that it plans to appeal against the Munich ruling. Qualcomm said in its statement: “The bonds are required for Qualcomm to be able to enforce the remedies ordered by the court on December 20 2018 after the court found that Apple is infringing Qualcomm’s patented power savings technology used in smartphones. Apple was ordered to cease the sale, offer for sale and importation for sale of all infringing iPhones in Germany.” Apple on Thursday referred any questions to a statement it made after the initial ruling.The US technology group said then that it would stop selling the iPhones 7 and 8 in its 15 Apple stores in Germany. All iPhone models would remain available through mobile carriers and resellers, however. The iPhone X was discontinued last year. The main reason why the Munich court found in favour of Qualcomm was Apple’s unwillingness to explain the precise functioning of the chip used in the iPhone models, citing a need for business secrecy. “For procedural reasons the court had to base its decision on the assumption that the chip works in the way that the plaintiff [Qualcomm] had claimed,” the court said on December 20. If Apple follows through with an appeal, it will have the chance to provide a fuller explanation of the workings of the chip, and demonstrate why it believes there is no patent infringement.
29;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-12-20T15:55:33Z;Apple faces iPhone ban in Germany over patent case;Second win for Qualcomm over California tech giant;Apple could be forced to stop selling some iPhone models in Germany after the tech giant lost a second court battle against Qualcomm. The ruling marks the second major win for Qualcomm against the tech giant. A Chinese court granted an injunction against Apple for an alleged patent violation earlier this month. The chipmaker wants to ban some iPhones using chips from Intel. Judge Matthias Zigann ruled that the combination of chips from Intel and Apple supplier Qorvo infringed on one of Qualcomm’s patents, which helps phones save battery while sending and receiving wireless signals. Models at risk of being banned include the iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X. “We are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal,” Apple said in a statement.Apple has the right to appeal the ruling to a higher court, and the ban will not be legally enforceable until that court reaches a final verdict. However, the district court in Munich said on Thursday that Qualcomm had the right to enforce the ban on a provisional basis now, provided that the company posted a security of €668.4m with the court to cover for Apple’s losses should the ruling be overturned on appeal. In a statement released on Thursday, the court said that it had been unable to establish the precise functioning of the chip because Apple had refused to provide a detailed explanation, citing secrecy needs. “For procedural reasons the court had to base its decision on the assumption that the chip works in the way that the plaintiff [Qualcomm] had claimed,” it said.If Apple appeals the case, it will have the chance to provide a fuller explanation of the workings of the chip, and show why it believes there is no patent infringement.“Qualcomm’s campaign is a desperate attempt to distract from the real issues between our companies,” Apple said. “Their tactics, in the courts and in their everyday business, are harming innovation and harming consumers. Qualcomm insists on charging exorbitant fees based on work they didn’t do and they are being investigated by governments all around the world for their behaviour.”Apple’s 15 retail stores in Germany will not sell iPhone 7 and 8 models during the appeal process, according to the company. All iPhone models will remain available through mobile carriers and resellers.In a statement, Qorvo’s chief intellectual property officer Mike Baker told CNBC the court would have come to a different conclusion “if it had considered all the evidence”. “We’re disappointed that the inventor and designer of our chip, who attended the hearing, wasn’t given the opportunity to testify or present other evidence that disproves Qualcomm’s claim of infringement. We currently do not expect that this decision will have any impact on our business with Apple.”Qualcomm continues to wage a multibillion-dollar legal battle around the world, with a similar case ongoing in the US.Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said: “Two respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of Qualcomm’s patents and declared Apple an infringer, ordering a ban on iPhones in the important markets of Germany and China.”
30;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-12-20T04:00:35Z;Apple tweaks iPhone software for users in Germany;Move aimed at heading off another legal challenge in continuing feud with Qualcomm;Apple has taken the unusual step of making changes to its iPhone software only for its users in Germany, in the hope of heading off a legal challenge from the chipmaker Qualcomm.The tweak to an iOS search feature could neuter the effect of a legal ruling in Munich expected on Thursday, even if the German regional court agrees with Qualcomm that Apple infringed one of its patents. Apple has introduced plenty of iPhone features that are designed to appeal to users in a particular country, such as blocking spam calls in China. However, changes made in response to legal threats are rare. It has issued only a handful of such software updates in the past several years. Such country-by-country fragmentation of iOS might become less unusual as its increasingly bitter litigation with Qualcomm progresses, following another patent case that went against Apple last week in China. Apple has claimed that Qualcomm overcharged for its intellectual property, while the US Federal Trade Commission has also accused the San Diego-based chipmaker of anti-competitive behaviour. The two cases threaten to reset the value of Qualcomm’s highly profitable patent portfolio, a factor that has weighed heavily on its share price for almost two years. In response, Qualcomm has sought leverage for a potential legal settlement by accusing Apple of patent infringement in dozens of cases around the world, in addition to allegations of breach of contract and stealing trade secrets. Last week Qualcomm claimed its first significant win in that campaign when a court in Fuzhou, China, issued a preliminary injunction against Apple for violating two of the chipmaker’s patents with several older iPhone models. Apple has insisted that it can keep selling those iPhones in China without breaking the terms of the injunction, but it nonetheless moved to design around the offending features, which relate to photo manipulation and using apps on a touchscreen. Apple said last week that it would issue a software update “for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case”. The situation could play out differently in Munich because Apple has already pre-empted any similar injunction that the regional court could issue. Apple issued its software update to German iPhone models earlier this year. The change affects how users search their contacts book from the iPhone’s home screen, using a feature called Spotlight. The modification was so subtle that it passed largely unnoticed by users. The Munich court is favoured by patent litigants because it has the power to issue an injunction more quickly than in other venues. Qualcomm is asserting several patents in Germany, including four related to iOS search, contacts and shortcuts in Spotlight. Other Qualcomm patents at issue in the case relate to power management, which will be more difficult for Apple to design around if it is found to infringe because they relate to iPhone hardware.
31;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-12-14T07:18:44Z;Apple seeks to resolve China iPhone ban with software update;Qualcomm accuses US tech group of disregarding Chinese court’s infringement ruling;Apple is attempting to resolve China’s ban on sales of certain iPhones with a software update for users in the region, in its latest move in a legal battle with Qualcomm over patent infringement.The Intermediate People’s Court in Fuzhou issued in November a preliminary injunction banning Chinese imports and sales of seven Apple smartphone models, from 2015’s iPhone 6s through to last year’s iPhone X. The order said the phones had violated two Qualcomm patents related to photo manipulation and using apps on a touchscreen.The court’s decision was a breakthrough for Qualcomm, which has been waging a multibillion-dollar legal battle against Apple in multiple countries over smartphone patents and royalties. Qualcomm has insisted that the court order covers the iPhone models regardless of the software used in them, meaning that Apple is violating the order by continuing to sell those iPhones in China. It is now seeking to extend the injunction to this year’s iPhones. Apple on Friday conceded that it needed to issue a software update to resolve the court’s concerns.“Based on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,” it said.“Early next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case,” it added.In response, Qualcomm said Apple “continues to disregard and violate the Fuzhou court’s orders. They are legally obliged to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court.”Yuan Yang, a lawyer at DeBund Law Offices, noted that the court order was vague and thus left open options for Apple. “It’s not specific enough in the ruling about what is actually infringing the patents — the software or the iPhones themselves.”“Apple can make use of this vagueness to present an argument,” added Mr Yuan.Qualcomm, through its Chinese lawyers, has also alleged that the patents in question are still infringed by new versions of iOS software. It said the only reason it did not include this year’s iPhone models, which are sold running iOS 12, in its legal complaint was because this would have delayed the court process.Lawyers have said that the courts may be influenced by the significance of the two tech giants for the US as well as for their Chinese partners. Qualcomm has in the past boasted of its strong relationships with businesses in China, and has leaned on them to influence regulators.“This is politicised, and it is part of a trade war. Apple is only going to get past this through dispute resolution [with Qualcomm], not just through the courts,” said Gregory Wendell Dennis, an intellectual property lawyer based in Kunming.Qualcomm has asked the Fuzhou court to enforce its injunction and halt sales across China. If it did so, Apple would suffer hugely in the world’s biggest smartphone market. Sales of the iPhone models in question accounted for 61 per cent of Apple’s phone sales in China in the third quarter of this year, according to research firm Canalys.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
33;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-12-13T11:41:52Z;Qualcomm seeks China sales ban on iPhone XS and XR;Chipmaker to file suits in Chinese courts after already winning injunction on older models;Qualcomm is asking courts in China to ban sales of the latest iPhone XS and XR, after winning a preliminary injunction there against Apple’s older models.The chipmaker is trying to put extra pressure on Apple in the hopes of forcing the iPhone maker into settlement talks, after claiming a key breakthrough in the two companies’ multibillion-dollar legal battle over smartphone patents and royalties.On November 30, the Intermediate People’s Court in Fuzhou granted a preliminary injunction banning Chinese imports and sales of seven Apple smartphone models, from 2015’s iPhone 6s through to last year’s iPhone X.The order, which was made public on Tuesday, said the phones infringed Qualcomm’s patents relating to photo manipulation and touchscreen apps. “We plan to use the same patents to file suit against the three new iPhone models,” Jiang Hongyi, a lawyer at Lexfield Law Offices who is representing Qualcomm in its patent suits, told the Financial Times.Mr Jiang said additional suits covering Apple’s new iPhone XS, XS Max and XR models were pending in courts in Beijing, Qingdao and Guangzhou. The lawsuits threaten to endanger Apple’s reputation and sales in the world’s biggest smartphone market. It will also test whether Chinese courts can be an ally to Qualcomm in its global dispute with Apple over licence fees.Qualcomm has in the past boasted of its strong relationships with businesses in China, and has leaned on them to influence regulators.Apple said on Tuesday that the injunction would not have an effect on its sales in China, and that “all iPhone models remain available for our customers in China”.“We will pursue all our legal options through the courts,” Apple said. It has already begun an appeal process, asking the court to reconsider its decision.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Qualcomm’s latest legal manoeuvre.Apple has tried to argue that the injunction only applies to models running iOS 11, which was updated in September. However, Qualcomm says the infringing software features are still present in iPhones running the latest version of iOS 12. It submitted video evidence of an iPhone 8 that it purchased from an Apple Store in Beijing to a court in Fuzhou earlier this week, in an attempt to enforce the ban. A copy of the court’s ruling, obtained by the FT from a legal source, does not mention any specific version of iOS. Qualcomm is trying to assert more than 20 patents against Apple in China, as part of its legal fightback against the iPhone maker’s allegations that it has overcharged for its royalties and abused its dominant position in mobile intellectual property.Another court in Germany is expected to rule next week on five further patents asserted by Qualcomm against Apple, relating to iOS’s Spotlight search and power management features. The court in the southern Chinese city of Fuzhou is the first in the two companies’ global campaign to hand Qualcomm a meaningful advantage against Apple. He Wengang, a lawyer at Haiwen & Partners, said: “Normally if the court issues a ban, they’d be quite confident that Apple has violated the IP rights. So I think Apple has a slim chance of winning in the end.”The Fuzhou court could, in theory, enforce the decision across China by asking Apple stores to halt sales of the offending phones. The maximum penalty would be criminal charges and jail time, but “enforcement is not very strict”, said Yuan Yang, a lawyer at DeBund Law Offices.Instead, others have said Apple’s bigger concern could be the damage to government relations if it continues to openly violate a court injunction.“I understand Apple are worried about the stock price and investors. But they should worry about what China thinks and what the court, the government thinks,” said Erick Robinson, partner at Dunlap, Bennett & Ludwig, who represented Qualcomm in China before 2014.Mr Robinson compared Apple’s current non-compliance to the way Qualcomm handled its anti-monopoly investigation back in 2013. “The problem back then was that Qualcomm thought it was bulletproof, and that created more problems. Apple now looks to be doing the same thing: being a big arrogant American company,” he said.The political concerns for Apple stem partly from the warmer reception Qualcomm has in China. Steven Mollenkopf, the chipmaker’s chief executive, was the only foreign executive to speak at last month’s annual government tech showcase in Wuzhen. The company has in the past boasted of its tight relationship with its many Chinese partners such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, who rely on its Snapdragon processors to power their smartphones.Mr Yuan said Apple could appeal against a final ruling by offering Qualcomm compensation, and by arguing that the banning of phone sales was not in the public interest.
34;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-12-10T17:57:10Z;China bans some iPhones in court victory for Qualcomm;Preliminary injunction issued after finding that Apple violated two patents;Qualcomm is claiming an important victory in its sprawling legal battle with Apple after a Chinese court slapped a ban on sales of certain iPhone models in the world’s largest mobile market. The Intermediate People’s Court in Fuzhou, China, has granted a preliminary injunction against Apple after finding it in violation of two Qualcomm patents related to photo manipulation and using apps on a touchscreen. Qualcomm said the ruling, which was made on November 30, means that Apple’s four Chinese subsidiaries are barred from importing and selling seven iPhone models, ranging from 2015’s iPhone 6s to last year’s iPhone X. However, Apple may design around the infringing patents through software updates, and its latest models, including the iPhone XS and XR, are not caught by the ruling. “We deeply value our relationships with customers, rarely resorting to the courts for assistance, but we also have an abiding belief in the need to protect intellectual property rights,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s executive vice-president and general counsel. “Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us. These court orders are further confirmation of the strength of Qualcomm’s vast patent portfolio.”Despite Mr Rosenberg’s insistence that the injunction was “effective now” and not confined to iPhones running older versions of the iOS operating system, Apple said the ruling would not affect the availability of its devices in China. “Qualcomm’s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,” Apple said. “All iPhone models remain available for our customers in China . . . We will pursue all our legal options through the courts.”Apple said later on Monday that it had taken the first step to launching an appeal of the injunction by filing a “request for reconsideration” with the court.China is a vital market for Apple, accounting for more than $50bn in annual revenues and a fifth of its total sales. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets estimate that as much as 40 per cent of iPhones sold there are older models, suggesting Apple could stand to lose $12bn in annual revenues if the ban were upheld. Apple and Qualcomm have become embroiled in a series of lawsuits during the past two years, spanning the US, China and Europe. Apple has accused Qualcomm of abusing its position in mobile chips, prompting the San Diego-based supplier to retaliate with a series of allegations, including breach of contract and patent infringement. The case in Fuzhou was first filed in November 2017. Another key decision will come later this month in Germany. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, has pointed to a series of legal milestones that he hopes will encourage Apple to seek a settlement but lawyers for the iPhone maker told a judge in San Diego last month that there have not been any such talks “in months”. Apple has been one of Qualcomm’s most valuable customers for several years, and the legal cases have deprived the chipmaker of billions of dollars in revenues. Qualcomm’s shares were up by about 3 per cent in early trading on Monday after the decision in China was announced, while Apple shares fell 2 per cent. The legal blow from China is just the latest bad news to hit Apple’s share price in recent weeks. After reigning as the world’s most valuable company for more than six years and becoming the first to reach a trillion-dollar valuation in August, Apple has lost almost $250bn in market capitalisation in less than two months. Gloomy trading statements from a series of Apple suppliers have exacerbated fears of a sharp slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple’s dependence on Chinese manufacturing has also placed it at risk in the escalating trade war between the US and China. Together, these concerns have allowed Apple’s rivals Microsoft and Amazon to bump it down into third place in the rankings of the most valuable stocks. 
35;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Slower Chinese demand, Apple feud weigh on Qualcomm outlook;;Qualcomm warned that revenues in the December quarter could fall by as much as a quarter, as it faces slower demand from China and the impact of its modems being left out of the latest iPhones.The mobile chipmaker also pointed to increased litigation expenses as it faces off with Apple and regulators in a variety of legal disputes around the world.Revenues fell 2 per cent in the three months to September, to $5.8bn, Qualcomm reported on Wednesday, just ahead of analysts’ expectations, thanks to a boost from Chinese mobile customers, but it swung to a net loss of $0.5bn, from net income of $0.2bn in the same period last year. While sales in Qualcomm’s chip business were flat on last year, its licensing revenues fell by 6 per cent in the most recent quarter.Its shares fell by around 3.5 per cent after-hours as it warned that revenues for its fiscal first quarter, which normally marks a high point for smartphone sales in the run-up to Christmas, could be down by 13 to 26 per cent, between $4.5bn and $5.3bn. It blamed “weaker sell through in China” for some of the drop, after strong mobile sales there in the previous quarter.Much of the rest of the decline stems from Qualcomm’s ongoing legal fight with Apple over patent royalties, which has taken a multibillion-dollar bite out of its profits in recent quarters. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, said that more than 50 per cent of its “headwind” in the current quarter’s guidance is related to Apple replacing its modems with rival Intel’s in its latest iPhones, but the loss would become “less impactful” to its quarterly results in the second half of the year.In addition, the iPhone maker has not paid Qualcomm’s licensing business anything since early 2017 when it accused the chipmaker of overcharging for its intellectual property. Qualcomm has hit back, accusing Apple of patent infringement in courts including California, Germany and China.“Our view on the timeline to resolve the licensing dispute has not changed,” Mr Mollenkopf said, with “billions of dollars” in damages owed by Apple and its manufacturers over contract disputes, as well as upcoming legal judgments from its patent court cases in the coming months.However, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that Apple was not in settlement talks “at any level” with Qualcomm, citing a person familiar with the matter.Qualcomm also had to pay NXP $2bn in the fourth quarter after failing to complete its planned takeover of the Dutch chipmaker, which failed to receive regulatory clearance in China. Following the termination of that deal, Qualcomm has pledged to buy back $30bn of its shares. It returned $26bn to shareholders last year through buybacks and dividends, leaving it with cash of $12.1bn at the end of September.Mr Mollenkopf pointed to Qualcomm’s progress in winning more than 20 contracts for 5G as a source of optimism for 2019.“Fiscal 2018 was an extraordinary year for Qualcomm,” he said. “We successfully navigated through many challenges. We enter fiscal 2019 a stronger company and extremely well positioned for the future.”

In previous years, China has made much of the attendance of Silicon Valley leaders such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Google boss Sundar Pichai.But this year’s event is being held against the backdrop of a fierce trade war between Washington and Beijing, that is largely being fought over American allegations of technology and intellectual property theft by Chinese companies. US officials are also concerned by the prospect of China establishing its dominance in key sectors such as 5G, the next generation of wireless technology, and artificial intelligence.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, the US chipmaker that relies heavily on the Chinese market, was the only foreign executive to speak at the opening ceremony, where he praised his hosts for carrying “an important message” and echoed President Xi Jinping’s idea of a “shared future in cyber space”.Foreign tech firms might feel that under the current political environment, it’s not ideal to be seen as overly cosy with ChinaIn a change from previous years, the attendee list for the two-day event was only published at the start of the conference, with civil servants suggesting that some high-profile attendees had not confirmed their attendance.“Foreign tech firms might feel that under the current political environment, it’s not ideal to be seen as overly cosy with China,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based tech market research firm.Silicon Valley companies have often struggled to balance their desire to have a presence in the Chinese market with concerns over governance of the internet and data in the country. Google pulled out of the country in 2010 but more recently faced a backlash among staff over leaked plans to build a censored Chinese version of its search engine. Apple, has also been criticised over its decision to place a data centre on the mainland and remove anti-surveillance VPN apps from its China app store.The US-China trade frictions have forced the organisers of the Wuzhen conference to try to present a more nuanced picture of their national ambitions, highlighting their long-term goals but without raising the hackles of critics who are anxious about Beijing’s growing clout.State media have been told to downplay the Made in China 2025 industrial policy, which sets out sectors in which Beijing wants Chinese companies to dominate in the domestic market, and civil servants have stopped highlighting foreign talent recruitment drives such as the Thousand Talents Plan, a programme to recruit the world’s leading engineering and science experts.
37;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-09-28T21:22:31Z;Apple scores victory in case that threatened iPhone imports;Legal fight against Qualcomm now goes to full US International Trade Commission;A US judge has ruled against banning imports of some iPhones into the US, despite backing a claim from Qualcomm that Apple had infringed on one of its patents.The preliminary result, which still needs to be confirmed by the full US International Trade Commission, represents an important victory for Apple in the first part of a sprawling intellectual property battle with Qualcomm. The US companies are fighting dozens of cases over claims of intellectual property infringement, with potential import bans in the US, China and Germany on the line.On Friday afternoon administrative law judge Thomas Pender backed an earlier recommendation from the ITC’s staff, who had concluded that Apple infringed on one of three Qualcomm patents involved in the case. The finding could have opened the door to a ban on US imports of iPhones that run on the AT&T and T-Mobile networks. These devices include chips made by Intel, while other iPhones sold in the US use Qualcomm chips.However, the judge recommended against a ban on public interest grounds. He also said he had recommended an alternative remedy, but did not disclose details. The full commission, which normally backs preliminary findings, is expected to rule early next year.Apple welcomed the decision in what it called an attempt by Qualcomm to “damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and US consumers”. It also reiterated claims that the chip company had “continued to unfairly demand royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with to protect their monopoly”.“We are pleased the [judge] found infringement of our patented technology, but it makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban,” said Don Rosenberg, general counsel of Qualcomm. “That goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products.”The worldwide dispute was triggered early last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of using its market power to charge excessive royalties on its wireless communications technology. It also instructed manufacturers who assemble its devices to stop handing over royalties to Qualcomm.The chip company retaliated by filing more than 40 patent infringement claims against Apple around the world, including two before the ITC, one of which is at an earlier stage of deliberation.Apple faced a potential import ban in an earlier patent battle, when the ITC backed a Samsung claim of patent infringement. Then-president Barack Obama used his veto power to overturn the ban on public interest grounds.
38;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm accuses Apple of stealing trade secrets;Chipmaker alleges that Intel is chief beneficiary of Apple’s alleged infringement;Qualcomm took its legal dispute with Apple another step higher on Tuesday, after it accused the iPhone maker of stealing its trade secrets and sharing them with rival chipmaker Intel.The two tech companies are already embroiled in a wide-ranging battle over patents and royalties, after Apple first accused the mobile chipmaker of overcharging for its intellectual property and of anticompetitive behaviour in January 2017. Qualcomm’s lawsuit on Tuesday seeks to build on an earlier case filed in San Diego last November that accused Apple of breach of contract. The suit centred on the “master software agreement” that governs how chip customers handle its tools and intellectual property when developing new products. Qualcomm said the process of legal discovery in its original case had produced new evidence that Apple’s conduct went “far beyond” contract breach. Its latest filing alleges that “Apple engaged in a years-long campaign of false promises, stealth and subterfuge designed to steal Qualcomm’s confidential information and trade secrets for the purpose of improving the performance of lower-quality modem chipsets, with the ultimate goal of eliminating Qualcomm’s Apple-based business”. The San Diego-based chipmaker points to Intel, whose Infineon subsidiary it displaced as the iPhone’s modem supplier in 2011, as the chief beneficiary of Apple’s alleged infringement. However, it is Apple, not Intel, that is the target of Qualcomm’s lawsuit for now. Apple added Intel’s networking and communications chips alongside Qualcomm’s in different models of the iPhone 7 in 2016. Qualcomm warned investors earlier this year that it had been designed out of the latest iPhones altogether and analysts’ examinations of the new XS model suggest that it relies entirely on Intel. Initial reviews pointed to significant enhancements in wireless networking speeds in the latest iPhones. Qualcomm alleges that Intel’s recent performance improvements were the result of its innovations, claiming that Apple breached its confidentiality agreement. “Apple repeatedly ignored those restrictions, using and sharing Qualcomm’s trade secrets in ways that Apple knew very well were improper,” Qualcomm said in its filings. “Indeed the scale and brazenness of Apple’s misappropriation demonstrates that it never intended to keep the promises it made in its agreements with Qualcomm, but rather planned all along to misuse and transfer Qualcomm’s technology in ways Apple thought would not be detected.” Apple did not comment directly on Qualcomm’s latest action but referred to its earlier statement on the two companies’ broader legal battle. “Qualcomm’s illegal business practices are harming Apple and the entire industry,” Apple said last year. “We believe deeply in the value of intellectual property but we shouldn’t have to pay them for technology breakthroughs they have nothing to do with.” Qualcomm’s latest legal salvo comes ahead of an initial decision from the US International Trade Commission, expected on Friday. Qualcomm is seeking a ban at the ITC on imports to the US of iPhones that use Intel’s chips, claiming Apple infringed its patents.
39;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;US trade hawks seize their chance to reset China relations;Latest tariffs look more like the start of a cold war than a trade war;It would be easy to see the latest $200bn round of US tariffs against China, set to go into effect on Monday, as just another provocative shot fired off by an American president in need of overseas distractions at a time when the legal noose seems to be tightening around his own neck.But that would be wrong. In fact, far from being an ill-advised and hasty policy decision emanating solely from Donald Trump’s White House, this latest tariff round represents something much more dangerous and lasting: a true reset of economic and political relations between the US and China, and the beginning of something that looks more like a cold war than a trade war.This reset is supported by factions stretching well beyond Mr Trump, on both the left and the right. That is what makes it so serious. The president is indeed single-mindedly obsessed with the US-China trade deficit, but he’s also the sort of person who will cut a deal for personal gain, and it is hard to imagine that the Chinese could not come up with something that would make him flip to a more moderate position.Not so the economic hawks within the administration, like Mr Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, and Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, who are playing an entirely different game. They believe it is in the long-term national interest for the US to decouple economically from China.There are plenty of people in the Pentagon, as well as some in the labour faction of the progressive left, who agree. Many of these people will be in positions of power long after this president is gone. They have different agendas, but coalesce around the idea that the US and China are in a long-term strategic rivalry, and that, as a result, US trade policy and national security policy should no longer be separated.That marks a fundamental shift for global business. The economic hawks have little sympathy for multinational chief executives who complain that the latest round of tariffs is broad and deep enough to create real inflationary pressure or force them to raise prices. Indeed, they see these companies as traitors who have naively sold out for short-term gain in a country that does not share fundamental western values, and will ultimately not allow them equal market access.And in the current economic and political environment, they have taken control of the narrative. Hawks can cite Chinese intellectual property theft, human rights violations, and aggression in the South China Seas as proof of their position.“You hear a lot of them talk about China as a ‘revisionist’ power, like the Soviet Union — a purveyor of a completely different system,” says Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused consultancy. That vision may be overblown, but it is an easier sell than defending status quo economic globalisation to an American public who are increasingly anxious about China or robots (or Chinese-made robots) taking their jobs.The hawks have also been quite clever so far about crafting tariffs that will minimise the impact on consumer prices while also penalising companies that have shifted the most sensitive supply chains to China. Think of chipmaker Qualcomm (which has found itself on the wrong side of nationalism in both countries) or tech group Cisco, which lobbied unsuccessfully to have its routers and switches, which power smart cities in China as well as the US and Europe, left off the latest tariffs list.A white paper recommending some US supply chain insourcing, prepared by the Department of Defense and likely to be released next month by the White House, may provide guidance on where the Trump administration will take its nascent attempt at industry policy. But it is clear that not all companies will suffer equally in a US-China cold war.Traditional consumer businesses — Starbucks, say, or Walmart — will be able to maintain a Chinese market presence more easily than high-tech companies trafficking in sensitive data, or any business working in strategic areas such as mapping or autonomous vehicles. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and any number of other US multinationals doing business in China may have tough choices to make in the future if the trade war escalates into a cold war in which they can no longer turn a blind eye to the national concerns of the states where they operate.The pain may be felt in China first, since the country is still much more export dependent than the US. But over the mid- to longer-term, US companies have more work to do in terms of insourcing supply chains.It is both politically and logistically unfeasible to become Fortress America, insourcing everything, which means that the Trump administration must build alliances with trade partners in places including Europe if it wants to be able to execute an American industrial policy — not a strength of this president.Business faces more existential challenges. What does it mean for a company like, for example, Google to launch a censored search engine in China, while its parent company, Alphabet, refuses to send its chief executive, Larry Page, to testify in the Senate on Russian meddling in US tech platforms? Can corporate leaders be above politics? They used to like to think so. Today, that seems like wishful thinking.rana.foroohar@ft.com

Yet two key new features of the Series 4 edition of Apple’s smartwatch seem squarely aimed at a somewhat older demographic. The new Watch has received approval from the US health regulator for its electrocardiogram sensors and software that can alert the wearer to irregular heart rhythms known as atrial fibrillation — a first for a smartwatch. “AFib” is most common in the over-65s.It also employs upgraded motion sensors to offer “fall detection”. The Watch automatically places an emergency call to friends, family members or carers if the wearer does not respond after a hard fall. The features are part of efforts by Silicon Valley to court the spending power of older customers, using a combination of “smart home” monitoring technology and wearable devices to promote healthier living and improve elder care. “While much of the technology sector obsesses over engagement among teens, Apple knows that its most important market is the over-50s,” said Mark Tluszcz, chief executive at Mangrove Capital Partners, a European tech investor. The new features . . . will make the Watch Series 4 a good gift for kids to give to their aged parentsHowever, Ramon Llamas, research director at analyst group IDC, cautioned that the over-65s are the “least likely [demographic] to purchase wearable devices”. “Recent surveys point to less than 5 per cent of that age bracket purchasing the device,” he said. Instead it is younger consumers who are driving smartwatch shipments to increase by a projected 39 per cent to 46.2m units this year, according to IDC. “It is important to appeal to that segment first instead of going right to the 65+ crowd,” Mr Llamas said. “I think the new features, especially the fall detection, the AFib and the [electrocardiogram] data gathering, will make the Watch Series 4 a good gift for kids to give to their aged parents.”Apple’s renewed focus on wearable devices comes as Qualcomm and Google are trying to reinvigorate the Android-based WearOS smartwatch platform, which is used by fashion brands including Fossil Group, Louis Vuitton and Montblanc. Earlier this week Qualcomm unveiled the new Snapdragon Wear 3100 platform, which promises to improve power management on the tiny devices and allow designers to make thinner smartwatches.As Apple has put a greater emphasis on the health and fitness features of its Watch, its attempt to appeal to fashionistas and buyers of luxury timepieces has been dialled back. While it still sells an Apple Watch in partnership with Hermès, which provides special watch faces and deluxe leather wristbands, the iPhone maker has now discontinued its higher-priced Apple Watch Edition. The solid-gold Apple Watch Edition first released in 2014 and costing upwards of $10,000 will not be supported by the latest version of its WatchOS software, while the white ceramic model released last year for $1,299 has not been updated with the Series 4 hardware.Sales figures for the Edition have never been released.

The solar-powered craft was designed to bring ultra high-speed internet connectivity to what has been termed The Great Unwired — the roughly 4bn people globally still unable to participate in the connected world.In June, not long after the show began, Facebook pulled the plug on its atmospheric satellite, or “high altitude platform station”, and decided that the aerospace industry with which it had collaborated on the build would be best placed to take the technology forward.The museum explains that this “represents the rate at which new ideas and technologies change and adapt within such a fast-paced landscape”. It may read like an agile get-out, but the V&A could not have better expressed the uncertain but also exciting nature of new connectivity.What is likely is that a dizzying increase in the speed and pervasiveness of connectivity is just a few years away — much under the banner of 5G, a faster, higher-frequency version of cellular radio-based 3G and 4G. But it will roll out successfully only if regulatory deals are hammered out, there is consensus on technical standards and, of course, if the technology works effectively.There are also questions over whether networks will opt to provide it and can work out a way of charging for it, as well as how they deliver those services (through cellular antennas, drones like Aquila, or from satellites). Mobile device makers are only likely to include it in their products if ultimately the global public and businesses demand it.It will be like electricity, with everybody getting what they want anytime, anywhereToday, many of us would settle for reliable 4G (even 3G), for broadband that works half as well as the providers boast and for WiFi that covers the home adequately. The fleets of British-built Aquilas that Facebook envisioned would bring 10 gigabit-per-second coverage — dozens of times faster than anything now available — to users 90,000 feet below them. Satellite distribution for the internet in remote areas would in future scenarios be 10 to 20 times faster.The supercharged internet of the next decade will not be just for people’s mobile devices and computers. The “internet of things”, already up and running, will be equally significant, with an estimated 20bn devices communicating with one another by 2020. This will include things such as washing machines that order their own servicing and self-driving cars that can run freely through otherwise potential hazards such as crossroads because they are able to communicate with each other through latency-free networks and avoid collisions.Again, though, there is a question over whether people want and will pay for IoT technology. While connected fridges are already available, you rarely hear of anyone owning and using one; and when today you cannot wholly rely on 4G to power even a Google search, it will not be easy to trust your life to cars dancing an intricate ballet through intersections, controlled by 5G.On the other hand, in the promised world of enhanced connectivity, the idea of superfast connections delivered through the air, leapfrogging the need for wires, cables and cranky home routers, should be an easy sell.Evangelists for these newer technologies say that immersing humanity in faster, more muscular connectivity, indoors and out, on planes and subways, and in remote regions, will change the world for the better.“We’re looking at profound societal impacts,” Asha Keddy, Intel’s 5G lead, says. “We’re heading to a fully mobile, intelligent, connected society. Technologies like AI, connected autonomous cars, drones and many more are going to overlay on each other — and who knows what’s going to come out of it?”Ms Keddy speculates that 5G could also be a force for equality, if everyone in the world has seamless, instant access to all the knowledge in the world.The 5G offering is the most prominent but not the only enhanced connectivity option on the table. Aquila, for example, was built to transmit data by laser beam to radio ground stations. This would have the benefit of allowing consumers to use older smartphones.Systems based on high-orbit geostationary satellites, which have been wholly tried and tested in broadcasting applications for more than a decade, use conventional parts of the radio spectrum rather than laser and microwave, and have greater geographical reach and huge bandwidth. This arguably makes it more useful to rural areas than 5G, whose localised ultra-high frequency cells are unlikely to become common outside towns.Higher-orbit satellite systems do, however, require receivers at ground stations and are also prone to latency — a fraction of a second’s delay is unpopular with users such as online gamers.But technologists are impressed by what they are seeing from 5G in the lab and live trials. There was a fear that signals would have difficulty penetrating buildings, but they are working better than expected.A British researcher, Adrian Braine, who works on the technology with Surrey University, says: “If we get 5G right, there’ll never need to be a 6G. It will be like electricity, with everybody getting what they want anytime, anywhere.”In parts of Africa, where the reach of full five-bar 4G can be remarkable even in off-the-track areas, people are enjoying the benefits of connectivity. Where it is no longer a novelty, however, people are pushing back on the ideal. There is a growing counter-current to universal, near-perfect connectivity, especially in the most developed parts of the world, where FOMO, fear of missing out, is being replaced with JOMO, or joy of missing out.Add to that the concerns over privacy and irresponsible conduct concerning data that have damaged the likes of Facebook, and some businesses may opt not to invest in enhanced connectivity.While the likes of Intel, Qualcomm and Ericsson are still pouring resources into 5G, China’s Huawei — which builds 5G technology and is responsible for much of Africa’s connectivity revolution — argued in April that users would not notice the difference from 4G and that networks would struggle to make money from the newer technology.Huawei’s sceptical view is not general among technology companies, however. What is a shared concern is that regulators, anxious not to be overly accommodating to global companies, could obstruct the supposed revolution.The European Parliament, for example, is in favour of opening up the market for next-phase connectivity to new entrants which, incumbents argue, could act as a disincentive to making the considerable investment needed to install new networks.Obstacles aside, it seems there is enough thrust from various stakeholders to ensure the technology gets a chance to fly."
42;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Toll of scuppered deals this year hits $540bn;Government scrutiny and investor activism behind rise in failed blockbuster takeovers;Acquisitions worth more than $540bn have been scuppered so far this year as blockbuster takeovers have come under renewed threat from government scrutiny.Countries are increasingly turning to foreign investment laws to block deals in sensitive industries, including the technology and utility sectors, while antitrust regulators have put up barriers to several multibillion-dollar transactions this year.Among the casualties was chipmaker Broadcom’s $142bn hostile bid for rival Qualcomm, which was blocked by US president Donald Trump on national security grounds, and the latter’s $44bn pursuit of Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors, which China refused to approve amid an escalating trade dispute with Mr Trump.In the last week alone, a handful of marquee transactions were killed, including the $3.9bn combination of local broadcast operators Tribune and Sinclair and US grocer Albertsons $5.6bn takeover of drugstore chain Rite Aid.Meanwhile, UK property owner IWG gave up on sales talks with Terra Firma, TDR Capital and Starwood on Monday. Overall, withdrawn bids are up more than a fifth from year ago levels, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Matthew Herman, co-head of global M&A advisory at law firm Freshfields, said that it was “impossible to decouple” the heightened regulatory scrutiny from politics. Several G7 countries are increasing the power they have to review deals on national security grounds, including the US, Germany and UK. Beijing has in turn sought to broaden its oversight of acquisitions, a retaliation against western efforts to curb Chinese takeovers.“While pointing to recent transactions such as Broadcom-Qualcomm might make you think that this is solely a recent phenomenon, it is not,” he said. “Governments have used foreign direct investment and antitrust regimes to scrutinise business combinations for decades.”Shareholder activism has also injected a great deal of uncertainty in pending transactions, according to advisers, as investors have increasingly been siding with hedge fund seeking to shake-up boards.“You used to sign up a deal and, absent a topping bid, shareholder approval was largely on autopilot,” said Daniel Wolf, M&A partner at Kirkland & Ellis. “Now, the possibility of deal-related activism, on the buyer or the target, has become part of the discussion.”Carl Icahn, an activist investor in Cigna, has voiced his opposition to the healthcare insurer’s $60bn acquisition of Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager, in an attempt to derail the tie-up ahead of a shareholder vote later this month.“Shareholders are showing less deference towards boards and are willing to block deals more than in the past,” said Bill Anderson, global head of activism/raid defence at Evercore.Robin Rankin, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse, said that the rise in collapsing deals indicated that the M&A cycle that commenced in 2014 was reaching it most advanced stage.“At the beginning of the cycle everyone is risk averse, they just do air-tight deals that will go through 100 per cent. As you go further into the cycle people become more willing to take some level of deal risk in transactions”
43;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-08-12T10:55:01Z;Magic Leap open to raising more capital after AR headset launch;Founder says start-up is preparing for long-term fight with likes of Apple and Microsoft;Magic Leap raised more than $2bn before its long-awaited “augmented reality” glasses went on sale last week, an unprecedented sum for a new start-up ahead of its first product launch. With the $2,300 Magic Leap One device finally shipping, founder Rony Abovitz said the company was open to raising even more capital as it gears up for a long-term fight against larger rivals such as Apple and Microsoft, which are developing their own AR headsets. “Any company like ours attempting to do something at this scale, we are taking on some of the biggest companies in the world,” Mr Abovitz told the Financial Times in an interview last week. “We are probably always in the mode of being opportunistic about capital.”Magic Leap’s production of the headset, which has included developing bespoke components, an all-new operating system and establishing its own manufacturing facility, has been costly but Mr Abovitz said the company still had “a lot of capital in reserve . . . We are judicial stewards of our capital”. Extra funds could help Magic Leap expand internationally and broaden its product portfolio, he said, while also providing further opportunity to build demand and awareness for what remains a nascent product category of glasses that place “holograms” precisely on to the real world. For now, Magic Leap One is an expensive new product with a limited range of applications, aimed primarily at “creators” — from app developers to the artistically inclined — rather than mass-market consumers. “Are we about instant profitability or revenue growth and innovation? We are studying what other great companies have done in the past,” he said. “These are the kinds of gears we are now thinking about,” said Mr Abovitz.Magic Leap’s most recent financing came from telecoms and media conglomerate AT&T in July, extending its Series D funding round that valued the Florida-based company at more than $5bn and bringing its total capital raised to $2.3bn. Alongside financial backers such as Singapore’s Temasek, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Fidelity and T Rowe Price, Magic Leap has assembled a formidable collection of strategic investors from the tech and media industry, including Google, Alibaba, Qualcomm and AT&T’s Warner Bros. “Now that we have a shipping platform with a developer environment, we can start to link to great software and services that partners like Google make,” Mr Abovitz said. That could include allowing third-party artificial intelligence services, such as Google Assistant, to connect to Magic Leap’s own onboard AI. But the company was cognisant of the potential privacy implications of connecting such technology to a device that “sees what you see and hears what you hear”, he added. “We want to take it a little slow and a little patient to understand how spatial computing weaves its way into society.” That cautious approach — alongside limiting initial sales of the “Creator Edition” of the first Magic Leap device to only six US cities — contrasts with Mr Abovitz’s more bombastic claims in the past. In 2016, he promised the company’s first product would be a cultural landmark akin to The Beatles’ release of their classic 1967 album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. “We want to deliver something fully-formed and amazing . . . We are not about putting out the rough cut,” he told the FT then, suggesting also that the device would be shipping “soon”. While he hopes that Magic Leap One could still appeal to millions of “creators”, Mr Abovitz concedes that he might have promised too much. “I think we are kind of in, like, maybe the early Rubber Soul period,” he said in last week’s interview, referring to The Beatles’ 1965 album. “We still have the White Album, Sgt. Pepper and more coming.”
44;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-08-10T02:36:34Z;Qualcomm settles $774m antitrust dispute in Taiwan;Chipmaker to increase investments in Taiwan as part of settlement;Qualcomm has settled its antitrust dispute in Taiwan, resolving one of several legal battles the mobile chipmaker is facing around the world. Qualcomm said the agreement allows it to continue setting licensing terms based on the price of an entire device using its technology and intellectual property, rather than just components such as modems.Those licensing practices have become a key point of contention with litigants including Apple and the US Federal Trade Commission. Last October, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm around $774m, alleging that it had abused its dominant position in providing chips for wireless data connections in mobile phones. Qualcomm had denied the allegations and launched an appeal. On Friday morning in Taiwan, the TFTC and Qualcomm said they had resolved their dispute and reduced the initial fine to NT$2.73bn ($93m), which has already been paid.However, the Taiwanese regulator will now monitor Qualcomm’s negotiations with licensees to ensure “fairness” for the next five years. Over the same period, the San Diego-based chipmaker must also increase its commercial investments in Taiwan, including collaborating on 5G and opening a new manufacturing and engineering centre there. No figures were immediately available for the cost of that investment. Among the deal’s other clauses, the company has promised to no longer enter into discount agreements in exchange for exclusivity clauses in its supply contracts, the Taiwanese regulator said. Qualcomm has also agreed to enter into renegotiations in good faith if a Taiwanese licensee believes it has been hit with an unfair agreement, and it ensures the company will not terminate or threaten to terminate chip supply during any such negotiations.The settlement does not end Qualcomm’s ongoing litigation with Taiwan-based Foxconn, one of a group of Apple contract manufacturers that has been pulled into the two companies’ legal dispute.Nonetheless, despite the lengthy regulatory oversight required, Qualcomm presented the settlement as a validation of its existing business model.“We are pleased to have reached a mutually beneficial resolution with the TFTC that puts the litigation behind us,” said Alex Rogers, president of Qualcomm’s licensing unit. “This settlement directly addresses concerns raised by the TFTC, regardless of disputed positions, and builds on our foundation of collaborative, long-term business relationships in Taiwan. We are happy to reaffirm our commitment to licensing our valuable intellectual property under principles of fairness and good faith.”In Taiwan, the decision to settle came after the regulator faced “enormous pressure” from local stakeholders including the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the country’s top research institute, with whom the chipmaker had paused research programmes, said Ross Feingold, a Taipei-based adviser with consulting group DC International Advisory. “It appears the TFTC sought a face-saving solution to a dispute that was a domestic political problem as much as it was a fair trade problem and entered into this kind of settlement for the first time in its history,” Mr Feingold said, noting also the regulator may have feared the Trump administration might have more vocally come to Qualcomm's defence, exacerbating the dispute.
45;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-08-07T13:41:46Z;Qualcomm shows how to learn from China mistakes;A quieter approach can help avoid damaging trade dramas and regulatory grumbles;"Until recently it was fair to say that if Chinese regulators wreck your best-laid business plans once, shame on them. But if it happens a second time, shame on you.As the importance of the China market to the likes of Apple and General Motors soared after the global financial crisis, the world’s biggest multinationals struggled to staff it accordingly. For some of them, it took years to beef up crucial local functions such as government relations and due diligence. In such a large, fast-growing and rapidly changing market, it was easy to be tripped up by a newly aggressive competition regulator one year or by emboldened anti-corruption investigators the next. After Xi Jinping came to power in late 2013, multinationals including Daimler, GSK, Microsoft and Qualcomm were all snared. The lucky ones settled quickly and learned lessons. Qualcomm recently showed how a company could learn from its mistakes and make sure not to repeat them. But unfortunately for the San Diego-based semiconductor company, that was not enough when it became a valuable pawn in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.In late 2013 Qualcomm found itself at the centre of a high-profile anti-monopoly investigation led by the National Development and Reform Commission. Executives and lawyers say that, with hindsight, there were steps the company could have taken to avoid what became a very public, damaging and expensive run-in with the NDRC. The company appeared to miss the fact that grumbles from Chinese smartphone makers about its pricing practices were beginning to find sympathetic audiences in the halls of the NDRC. Having failed to negotiate an amicable solution with its Chinese customers, Qualcomm then found itself in the middle of a relatively public and adversarial showdown with the NDRC’s competition regulators. ""Had Qualcomm been more reasonable in the beginning, they could have prevented the whole [monopoly] skirmish from becoming public,” says Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who worked for Qualcomm at the time. “The publicity is what really hurt Qualcomm . . . They should have said ‘We don’t agree [with these complaints] but let's come to a joint solution’.” In February 2015, the company agreed to pay a $975m fine. As difficult as this episode was, it set the stage for a steady expansion of Qualcomm’s China business. Today the company has 150 licensees in the country. Three years after the monopoly investigation, Qualcomm appeared to play another difficult regulatory dilemma much more skilfully. This spring, as it sought Chinese competition clearance for its $44bn buyout of Dutch chipmaker NXP in the middle of rapidly escalating Sino-US trade tensions, Qualcomm engaged in much quieter and more constructive negotiations with the Chinese government. It simultaneously lobbied the Trump administration on behalf of ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker — and Qualcomm client — that faced sanctions amounting to a corporate “death penalty” for violating US embargoes on American technology shipments to Iran and North Korea. In the midst of the trade drama, Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon also visited one of its joint ventures in the southwestern city of Guiyang, where he held out the possibility of further investment. “They played NXP about as well as they could have,” Mr Robinson says. “They learned their lesson.” That all this was not enough to secure Chinese approval for the NXP deal was no fault of Qualcomm’s. For the many Chinese officials seething about the Trump administration’s trade war threats, signing off on a strategically important acquisition for an American tech giant was politically impossible. When China’s State Administration for Market Regulation forced Qualcomm to resubmit its clearance application in late April, giving itself another six months to review the transaction, the regulator effectively took the deal hostage pending the resolution of both the ZTE and Sino-US trade disputes. The biggest mistake in the Qualcomm-NXP saga was thus made by the Trump administration. In a badly executed hostage exchange, it gave ZTE a life-saving reprieve before Beijing approved the NXP deal. But the Trump administration is showing signs that, like Qualcomm and other companies, it too can learn from past mistakes in China. Last week the US commerce department quietly restricted high-tech exports to 44 Chinese entities, many of which are units of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, or Casic. Casic, as it happens, is ZTE’s second-largest shareholder. "
46;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;No more big deals, please, says NXP chief;;NXP will not entertain any more big acquisitions after its two-year effort to sell to Qualcomm left its management team “fatigued and tired” by the regulatory process that ultimately killed the deal, according to the Dutch chipmaker’s chief executive.“There has been a lot of uncertainty and anxiety that we’ve had for the last few years,” Rick Clemmer said in an interview, after Qualcomm walked away from the deal, having failed to secure regulatory approval from China. “Frankly the entire organisation is relieved that we have clarity and certainty.” On Thursday morning, Mr Clemmer held his first conference call with analysts in almost two years, after NXP reported second-quarter revenues of $2.3bn, up 4 per cent year on year. NXP was set to receive $2bn in “termination compensation” from Qualcomm on Thursday, which it plans to return to shareholders as part of a $5bn share repurchase programme. NXP shares closed down 5.7 per cent at $92.81 on Thursday. While Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, has blamed the US-China trade war for scuppering his deal, Mr Clemmer took aim at the Chinese authorities. “There is nothing about the transaction that they had an objection to, that there were not remedies provided,” he told the FT. “There is no clarity in China whatsoever.”Asked if he blamed the Trump administration for the trade war, exacerbating political tensions between the US and China, he replied: “That’s above my pay grade”. If the transaction had not been delayed by regulators, it might have been completed before the trade war began, he said, adding: “NXP is a big supporter of free trade, not tariffs.” NXP and Qualcomm first began discussing a deal in early 2016 and an initial agreement was announced in October of that year. Since then, NXP’s ability to take strategic decisions has been constrained, Mr Clemmer said, causing the company to miss out on smaller potential deals. “It ties your hands a little bit as you’re going through that period,” he said. “It actually did put some constraints on us about some pruning and additions that we would have been able to do over the last couple of years.” NXP is now free to pursue some of those opportunities to realign its portfolio, he added. But Mr Clemmer does not plan to do any more large deals - even if regulators were to allow them, which analysts see as a dim possibility following the failure of Qualcomm’s bid. “Our organisation is fatigued and tired at the process,” Mr Clemmer said, especially after completing NXP’s acquisition of Freescale so close to beginning the Qualcomm transaction. “I don’t want to put our organisation through that again.” NXP employees had initially been excited by the prospect of merging with Qualcomm but morale changed when Broadcom made a hostile approach to the San Diego-based chipmaker. Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan is known for cost-cutting in businesses after acquisitions. Broadcom’s approach was ultimately nixed by the US government over national security concerns.
47;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-07-26T14:52:12Z;Qualcomm/NXP: block trade;US group’s failed move is reminder of China’s willingness to intercede in M&A plans;Investors are having a tough time factoring in the cost of a potential global trade war. Chinese antitrust regulators just complicated their calculations further. Hedge funds that specialise in merger deals had bet on shares in Qualcomm acquisition target NXP outperforming. After China stymied the deal, Qualcomm’s shares have rallied instead.The decision by Chinese regulators to let an approval deadline pass is seen as tit-for-tat on perceived poor treatment by the US. But the roots of the controversy go deeper. Chinese leaders are worried about their supply of chips if international relations sour. In the most recent full year, Qualcomm derived two-thirds of its revenues from China. Creating capabilities in semiconductor production is a key plank of the country’s manufacturing 2025 strategy. This goal was always destined to cause friction with the US groups that dominate the sector.Buying NXP made sense for Qualcomm. The company is focused on mobile technology such as smartphone chips. Sales of these devices have been slowing as consumers stop replacing their phones every year. NXP makes chips for cars and other applications, where growth expectations are more impressive. Half of its revenues in the most recent quarter came from the automotive segment.Without this boost Qualcomm has had to think of another plan to lift earnings. It now intends to buy back $30bn of shares. Buybacks will deliver no breakthroughs, yet its shares gained 5 per cent anyway.The US-China trade fight often generates headlines about soy beans and pork. But semiconductors and critical telecommunications markets are where the real contradictions lie. Governments worldwide are trying to exert more control over foreign investment in crucial technologies. Qualcomm’s failed attempt to buy NXP is a reminder of China’s willingness to intervene in global M&A.
48;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-07-26T10:59:16Z;NXP poised for drop after Qualcomm deal collapses;;Shares in Dutch semiconductor group NXP are set to open sharply lower on Thursday, falling as much as 12 per cent in pre-market New York trading after Qualcomm failed to get Chinese regulatory approval for a planned $44bn takeover of the company.The company said it would receive a $2bn termination fee from by Qualcomm on Thursday and that it would launch a $5bn share buyback programme to support its stock price. However, in reporting its quarterly results, NXP poured more bad news on investors.The company narrowly missed analysts’ expectations for its quarterly sales, a day after Qualcomm reported revenues ahead of market estimates. The Dutch chipmaker said revenues were $2.29bn in the second quarter of the year, up 4 per cent from the same period a year ago but just a 1 per cent increase from the previous quarter. Analysts had been looking for $2.36bn according to Bloomberg.Shares in the group fell to as low as $86.50 before the US market opened, well below that $127.50 offer that it had accepted from Qualcomm in a deal that had been in the works since at least October 2016. The company’s stock price is down 44 per cent since its high in February when a revised deal with Qualcomm was agreed.The agreement between Qualcomm and NXP expired at midnight US time after failing to obtain antitrust clearance from Beijing. China’s inaction is widely assumed to be a form of retaliation against US president Donald Trump’s sharp language and tariff action against Chinese imports.Richard Clemmer, NXP chief executive said, said:“While it is unfortunate that the semiconductor powerhouse that would have resulted from the transaction with Qualcomm could not close after 21 months of diligent efforts by the team, we are confident in our future as an independent market leader and will continue to focus our efforts to drive our long-term strategy in our leadership markets of automotive and secure IoT solutions.”The move will be felt acutely by some of the world’s largest hedge funds, which had piled into NXP in the expectation that the takeover by Qualcomm was a done deal. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management was one of the top shareholders in NXP as of June 5, while hedge funds including Pentwater Capital, Soroban, DE Shaw, Farallon, Och-Ziff, York Capital, Arrowgrass and Tyrus Capital all held large stakes in the company as of March 31, as well.A spokeswoman for Elliott, who earlier this year argued that NXP was worth $135 per share and was part of a group of nine hedge funds who agreed to support a $127.50 revised deal with Qualcomm, declined to comment.
49;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-07-26T06:42:49Z;China’s suffocation of Qualcomm-NXP merger signals new era;Rebuff to US semiconductor company seen as collateral damage of trade tension;In late May, a team of Qualcomm lawyers arrived in Beijing to seal a deal with Chinese competition regulators, optimistic that they would soon clear the last hurdle in the US semiconductor company’s proposed $44bn acquisition of the Dutch-owned NXP. “All the technical issues had been resolved,” said one person briefed on Qualcomm’s discussions in Beijing. “From Qualcomm’s perspective everything that needed to be done was done.”But three days later Donald Trump dropped a bombshell. Despite earlier assertions by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese vice-premier Liu He that the world’s two largest economies would step back from the brink of a trade war, the US president announced that his administration would proceed with punitive tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese exports.“The regulators started to say things along the lines of ‘your president embarrassed Liu He’, ‘he offended the Chinese people’, and all that,” said the person briefed on Qualcomm’s interactions. At midnight on Wednesday New York time, the San Diego-based company bowed to the inevitable. With Chinese clearance still pending, Qualcomm announced it would not proceed with the NXP deal. “We obviously got caught up in something that was above us,” said Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive, hours before his company’s deadline for the transaction. The Chinese government’s decision to let the clock run out has not only killed what would have been a transformative deal for Qualcomm — it also threatens to change the mergers and acquisitions landscape for US technology companies. National antitrust regulators around the world are able to review M&A transactions if those companies have significant businesses in the country, but only in recent years has China exercised that right.Since July 6, when the US imposed a first tranche of tariffs on imports from China worth $34bn a year, the US president has reiterated his intention to assess punitive tariffs on all Chinese exports to America — worth more than $500bn last year. In the event of total trade war, China, which could not respond in kind as it does not import nearly as much from the US, would have to consider other forms of retaliation. Playing the regulatory spoiler in large, strategic US deals such as Qualcomm’s is one option. China’s refusal to approve the deal puts a “big red light on any big M&A in the semiconductor industry in the short term”, said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight. “The stakes in technology are obviously very very high, particularly given that semiconductors are a huge strategic priority for China,” he added. “That, combined with . . . the whole trade war, really means Qualcomm has become an unfortunate victim of the broader climate.”More than $200bn worth of M&A deals were announced in the semiconductor industry in 2015 and 2016, including Qualcomm and NXP’s, as smaller chipmakers sought the safety of scale, larger players diversified amid slowdowns in the PC and smartphone sectors, and all tried to position themselves for the advent of 5G, the next-generation wireless technology that will begin to be rolled out this year. But now, says Mizuho semiconductors analyst Vijay Rakesh, “the activity has slowed down significantly. Now we have pretty much come to a screeching halt.” Qualcomm and NXP first started talking in early 2016, when the Dutch chipmaker was looking for a buyer for its digital networking business. By June that year the companies’ chief executives were discussing an acquisition of NXP in its entirety.Closing the deal should have been straightforward, with limited overlap between product portfolios meaning there were few competition concerns. Before the companies got bogged down in Beijing, the takeover had been cleared in eight jurisdictions. But a deal conceived before Mr Trump was elected president would ultimately become one of the highest-profile victims of his administration’s aggressive trade policies.Technically, the Chinese government did not block the transaction. After instructing Qualcomm to refile its approval application in mid-April, the State Administration for Market Regulation had six months to issue a final ruling. But China’s silence has cast a long shadow over many upcoming deals that will fall under the regulator’s purview. Investors that built a stake in NXP have been hit by the break-up of the acquisitions and now view China’s presence in the global market as a big risk factor. “We were completely blindsided,” said one investment manager that had a large position in NXP. [China’s refusal to approve the deal puts] a big red light on any big M&A in the semiconductor industry in the short termThe addition of China to the global regulation of M&A “has just made this business a lot more difficult”, the investor added. The largest aerospace deal in history, United Technologies’ $23bn acquisition of Rockwell Collins, must also gain regulatory clearance to close by its deadline in September, the investor noted. Back in May Beijing officials had indicated, according to people briefed on the trade talks, that they would clear the Qualcomm-NXP transaction in return for Mr Trump’s willingness to lift crippling sanctions on ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications firm that admitted violating a US embargo on technology exports to Iran and North Korea. Qualcomm helped its cause in Beijing by lobbying quietly for a reprieve for ZTE, which was also an important client.But when Mr Trump resumed trade hostilities with China, one large US institutional investor in the Dutch company began to hedge its bets. “We’re still long NXP but we’re protected and our position is a lot smaller than it was,” a strategist at the firm said on Wednesday before the deal collapsed.Additional reporting by Sherry Ju Fei, Yuan Yang and Xinning Liu China is unique in the world of antitrust enforcement / From Eric Barstad, Minneapolis, MN, US

The companies’ agreement expired just before midnight in New York on Wednesday without any indication that they had obtained antitrust clearance from Beijing, despite the deal being signed off by eight other regulators around the world. After being shielded by the Trump administration from Broadcom’s hostile approach four months ago, Qualcomm has now become the highest-profile American victim of the US-China trade war.China’s inaction on regulatory approval for a deal involving a big US technology company has been seen as retaliation for US president Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports, although Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said on Thursday that the deal was reviewed in accordance with the anti-monopoly law.The deal’s collapse could also prove costly for the hedge funds that had piled into NXP over the past few months, and now own more than a third of its shares. Shares in the Dutch group fell 12 per cent to as low as $86.50 before the US market opened, well below the $127.50 offer that it had accepted from Qualcomm.Paul Singer’s Elliott Management was one of the top shareholders in NXP as of June 5, while hedge funds, including Pentwater Capital, Soroban, DE Shaw, Farallon, Och-Ziff, York Capital, Arrowgrass and Tyrus Capital, all held large stakes in the company as of March 31 as well.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, conceded defeat earlier on Wednesday after a two-year effort to close the NXP tie-up. Instead, he announced a $30bn share buyback programme. “We intend to terminate our purchase agreement to acquire NXP when the agreement expires at the end of the day today, pending any new material developments,” Mr Mollenkopf said on Wednesday afternoon.On a conference call with analysts, he added: “The decision for us to move forward without NXP was a difficult one . . . To say the least, the 21 months since we announced the NXP acquisition have been volatile.”Mr Mollenkopf said that Qualcomm ultimately decided that there was not a “high probability” of a near-term change in the “current geopolitical environment” that would allow the deal to close. Qualcomm plans to complete a “large majority” of its $30bn share buybacks before the end of its fiscal 2019, in September next year.The company on Wednesday also reported results that were “significantly above our prior expectations”. Revenues increased 6 per cent to $5.6bn, ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, with net income up 41 per cent to $1.2bn. Shares in Qualcomm jumped 6 per cent in after-hours trading. And the company revealed a piece of long-anticipated news on its analyst call: Apple will not be using its modems in the next generation of iPhones, amid legal battles between the two companies.“We believe Apple intends to solely use our competitor’s modems, rather than our modems, in its next iPhone release,” said Qualcomm’s chief financial officer George Davis. “We will continue to provide modems for Apple legacy devices.”Before the close of trading on Wednesday, Qualcomm’s shares had been 10 per cent below where they were at the start of 2018, when they were buoyed by the offer from Broadcom. Mr Trump’s blocking of the bid in March on national security grounds marked an unprecedented intervention by the White House. Qualcomm’s profits have been hit by its wide-ranging legal battle with Apple over royalties. Apple’s litigation began in January 2017, just a few months after the NXP deal was agreed in October 2016. Mr Mollenkopf will now come under pressure from Qualcomm’s investors to show how the San Diego-based chipmaker can diversify from its mainstay of chips for smartphones into the “internet of things” without the anticipated boost from NXP, which has a bigger business in the automotive and security industries. Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight, said that the resolution to the drawn-out NXP saga was a “good thing” for Qualcomm investors because it provided “increased certainty”.“At some point you have to get on and manage the business. You can’t wait for something indefinitely,” Mr Blaber said. However, the company’s need to diversify remains. “This deal was all about [the internet of things] and the reality is that IoT is growing but still relatively small in the grand scheme of Qualcomm’s business.” Qualcomm’s offer for NXP, which was increased from $110 a share in February amid pressure from activist investors, was set to expire just before midnight US eastern time on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Elliott, which earlier this year argued that NXP was worth $135 a share and was part of a group of nine hedge funds who agreed to support a $127.50 revised deal with Qualcomm, declined to comment.NXP said it would receive a $2bn termination fee from Qualcomm on Thursday and that it would launch a $5bn share buyback programme to support its stock price. However, in reporting its quarterly results, NXP poured more bad news on investors.The company narrowly missed analysts’ expectations for its quarterly sales, a day after Qualcomm reported revenues ahead of market estimates. The Dutch chipmaker said revenues were $2.29bn in the second quarter of the year, up 4 per cent from the same period a year ago but just a 1 per cent increase from the previous quarter. Analysts had been looking for $2.36bn according to Bloomberg.“While it is unfortunate that the semiconductor powerhouse that would have resulted from the transaction with Qualcomm could not close after 21 months of diligent efforts by the team, we are confident in our future as an independent market leader,” said Richard Clemmer, NXP chief executive said.Additional reporting by Sherry Fei Ju in Beijing
51;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm admits Apple will not use its modem in next iPhones;Switch comes amid legal battles between the two companies;"The big news that everyone was expecting from Qualcomm on Wednesday was that it is abandoning its $44bn bid for NXP.

But Qualcomm’s management team also slipped out another piece of long-anticipated news on its analyst call: Apple will not be using its modems in the next generation of iPhones, amid legal battles between the two companies.“We believe Apple intends to solely use our competitor’s modems, rather than our modems, in its next iPhone release,” said Qualcomm’s chief financial officer George Davis. “We will continue to provide modems for Apple legacy devices.”The comments confirm rumours that have been circulating since late last year that Apple might switch to Intel when the next iPhone is released, most likely in September.Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president, added during the analyst Q&A: “This is a very dynamic industry . . . We continue to be focused on technology. We feel pretty good about our modem leadership.”He pointed to recent research that suggested iPhone models using Qualcomm’s modems saw faster download speeds than those variants that include Intel’s chips. Apple added Intel to its modem suppliers in 2016 with the iPhone 7.Despite the multibillion-dollar litigation between Apple and Qualcomm, which is proceeding through courts in the US, China and Europe in the coming months, Mr Amon suggested that the loss may not be permanent, as the industry moves towards the first 5G smartphone launches next year.“If the opportunity presents itself I think we will be a supplier of Apple [again],” he said.Intel’s shares were flat after-hours. Qualcomm’s after-hours gains only accelerated during the analyst call, with shares rising 6.5 per cent."
52;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-07-25T11:37:21Z;NXP slips with investors bracing for decision on Qualcomm deal;;Shares in Dutch semiconductor maker NXP fell about 3 per cent in pre-market New York trading to $97.70, as investors wait to learn whether its planned $44bn takeover by US rival Qualcomm secures last-minute approval from Chinese authorities.The declines mark the lowest level for its shares since May 4, sitting at a sharp discount to the $127.50 offer that has been agreed with Qualcomm.If Chinese regulators do not give the go-ahead by 11:59pm in New York on Wednesday, Qualcomm and NXP are expected to walk away from the deal, the FT’s Due Diligence briefing reported earlier on Wednesday.Qualcomm has promised to pay NXP $2bn in cash by 9am on Thursday if the deal falls apart and will probably kick off an aggressive share buyback programme to help bolster its stock price (which, mind you, is 15 per cent below the high it reached amid the Broadcom fight).If the deal does fail — barring last-minute word from Chinese regulators that they’re ready to approve it — it would be the clearest signal yet that tensions between Washington and Beijing have frayed and that the latter is willing to use its regulatory heft as one chess piece in the escalating trade skirmish.The losers are not only executives in San Diego and Eindhoven, the respective headquarters for Qualcomm and NXP. Financial advisers, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Centerview Partners and Qatalyst Partners stand to miss out on millions in fees. Hedge funds that bet on the deal are also nursing heavy paper losses.Read the FT analysis on that, here.
53;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-07-20T03:00:27Z;Big hedge fund bet on NXP hit by trade war;Chip deal that appeared to offer easy winnings caught in US-China tensions;Some of the world’s biggest hedge funds are learning the hard way that there is no such thing as a slam-dunk trade.Paul Singer’s Elliott Management and Matthew Halbower’s Pentwater Capital are among those caught up in US chipmaker Qualcomm’s $44bn pursuit of NXP Semiconductors, a takeover first agreed when Barack Obama was still in the White House and one that has until July 25 to be completed.The only remaining approval required is from Chinese regulators, with many investors believing that rising Sino-US tensions over trade and technology is why the deal has yet to win clearance in Beijing. A lack of approval would make Qualcomm the highest-profile US corporate casualty of the trade war.If the takeover collapses, analysts warn that aggressive selling of NXP shares by hedge funds may reverberate across the financial system as investors race to close trades and settle leveraged bets with their banks. Of the company’s publicly known stockholding base, roughly 41 per cent is held by hedge funds, according to Bloomberg data.“I have never quite seen anything like this before,” said one veteran observer of the hedge fund industry. “If NXP goes wrong next week, the entire market will be down.”Shares in NXP, whose chips for driverless cars will give Qualcomm a way of cutting its dependence on those used in smartphones, have fallen more than 11 per cent from a recent high in June and are trading well below the $127.50 offer price. The stock was trading at about $103 on Thursday.NXP’s largest hedge fund shareholders include Elliott, which first disclosed a stake in August, 2017, Texas-based HBK, Soroban Capital and Pentwater, all of whom own at least 3 per cent of its stock, according to the most recent publicly available data.This would not be the first time that hedge funds have been ensnared by the collapse of a deal. In 2014, investors, including Paulson & Co, suffered paper losses after US pharmaceuticals group AbbVie walked away from its £32bn deal to buy Shire.Multiple hedge fund managers told the FT that traders have been blindsided by a chain of events that began in 2016. Funds moved quickly to buy shares in NXP, which Qualcomm first agreed to buy for $110-a-share just weeks before Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016.Betting that the transaction would be completed, arbitrageurs sought to profit from the gap between NXP’s stock price and Qualcomm’s offer which was about $10 on the day the companies announced the deal. Depending on a hedge fund’s risk tolerance, such bets in a takeover situation are typically built with the use of leverage allowing the opportunity to amplify gains or losses.By the middle of 2017, the likelihood of making money by owning NXP shares looked practically guaranteed. The stock closed above Qualcomm’s $110-a-share offer price on July 27, reflecting both the company’s improved performance and increased optimism about semiconductor makers. A wider re-rating of the sector had pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up by a third since the Qualcomm takeover deal was announced.“It was seen as a no-brainer because you had an offer of $110 in cash and if the deal didn’t happen you got even more than $110,” because the whole sector was rising, explained one hedge fund portfolio manager who has followed the NXP-Qualcomm saga closely. “This was a rare case where people believed there was zero downside,”He added: “Normally, in merger arbitrage, you either make a little bit of money or lose a lot if you are wrong. Almost never, do you have a case where you make money both ways. There’s a law that says there is no reward without risk and people forgot that. It was seen as riskless.”The first flicker of alarm that NXP shares may not be a one-way bet to trading gold emerged last November when it became clear that Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom was planning to make a bid for Qualcomm. The move introduced a new risk, but after a period of volatile trading, NXP shares continued their ascent. By December, Elliott launched a public campaign seeking a $135 per share offer for NXP.Indeed, as Broadcom persisted with its hostile approach for Qualcomm, it dawned on investors that an improved offer for NXP could prove a shrewd defence mechanism to fend off the then Singapore-based company. In February this year, Qualcomm won the support of nine NXP shareholders, including Elliott and Soroban, and agreed to a new deal that valued NXP at $127.50 a share.But less than a month later, the Trump administration cited national security concerns and blocked a deal between Broadcom and Qualcomm before it had even been agreed. Nor was that unprecedented move the end of the high-stakes drama for the Qualcomm-NXP deal. In April, China demanded further divestitures from Qualcomm to approve the purchase of NXP.As the clock ticks towards July 25 without Chinese sign-off, Qualcomm and NXP have signalled that they will not extend the merger deadline. Both declined to comment on whether they would resume negotiations for an extension in the coming days. Several sources involved in the deal said they viewed next week’s deadline as a drop-dead one, barring a last minute indication from Chinese regulators that the deal is nearing approval. Qualcomm executives have outlined a plan for large share buybacks should the deal with NXP unravel.Analysts and investors have questioned the rationale for China’s hesitation. Some have likened Qualcomm to a chess piece that has allowed Beijing to pressure the US over its sanctions on ZTE, the telecoms maker that was essentially forced to halt its operations after it could not secure key parts. Others simply see it as a bargaining chip for the Chinese in the trade war.“We watch the stock now pretty closely just as a tell on overall sentiment on the trade war,” said Stephen Granoff, the head of research at Sender Company & Partners. The hedge fund invested in NXP earlier this year but sold its stake. Mr Granoff added that the drop in the stock had caused “pain” for some funds already.There may be more to come.When a merger runs into trouble, the fallout often extends beyond shareholders and can leave debt investors also looking decidedly glum.Banks arrange financing packages for multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions before deals close. Companies such as Qualcomm, after all, need the funding to write their acquisition cheque to the company they have agreed to purchase.The issue for bondholders is that they bear the risk should a deal fail to materialise. While companies usually promise investors to buy back their bonds with a 1 per cent premium if they fail to complete a deal by a pre-determined date, investors can still get burnt. Buried within bond contracts are clauses that have enabled some large companies to buy back debt issued to finance deals at par and thus not pay a premium.Earlier this year Qualcomm redeemed some debt tied to the financing of its takeover of Dutch chipmaker NXP, including $1.5bn of notes that matured in 2020. Those bonds had previously traded as high as 101 cents on the dollar, but were ultimately called at par.Qualcomm also sought to buy some of its debt back at par.The cases are often more extreme. When US health insurers Aetna and Humana were forced to walk away from their merger in February 2017 after a federal judge blocked the merger, the companies had to unwind a $13bn financing package. Aetna had sold $2.4bn of 30-year paper, which found ample investor demand. The bonds traded as high as 107.5 cents on the dollar in the weeks after the debt was sold, but were ultimately redeemed at 101 cents on the dollar.It was a painful experience for some bondholders, who had thought that the decision to raise the debt in the first place signalled the companies were on the right path with regulators.However, the biggest risk may be the deals themselves. When an unexpected debt-funded merger is announced, bond investors find themselves lending to a company that is significantly more indebted than before, and sometimes they say it will be years before they reduce their leverage to levels that are more traditional for their credit ratings.Eric Platt and Alexandra Scaggs
54;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Beijing downplays Made in China policy;Move to build common cause with Europe against Trump trade tariffs;China is softening its rhetoric on an industrial policy that set it on collision course with the US and Europe, in a bid for foreign investment to keep its economy on track. The shift on the Made in China 2025 policy — now being downplayed by the country’s media and the subject of assurances to foreign governments — comes as Beijing seeks to improve ties  with European companies that have complained about forced technology transfer and subsidies for national champions.The policy, unveiled in 2015, set out 10 sectors — such as robotics, semiconductors and advanced medical technology — in which domestic companies are expected to dominate in the Chinese market and compete globally.But, as China tries to build a common front with Europe against tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, state media are no longer giving the same prominence to the policy.A propaganda directive leaked in late June ordered Chinese media no longer to refer to the term. A report on Friday by Xinhua, the state news agency, also avoided any reference to Made in China 2025 when discussing President Xi Jinping’s call for the country to develop “core” areas of science and technology.Foreign business long ago learned to take Chinese industrial policies very seriously, especially when they include dates and percentage targets for replacing foreign companies in the domestic market and then taking them on globallyChinese leaders are also seeking to reassure foreign governments and companies that the programme is more benign than has been portrayed.On a trip to Berlin last week, Premier Li Keqiang compared the policy to Germany’s “Industry 4.0” push, which seeks to ensure that German companies fully exploit new technologies.“Chinese officials are playing down Made in China 2025, saying it is an aspirational document put together by the bureaucracy even though it is enshrined in the party’s constitution,” said James McGregor, APCO Worldwide’s greater China chairman, who has written extensively about China’s indigenous innovation strategy. “But foreign business long ago learned to take Chinese industrial policies very seriously, especially when they include dates and percentage targets for replacing foreign companies in the domestic market and then taking them on globally.” European businesses and governments had been worried that the Made in China 2025 policy would lead to unfair competition with Chinese groups.In cases such as high-speed rail, multinationals such as Siemens have handed over technology under licensing deals only to see Chinese partners turn round and compete with them in foreign markets.But the Ministry of Commerce now says the Made in China 2025 programme is open to foreign companies.China has also recently eased market access for foreign pharmaceutical companies, in addition to plans to reduce or eliminate ownership limits in the financial services and motor sectors in 2021-2022.Countering foreign claims of forced technology transfer, the Ministry of Commerce has noted that China last year paid almost $30bn in intellectual property royalties to US companies. It added that technology transfers were purely “voluntary”.On Monday, EU leaders will meet Mr Xi and Mr Li in Beijing, where they hope to make progress on an investment agreement. Last week, China secured $20bn in contracts with German firms.Nevertheless, the drive to promote Chinese innovation remains a national imperative. On Friday, Mr Xi told the top government committee overseeing the economy that developing technologies was vital not only for economic development but for national security. The toned-down coverage of Made in China 2025 has been accompanied by an unusual reduction of state media coverage of Mr Xi. Last Monday, his name did not appear in any headline on the front page: the first such absence in five years, according to a count by independent Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily.On Sunday, his name and photo were missing again.Analysts said it was a sign that the party was trying to shift public focus away from Mr Xi’s policies amid slowing growth and the confrontation with the US. “The trade war with the US has caused panic inside the system, including the fear that China’s tit-for-tat approach will cause trouble for China's economy,” said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based Communist party historian. “From the perspective of [the Communist party’s] ruling position, if the captain goes in the wrong direction then it’s dangerous.”This article has been amended since its initial publication to more accurately reflect the People’s Daily coverage of Mr XiAdditional reporting by Archie Zhang and Xinning Liu in BeijingTwitter @HornbyLucy
55;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Culture clashes loom after a rush of company mergers;M&A deals between groups with different corporate norms can be bad news for investors;Tariffs, trade wars and rising nationalism may command headlines, but they have done nothing to dent global dealmaking. More than $2.5tn in mergers and acquisitions have already been announced this year and, if the pace continues, 2018 is likely to surpass 2015’s $5tn in M&A deals.Partly, this reflects the end of a long cycle of easy money in which companies are looking to get that last bit of juice out of their stock prices. Some of the largest deals, such as AT&T-Time Warner, Disney-Fox, or CVS-Aetna, are about traditional companies trying to compete with the big internet groups by building scale. Either way, it is worth remembering that more than half of all mergers destroy shareholder value. Think of the cautionary cases of AOL-Time Warner, Quaker-Snapple or Daimler-Chrysler.What sets successful mergers apart from the failures? In large part, it is having a good cultural fit. Corporate culture is, of course, predicated on many things: a company’s nation of origin, the type of talent it calls for, the industry it is part of and so on. But all these things can be categorised in a binary way: is the culture “tight” or “loose”?While all cultures have their norms, tight ones — whether they exist in countries or companies — tend to enforce their norms quite strictly, whereas loose ones are more tolerant — even encouraging — of rule-breaking. Michele Gelfand, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland, whose research on cultural norms has been used by the US Department of Defense and numerous multinational corporations, suggests that countries as diverse as Japan, Norway, Singapore and India all have tight cultures. By contrast, she classes those of Israel, the Netherlands, Greece and the US as more or less loose.The results of her study of 33 nations, which were first published in the journal Science in 2011, show that levels of tightness were highest in south and east Asian nations, followed by the Middle East, and Nordic or Germanic countries in Europe. The Latin, English-speaking and former communist nations are the loosest. The latter example may be at least in part a response to a period of strict Soviet rule. Extreme cultures can trigger a counter-reaction, which is perhaps one reason that the rise of a liberal coastal elite in the US has been countered by rightwing populism in the country’s heartland — in turn fuelling even more extreme identity politics on the left. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to grappling with not only the extreme turn politics has taken in many countries, but also the likelihood of success of the current plethora of M&A.Globally, cross-border deals have nearly doubled relative to the first half of last year, meaning that cultural conflict could play a more important role in M&A than usual. In her upcoming book, Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World, Prof Gelfand outlines research on 6,000 significant mergers in more than 30 countries taking place from 1980 to 2013.She finds that a large tight/loose gap between the corporate cultures of the parties involved resulted in a lower than average stock price, and much lower returns for the investor than in a typical deal. The largest gaps analysed resulted in a loss of$30m within five days of the announcement, which would seem to indicate that markets understand cultural gaps even when buyers themselves do not.All this suggests that investors should perhaps be happy that Broadcom, the Singaporean chipmaker, was blocked from buying the US tech company Qualcomm by the Trump administration in March. The two companies come from countries that are, at least according to Prof Gelfand’s research, unlikely to mesh well. It might also be a relief that cross-border deals in general may become tougher in the US, given the political climate. But such challenges are not limited to international deals. Companies within a single country can have wildly different cultures. Consider the recent Amazon-Whole Foods deal, which may give reason for concern. While many internet companies have extremely loose cultures (think Uber or Facebook), Amazon founder Jeff Bezos runs his company with a tight top-down structure.This is in part because Amazon is driven by the very precise demands of the manufacturing and logistics industries. Performance is constantly surveilled, evaluated and reviewed. That is quite a contrast to Whole Foods, which has a looser culture that can be traced to its hippie roots and high profit margins (companies that are under less competitive threat can afford to be looser).No wonder there are now stories of grocery clerks crying on the job and store shelves going empty at Whole Foods. This kind of culture clash does not bode well for investors. Fostering diversity is not easy, but the best companies do it. Chinese internet groups such as Alibaba or Baidu are influenced by the strictures of the state, and yet they find ways to remain creative and nimble. Any number of US and European multinationals are able to foster loose research and development divisions that work alongside tight manufacturing operations. The key, particularly in mergers, is not to be blindsided. Successful corporate marriages result when each partner knows what they bring to the table.rana.foroohar@ft.com
56;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-06-22T02:30:23Z;Intel faces big challenges as Krzanich exits after affair;Ouster over relationship with staffer comes as manufacturing lead is under threat;When Brian Krzanich took over the top job at Intel, he had a simple message. The US chipmaker was the clear leader in the world’s most demanding manufacturing industry. After a career of more than 30 years spent in operations, the new chief executive vowed to double down on a lead that he saw as Intel’s main competitive advantage.Five years on, however, that manufacturing leadership has come into question for the first time since Intel rose to dominate the semiconductor industry in the 1980s — and Mr Krzanich is out.The two are completely unrelated, if the company is to be believed. Mr Krzanich had a consensual relationship with an unnamed Intel employee, contravening a policy in place since 2011 that forbids managers from “fraternising” — the company’s word — with anyone who either directly or indirectly reports to them.Corporate governance experts backed the company’s zero-tolerance policy on Thursday, supporting the board’s decision to apply its ethical rules at all levels of the company, regardless of rank.But the slip in manufacturing that has occurred on Mr Krzanich’s watch has left his successor with a headache. Intel has led the chip industry for years by being the first company to reach each new generation of microprocessor technology, shrinking the feature size on its chips faster than the competition. That enabled it to pack more processing power into less space and surf the wave of Moore’s Law — the prediction, by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, that chips would get progressively smaller and more powerful.The extent of the slip was evident earlier this year, when Intel warned that its first 10 nanometre chips — originally due by the end of 2016 — would not hit volume production until late in 2019. Mr Krzanich once predicted that Intel’s old two-year cadence for shrinking chip feature sizes would probably stretch out another six months as it hit new challenges manufacturing at such minute scale. But by the time its 10nm chips reach the market, the gap will have widened to more than five years.“Intel was on a roll for years — in hindsight, they took too much risk” by setting over-ambitious manufacturing goals, said Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.The company’s slip has contributed to the new lease of life being enjoyed by AMD, the perennial also-ran in a PC and server chip market dominated Intel. By outsourcing its manufacturing to TSMC, a Taiwanese group that makes chips on order for outside groups, AMD may stand to take a slice out of its bigger rival’s market share in the data centre market. Intel’s latest manufacturing headaches have contributed to a 60 per cent bounce in AMD’s shares since April.That helps to account for the lack of consternation on Wall Street at the news of Mr Krzanich’s abrupt departure. He had been credited with pushing the company faster beyond the mature PC market, partly through acquisitions. These included the $16.7bn purchase of Altera, whose products are used in artificial intelligence, and the $15.3bn acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli driverless technology company.Intel was on a roll for years — in hindsight, they took too much riskBut while this has given it a stake in more of the industry’s most promising growth markets — including 5G mobile communications, driverless cars, machine learning and the internet of things — Intel still has a long way to go to challenge companies such as Nvidia in AI and Qualcomm in mobile.Analysts at Barclays summed up the mood. In a note to investors on Thursday, they said that the departure, though unplanned, could still be a “a good transition point” for Intel as it looks to hone its position in the next giant chip markets, working out where to push harder and where to retreat.“I don’t think all of these have to hit — but some of them do,” said Mr Moorhead.Despite the manufacturing delays, however, Mr Krzanich has left Intel in robust financial health. The company is enjoying strong growth from the data centre market — where its chip architecture, originally created for PCs, is also the foundation for most servers. Intel combined news of its CEO’s ouster with a bullish forecast for second-quarter earnings, lessening some of the shock.Stronger cost discipline under Bob Swan, brought in as chief financial officer from eBay in 2016, has also helped. That has contributed a strong rally in Intel’s shares since last autumn, after a period in which the company’s investors had missed out on a powerful stock price boom for other chip companies. Mr Swan was named interim CEO on Thursday.Intel said it would look beyond the company for its next CEO, as well as consider internal candidates, potentially pointing to the first outside leader in its 50-year history. The large number of bets on new markets placed by Mr Krzanich makes it unlikely the company will turn outside for a visionary leader to set a new direction, said Mr Moorhead. The challenge now is to refine its current strategy, not pick an entirely new one. That is a job better suited an insider, he said.Coming soon after extensive executive changes set in motion by Mr Krzanich, however, the search for a successor has come at an inconvenient time.The list of internal candidates is headed by executives such as Navin Shenoy, who was appointed head of the company’s important data centre group only last year, and Venkata Renduchintala, who joined three years ago from Qualcomm and is now head of the PC group and chief engineering officer.If Intel’s board follows through on its usual practice of promoting from within, one of these two could soon become the inheritor of one of the chip industry’s most famous crowns.
57;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-06-21T01:42:51Z;Xiaomi to raise up to $6.1bn in Hong Kong IPO;;Xiaomi will sell shares at between HK$17 and HK$22 a share, raising up to $6.1bn in its Hong Kong initial public offering.Cornerstone investors, including US chipmaker Qualcomm and China Mobile, have signed up for an aggregate $548m shares – based on the midpoint of the price range. The price represents a multiple of 22.7-29.3 times 2019 earnings as forecast by the underwriting syndicate. Xiaomi’s offering, which was to have scored two big firsts, has been dogged by problems and the amount raised represents almost half its original ambitions to be valued at $100bn. Instead, the pricing implies a market valuation of between $54bn and $70bn – or marginally higher if the over-allotment option is exercised. Xiaomi still becomes the first issuer to take advantages of Hong Kong’s new rules on dual-class listings – which was key for founder Lei Jun – but may not now issue China’s maiden depositary receipts after shelving its planned $5bn China Depository Rights issue. This is not Qualcomm’s first foray into Chinese entities – it invested in facial recognition start-up SenseTime. While the US chipmaker has been caught in several crosshairs from the trade war “I wouldn’t necessarily draw a link,” said one banker.The Beijing-based smartphone maker is expected to list early next month.
58;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-06-18T04:00:27Z;China seeks semiconductor security in wake of ZTE ban;Stubborn technology gap has frustrated Beijing’s bid to build a world-class chip sector;When the US administration shut down Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE in April — putting the future of a $17bn company and 75,000 jobs at risk after sanctions cut the supply of key microchips — it highlighted a vulnerability in the Chinese economy: it depends on foreign-made chips.The country remains dependent on imports to build the phones, telecoms gear, computers and other devices that account for almost one-third of its exports: at $227bn in 2016, the country spent more on the items than it did on oil, iron and basic plastics combined, according to the World Bank and Chinese government data.The US is set to unwind the ZTE sanctions after Chinese leader Xi Jinping pressured Donald Trump, but Beijing remains desperate to end its reliance on foreign chipmakers. It has already committed $150bn to build its domestic semiconductor industry over the next decade via the Made in China 2025 development programme.“The motivation [in China] is pretty clear,” said ANZ chief China economist Raymond Yeung. “If you don’t have the chips, you can’t do anything.”The stakes are high. In April, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, speaking to students at Waseda University in Tokyo, warned of the fallout for Chinese tech companies if the US were to suddenly stop supplying chips to the country. “One hundred per cent of the market for chips is controlled by Americans . . . suddenly if they stop selling . . . what that means, you understand?” he said.China’s sensitivity to its reliance on offshore chip groups was apparent again earlier this month, when Beijing launched probes into several foreign semiconductor groups, including Samsung and Micron, for alleged price fixing. The two groups said they were co-operating with authorities.Analysts say that what is missing for the Chinese is mastery over “process technology” — the cluster of skills needed to pack billions of transistors into a fingernail-sized chip.“Doing it from scratch is a very, very high bar to figure out,” said Chris Thomas, head of the Asia semiconductor practice at consultants McKinsey. “Even if you had the money, there’s a lot of integrated disciplines.”Mr Thomas added the big chip plants in China were reluctant to invest heavily until they got a handle on process technology. “You can’t invest in capacity until you have the technology,” he said.Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, says Chinese companies will struggle to catch up to foreign rivals that are improving their capacity at the same time.“Let’s say [Chinese companies are] behind by five years,” he said. “So in five years they will catch up with where we are now, but in five years we’ll be ahead of them again, by another five years.”Analysts agree that Chinese chipmakers still trail their most advanced rivals by years, despite decades of central planning and billions of state funds.“Even for a mid-tier smartphone right now, the main chip cannot be produced by the best foundry that China has,” said Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein, referring to the contract chipmakers at the heart of the global semiconductor industry.The sales gap between TSMC and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the Shanghai-based foundry that ranks fifth worldwide in sales of customised chips, is only growing as the Taiwan group builds on its lead in facilities, customers and capital expenditure. SMIC declined to comment.Making advanced chips means working closely with designers and technology groups to write the rules for how chips will be developed. Overtaking TSMC, for instance, would require a company such as Apple to take a leap of faith on a new Chinese manufacturer to build one of the most critical components for its devices.Nevertheless, the scale of Beijing’s investment and China’s record of success in industrial and technological development means experts are reluctant to rule out the possibility that the country will leapfrog the world in semiconductors.“After 2020, you could see a world in which innovation slows down quite a bit, and therefore you see a world where [China’s] ‘laggards’ are able to catch up, because the leaders are not able to march ahead as fast,” said Mr Thomas.As the world’s biggest consumer of semiconductors by value, China also has market power it can use to encourage offshore groups to share their technology. Last year Qualcomm, the US group, formed a joint-venture with state-owned Datang Telecom Technology to develop chips for cheap smartphones.Chinese customers and intellectual-property licensees in the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of Qualcomm’s sales in 2017, up from 53 per cent in 2015. The importance of good China relations was reinforced by Beijing’s delay of Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors, in April.China has also tried to buy its way to the top of the chip industry. The Rhodium Group, which monitors Chinese investment in the US semiconductor sector, recorded 27 attempted Chinese deals worth more than $37bn from 2013 to 2016, including three major acquisitions: Integrated Silicon Solutions, Mattson Technology and OmniVision. That compared to only six transactions worth $214m from 2000 to 2013.However, the dealmaking rattled the west. US regulators blocked several acquisitions of chipmakers on national security grounds. These included Singapore-registered chip designer Broadcom’s $142bn hostile bid for Qualcomm, with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US saying the deal could lead to China overtaking the US in 5G technology.The Trump administration also rejected the $1.3bn acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor, a US company, by a group of investors that included state-controlled China Venture Capital Fund last September.For now, said Mr Chang, bottomless pockets will not suffice.“It is not enough to just to have money,” said Mr Chang. “Once you are behind in technology it is not so easy to catch up.”In 2016 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing invested $3bn in a chip factory in Nanjing to “provide closer support to customers as well as expand our business opportunities in China”, the company said.Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, says the deal allowed his company to play to Beijing’s desire to make more chips in China but TSMC was also able to protect the company’s intellectual property.“We felt that by making the symbolic move we will be at the table when they talk about ‘Made in China’,” he said, referring to Beijing’s development master plan.Mr Chang said the Nanjing plant was wholly owned and controlled by TSMC, and Mr Chang said its most sensitive trade secrets were handled only by a top tier of the group’s most trusted Taiwanese staff. Moreover, the plant would never make the company’s most advanced semiconductors. Chips for the latest iPhones, for example, would continue to be made at its factories in Taiwan.The investment meant TSMC secured access to rapidly growing Chinese customers, such as Huawei, without committing to transferring its most sensitive technology to mainland groups.“I think we accomplished [our] mission,” said Mr Chang.
59;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm, NXP jolted higher after US-ZTE deal;;Shares in Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors are both marching higher on Thursday after the US said it has reached a deal with Chinese telecoms group ZTE to unwind crippling sanctions that nearly brought it to the brink of collapse.The deal would allow ZTE to start importing vital US-made components it needs to make its phones and telecoms equipments and help resolve a case that has been thrust into the middle of the ongoing US-China trade dispute.Qualcomm is currently awaiting Chinese regulatory approval for its $47bn acquisition of rival NXP and the hope is the reprieve for ZTE would now pave the way for Beijing to give clearance for the deal.Shares in Qualcomm were 2.2 per cent higher at $61.17 while those for NXP jumped 6.3 per cent to $121.74. Both stocks were pressured this year by concerns over the fate of their proposed merger. Qualcomm had been down by as much as 22 per cent for the year in April after the US hit ZTE with the component supply ban. NXP nursed year to date losses that topped 21 per cent at one point in May.Other chip stocks failed to get a lift from the ZTE news however. Intel was off 1.8 per cent, Advanced Micro Devices fell 3.7 per cent and Nvidia lost 1.2 per cent. Taken together, the moves leave the wider Philadelphia Semiconductor index 0.6 per cent lower for the day.
60;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-06-04T16:58:06Z;Qualcomm in stand-off with bondholders over NXP delay;Chipmaker told investors it will not compensate them despite missing takeover deadline;Qualcomm, the US chipmaker, is in a stand-off with a group of bondholders after telling them it does not intend to compensate them for the delay to its $44bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors.When investors bought $2.75bn of bonds issued last year to fund Qualcomm's purchase of NXP, they expected the US company to buy back that debt at a 1 per cent premium if it failed to complete its acquisition by June 1, based on a provision in the notes’ documents. However, with the deal still awaiting final approval in China, on May 31 Qualcomm notified bondholders that it plans to redeem the outstanding notes at par, rather than at a premium, according to a person involved in the debt investors’ discussions.The company pointed to another part of the offering documents, which it said allows it to buy back the debt at face value, saving the company $26m based on the amount of bonds still outstanding.The skirmish between Qualcomm and its debt investors is sharpening the focus on the fine print of bond documents, since a less predictable regulatory environment has snarled several high-profile, debt-financed deals.Companies often promise to buy back bonds sold to fund acquisitions for 101-per-cent of the bonds’ face value if the deals are not completed. They do so with provisions known as special mandatory redemption (SMR) clauses, intended to prevent the use of borrowed cash on purposes lenders find less attractive.Qualcomm is not the first company to try to sidestep the SMR provisions this year. In March, AT&T exploited similar duelling provisions to avoid $17.5m of payments on an SMR bond issued to fund its Time Warner deal, which has been challenged by the Trump administration.The timing of AT&T’s manoeuvre apparently precluded a legal challenge from investors, but Qualcomm’s bondholders are considering legal action. When the chipmaker signalled last month that it would buy back the bonds at par, a law firm representing investors holding more than $700m of debt sent a letter to Qualcomm stating their belief that they should be paid 101 per cent of par value.Qualcomm declined to comment. According to the person involved in bondholder discussions, Qualcomm told lenders that, because it has deposited just enough money with a trustee to buy the bonds back at par and taken various other administrative actions, it has satisfied its legal obligations.The provision the company said it was using is known as a “make-whole call”. That allows it to buy the debt back early at par value or at the discounted sum of future payments, whichever is higher.At issue are two fixed-rates notes that reach maturity in 2019 and 2020, respectively, part of a $4bn financing package Qualcomm arranged to fund its NXP acquisition.It originally issued $2.75bn of the two notes, and last month, with the SMR deadline approaching, it tried to persuade investors to exchange the debt for new securities with a November deadline, in return for compensation of 0.25 per cent. That was when the company first raised the possibility that it would not pay the 1 per cent premium dictated by the SMR provisions.The offer was met with lacklustre demand, but $123m of bonds were exchanged, reducing the outstanding amount to $2.6bn.
61;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-05-29T18:00:14Z;Qualcomm chief says 5G will put China telecoms groups on top;Steve Mollenkopf says telecoms groups could disrupt market leaders Apple and Samsung;The chief executive of US chipmaker Qualcomm has predicted that the arrival of 5G will propel Chinese technology companies to the top of the global smartphone industry, threatening to disrupt today’s market leaders such as Apple and Samsung.The bold forecast comes as policymakers have seized on the transition to the next-generation wireless technology as a key test of national security and competitiveness.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in an interview that the industry is shifting “much more quickly” than when operators and device makers started to move to 4G a decade ago.The big difference this time, he said, is China. The country’s telecoms groups lagged behind the rest of the world in deploying 4G by several years but will start to roll out 5G as soon as 2019.“Historically what's happened is when you've had big ‘G’ transitions, the structure of the industry changes,” Mr Mollenkopf said. Before the rollout of 4G, he recalled, “the discussion was about Motorola and Nokia and BlackBerry”. Those companies have now faded, in part because 4G hastened the shift towards more versatile touchscreen smartphones that began with the iPhone in 2007. “5G has an open door for a lot of these type of changes to occur [again],” Mr Mollenkopf said. “On top of that, it is the first time in the history of the industry where you have significant and sophisticated handset manufacturers from China who have the ability to service the entire world. You did not have that at the beginning of the 4G transition. And they are ambitious.”But Qualcomm still counts Apple and Samsung among its largest customers. “Our job is deliver [5G] at scale and let the market decide,” he said.Mr Mollenkopf’s comments came as the company has been caught in the middle of a trade battle between the Trump administration and the Chinese government.President Donald Trump blocked a $142bn takeover of Qualcomm by rival chipmaker Broadcom in March, citing the risk the deal posed to national security. The development of 5G was a key element of that decision.Mr Mollenkopf blamed tensions between Washington and Beijing for delaying China’s approval of Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, the Dutch chipmaker. With Beijing finally set to pass the deal— almost two years after the company made its first bid — Qualcomm and its investors are looking to 5G to take the group into entirely new markets.These range from the automotive sector, where NXP is strong, to new kinds of video-streaming devices. Qualcomm and its rivals, including Intel and Huawei, also hope it will enable a new cohort of connected devices — the so-called “internet of things”. “There are a really small number of key players that do the fundamental research for the technologies that make these things work on a global basis — and that number is getting smaller,” Mr Mollenkopf said.Qualcomm’s growth in China stems from its 2015 settlement of an antitrust investigation for $975m. That deal also led to a change in its patent licensing model and unlocked a huge wave of deals with Chinese tech companies, many of which rely on its Snapdragon mobile processors at the heart of their smartphones. Last year, almost two-thirds of Qualcomm’s revenues came from chip customers and intellectual-property licensees in China, up from 53 per cent in fiscal 2015, according to the company’s annual reports. In January, the company struck 5G partnership deals with China technology groups Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo and Vivo.Qualcomm’s reliance on China has only increased in the wake of a costly legal battle with Apple, one of its largest US customers. The iPhone maker has withheld royalties from Qualcomm’s patent licensing business until the dispute is resolved. Mr Mollenkopf is optimistic that the multibillion-dollar fight will be over by the end of the year as the case goes to courts around the world. “Those legal milestones, until you get close, there is no incentive for either side to sit down and have meaningful discussions. As you get closer, the environment gets better to do a deal,” he said.The longer the case drags on, however, the more it could bolster the push by former executive chairman Paul Jacobs to take the company private. Mr Jacobs, who is trying to raise the financial backing for what would be the biggest buyout in history, could capitalise on the disquiet among Qualcomm’s shareholders that was revealed during the Broadcom bids.Mr Mollenkopf admitted that there is a “disconnect” between Qualcomm’s share price and “what we think is the intrinsic value” of the company. Nonetheless, he added: “If people had a proposal that compensated our shareholders for what we think is the value of the asset, we would look at it.”At a Qualcomm conference on 5G earlier this year, the US chipmaker boasted of its “very tight” partnerships in the country, writes Yuan Yang in Beijing.“We see ourselves as part of the Chinese ecosystem,” Cristiano Amon, the company’s president, told reporters at the event in the Chinese capital.Qualcomm’s relationships in the country are wide and deep, judging by the range of executives that were gathered. They included officials from Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, ZTE, Lenovo and Wingtech Tech, all of which rely on the US company’s chips.Most of the executives from those businesses spoke out against Broadcom’s attempted acquisition of Qualcomm, with Lin Bin, Xiaomi’s president, questioning whether the chipmaker would still be able to produce “era-defining communications products” if the deal was approved.“Qualcomm has been eager to offer technology partnerships to China in the course of seeking regulatory approval for its acquisition of NXP,” said Dan Wang of research firm Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong.But the reliance on China could also prove a challenge for Qualcomm. President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 industrial policy aims to make a number of companies world leaders, including building a domestic semiconductor industry that will overtake its foreign peers.Qualcomm’s relationships have been a boon but could prove costly in the longer term.
62;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-05-14T04:00:51Z;Can Paul Jacobs pull off the biggest buyout in history?;Qualcomm’s former chairman is trying to find backers for a $100bn bid for chipmaker;"America’s top dealmakers were sitting in the Waldorf Astoria in New Orleans in March when word first circulated that Paul Jacobs was considering a bid to take Qualcomm private.The idea raised quite a chuckle among the bankers and lawyers in attendance there for the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference.Mr Jacobs is the former chairman and chief executive of Qualcomm, son of its founder and an electrical engineer with dozens of patents to his name, giving him credibility in a company that has played a critical if backstage role in the smartphone revolution.But the deal in question would be the largest leveraged buyout in history, requiring perhaps three times the $48bn raised by KKR, Goldman Sachs and TPG to take over Texas utility TXU (now called Energy Future Holdings) before the financial crisis.Mr Jacobs was pushed out of the chairmanship earlier this year as Qualcomm dealt with a $142bn hostile bid from rival chipmaker Broadcom, which was finally scuttled by US president Donald Trump on national security grounds in March.Since then, Mr Jacobs has hired two investment banks to try to cobble together lending commitments worth as much as $100bn to back a bid, according to people familiar with the matter.Although he has yet to approach the company with a formal proposal, some of those initially sceptical dealmakers appear to have warmed to Mr Jacobs’ chutzpah — but they have a few questions.Broadcom’s failed bid, pitched at $79 a share, offered some indication of the price at which investors would entertain an offer.Qualcomm’s board held out for $90 a share but shareholders were voting overwhelmingly for the alternative directors Broadcom had nominated for election, according to reports at the time.That signalled a transaction could be had at a lower price — and is likely to encourage Mr Jacobs, not least because a bid from him should entail less regulatory risk and could be pitched lower. Shares in Qualcomm have not traded above $70 this year; the average Wall Street analyst is targeting a price of $62, according to Sentieo data.Meanwhile, the premiums private equity investors have paid on US leveraged buyouts this year are the lowest since 2007, Dealogic data show. Using the 2018 average — a 15 per cent premium to the stock price over the month before a deal — a Qualcomm buyout might be pitched as low as $60.50 a share.Even at that low end, Mr Jacobs would need to rustle up $90bn in new debt and equity, as well as be able to support Qualcomm’s existing $23bn debt load. To match Broadcom’s $79 a share, he would need to rustle up $117bn.Broadcom convinced 12 lenders — including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — to commit $100bn to its takeover effort. Mr Jacobs’ bankers have begun to test the market’s appetite for its own financing package, which would eventually be converted in bonds and loans.A syndicated bond sale for a Qualcomm buyout could near the record $49bn Verizon raised in 2013 to fund its acquisition of the part of Verizon Wireless it did not already own.A shortage of new debt issuance and generally upbeat economic conditions mean the near $9tn market for corporate bonds is at least open to large deals. Earlier this year, US drugstore chain CVS Health borrowed $40bn through a debt offering, the third largest corporate bond deal of all time.“A Qualcomm leveraged buyout could be financed today,” said Christopher Kilpatrick, a portfolio manager with Western Asset. But he added a note of scepticism: “It would have to be structured correctly and would require a large equity check. It’s not our base case.”Henry Peabody, a portfolio manager with Eaton Vance, said of a possible blockbuster bond sale: “A deal of this size would cause major indigestion.”“The [high yield] market would focus on nothing but that for a couple of weeks.”Much depends on whether Qualcomm’s $44bn bid for the Dutch chipmaker NXP is approved by Chinese regulators, because it determines how much Mr Jacobs would offer, as well as how much debt the company could support.Qualcomm earned more than $6.5bn before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in its last fiscal year, which ran to November 29. NXP reported ebitda of $4.3bn in 2017. Investors and bankers are debating how much debt that nearly $11bn of earnings can support.If Mr Jacobs decided to fund the transaction with 70 per cent debt, banks would need to commit more than $80bn to come close to Broadcom’s offer. With Qualcomm and NXP’s outstanding debts, that could push leverage to roughly 10 times the combined company’s recent ebitda. That would be a red flag for lenders’ regulators and a level that would probably prompt rating agencies to strip the US chipmaker of its investment grade ratings.Royalty disputes have knocked Qualcomm’s earnings recently, however, and the long-term demand for chips is not in doubt.“They do have a cash flow and there is a long-term view of that cash flow,” said Mr Kilpatrick of Western Asset. “Several ‘unicorn’ issuers that have revenue growth, big market caps, and much less certain cash flows are being easily financed at attractive rates in the corporate bond markets today.”Peter Andersen, the founder of Andersen Capital Management, said that if you “forgot the scale of the thing . . . the numbers would work. The ability for it to carry that debt is possible.”The thorniest challenge will be securing the $30bn or more in equity financing that could be necessary to clinch the deal. Mr Jacobs is targeting sovereign wealth funds, individual investors and companies that are among the few in the world that could cut the $5bn-$10bn cheques he needs, according to one person familiar with his thinking.He could follow the example of Broadcom’s Hock Tan, who courted private equity funds including Silver Lake, but such firms have caps on how much a single fund can invest in a deal, making a $5bn-plus equity investment challenging for most.Mr Jacobs is said to have received indications of interest from a number of deep pocketed investors. Among his friends is Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, but it is not clear that the Japanese company or Mr Son’s $100bn Vision Fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, are interested.There is another hurdle: more than half of the equity investment will need to come from US investors to avoid the intense scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US that sank Broadcom’s bid, several lawyers said.If the tussle with Broadcom revealed anything, it was that regulators and senior officials in Washington viewed the San Diego-based Qualcomm as a national champion. It is not just dealmakers who are watching Mr Jacobs prospects with a quizzical eye."
63;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-05-08T04:42:13Z;US-China tech wars threaten global sector disruption;Conflict set to upend corporate supply chains and revenue as well as China’s ambitions;Banned component sales. A blocked $142bn chip takeover. Fresh concessions demanded on a second chip deal. If this is just the warm-up, analysts say the US-China tech wars look likely to severely disrupt the global tech sector on both sides of the Pacific.Such disputes are rooted in US anxiety over China’s tech power and the methods it employs to amass it. They are set to intensify with Washington’s Section 301 investigation into the alleged Chinese theft of US intellectual property and practice of forcing technology transfers from foreign investors.Early strikes have hit at hardware companies, including smartphone and telecoms equipment maker Huawei, which has served as a lightning rod for US fears about Chinese snooping and state largesse, and rival ZTE. Huawei denies its technology is used for surveillance.As US pressure escalates, proposals published this week call for barring US agencies from using technology from Huawei or ZTE and a ban on the US military contracting vendors that work with either.All this threatens, in the words of one consultant, to wreak “economic carnage”.For its part, China has long fretted over its reliance on semiconductor imports. The nation spends more on imported silicon, which sits is at the heart of smartphones, gaming consoles and other electronics, than it does on oil. For all its advances in artificial intelligence and the internet, the silicon layer on which much of the tech sector sits is threadbare.The resulting conflict, say analysts, strikes at the heart of China’s ambitions and is likely to curb revenues as well as disrupt supply chains at foreign multinationals, many of which see the country as a key market. But it is also prompting a rethink at the corporate level in China, with tech companies looking to develop their own chips.“The complexity of this issue is mind-boggling because the electronics value chains are much more complex and globally integrated than they were in the past,” said Christopher Thomas, partner in McKinsey’s Beijing practice.Washington first hit out at ZTE, imposing a seven-year ban on purchases of US components after accusing it of illegally selling restricted equipment to Iran. ZTE relies on US sources for its newest Axon M smartphone, buying protective glass and 60 per cent of other electronics from the likes of Qualcomm, SanDisk and Skyworks Solutions, according to consultancy ABI.The complexity of this issue is mind-bogglingThe trouble for ZTE and China is that alternative sources, in Japan or South Korea, would not be able to add sufficient capacity, and domestic state-subsidised chipmakers such as SMIC and Tsinghua Unigroup lag well behind their rivals.As part of its response to last week’s US trade demands, Beijing wants the ban on ZTE lifted, as well as an end to restrictions on US exports of sensitive high-tech products.Chinese efforts to acquire overseas chip assets have also fallen foul of US regulators. Xcerra, the Massachusetts-based testing chip company, was the latest casualty, when it in February ditched its agreement to be acquired by a state-backed fund in the face of regulatory hurdles.Last year the US scuppered China’s planned purchases of Lattice Semiconductor and Aixtron, a German maker of chip equipment, on national security grounds.Facing these roadblocks, China has taken some pre-emptive steps to wean itself off foreign technology. Max Zenglein, senior economist at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a Berlin think-tank, points to efforts to woo more workers from overseas, including specific measures this year aimed at attracting workers from Taiwan, home to big chipmakers such as TSMC.Tech companies also have moved more processes in-house, developing vertically integrated models to try to inoculate them against supply chain disruptions. Those going this route include handset makers Xiaomi and Huawei, which is banned from selling most of its products into the US.Jack Ma’s tech giant Alibaba is working on a neural network chip capable of carrying out AI functions such as facial and speech recognition with substantially less power, and is also acquiring local chipmaker C-Sky Microsystems.But Chinese tech companies’ progress in developing their own technology, measured by growth in patents or research and development spending, is part of the problem, according to Edison Lee, analyst at Jefferies.He said US President Donald Trump “has definitely come to the conclusion China is going to overtake the US in terms of tech abilities and prowess, because I think his reasoning is China has done a lot of R&D over the past five to six years but where did they get the base from? The base is copying technology from the western world and then improving it and building on it.”Alibaba is pouring $15bn into R&D, and many of the big tech groups are running joint innovation labs with the government.Another flashpoint highlighted by analysts is 5G, the next-generation wireless standard that Huawei has been working to develop. Qualcomm’s proposed $142bn takeover by Singapore-registered Broadcom was scuttled by concerns in Washington that it might lead to reduced R&D spending by the US company, allowing China to steal a lead in 5G development.All of this has left the US fretting that failure to clip such groups’ wings will hand China the lead on subsequent generations of key mobile technologies, too.“Will China widen its lead?” asked Mr Lee. “If Nokia and Ericsson go out of business and it’s just Huawei and ZTE [left], the American [telcos] can never upgrade.”Qualcomm, the US chipmaker whose planned deals have been ensnared in the row between Washington and Beijing, illustrates how the pain cuts both ways.About two-thirds of its sales last year came from products delivered to China and Hong Kong — to multinationals and others that assemble their devices there — but analysts estimate less than half of this went to Chinese customers.For a start, Qualcomm is among the US manufacturers caught up in Washington’s ban on US companies selling parts to ZTE, which it estimates will trim 3 cents off its earnings per share. Analysts believe ZTE buys Qualcomm’s chips for its smartphones as well as licensing its intellectual property, making up an estimated 2 per cent of its annual revenue.China’s antitrust regulator has also demanded that the company make more concessions over its $44bn bid for Dutch peer NXP, a move Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, attributed to the escalating trade war.“It is clear that the geopolitical environment and trade actions are having an impact on the approval process,” he said.

65;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-04-26T02:07:38Z;Qualcomm comes under pressure on legal disputes;Chipmaker’s net income plummets 52% as it battles Apple and US regulators;Qualcomm accumulated a $125m legal bill in the three months to March and the chipmaker warned its costs would rise further in the coming months, as it prepares for a number of courtroom battles against Apple and US regulators.Apple’s legal onslaught against Qualcomm over smartphone patent royalties has already put a huge dent in the chipmaker’s profits. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that its net income fell by 52 per cent to $363m, in large part because Apple and its contract manufacturers have choked off billions of dollars worth of royalty payments since the dispute began more than a year ago. Overall revenue grew by 5 per cent year-on-year to $5.3bn for the three months to March. George Davis, Qualcomm’s chief financial officer, told investors on Wednesday’s earnings call that the San Diego-based company was seeing a “significantly higher” rate of spending this year due to litigation with Apple and a related antitrust investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission.“In the second fiscal quarter, we spent approximately $125m on these cases and expect that to ramp further [in the third quarter],” he said. Qualcomm’s patent infringement claim against Apple at the International Trade Commission, in which it is seeking an import ban on certain iPhone models, will have its first hearing in June. At around the same time, a similar intellectual property case is expected to go to court in Germany. Qualcomm and Apple are also fighting over patents in several jurisdictions in China. It is clear that the geopolitical environment and trade actions are having an impact on the approval process [in China]Meanwhile, Apple’s original legal action against Qualcomm, filed in San Diego, could go to trial before the end of this year. Apple is not the only source of legal costs for Qualcomm. It is also grappling with Chinese regulators to obtain approval for its $44bn takeover bid for Dutch chipmaker NXP. Qualcomm was forced to withdraw and refile its application for approval from China’s antitrust authorities last week, after the country’s commerce ministry warned that the deal “may have a negative impact on market competition”. However, Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive, blamed the escalating trade war between the US and China for the delay. “While we continue to work closely with the Chinese regulators and remain optimistic about getting the necessary regulatory approvals there, it is clear that the geopolitical environment and trade actions are having an impact on the approval process,” Mr Mollenkopf said.“However, we continue to expect to ultimately receive approval in China . . . and we remain committed to the transaction.” Qualcomm needs to obtain approval from China before its NXP offer expires on July 25. If it fails to do so, Qualcomm’s “Plan B” is to increase its capital returns to shareholders. That could include a massive $20bn-$30bn share buyback programme, Qualcomm said on Wednesday.The NXP deal is not the only part of Qualcomm’s business that has become embroiled in US-China tensions. Last week, the US commerce department banned American companies from doing business with ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment maker, for seven years, over allegations that it illegally sold equipment to Iran and North Korea.In its first acknowledgment that its sales would be hit by the ban, Qualcomm said on Wednesday that it cut its earnings guidance by about 3 cents per share as a result of “expected ZTE order effects across the company”. Analysts believe that ZTE buys Qualcomm’s chips for its smartphones as well as licensing its intellectual property, making up an estimated 2 per cent of its annual revenues. Reports emerged on Wednesday that Huawei, another Chinese telecoms group that has become a target for US regulators, was also facing an investigation by the Department of Justice over exports to Iran. Huawei, which has insisted it complies with “all applicable laws”, is currently believed to be in dispute with Qualcomm over royalties, although the chipmaker has not named the customer.“The concern would be that some of these regulations cause Qualcomm to lose other customers, even if it’s by nature of protest because of US-China relations,” said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. Chinese smartphone makers comprised a “big portion” of Qualcomm’s revenues in both its licensing and chips divisions, he said.At the same time, Qualcomm is fighting against a broader slowdown in the smartphone market and a change to how it licenses certain patents related to vital cell phone networking standards.Mr Mollenkopf told investors that he expected “some softness” in smartphone shipments in the quarter ending in June, particularly in China, which was counterbalanced by higher average selling prices for more sophisticated handsets such as the iPhone X.
66;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm: gee up;Next generation standard will need to be big for chipmaker;The hope on the horizon for Qualcomm is supposed to be 5G. Previous “G”’s brought faster wireless to mobile phones — a great leap forward for civilisation that allowed people to watch videos on the bus.Qualcomm, which spends $5bn a year on research and development to protect its dominance of mobile chips, expects to again reap the benefits of the next generation standard, which should appear in 2019.Yet Wednesday evening’s earnings call cast some shade over this badly-needed ray of sunshine. First, there is already doubt about the benefits of the faster technology. Qualcomm predicted consumers would start seeking out new 5G capable devices as soon as next year. Only last week, though, Huawei, the Chinese tech group, questioned whether consumers would even notice the difference.More important, Qualcomm is all but conceding defeat on its historical, lucrative and widely loathed licensing model. In 2015 to end a dispute with Chinese authorities, Qualcomm had agreed to license “standard essential patents” separately to its traditional fatter bundle of intellectual property. This cheaper SEP-only package was then offered around the world last November and, Qualcomm noted on Wednesday’s earnings call, some customers were switching to this skinnier package in new 5G contracts. As a Sanford Bernstein analyst asked pointedly: “Why is this a good thing?”One answer is it might be more palatable for customers and authorities around the world, which have previously sued Qualcomm, alleging it abuses its market power. In China, the SEP-only programme has led to more than 120 agreements.But it also implies lower margins. The 5G SEP-only licensing is priced at 3.25 per cent of a device compared with 5 per cent for the full portfolio.Overall, Qualcomm’s quarterly earnings were better than expected. The shares rose a little after-hours. But they remain almost 40 per cent below the $82 a share, or $120bn in market value, which rival Broadcom had offered in its thwarted bid for the company. That is an almighty gap to close. The settlement of a damaging legal battle with Apple and peace in the China-US trade hostilities would help. But in the long run, 5G needs to have a big impact. That is far from assured.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

67;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm profits bitten by legal battle over iPhone royalties;;Qualcomm saw its profits cut in half as a painful legal dispute with Apple over iPhone royalties drags on, but it still beat Wall Street estimates for the quarter.Earnings of 80 cents per share beat analysts’ estimates of 70 cents as Qualcomm shrugged off wider concerns about the health of the smartphone market.Wednesday saw the mobile chipmaker’s first quarterly earnings report since rival Broadcom abandoned its hostile takeover bid in March, after the deal was blocked by President Donald Trump over national security concerns.The company is now trying to cut $1bn in costs and complete its acquisition of NXP, which has been held up by Chinese regulators amid the country’s broader trade dispute with the US.Qualcomm’s overall revenue grew 5 per cent year-on-year to $5.3bn for the three months to March, slightly ahead of Wall Street’s estimates.“Our fiscal second-quarter results reflect better than expected performance in our semiconductor business and lower operating expenses,” Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said.Shares in the San Diego-based company jumped around 3 per cent in after-hours trading.Net income fell 52 per cent to $0.4bn in its fiscal second quarter, as Qualcomm continues to suffer from a very public legal fight with Apple and the iPhone’s contract manufacturers, as well as a private dispute with another patent licensee widely believed to be Huawei. Together, these have choked off royalties that were worth almost $1bn in revenues in the same quarter a year ago.For the current quarter, Qualcomm said it expected revenues between $4.8bn and $5.6bn, indicating a year-on-year drop of 11 per cent or increase of 4 per cent at the extreme ends of the range. Wall Street analysts had previously expected around $5.3bn for the June quarter.Despite warnings by other chipmakers such as TSMC that the smartphone market was facing a slowdown, Qualcomm said it expected 3G and 4G device shipments to increase by between 3 and 8 per cent in 2018, giving a range of 1.8-1.9bn units.
68;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Chipmakers slide on Huawei DoJ investigation report;;The chips are down for semiconductor makers on Wednesday after a media report said the US Department of Justice is investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies has violated sanctions related to Iran.The report from the Wall Street Journal sent shares in Nvidia 3 per cent lower, while Advanced Micro Devices shed 3.4 per cent. Xilinx and Qualcomm were both down about 0.5 per cent apiece.The wider Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.7 per cent, marking its fifth straight day of decline. The index has dropped more than 9 per cent over the past week.Huawei is one of the world’s largest smartphone makers alongside Apple and Samsung, and the company sources some of its components from US chipmakers.The Chinese group declined to comment directly on whether it was under investigation. It said in a statement: “Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.”The report of the probe comes just a week after the US hit Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE with a denial of export privileges over violation of US export laws to North Korea and Iran. A denial of export privileges would, among other things, prohibit ZTE from sourcing US components, on which it is highly dependent for its phones and other products.
69;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-04-19T22:51:25Z;Qualcomm to cut 1,500 jobs across California;;Qualcomm on Thursday disclosed that it was cutting 1,500 jobs across its California offices as part of a plan to reduce annual costs by $1bn. 1,231 of the cuts will come from San Diego, where Qualcomm is headquartered, the company said in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filing. Meanwhile another 269 jobs will be cut from offices in San Jose and Santa Clara, another WARN notice showed. The job cuts are expected to begin in June. The WARN filings only cover California, meaning overall job losses could be greater as the company reduces its staff around the world.The chipmaker had first outlined the savings in January in an effort to rebuff a hostile takeover from rival Broadcom.Qualcomm said on Thursday it initially evaluated cost cuts that would not involve headcount reductions but “concluded that a workforce reduction is needed to support long-term growth and success, which will ultimately benefit all our stakeholders”. Qualcomm shares ended Thursday 5 per cent lower amid a broader sell-off in chipmakers and were little changed after the market close. Shares are down 18 per cent year to date.
70;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-04-19T11:55:22Z;China demands Qualcomm concessions over NXP deal;Beijing delay raises fears of $44bn takeover becoming bargaining chip in US trade spat;US chipmaker Qualcomm must make further concessions over market competition to win Beijing’s approval for its proposed $44bn purchase of Dutch company NXP Semiconductors, China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday.The ministry said Qualcomm had resubmitted its application to the authorities on Monday, amid fears Beijing might use its crucial approval of the deal as a bargaining chip in trade disputes with Washington. “This deal has a wide influence and may have a negative impact on market competition,” Gao Feng, ministry spokesman, said.The US chipmaker had submitted a remedy plan to resolve such problems but “an initial investigation shows Qualcomm’s plan cannot easily solve the problems relating to market competition”.The commerce ministry’s first public comments on the deal came days after Washington banned component sales to Chinese electronics company ZTE, which relies on the US for microchips.They heighten fears that US-China tensions over trade and security are seeping into regulatory approvals for deals.“The crude logic would be ‘you hit ZTE so we’ll hit Qualcomm’,” said Andrew Gilholm of consultancy Control Risks. “Sitting on [the deal] is one thing and blocking it is another matter, and I think Beijing are in wait-and-see mode.”The US is poised to make its final decisions on tariffs and fresh legislation to block more Chinese acquisitions.“I think everything is in play and it doesn’t matter if it’s reviews of transactions, or stepped up customs inspections,” said James Robinson, managing director of consultancy APCO Worldwide. “Both sides, but particularly China, will be exerting quiet pressure in places that it knows can inflict pain on the other side.”National regulators are key players in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. US-Sino sensitivities have been heightened by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’ decision last month to block the $142bn hostile takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom on national security grounds. The committee had already stalled several deals by Chinese companies in the past year.China has increasingly asserted its influence in global mergers, with the ministry of commerce exercising powers over any deal worldwide involving companies with more than Rmb2bn ($319m) of turnover in China.Mr Gao said a decision on Qualcomm’s deal for NXP had taken “a long time to collect and analyse evidence” and that the matter would be dealt with “openly and fairly”.Qualcomm is a provider of microchips for Chinese electronics manufacturers, and has had disputes with domestic companies such as Huawei over patents. Chinese companies are concerned the NXP deal could further extend Qualcomm’s patent licensing powers.Beijing in 2015 levied a record fine of almost $975m on Qualcomm on grounds that it had charged excessive prices for patents and that it bundled essential patents with less vital ones. The fine followed complaints from Chinese industry groups.One of the best-known examples of China blocking a deal involving a foreign company came in 2009 when Coca-Cola’s $2.4bn bid for China’s Huiyuan Juice was denied approval. Analysts said Beijing was even more likely to intervene in sectors judged to be vital to China’s economy such as microchips. Qualcomm has extended the deadline for completion of the NXP deal from April 25 to July 25 and will pay the Dutch company a termination fee the next day if it fails to gain clearance for the takeover. The 2016 filing related to the takeover stated that Qualcomm would pay NXP $2bn in cash if it did not get the required regulatory approval.Qualcomm’s bid for NXP is part of a wave of consolidation in the chip industry, as companies try to scale up and shift from powering smartphones to the growth markets of artificial intelligence and the internet of things.Authorities in Brussels and Seoul approved the NXP takeover in January.
71;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;China demands more concessions from Qualcomm for NXP deal;Approval for deal seen as bargaining chip in US trade tensions;China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that US chipmaker Qualcomm would need to make more concessions in order to resolve market competition issues created by its proposed $47bn purchase of NXP semiconductors.The statement comes amid fears that Beijing may use its crucial approval of the deal as a bargaining chip in trade tensions with Washington.“This deal has a wide influence, and may have a negative impact on market competition,” Gao Feng, a spokesman for the ministry told reporters.Mr Gao said that Qualcomm had submitted a remedy plan to resolve such problems but added that “an initial investigation shows Qualcomm’s plan can not easily solve the problems relating to market competition”.He added that Qualcomm had resubmitted its application to Chinese authorities on Monday, and that the matter would be be dealt with “openly and fairly”.
72;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-22T07:32:35Z;Qualcomm/Paul Jacobs: blood money;A plan to take the group private hits steep equity hurdle but is just about plausible;Ousted as chairman of Qualcomm, then pushed off the board and finally mocked for his aspirations to acquire the semiconductor company — it has been a tough few days for Paul Jacobs, a son of the company’s founder.The first step was an understandable, though insufficient, reaction to shareholder unrest. An early tally of voting, obtained by Bloomberg, showed incumbent Qualcomm directors receiving half the votes of four nominees put forward by Broadcom, the semiconductor rival attempting to squeeze the board as part of its abortive hostile takeover bid. Removing Mr Jacobs as executive chairman looks late rather than hasty: management may also need to change in an uphill battle to rebuild shareholder trust.Board ejection, though, was more questionable. Qualcomm asked Mr Jacobs to step down after he expressed interest in taking the company private. In 2013, Michael Dell not only stayed on Dell’s board, but remained chief executive while he made his own acquisition attempt.Finally, there is the widespread belief that this move from Mr Jacobs is “quixotic”, “long-shot” and “highly improbable”, or even that he has “snapped”. Sceptics point out — as though this had never crossed his mind — that Mr Jacobs owns only 0.1 per cent of Qualcomm’s shares. That just means he needs plenty of equity as well as masses of debt.An acceptable price for weary shareholders might be $150bn, including debt, which surpasses Broadcom’s highest bid. A typical 80/20 leveraged buyout split would use $120bn of debt, implying interest costs of about $8bn a year. Some analysts think Qualcomm will produce over $14bn of earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) next year, after it completes the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. Deduct the combined companies’ capital expenditure of $1bn and there is $13bn or so to service debt. Banks queued up to finance Broadcom’s acquisition and should show up for this bid.The bigger hurdle is likely to be equity. The likes of SoftBank, Silver Lake and Saudi Arabia are among a shallow pool of possible providers. Mr Jacobs would have to make a good business case for the deal. Out of the public eye, Qualcomm might find it easier to end a damaging lawsuit with Apple. But his history at the company makes it hard to envisage bold transformations, such as spinning off the licensing division or slashing research spending.Some backers — and too much debt — might also attract a government veto on national security grounds. The maths, though, are not as absurd as critics pretend.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
73;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-18T18:22:40Z;Ex-Qualcomm chief aims to build investor support for bid;Paul Jacobs hopes for support in shareholder protest vote after his dismissal;Paul Jacobs is looking to Qualcomm’s investors to lodge a protest vote at Friday’s annual shareholder meeting, as he tries to build support for his attempt to bid for the company after being ousted from the chipmaker’s board last week.Mr Jacobs, who was Qualcomm’s executive chairman until earlier this month, is hoping to capitalise on some investors’ dissatisfaction with how the San Diego-based company handled rival Broadcom’s hostile takeover attempt to further his own effort to take the company private, according to people close to the matter. The son of Qualcomm’s founder Irwin Jacobs, Mr Jacobs — himself a former chief executive — is seeking finance for a leveraged buyout that could offer shareholders a similar premium to Broadcom’s thwarted offer. When the rival chipmaker’s hostile bid was blocked by President Trump over national security concerns, Qualcomm investors were denied the opportunity to vote on six directors nominated by Broadcom. The presidential order also required Qualcomm to reschedule its annual shareholder meeting for this Friday, March 23. In the wake of Mr Trump’s decision, shareholder advisory group ISS has recommended that shareholders continue to cast their votes using Broadcom’s “dissident” proxy card at Friday’s meeting. Even though the order means that Qualcomm cannot accept votes for Broadcom’s nominees, the resolution will still provide one way for shareholders to register a protest. “By continuing to vote on the dissident card, the meeting's vote results may also better reflect shareholders' views regarding the board's handling of the proxy contest, which should inform future engagement efforts,” ISS wrote in a note last week. In the run-up to the shareholder meeting when it was originally scheduled for earlier this month, shareholder advisory groups ISS and Glass Lewis had urged Qualcomm to engage with Broadcom in the best interest of its investors. ISS has questioned whether Qualcomm’s board is committed to maximising shareholder value. Mr Jacobs was forced from Qualcomm’s board last week, a move he described as “unfortunate and disappointing”. Qualcomm said that he would not be renominated as a director at this Friday’s meeting while he pursued his takeover bid.“There are real opportunities to accelerate Qualcomm’s innovation success and strengthen its position in the global marketplace,” Mr Jacobs said in a statement on Friday. “These opportunities are challenging as a standalone public company, and there are clear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximise the company’s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders, and bolster a critical contributor to American technology.”Some preliminary indications suggested that Qualcomm shareholders would have backed Broadcom’s attempt to take control of its target’s boardroom. Investors had grown impatient with Qualcomm’s existing leadership as its shares slumped through most of 2017, in the face of several regulatory battles and a painful legal fight with Apple, one of its largest customers. Early voting results on Broadcom’s six proposed directors, leaked to Bloomberg before the shareholder meeting had been postponed, suggested that the Singapore-based chipmaker’s nominees were polling ahead of Qualcomm’s existing directors.
74;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-16T22:26:39Z;Qualcomm ousts Jacobs as director over buyout plan;Former chairman will not be renominated to board after saying he is exploring a bid;Paul Jacobs will not be renominated to Qualcomm’s board next week after clashes over his plan to take the $90bn chipmaker private.Mr Jacobs, Qualcomm’s former chairman and chief executive, called the move “unfortunate and disappointing”.“The board reached that decision following his notification to the board that he has decided to explore the possibility of making a proposal to acquire Qualcomm,” the company said in a statement on Friday afternoon.The statements mark the first official acknowledgment of Mr Jacobs’ scheme to seek funding for a potential buyout after the FT reported the news on Thursday. Mr Jacobs, who is the son of Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs, has approached potential partners including Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for what would be one of the largest buyouts in history.Though Qualcomm thanked Mr Jacobs for his “decades of service and for [his] commitment, experience and vision”, his effort to acquire the company so soon after the end of Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid has caused divisions in the boardroom, according to two people close to the company. Mr Jacobs did not want to leave the board but plans to present his vision for the company on Monday.“There are real opportunities to accelerate Qualcomm’s innovation success and strengthen its position in the global marketplace,” Mr Jacobs said. “These opportunities are challenging as a standalone public company, and there are clear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximise the company’s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders, and bolster a critical contributor to American technology.”The move ends a dramatic week for Qualcomm, which began with President Donald Trump blocking Singapore-based Broadcom’s takeover attempt on national security grounds, after concerns were raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.“Following the withdrawal of Broadcom’s takeover proposal, Qualcomm is focused on executing its business plan and maximising value for shareholders as an independent company,” Qualcomm said on Friday. “There can be no assurance that Dr Jacobs can or will make a proposal, but, if he does, the Board will of course evaluate it consistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders.”Mr Jacobs said: “I am glad the board is willing to evaluate such a proposal, consistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders. It is unfortunate and disappointing they are attempting to remove me from the board at this time.”
75;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-16T18:14:30Z;Digital protectionism and national security;Where are the limits of government interference in the tech industry?;Qualcomm is no ordinary company. In an era when mobile technology is ingrained in every kind of economic activity, it develops key intellectual property underlying wireless communication. All mobile networks are built on standards developed with Qualcomm’s leadership. In a sense, Qualcomm’s technology touches all the data on all mobile devices, everywhere. Most people may not know it, but the company is as ubiquitous as the air.Given this, it is no surprise that the acquisition of the San Diego-based Qualcomm by Singapore’s Broadcom raised questions of national security. The $130bn hostile bid landed late last year. The committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), an intra-agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions, took an interest soon thereafter. Early this month Cfius stated its initial conclusions.Cfius’ primary worry was that Broadcom would cut back long-term investment at Qualcomm, especially in the 5G wireless standard (this conclusion was based on both Broadcom’s past behaviour and the heavy debt it would take on to close the deal — which could force it to focus on short-term profit). This might allow China’s Huawei, which is investing heavily in 5G, to attain a dominant position in the technology. Second, Cfius noted that Qualcomm has contracts with the Department of Defense — some of them classified.This week, President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of blocking the transaction before a deal was even agreed. Mr Trump’s decision may have been the right one. Huawei has very close connections to the Chinese state — indeed, many in the industry characterise it as a state entity. Allowing Huawei to control some of the building-block technologies for all global communications would therefore represent a major shift of power to the east. The president’s action is also justifiable in light of the extreme protectionism with which China insulates its own technology industry.What is worrisome is that while the intervention looks sensible, it was not made in accordance with any well defined principles or rules. And it was taken by a president who is beginning to back up his protectionist bluster with action. His recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminium were also defended — completely implausibly, in that case — on national security grounds.Broadcom is in the process of changing its domicile to the US. If a US company was interested in buying Qualcomm, and had a reputation for cost cutting, would national security justify blocking that deal? Why not? Is any large technology company with a Chinese competitor off limits for foreign buyers? The arguments used against the Qualcomm deal are dangerously broad. Most technology companies of significant size have links to both the defence industry and to China. If those two factors are sufficient to block a deal, then the president can block almost any tech deal he pleases.Qualcomm was clearly a company of special importance. The next big tech deal is likely to be less clear cut. The president cannot be counted on to exercise his great power in this area carefully. Other countries might respond by throwing up barriers of their own. It is not hard to imagine a slow Balkanisation of the global technology industry — which would make us all a little poorer.Perhaps after the next blocked deal, the thwarted buyer and target will go to court to demand a better justification from the government. Regardless of who was to prevail, that would be a case worth watching.
76;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Tale of woe for Hock Tan and his shattered Qualcomm dream;Broadcom chief made wrong bet trying to use positive Trump ties in takeover bid;On the second day of November 2017, Hock Tan emerged as an unlikely player in President Donald Trump’s campaign to put America first. The Malaysian-born chief executive of Singapore-registered Broadcom was invited to the White House to announce that the chipmaker he had assembled through a string of takeovers was shifting its corporate home back to the US.Four days later, Mr Tan, US citizen, made an even more audacious move, launching an unsolicited $130bn bid for Qualcomm, a rival chipmaker that has counted Apple and the Pentagon among its customers and is so central to its hometown of San Diego that its name once graced the stadium where the Chargers, the city’s American football club, used to play.It all ended in tears for Mr Tan, 66. The president turned from friend to foe as Qualcomm used its heft in the nation’s capital to make the case that Broadcom takeover would harm US national security. Late on Monday, Mr Trump blocked the deal before it could be sealed, agreeing with arguments that putting Mr Tan in control of Qualcomm could set the US back in its race against China to develop critical 5G wireless technologies.The pre-emptive strike by the economic nationalist in the Oval Office shook up dealmakers, raising fears other countries could employ similar arguments to quash cross-border transactions. Their consolation — expressed in interviews with more than a dozen deal participants on both sides — is that Mr Tan and his advisers miscalculated, taking the president and Qualcomm for granted as they hurriedly tried to pull off one of the biggest hostile takeovers in history.“Cocky” is the word one person close to the transaction uses to describe Mr Tan and his team. Their time in the White House helped blind them to the risks awaiting them, this person said. “The president likes Hock Tan,” they figured, “so that’s it.”Speed was of the essence for Mr Tan because of the nature of his attempt. Hostile bids rarely succeed. Broadcom bet — with some reason, dealmakers say — that it could persuade Qualcomm’s shareholders to support its own slate of directors, who would then approve the transaction. But to wage such a proxy fight at the annual meeting scheduled for March 6, Broadcom had to set the wheels in motion before it could complete the move back to the US heralded at the White House meeting.Mr Trump was miffed by the sudden development, feeling that Mr Tan had taken advantage of his hospitality, according to people familiar with the matter. Qualcomm, on the other hand, was ultimately handed an opportunity — to take its case to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), an inter-agency group that vets foreign deals.The Broadcom side thought it could avoid problems with Cfius. “I’m not sure this was on anybody’s radar screen as a concern,” said one person close to the company.Broadcom’s confidence was based on an earlier Trump administration decision involving its acquisition of Brocade, a California tech company that makes storage products. Once Broadcom promised to move its base, US officials agreed to the deal, although some Cfius members were left with concerns about Broadcom.Qualcomm’s lawyers took advantage of the opportunity. They put out feelers to Cfius member agencies, including the Pentagon, in early January and realised that any deal was likely to invite scrutiny. They also latched on to a rarely used tactic to secure a Cfius review before the deal was done. Their opening came in the form of Cfius rules that focus on board control as well as equity holdings. These made the proxy fight launched in January akin to taking of control of Qualcomm.Qualcomm also took aim at Mr Tan’s business record. Although he bristles at the characterisation, Broadcom is known in the technology industry for cutting back on long-term research at companies it acquires. It is also seen as lacking the deep expertise in cellular networking technology needed for 5G.Qualcomm, by contrast, accelerated its 5G partnerships in recent months — in part as a way to demonstrate to shareholders that it could thrive on its own despite a host of legal and regulatory challenges. With the exception of Apple and Huawei, most of the world’s top smartphone makers, including Samsung, Lenovo, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi, have pledged to work with Qualcomm on 5G, the chipmaker announced in January.That momentum in 5G dealmaking bolstered its credibility with regulators, too. On March 5, Qualcomm delayed its shareholder meeting after the US government ordered a national security review of the proposed deal. Broadcom’s plan to cut investment on the 5G front was highlighted in a letter Cfius sent the next morning to Mark Plotkin, the Covington & Burling partner leading Qualcomm’s Cfius strategy, and Ted Kassinger of O’Melveny & Myers, another prominent Washington lawyer representing Broadcom, focused mostly on the potential threat to Qualcomm’s role in developing 5G technology.The missive contained what some readers saw as a significant sentence: “Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.” To them, that suggested US intelligence agencies had concerns about Broadcom. “When you read ‘significant classified concerns’ there is something behind that from the government’s perspective,” said one person close to the transaction.Broadcom makes unsolicited $130bn bid for QualcommQualcomm rejects the bidBroadcom nominates entirely new slate of directors to Qualcomm’s 11-person board, kicking off a proxy fight for shareholder approvalFederal Trade Commission investigates whether Broadcom was involved in anti-competitive practicesQualcomm secretly asks for Cfius review of the Broadcom bidBroadcom raises its bid to $146bn, its ‘best and final offer’, which Qualcomm rejectsBroadcom climbs down from its board demands, cutting number of director seats it wants to six from 11Broadcom and Qualcomm executives meet for the first time to discuss a potential deal, a gathering known as the St Valentine’s meetingAfter Qualcomm increases its bid for NXP Semiconductors, Broadcom reduces its Qualcomm offer to $142bnQualcomm says the two sides are closer to agreement on regulatory issuesQualcomm delays its shareholder meeting after the US government orders a national security review of the proposed dealCfius issues public warning against the bid, saying a deal might lead to China overtaking the US in critical 5G technologyPresident Donald Trump blocks Broadcom’s bidBroadcom withdraws its bidCfius warned in its March 5 letter that the deal could help China overtake the US in 5G for reasons including Broadcom’s reputation for not investing in research at its acquired companies. The committee also ordered both sides to stop all negotiations on the deal.Broadcom reacted with another miscalculation. Instead of standing down, it pressed ahead with efforts to shift its domicile from Singapore. Broadcom’s resistance was based on its belief it could challenge the Cfius intervention through the courts, according to multiple people with knowledge of the company’s thinking.“They sealed their fate by violating the order . . . If the government suspected that Broadcom might be a bad actor, then Broadcom confirmed it,” said a person close to the deal. “A lot of other companies could have acquired Qualcomm. But not Broadcom.”Congressional pressure followed. On March 8, Texas Republican John Cornyn took to the Senate floor to argue that Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm played into the hands of the Chinese Communist party.“The cause for alarm is the deal is a hostile takeover and the consequences of the takeover could put China in the driver’s seat for the next generation of mobile technology,” he said. “Chinese companies, beholden as they are to the Chinese Communist party, would fill any void that is left once the deal is complete much to the detriment of our national security and our economy.”The next day, Broadcom appeared before a Singapore court to discuss its change of domicile. The anger of US officials was on display when Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary and Cfius chair, told CNBC that Cfius normally gives companies a chance to withdraw their bids to avoid embarrassing publicity. People close to the transaction saw that as an ominous sign.“This was a unique situation,” he said. “I, as is the rest of the committee, are fully prepared to use our powers to protect national security.”Mr Trump blocked the deal the following Monday, raising questions about whether the administration will turn to the secretive panel more frequently to scuttle deals in the name of protectionism. The White House recently levied tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and many saw the swift ruling on Broadcom in a similar light.“It signals a willingness of the Trump administration to use all the tools available to it,” says Andrea Murino, co-chair of law firm Goodwin’s antitrust and competition practice.Bankers and lawyers, however, were reluctant to predict that Mr Trump’s move will affect the record wave of merger and acquisition announcements that followed the passage of the new US tax law last year. Dealmaking so far in 2018 has eclipsed $900bn, faster than during the dotcom boom or the lead-up to the financial crisis in 2007, the high water mark for M&A activity at $4.6tn, according to Dealogic.There is even the possibility of another deal at Qualcomm.

The longtime Qualcomm director has informed members of the board about his plan to launch a buyout, according to three people with direct knowledge about the matter.Shares in Qualcomm rose more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading, after Mr Jacobs’ approach was first reported by the Financial Times.SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that controls the $100bn tech-focused Vision Fund, is one of the potential partners approached by Mr Jacobs, according to one of the people with knowledge about his take-private plan.It is unclear whether SoftBank will team up with Mr Jacobs, although the option is being explored; several people close to the matter said Mr Jacobs’ personal ties with founder Masayoshi Son could facilitate the deal.Potentially complicating the situation, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund, which is also backed by state investment funds from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi as well as other tech groups including Apple, which is waging a legal battle against Qualcomm.Moreover, a bid with foreign backing could attract fresh scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which vetoed the Singaporean-domiciled Broadcom’s bid over concerns about its links to Chinese entities. However, people close to the matter believed those concerns were surmountable.Qualcomm and SoftBank declined to comment. Mr Jacobs could not be immediately reached.Mr Jacobs, whose father Irwin founded Qualcomm in 1985, was the company’s chief executive between 2005 and 2014. He stepped aside as chief executive in 2015 but remained executive chairman until last week when he gave up that role, as shareholder ire grew over the way Broadcom’s approach had been handled. He remains on the board.The decision to take Qualcomm private crystallised after Mr Jacobs was relegated from chairman of the board to regular member, said one person familiar with the situation. Mr Jacobs is working with a small group of advisers, who are trying to assess whether it is possible for him to take the chipmaker private.Qualcomm has a market capitalisation of about $93bn at $63 a share, its after-hours price on Thursday. It has $12.5bn of cash but is in the process of acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $43bn, which will add debt.In the thwarted Broadcom bid, which envisaged the NXP deal going ahead, the Singapore-based company had offered $79 a share — a price rejected by Qualcomm.Despite the historic family links to Qualcomm’s founding, Mr Jacobs personally owns less than a tenth of 1 per cent of Qualcomm’s shares. A $100bn-plus bid would be dependent on one or more deep-pocketed financial backers.SoftBank has already completed the acquisition of one large chip company, the UK’s Arm Holdings, in 2016 for $32.4bn. More than half the Vision Fund’s vast resources are still available.More important, however, according to one potential backer, is the plentiful availability of debt: Broadcom assembled $100bn of loan commitments for its abortive pursuit of Qualcomm.Additional reporting by Eric Platt"

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.1 per cent in morning trading as sectors dropped across the board, pulled down by falls of more than 1 per cent in both financial and technology stocks. “Markets have moved on from worrying about an inflation scare to focusing on continued political uncertainty in the US,” said Tai Hui, JP Morgan Asset Management chief market strategist for Asia Pacific. “Hopefully the Fed can provide some stability in market confidence next week by clarifying its position on monetary policy, which we believe could see the [Federal Open Market Committee] forecast of policy rate hikes moving from three this year to four, based on robust economic fundamentals,” Mr Hui added. The picture was similar in Sydney, where the S&P/ASX 200 was off 0.8 per cent as every segment fell except telecoms, up 0.3 per cent. Miners shed 0.6 per cent while financials were off 0.2 per cent. Tokyo’s Topix was down 0.5 per cent as financials and telecoms both fell 0.6 per cent, although utilities were up 0.2 per cent. In Seoul, the Kospi was likewise off 0.6 per cent.

82;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Trump’s Broadcom block sends ripples across corporate America;Rare move to kill $142bn bid for Qualcomm stokes fears for dealmakers;Donald Trump has long fashioned himself as the ultimate dealmaker, writing in The Art of the Deal that he “aims very high” and just keeps pushing “to get what I’m after”.That makes his decision to block a $142bn takeover on Monday all the more remarkable. Never before has a sitting US president barred a deal over national security concerns ahead of two companies agreeing to a merger, highlighting Mr Trump’s readiness to test the limits of his constitutional powers to secure America’s primacy in the world.Dealmakers warned that the move to bar Broadcom from pursuing a hostile takeover of rival chipmaker Qualcomm — which comes just days after Mr Trump invoked a cold war-era national security statute to justify tariffs on steel and aluminium — would send ripples across corporate America, stoking fears that foreign nations could take retaliatory action against US companies.“The fact that the president took pre-emptive action before a deal was even signed is extremely disturbing and inconsistent with all of our notions of due process,” says Frank Aquila, a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. “It will also make it more difficult for American companies to cry foul when they are blocked in other countries for political reasons. This action does not bode well for robust cross border M&A activity in a number of sectors.”Some national security experts question whether the US president has the authority to block the deal, given that Singapore-registered Broadcom was in the process of moving its legal base back to America — a move announced with great fanfare by the company’s chief executive Hock Tan at a White House event with Mr Trump just days before he launched the bid for Qualcomm.Although the presidential action came days after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), an inter-agency group that vets foreign deals, issued a warning against the hostile takeover bid by Broadcom on the grounds that a deal might lead to China overtaking the US in critical 5G technology, it was not expected that Mr Trump would intervene so swiftly. The potential cuts that Broadcom could have made to Qualcomm’s investment in 5G may have presented a national security risk to the US by effectively handing the lead in the race to develop the next generation of wireless technology to China’s Huawei, says Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Qualcomm is one of only two companies to do long-term investment in next-generation wireless. Huawei and Qualcomm — that’s it,” he says. “That would have gone away because that’s not how Broadcom works.”The acquisitive company is known for cutting back early-stage research in favour of technology that can be commercialised within just two or three years, rather than seven to 10 years in the future, he adds. Broadcom’s culture and that of Qualcomm would have been like “oil and water”.Nonetheless, Mr Moorhead says he is “very surprised” that the deal was blocked so swiftly.Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary who chairs Cfius, sought to play down the idea that the latest presidential actions marked a hardening of US attitudes toward foreign investment. He pointed to the body’s “focused mandate” to examine the national security implications of deals involving foreign investors seeking control of US companies.“This decision is based on the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only,” Mr Mnuchin said in a statement. Some experts believe that Mr Trump’s move highlights an expensive miscalculation by Broadcom and its advisers rather than an attempt by the US president to mask a protectionist action in the mantle of national security. Had Broadcom waited until the completion of its corporate move back to the US — the company said on Monday that it expected to complete the shift next month — it is unlikely that the takeover of Qualcomm would have been subject to scrutiny from Cfius. “A US investor does not have to deal with Cfius,” says one former US official and Cfius expert, calling Broadcom’s move to rush the deal a “screw up”.Another Cfius expert says the committee appeared to have set a very low threshold for blocking Broadcom. “Basically it looks like Cfius is extending to Qualcomm's products the same security of supply approach it traditionally applies to defence equipment,” the expert said.Broadcom did not reveal whether it would take on the US government in an effort to overturn Mr Trump’s decision. Late on Monday, Broadcom said it “strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns”, adding that it would review the order.When the deal was announced in November last year, many analysts saw Broadcom’s move as opportunist, coming at a time when Qualcomm was weakened by legal and regulatory battles on several fronts. Now, though, the episode leaves Broadcom’s reputation badly bruised. “It has done them more harm than good,” says Mr Moorhead. “People inside the Washington beltway — and the technology beltway — will look at this and wonder, ‘Why is Broadcom perceived as such a security risk by the US national government?’ . . . There is no way for Broadcom to challenge this.”For Qualcomm’s senior management and advisers, Mr Trump’s intervention has handed them a huge victory after almost five straight months of fierce opposition to Broadcom’s offer. The US chipmaker said the $142bn bid was too low and faced an intense antitrust review. On Monday, the company said it would convene its postponed annual meeting on March 23, after Broadcom’s nominees to its board were disqualified by the presidential order.But Mr Trump’s move also highlights the increasing scrutiny US presidents have been paying to protecting technology, particularly the semiconductor industry amid what Washington sees as a growing strategic threat from China.Last year, Mr Trump blocked the $1.3bn acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor, citing national security concerns over the Chinese government’s financial backing for the deal.“When you put this executive order together with the administration’s increasing focus on Chinese technology transfer, approach to US intellectual property, and Chinese competitive concerns, it seems pretty clear that . . . there must be macro and micro adjustments in the Sino-US economic relationship,” says Tony Balloon, partner at law firm Alston & Bird.Congress is now considering legislation to expand Cfius’s mandate to outbound investment in order to block US companies from handing over vital technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics when they join overseas joint ventures. In places such as China, foreign companies are required to enter into such joint ventures in order to gain market access.Senator John Cornyn, the lead sponsor of that legislation, last month called on Cfius to investigate Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm, stressing the need to protect the California company’s 5G technology.In one of its last acts in office, the Obama administration issued a report in January 2017 calling for the Trump administration to find ways to protect the semiconductor industry. Mr Obama also blocked the Chinese-backed takeover of Aixtron, a German company with US operations. In its national security strategy issued in December last year, the Trump administration listed protecting the US “national innovation base” as an important priority. The administration is also now considering imposing tariffs and investment restrictions against China as part of a trade case intended to bring an end to Beijing’s practice of forcing US companies to transfer key technologies to Chinese joint venture partners.Scores of companies have dropped mergers after a Cfius intervention but only a handful have been scuppered by the sitting US president. President Donald Trump’s decision on Monday to bar Broadcom from pursuing its $142bn takeover of Qualcomm is the largest to be blocked by executive order, writes Eric Platt.Here are the four other deals that were thwarted by presidential order:2017 President Donald Trump blocked Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ purchase of Lattice Semiconductor. Canyon Bridge faced opposition to the $1.3bn semiconductor deal because it received some investments from China Venture Capital Fund Corporation.2016 President Barack Obama prevented the €670m sale of German semiconductor supplier Aixtron to Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund, which is based in China. Aixtron, which made products used in weapons systems, met resistance from Cfius, and ultimately the president, who said the deal “threatens to impair the national security of the United States”.2012 Mr Obama barred Chinese-owned Ralls Corp from developing a wind farm on land near a naval base in Oregon that was used to test drones and conduct combat training. He ordered the company to sell the sites and remove its equipment from the land.1990 President George H W Bush ordered China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation to sell aeroplane parts manufacturer Mamco, which it had purchased months earlier. Cfius raised concerns that the deal could give the Chinese government access to military secrets and provide it with the technology to build fighter jet engines with in-flight refuelling abilities, according to the Washington Post at the time.

Qualcomm stock closed down 4.4 per cent after the White House released a statement saying that the deal – which would have seen the Singapore-based group pay $142bn in the biggest ever tech acquisition – threatened to “impair the national security”. Broadcom, meanwhile, was up 0.8 per cent in after-market trades on the Nasdaq, despite the decision halting its four-month battle for its US rival.

They will not be permitted to vote on directors which had been proposed by Broadcom, the rival semiconductor company now branded a threat to US national security. Those nominees have been declared personae non gratae. Signed: Donald J. Trump.This extraordinary intervention, the second deal worth more than $100bn which the Trump administration has sought to block, will rattle companies around the world. More immediately, though, what does it do to Qualcomm?Shares in the chipmaker fell 5 per cent following the White House’s announcement. That is a relatively modest reaction. Optimists might argue there remains some hope of the deal going ahead, perhaps following a legal challenge. After all, Mr Trump is using a law meant to safeguard the US against dangerous foreign companies; but Broadcom is in the process of redomiciling to the US. More likely, there was already so much pessimism from prior official announcements that less damage was caused by what looks like the coup de grâce.Broadcom had offered $79 a share, or $140bn. After Monday evening’s sell-off, Qualcomm’s shares fell below $60. It will be a hard climb back. By successfully appealing for a government veto, Qualcomm has risked further antagonising its long-suffering shareholders.Any chance of a deal premium now appears to have evaporated. Qualcomm was already indigestible to most potential suitors: even after the sell-off, its market capitalisation is $89bn. It has net cash of $13bn but it is about to spend $44bn on its own acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. Only Intel, twice the size of Qualcomm, is a big enough US acquirer but it has little incentive to intervene if the Broadcom deal is dead.Now Qualcomm can return to its bitter legal battle with Apple, one of its largest customers. Believe the sunny promises of Qualcomm’s management and that is a passing problem. The future is fine as an independent company. Just around the corner comes the new 5G wireless standard, where Qualcomm will make hay. Qualcomm, however, has disappointed before — even without the president’s help.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Has President Trump inappropriately intervened in a private sector transaction?"
85;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-13T00:52:52Z;Trump blocks Broadcom’s $142bn hostile bid for Qualcomm;President cites national security concerns in taking unprecedented action against deal;US president Donald Trump has blocked Broadcom’s $142bn hostile bid for rival chip company Qualcomm, saying he was acting to protect national security.The unprecedented presidential action to prevent a giant merger before it was even agreed threatened to turn the White House into a pivotal player in corporate dealmaking, and thrusted national security considerations to the centre of the wave of consolidation that has transformed the US chip industry over the past two years.The hostile takeover bid by Singapore-registered Broadcom had already prompted opposition from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency group in Washington that vets foreign acquisitions. However, while Cfius warned of possible national security concerns, it had called for a full investigation only a week ago.The hasty White House intervention appeared to cut off Broadcom’s hopes of sidestepping the deeper national security review. The company said shortly ahead of Mr Trump’s order that it expected to complete a process of “redomiciliation” — turning itself back into a US company — by April 3. It claimed that it was “in all important respects a US company”, with most of its management and operations taking place in the US.In the presidential order released on Monday, Mr Trump said there was “credible evidence” to believe that after a purchase of Qualcomm, Broadcom might “take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States”. He went on to prohibit the deal, and order the companies to “immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm”.Qualcomm is one of the largest makers of chips and other technologies for mobile devices, and derives most of its revenues supplying Apple’s iPhone and their Android competitors.Cfius had pointed to a number of potential concerns arising from Broadcom’s bid for the leading US wireless chip technology company. These ranged from possible cuts to research and development spending that would hold back Qualcomm, to a veiled warning that Broadcom could harm the US company’s assets through arrangements with “third-party foreign entities”.Broadcom said in a short statement that it “strongly” disagreed that the proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raised any national security concerns.A paper circulated inside the White House earlier this year had warned of the risks to US national security if Chinese companies take a lead in the next generation of high-speed wireless technology, known as 5G.Mr Trump’s order appeared to point to a complete victory for Qualcomm, which had resisted the acquisition approach and secretly requested the Cfius intervention at the end of January.It was unclear on Monday whether Broadcom would attempt to challenge the order, since its planned conversion in less than a month into a US company would put it outside the reach of Cfius.In another step that should help Qualcomm buttress its defences against unwanted takeovers, Mr Trump ordered the San Diego-based company to move ahead quickly with its annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom had lobbied Qualcomm shareholders to use the meeting to elect a majority of its own nominees the board, a move that could have forced Qualcomm into accepting the takeover approach.The embattled company had won a one-month reprieve when Cfius ordered it to delay the meeting a week ago pending a national security review of the proposed deal.With Broadcom now barred, Mr Trump ordered Qualcomm to issue a notice for the meeting “as soon as possible” and then hold the meeting within 10 days of that — a step that could quickly see the opponents of Broadcom’s takeover offer consolidate their hold on the board.Qualcomm duly responded to the order on Monday by rescheduling the annual meeting for March 23.Shares in Qualcomm dropped nearly 5 per cent in after-market trading after the Mr Trump’s order was released, wiping off about $4bn in value, while Broadcom edged up 1.5 per cent.Scores of companies have dropped mergers after a Cfius intervention but only a handful have been scuppered by the sitting US president.

86;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-12T22:49:42Z;Trump blocks Broadcom’s $142bn Qualcomm takeover;President says deal threatened to ‘impair the national security’ of the US;US president Donald Trump blocked Broadcom’s $142bn takeover bid for chipmaker Qualcomm on Monday, halting the Singapore-based group’s bitter four-month battle for its US rival.In a statement from the White House on Monday evening, Mr Trump said the deal — the largest tech acquisition ever proposed — threatened to “impair the national security” of the US, following a recommendation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.“The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,” Mr Trump wrote in an order.Senior officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States met with Broadcom leadership earlier in the day after the Singapore-based company had violated the Committee’s orders by racing to move its headquarters to the US.Qualcomm shares were down 2.4 per cent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, while Broadcom was up 0.1 per cent.
87;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-12T18:47:57Z;Broadcom tussles with US government over Qualcomm bid;National security panel pressures chipmaker as it races to set up American HQ;Tension between the US government and Singapore-based Broadcom escalated after a national security panel warned it was considering sending the chipmaker’s hostile bid for Qualcomm to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has the power to kill the largest tech deal in history.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States said in a letter sent over the weekend and made public on Monday that the chipmaker had breached an order from the committee by racing to move its headquarters to the US.Broadcom is seeking to allay US national security obstacles to the $142bn bid for Qualcomm by redomiciling in the US, a move it said on Monday would be completed by April 3, days before a crunch vote of Qualcomm shareholders.The chipmaker said that it has been “fully transparent” with Cfius about the relocation process and that it believes it is in “full compliance” with the committee’s demands.Aimen Mir, a deputy assistant secretary at the US Treasury, wrote in a letter on Sunday that on several occasions Broadcom had failed to communicate appropriately with Cfius officials about its plans, including filing court documents in Singapore and proxy statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its change of domicile without giving the committee five days notice.The government panel has criticised Broadcom’s “private equity-style” takeover plans for Qualcomm, saying it would reduce long-term investment in the San Diego-based chipmaker, a move Cfius fears would lead to China overtaking the US in critical 5G technology.Cfius said its review of the transaction had confirmed its national security concerns and that it would consider taking further actions. These could include sending the review to the White House for a final decision to block or approve the proposed takeover of Qualcomm.Senior Cfius officials are to meet Broadcom on Monday to discuss the deal.Cfius, which vets all foreign takeovers that could pose a national security threat, stepped into the tussle over Qualcomm’s future last week, telling the company to delay a shareholder vote on whether to oust current management in favour of Broadcom representatives, a move that would open the door to a takeover.Qualcomm has remained staunchly opposed to a deal with Broadcom, with the US chipmaker holding out for a far higher price than its rival’s best-and-final $142bn offer. Broadcom has so far shown no willingness to back down from its hostile approach for Qualcomm. Last week, the company said it would create a $1.5bn fund to invest in American engineering talent and would preserve Qualcomm’s research and development on 5G technologies, the next wireless standard.“While Broadcom is based in Singapore, a stalwart US ally, it seems that the perceived national security risk relates to Broadcom’s links to China, specifically certain Broadcom technology development agreements with Chinese parties that are apparently unrelated to the contemplated Broadcom/Qualcomm transaction,” law firm Kirkland & Ellis said in a note drafted by its national security experts.“This ‘indirect exposure to China’ as a perceived national security risk has been an increasingly common theme for the last 18 months,” Kirkland’s note added.Cfius had already expressed serious concerns about Broadcom’s $5.5bn acquisition of Brocade, a smaller chipmaker, but eventually agreed to approve the deal after the Singapore-based company agreed to redomicile to the US.However, given Qualcomm’s greater strategic importance than Brocade to America’s national security interests, Cfius is more reluctant to give the green light to the deal, said several lawyers who focus on national security. 
88;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-12T15:12:24Z;US investment panel says Broadcom violated national security order;Committee on foreign investment warns ready to refer Qualcomm bid to President Trump;A US national security panel warned Broadcom over the weekend that it was ready to refer its takeover bid for Qualcomm to President Donald Trump after the Singapore-based chipmaker violated an interim order earlier this month.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States said in a letter that the chipmaker had breached an order requiring Broadcom to notify Cfius at least five days before it took actions relating to redomicile itself back to the US.In the absence of new information, Cfius said its current review of the transaction had confirmed its national security concerns and that it would consider taking further actions. That could include sending the review to President Trump for a final decision to block or approve the takeover proposal for Qualcomm.Broadcom had sought to allay US national security obstacles in its $142bn bid for Qualcomm by moving its official base from Singapore to the US. In response to the letter from Cfius, Broadcom on Monday said it would complete its move back to the US by April 3, days before the delayed Qualcomm annual meeting. The chipmaker added in its filing that it has been “fully transparent” with Cfius about the redomiciliation process and that it believes it is in “full compliance” with the interim order.Senior Cfius officials are to meet with Broadcom on Monday to discuss the deal.CNBC first reported news of the letter.Broadcom shares rose 3 per cent on Monday while Qualcomm declined less than 1 per cent.

It had previously expected to finalise its redomiciliation by May 6.The announcement follows an intervention from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius) earlier this month, with the interagency US panel scrutinising a Broadcom-led proxy fight. The Singapore-based group has sought to replace six of the 11 directors on the Qualcomm board.Cfius ultimately ordered that Qualcomm delay the annual meeting at which the vote will occur. The company now expects to convene shareholders and announce the results of the election on April 5.“Broadcom, which is in all important respects a US company, has been repeatedly approved by Cfius in its previous acquisitions of US companies and has always engaged productively with CFIUS to ensure US national security is protected,” Broadcom said in a statement.

President Donald Trump signed his steel and aluminium tariffs under that false guise. But metal bending is not the most worrisome new area for protectionism. Trade in physical goods and services has been flat for years, but digital flows of commerce and information have risen by 45-fold in the past decade, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. The trade war to fear is not in physical commodities, but in technology, which economic nationalists hope to ringfence in order to stave off competitive threats from countries such as China.The US has already launched a so-called Section 301 investigation. The results are due this summer but it will probably result in stricter barriers on Chinese investment in American data and IT. That could shut out companies such as, say, Tencent, or result in new tariffs on a wider variety of Chinese products — or even usher in new visa rules for Chinese immigrants.Last week, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US announced it had launched a review into Singapore-domiciled chipmaker Broadcom’s bid to purchase Qualcomm, a leading US semiconductor business. The move followed pressure from Texas Senator John Cornyn and California representative Duncan Hunter, who have each received more than $15,000 in donations from Qualcomm’s political action committee, according to Federal Election Commission records. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs Cfius, said last week that the US was “fully prepared” to use its powers to prevent the deal should it threaten national security.The arguments being made against the deal range from worries that Broadcom would shrink Qualcomm’s investment in crucial areas such as 5G, to fears that the US cannot remain digitally competitive and secure if a Singaporean company owns Qualcomm. But that fails to take into account the way in which both the US technology industry and the administration itself currently operate.Cfius frets that Broadcom, which has lined up $106bn in debt financing from private equity groups Silver Lake, KKR and CVC for the deal, will take a short-term profit approach and cut Qualcomm’s rich research and development budget, which is 20 per cent of revenues. That is a legitimate worry: private equity has a history of reducing R&D when the debt loads are high. Cfius’s theory is that if Qualcomm is starved of investment, the US will lose a “national champion” in the technology race against China.Yet this ignores the fact that Qualcomm has “strategic collaborations and interests in China that dwarf those of Broadcom”, according to Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein semiconductor analyst. Many big US technology companies have substantial interests in China, even though some of them have been privately jumping on the nationalistic bandwagon in recent months. They have been using the “better us than China” argument when lobbying against the groundswell of enthusiasm for additional regulation of the technology sector on a variety of fronts, from antitrust to privacy.The problem is that neither the US technology industry nor the government can have it both ways. In the 1980s, under the Ronald Reagan administration, there was briefly a push for a more cohesive industrial policy around technology, but it was ditched as soon as George H W Bush took office. Then, in the late 1990s, the Department of Defense worried that the Japanese were making 92 per cent of the flat panel displays used in military equipment. It launched an effort to create a homegrown industry for this technology. Billions of dollars and several years later, Japanese firms had a 96 per cent market share. Today’s worry, of course, is that we start with tariffs on aluminium and steel and end up in a digital trade war that cannot be won.The government is right to want to look out for national security interests and to have a hand in how strategically important sectors are managed. But protectionism is not the way to do it.The US government has a terrific record in terms of funding blue sky research that results in huge economic value for the private sector — touchscreen technology, GPS and the internet itself came out of the Pentagon. We should be bolstering rather than cutting funding for such research, and perhaps even allowing the public sector to take a greater cut of the profits if the research is commercialised, as Nordic countries and Israel do. That would help offset popular criticism that results when companies such as Apple or Google or Qualcomm, after benefiting greatly from publicly funded basic research, end up stashing much of their profits offshore.It is true that China protects its own technology sector. But it is also true that America has homegrown technology troubles. Rather than slapping tariffs on foreign goods or swallowing the claim that companies doing business with economic adversaries are somehow national champions that will ensure state security, we should take a closer look at our own digital ecosystem. Large US incumbents are crushing innovation. Educational reform is desperately need to train workers for jobs where they will not be displaced by robots.We can best bolster growth not by protecting US companies from overseas buyers, but by investing in infrastructure. Addressing those issues is the right way to protect national security.rana.foroohar@ft.com
91;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-09T22:45:03Z;Broadcom shares jump on report of possible Intel interest;;Broadcom shares jumped in after-hours trading on Friday after a report said that Intel was weighing strategic options in response to Broadcom’s drama-filled pursuit of rival chipmaker Qualcomm, including a possible bid for Broadcom.Broadcom shares surged almost 7 per cent after the closing bell on Friday to $271.50 in response to a Wall Street Journal report, which said Intel was weighing “a range of acquisition alternatives” in response to Broadcom’s months-long effort to gobble up Qualcomm in a $142bn hostile takeover offer.US-based Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, is reportedly watching that battle with great interest and hoping for it to fail so that it would not face competitive threats from a potential tie-up of the two companies. If Broadcom looks to be making progress, Intel may step in with a bid of its own for Broadcom, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.However, Intel may also respond by pursuing smaller acquisitions rather than trying to snap up Broadcom, which has a market cap of $104.1bn. Intel is more than twice as large by market valuation of $236.85bn.Intel shares dropped 1 per cent in after-hours trade, and Qualcomm dipped 0.5 per cent.Intel said in a statement: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation related to M&A. That being said, we have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months — including Mobileye and Altera — and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders.”
92;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Paul Jacobs out as chairman of Qualcomm;Ex-CEO and son of co-founder is replaced with independent director as Broadcom circles;Qualcomm removed Paul Jacobs as the chairman of its board of directors on Friday, replacing the former chief executive of the US chipmaker as it fends off a hostile takeover from rival Broadcom.The board named Jeffrey Henderson, who has served as an independent director on the company since 2016, as its next non-executive chairman. As part of the move, Qualcomm eliminated the role of executive chairman. Mr Jacobs will continue to serve on the board.The reshuffle at the very top comes as Qualcomm tries to beat back a $142bn hostile offer from Singapore’s Broadcom, which has led a bitter and very public four-month campaign to win control of the US company.“The board is committed to the principles of strong corporate governance and believes that having an independent director as chairman at this important juncture in Qualcomm’s history is in the best interest of the company and our stockholders,” said Tom Horton, the lead director on the board.Mr Henderson has held management positions at both Eli Lilly and General Motors and from 2005 to 2014 served as the chief financial officer of Cardinal Health, a distributor of medical supplies.
93;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Is US investigation of Broadcom bid just a patriotic ploy?;Qualcomm has found a sympathetic ear in the protectionist White House;Patriotism may be the last refuge of a scoundrel but national interests can also serve as a handy bolthole for anxious management.This week, Broadcom’s $142bn hostile takeover of Qualcomm took another twist with the public intervention of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a normally secretive national security body that can block foreign takeovers.Cfius voiced concerns that Broadcom could impede Qualcomm’s technological competitiveness and so “significantly impact US national security” by allowing China to have an advantage in 5G telecoms networks. Huawei, the Chinese tech group, was cited as one of the companies that could benefit, allowing China to expand its “influence on the 5G standard setting process”.Qualcomm, which had asked Cfius to scrutinise the takeover bid, found a sympathetic ear in the protectionist White House. As an M&A defence, it is hard to beat. The Cfius investigation, which will delay a shareholder vote on allowing Broadcom seats on the Qualcomm board, raises at least two important questions: would Broadcom significantly weaken Qualcomm and is the 5G standards debate valid in the context of national security?On the former, Broadcom is accused of using a debt-fuelled private equity style buyout to support short-termist R&D spending cuts. But would Broadcom really commit to spending a staggering $142bn purely to reduce the competition?Broadcom has now promised $1.5bn to train US engineers on 5G networks, as well as to maintain Qualcomm’s existing 5G R&D. The combination of the two companies could create a more compelling rival to Huawei and others such as Samsung, Nokia and Intel in the race for 5G. A Qualcomm-Broadcom tie-up might even prove too strong: there are legitimate concerns about market power, in particular when negotiating with tech groups that rely on chips made and licensed by the pair.But there is also the bigger question Cfius poses over the national importance of 5G patents. There is a good reason why a phone can be used almost everywhere in the world — standards on the technology are set collectively via industry bodies, and then used widely under licence.Almost every part of a smartphone, from the chipsets to the little tray that stores the Sim card, will have been patented but shared on a so-called Frand basis (Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory). This comes at a cost for whoever does not own the patents of course.5G will be an important innovation, able to send data via mobile networks at greater speed and with bottomless capacity, but any first-mover advantage is more commercial than political. Finland, home of the patent-heavy Nokia, has never exalted in any privileged position.However, there is a third issue of Qualcomm becoming a supplier of crucial government technology. Here it is not clear: is Cfius saying that Broadcom — a Singapore-based amalgamation of several former US businesses run by a Malaysia-born businessman that will soon be redomiciled in the US — is a problem as a US state supplier? The Cfius investigation, presumably, will reach a conclusion on the matter.But even the threat of such an outcome could spell the end for what would be the world’s largest ever tech deal, according to some advisers. It may be an easy escape for Qualcomm, but a shame for investors not to have their voices heard on the deal before the regulators kill it off.
94;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-07T17:45:21Z;Broadcom refuses to back down in pursuit of Qualcomm;Singapore-based group announces $1.5bn US training fund after Cfius security worries;Broadcom has refused to back down from its months-long pursuit of Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chipmaker, despite intervention by the US government, announcing that it would create a $1.5bn fund to invest in American engineering talent. The move by the Singapore-based group, which vowed to maintain Qualcomm's research and development efforts on the next-generation wireless standard, known as 5G, could relax regulatory resistance in Washington to its $142bn hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm.The company has been locked in a bitter dispute with its US rival as it tries to clinch a deal, which the current Qualcomm board of directors has rebuffed.Antitrust concerns had long been seen as a potential hurdle to any combination of the two chipmakers, but a public warning issued on Tuesday by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius) took many investors and analysts by surprise.Cfius said in a letter that a deal, including a push by Broadcom to elect a number of new, independent directors to the Qualcomm board “could pose a risk to the national security of the US”. It has been in touch with both companies on the proposal.The US government panel warned that any weakening of the US chipmaker’s standing could “leave an opening for China to expand its influence”. Cfius ordered Qualcomm to delay its annual meeting for a month as it reviews a potential deal.Cfius took issue with Broadcom’s “private equity-style” plans, which it wrote could lead to a reduction in Qualcomm’s large research and development budget in favour of “short-term profitability”.In response, Broadcom has pledged to invest in technologies that it said were “critical” to the US and create the aforementioned $1.5bn fund to train new engineers. “With its proven track record of investing in and growing core franchises, Broadcom is committed to making the US the global leader in 5G,” the company said. “Broadcom is in every important respect an American company.”Qualcomm has taken a lead position developing new wireless technologies, and is among a group of companies that includes China’s Huawei racing to launch the 5G standard.The Singaporean group, led by chief executive Hock Tan, is also in the process of move back to the US.Cfius experts and people with knowledge of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal have said this tactic could ease national security concerns. The company expects to complete its relocation by early May.Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said the recent Cfius action would add to antitrust concerns for shareholders. Ultimately, they must vote and approve the transaction. Karl Ackerman, an analyst with Cowen, said the Cfius letter “may sway” some Qualcomm shareholders to vote against the deal.But he noted that Broadcom was likely to press on with its pursuit of the company until the annual meeting on April 5, adding: “If anything, this announcement by Cfius expedites [Broadcom’s] re-domiciliation from Singapore to the US.”Broadcom shares fell nearly 2 per cent to $246.53 while Qualcomm was less than 1 per cent lower at $61.84.

96;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;US security committee warns on Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm;Concerns that link-up might enable China to take the lead in critical 5G technology;"A secretive US national security committee has issued an unusual public warning against Broadcom’s proposed $142bn hostile takeover of San Diego-based Qualcomm, saying that a deal might lead to China overtaking the US in critical 5G technology.The letter from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which can block foreign takeovers of American companies, constitutes an unprecedented case of the normally publicity-shy regulator pre-empting an ongoing negotiation to protect US technology from Chinese competition.The move comes only days after Donald Trump, US president, invoked a cold-war national security statute to justify tariffs on steel and aluminium, and experts said it marked a major shift by Washington to use national security exemptions in trade legislation as protectionist tools in American industrial policy.In a letter to the two companies, Cfius criticised Singapore-based Broadcom’s “private equity-style” plans for Qualcomm, saying it would reduce long-term investment in research and development in search of quick profits.Cfius argued that this would help Chinese competitors develop 5G, a major advance in communications technology that offers faster speeds for consumers and underpins the push toward “smart cities” and autonomous driving.Cfius singled out Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan, a Malaysia-born US citizen, for his plans to “reset” Qualcomm’s business model without specifying how he would fund the company’s R&D.“Reduction in Qualcomm’s long-term technological competitiveness and influence in standard settings would significantly impact US national security,” Cfius said in the letter published on Tuesday.“This is in large part because a weakening of Qualcomm’s position would leave an opening for China to expand its influence on 5G-standard setting.”Qualcomm is one of the largest makers of chips and other technologies for mobile devices, and derives most of its revenues supplying Apple’s iPhone and their Android competitors.It has long been seen as one of the US’s more innovative hardware companies, developing the technology used in the first mobile phones in the 1990s.“This is a sea-change in the behaviour of Cfius and how they analyse risk over and above foreign ownership,” said a top Cfius lawyer in Washington. “Cfius is being used as a tool of a national industry policy one company at a time.”In its warning to the companies, Cfius cited the increased spending on R&D by Huawei, a Chinese telecoms equipment maker that the US government has previously warned poses a national security risk because of its links to the country’s military, and its ownership of about 10 per cent of “essential” patents in 5G technology.“While the United States remains dominant . . . China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,” Cfius added.The Pentagon which is particularly concerned about Qualcomm falling behind its Chinese competitors, views the group as a “trusted company” that shores up the US telecoms and tech infrastructure.People close to Qualcomm said that the letter, which was sent to both companies this week and released by Qualcomm on Tuesday, effectively eliminated Broadcom’s chances of acquiring the company. Broadcom said on Tuesday that it was co-operating with Cfius.“The letter is reflective of a fundamental shift within the defence department and the Trump administration related to supply-chain assurance, technology transfer to the Chinese and reliance on Chinese customers,” said the Cfius lawyer. “Needless to say, this is not good for the deal.”The Trump administration has shown particular sensitivity towards the future of 5G technologies. Security officials have considered the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Broadcom has argued that its bid should not be scrutinised by Cfius because it will have reincorporated back in the US by early May, meaning that the deal would not be a foreign takeover.Mr Tan stood next to Mr Trump in the Oval Office last November to publicly announce its plans to move back to the US; it was based in California before moving to Singapore for tax reasons.In response to Cfius’ letter, Broadcom said it was better placed than Qualcomm to make the combined company a global leader in critical 5G technologies.“There can be no question that an American Broadcom-Qualcomm combination will provide far more resources for investments and development to that end. Entrusting this effort to a failing Qualcomm management . . . would not be in America’s long-term interests,” Broadcom said on Tuesday.Shares in Qualcomm dropped 3.7 per cent to $61.64 in afternoon New York trading. That was well below Broadcom’s latest cash and stock offer, which valued shares in Qualcomm at $79 each, or $82 if the US company drops a planned $44bn takeover of Dutch chipmaker NXP.A number of prominent Wall Street banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, have lined up to lend $106bn to Broadcom in what would amount to the largest ever financing package for a deal.Broadcom shares climbed slightly, which analysts said was a sign that investors thought that a deal was becoming less likely.The US government, citing Cfius’s national security concerns, had ordered Qualcomm to delay by a month its March 6 shareholder meeting to vote on whether to replace six of its directors with candidates put forward by Broadcom.Broadcom said on Monday it was “disappointed” by the decision, as it accused Qualcomm of trying to “ prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees.”"

98;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-06T16:38:47Z;Debt challenge awaits Broadcom over Qualcomm deal;Trying to finance its $142bn pursuit of chipmaker risks straining company’s investment grade rating;If Broadcom overcomes regulatory and political hurdles in its $142bn pursuit of US chipmaker Qualcomm, the Singaporean company’s next test will be in the bond market.A dozen banks have committed to provide Broadcom with $100bn of financing, which the lenders would eventually need to convert to bonds and loans if Qualcomm and its shareholders agree to a deal.But there are few precedents for debt-financing on the scale contemplated by Broadcom, with just US telecoms group Verizon and brewer AB InBev having raised more than $40bn at a single stroke in the bond market. CVS Health, the largest US drugstore chain, may do so this week to fund its $69bn acquisition of healthcare insurer Aetna.Relying on the debt market to fund a deal would likely strain the investment grade credit ratings of both Broadcom and Qualcomm. The bond sales would flood the market as yields on US corporate debt hit a six-year high and investors adjust to the first bout of market turbulence in more than a year.“A month or two ago, any regular issuer could come in any size and get a deal done without any trouble,” said Tod Nasser, senior vice-president for investments at Pacific Life. “Since equity market volatility picked up, spreads are out significantly, especially for edgier credits. That week a Qualcomm financing would come, what’s going on in the White House, what’s going on with the Fed will matter a lot.”Any debt issue from Broadcom would likely include multiple maturities and currencies, potentially eclipsing the record $49bn Verizon raised to fund its 2013 acquisition of the rest of Verizon Wireless, one person with knowledge of the deal said. Floating rate loans are expected to play a significant part in the transaction, and banks have shown enthusiasm to keep some loans issued as part of the transaction on their balance sheets, the person added.A deal of the size required for the purchase would catapult the combined group into the ranks of the largest debt-issuing companies, a list dominated by telecom operators and banks, according to data from ICE BofAML Indices analysed by the Financial Times. Neither Broadcom nor Qualcomm currently rank in the top 75 debt issuing companies in the US.Advisers to Broadcom will be closely watching how the CVS Health debt sale is received.“For the broader part of this decade, credit markets have been open for business,” said Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager with Thornburg Investment Management. He added that even during market “hiccups”, debt sales had continued undeterred. AB InBev priced its $46bn bond sale amid market turmoil at the start of 2016.However the CVS Health sale goes, Broadcom would still need to pay up, bondholders say. Benchmark Treasury yields have risen more than 50 basis points since the company, led by Hock Tan, first publicly proposed a takeover of Qualcomm, which is itself in the process of buying NXP, a Dutch group, for $44bn. And to shift billions of dollars of debt in a single swoop, the company will probably have to offer concessions to investors. Verizon agreed to pay investors an extra 57bp on top of what 10-year US government bonds were yielding to get its 2013 sale away.Of paramount concern to many bondholders scrutinising the potential transaction is Broadcom’s ability to hold on to investment grade ratings from the major credit rating agencies. “The only way they [Broadcom] can get it done is funded in the investment grade market,” said Todd Schomberg, senior portfolio manager at Invesco. “Leverage would jump up quite dramatically but they would give a commitment to the rating agencies to de-lever over time.”Rating agency Moody’s warned in November that a deal could result in a “multiple” notch cut to Qualcomm’s A1 rating. By contrast, it rates Broadcom Baa2, two levels above junk. Two investors who spoke with the FT estimated the combined company would have debts of more than five times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation at the time a deal closes.“Investors are looking at companies and saying, OK, prestige credit quality may have improved for those companies that had cash trapped overseas,” said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. But “if a company is at risk of being high yield, they may not want to own that issue. It limits the pool of potential investors buying into that deal.”If Broadcom can steer its proposed acquisition around regulatory and security obstacles, a financing challenge awaits.

It did not stop the US blocking Ant Financial’s attempt to buy MoneyGram. And it has not stopped the Committee on Foreign Investment intervening in the attempted $142bn purchase of Qualcomm by Broadcom.Hock Tan seemed to have spiked these guns. In November Broadcom’s boss appeared alongside President Donald Trump (regrettably sans “Make America Great Again” hat) to announce the chipmaker was moving from Singapore to the US. Redomiciling, whatever the attraction of Mr Trump’s policies, seemed to have the benefit of circumventing Cfius. How could the powerful committee block a deal when the acquirer is not “foreign” after all? Lawyers struggle to summon a precedent for an acquirer pulling off this manoeuvre. They also struggle to see why it would not work. That may still be the right call. Cfius has not vetoed the deal; it has just told Qualcomm to delay its annual meeting, where Broadcom had put up a slate of directors for election in an attempt to force its target to the negotiating table.Officials — egged on, in Broadcom’s framing, by dastardly machinations from Qualcomm — decided the group could have slipped into Broadcom’s control via the director fight and held an extraordinary review. Interesting that though Broadcom’s redomicile is under way, it is not complete. For now, the chipmaker is still a foreign entity. If this is how the bid founders, Qualcomm will have some restive investors. Its shares fell 1 per cent on the news and there is now a 20 per cent discount to the offer price, which, it seems clear, was not the final bid. A failed offer would also mark a new level of interventionism by the US government. Can the Trump administration celebrate Mr Tan’s love for America in the Oval Office and then treat his company as a dubious foreign entity four months later? Apparently.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of this development in the comments section below."
100;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-05T18:10:28Z;US national security regulator delays Qualcomm vote;Treasury orders delay to shareholder meeting to allow bid to be investigated by Cfius;The US government has ordered chipmaker Qualcomm to delay an upcoming shareholder meeting by 30 days as it investigates whether a proposed takeover by Singapore-based rival Broadcom would put national security at risk.The unprecedented public intervention comes as the US company’s shareholders were set to vote on Tuesday on whether to replace six of its directors with candidates put forward by Broadcom, which is seeking to force through a $142bn takeover— the biggest tech deal to date.The US Treasury department, which leads an inter-agency regulator called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, said that a 30-day delay of the vote “will afford Cfius the ability to investigate fully Broadcom’s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm”.The delay is the latest escalation in a tensely fought hostile takeover battle, as Qualcomm’s management look to maintain the company’s independence.The move highlights Washington’s determination to use its political clout to review and potentially challenge deals that could transfer US technology to a foreign company.“What happened today is absolutely unprecedented,” said a Washington-based lawyer who has worked on Cfius-related cases for more than 20 years. “For the government to delay a crucial shareholder vote so that they can look into the case more deeply shows the extent of their concern about this deal.”US lawmakers are worried about Broadcom’s longstanding relationship with Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker that the US government has warned poses a national security risk. Qualcomm and Huawei are going head to head in the development of chipsets for new generation 5G devices.Broadcom said it was “disappointed” by the decision. It added: “Broadcom was informed on Sunday night that on January 29, Qualcomm secretly filed a voluntary request with Cfius to initiate an investigation, resulting in a delay of Qualcomm’s annual meeting 48 hours before it was to take place.“This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees.”Qualcomm said that it would comply with the government’s request and delay the shareholder meeting by at least 30 days as it accused Broadcom of misleading investors and the general public by ignoring serious regulatory and national security issues.It added: “Broadcom’s dismissive rhetoric notwithstanding, this is a very serious matter . . . Broadcom’s claims that the Cfius inquiry was a surprise to them has no basis in fact.”Although Cfius’s action is unusual, it is within the multi-agency group’s authority to intervene, especially given Qualcomm’s presence in the semiconductor industry. US officials have long seen the sector as strategic and have been eager to protect from foreign ownership.Any company that receives an unsolicited bid has the right to ask Cfius to review the proposed deal before they agree to it, to discover whether the transaction poses any national security risks.In recent weeks, US lawmakers have become more vocal with their concerns about any potential takeover.Some have urged the Trump administration to open an investigation into the bid, arguing that it would be “deeply concerning” if a foreign company took control of a US group through a proxy fight without first gaining the approval of the Cfius.Broadcom was previously a US-based company but redomiciled to Singapore to gain tax benefits following a takeover in 2015. Hock Tan, its chief executive, went to the White House last November to publicly announce its plans to move back to the US.Broadcom has argued that its takeover bid should not be scrutinised by Cfius because it will have finished reincorporating in the US by the end of its fiscal second quarter, which is May 6. At that point, it says, the deal would not be a foreign takeover.The bid has also raised data protection concerns among European lawmakers, who fear that Broadcom could gain control of sensitive data on EU citizens.Additional reporting by Shawn Donnan in Washington and Nic Fildes in London

At that point, it says, the deal would not be a foreign takeover.Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm raised data protection concerns among European lawmakers as they fear the Singapore-based chipmaker could gain control of sensitive EU citizens’ data.
102;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-02T05:42:07Z;Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm sparks unease in Europe;Officials uncomfortable with Singapore-based group controlling sensitive EU data;Broadcom’s $142bn hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm is raising data protection concerns among European lawmakers as they fear the Singapore-based chipmaker could gain control of sensitive EU citizen data.Qualcomm recently secured a $44bn agreement to buy NXP, a Dutch group that makes chips for German passports, and European officials are uncomfortable with Broadcom having access to such information. “We are concerned about the possibility of a European company handling sensitive data of EU citizens falling in the hands of a company that is based in Singapore, where data protection standards are lower than in the EU,” Josef Weidenholzer, vice-president of the S&D, the second-largest party in the European Parliament, told the Financial Times.This comes days after US lawmakers urged the Trump administration to open an investigation into Broadcom’s bid as they argued that it would be “deeply concerning” if a foreign company took control of a US group through a proxy fight without first gaining the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.Broadcom said earlier this week that its takeover of Qualcomm, which would be the largest tech deal ever, should not be scrutinised by Cfius as “Broadcom is committed to reincorporating from Singapore to the US, and expects to receive the required approvals to do so by the end of Broadcom’s fiscal second quarter.”Qualcomm made a range of assurances regarding the plant in Hamburg that were very positive. There were no such signals from Broadcom and that has raised concernsA person close to Broadcom said the chipmaker is ready to work closely with European authorities to protect the data and privacy of EU citizens. Political pressure against Broadcom’s bid on both sides of the Atlantic comes ahead of a critical Qualcomm shareholder meeting on March 6, when investors of the San Diego-based company will vote on a slate of six out of 11 directors nominated by the Singapore-based group.Broadcom’s potential takeover of NXP also has a number of German politicians on edge about the future of NXP’s plant in Hamburg, given the Singaporean company’s reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, including laying off workers and stripping research and development. Niels Annen, a Social Democrat member of parliament from Hamburg, said: “Qualcomm made a range of assurances regarding the plant in Hamburg that were very positive. There were no such signals from Broadcom and that has raised concerns.”Although the vote is likely to be very close, several stockbrokers buying and selling shares on behalf of large investors said the tide is shifting in favour of Qualcomm’s management, which is opposed to Broadcom’s board changes and existing takeover proposal. Parnassus Endeavor Fund, a top-30 investor in Qualcomm, said it would vote in favour of the current board and against the slate of six out of 11 directors proposed by Broadcom. “The current Qualcomm board is committed to getting a higher price or staying independent, and we agree that Qualcomm’s stock is worth much more,” said Jerome Dodson, Parnassus portfolio manager.Several Qualcomm shareholders are concerned that if Broadcom’s nominees take control of its board they could force the company to agree to a deal that is not in the best interest of investors. While the public vow of support by a major shareholder is a strong vote of confidence for Qualcomm’s management, other investors are more open to voting in some of Broadcom’s nominees to bring new points of view to the board.Earlier this week Qualcomm said it was open to engage further with Broadcom on a higher price than its current “best and final offer” of $79 per share, valuing the company at $142bn, including $25bn in net debt.

103;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-03-02T02:21:39Z;Qualcomm gets top investor’s backing to reject Broadcom bid;;Qualcomm has secured the backing of a top investor for rejecting Broadcom’s $142bn hostile takeover bid just days days before a crucial shareholder vote. Parnassus Endeavor Fund, a top-30 investor in Qualcomm, said it would vote in favour of the current board at the San Diego-based company and against the slate of six out of 11 directors proposed by the Singapore-headquartered rival.The public vow of support of a major shareholder is a big win for Qualcomm and strong vote of confidence for its management, vindicating its decision to fight for a higher offer from Broadcom.“The current Qualcomm Board is committed to getting a higher price or staying independent, and we agree that Qualcomm’s stock is worth much more,” said Jerome Dodson, portfolio manager of the Parnassus Endeavor Fund.Last month Broadcom offered to pay Qualcomm shareholders $82 per share, valuing the US company as much as $146bn, including debt, in a “best and final” offer. Broadcom later cut that price to $142bn after Qualcomm agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductor for $44bn.Qualcomm’s board rebuffed both offers arguing that they undervalued the company, which makes chips for Apple’s iPhone and is a market leader in 5G wireless technology. This week Qualcomm said that it was open to considering a deal but the price remained a sticking point. Broadcom has refused to increase its bid and has opted to wait for the shareholder meeting, with the hope of taking control of the board.A deal, which would be the largest ever in the tech sector, would face mounting regulatory scrutiny on the antitrust and national security fronts.The risk of the deal getting stalled by regulators is a matter concerning many shareholders. “The proposed merger has also raised regulatory concerns, such as anti-trust and national security issues, and we think the current Qualcomm board is better able to deal with these issues than a Broadcom-backed board,” said Mr Dodson of Parnassus.Broadcom has said that it is confident to get the deal approved and that the transaction would not face national security scrutiny as the Singapore company plans to relocate to the US.
104;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-28T17:42:38Z;Arm Holdings CEO predicts doubling of sales in by 2022;Segars confident that consolidation in chip sector will not hit growth;The chief executive of chip designer Arm Holdings has shrugged off concerns that it could be hurt by consolidation in the semiconductor industry, and expects the number of chips built on its designs to increase sharply to reach 100bn over the next four years.Broadcom and Qualcomm, two of Arm’s largest customers, have been engaged in a long-running takeover battle with the latter indicating this week that it would be willing to sell if its rival increased its offer to $160bn including debt.Simon Segars, the head of Arm which is owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said he does not expect such mergers among his company’s customer base to hit growth. “What does this mean for us? Fewer semiconductor companies, but larger semiconductor companies,” he told the Financial Times at the Mobile World Congress. “It is an expensive game and you need a lot of scale. The sophistication [of chips] is very high and the volume of chips is not going down.”Arm designs have underpinned sales of 50bn chips in the past four years and Mr Segars expects that rate to double with the arrival of 5G, the next generation of mobile network that will enable more devices to connect to the internet. Even in the smartphone market, where sales fell for the first time last year, Mr Segars expects Arm see more of its technology is used in chips to improve the most expensive devices.The company demonstrated a car at Mobile World Congress that could recognise a specific handset when a driver approaches the vehicle and set the seat and radio station accordingly. Arm believes that sort of technology is “relatively simple” and the type of advance that it will need to keep ahead as 5G becomes more pervasive. SoftBank paid £24.3bn for Arm, the UK’s largest technology company, in 2016 and has funded five small acquisitions and a 25 per cent rise in staff numbers to 5,700 since the deal closed, according to Mr Segars.He said the Japanese company, led by Masayoshi Son, has provided Arm with more “raw resources” than it had as a listed business and has left the entity to operate independently.“Masa is keen on synergies between SoftBank entities — Arm and Sprint [the US telecoms company] for example — but it is not as though we all have to buy toilet paper from the same supplier,” Mr Segars said. 
105;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;US lawmakers call for review of Broadcom bid for Qualcomm;Mnuchin urged to examine ‘deeply concerning’ takeover attempt by Singapore chipmaker;Broadcom has come under scrutiny from US lawmakers as it tries to clinch a takeover of rival Qualcomm, with pressure mounting for a US government panel to open an investigation into the potential transaction.John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, called on the Committee of Foreign Investment in the US to “promptly review” Broadcom’s proposal before a critical March 6 meeting of Qualcomm shareholders, when they will vote on a slate of directors nominated by the Singapore-based group.In a letter to Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday seen by the Financial Times, Mr Cornyn wrote that it would be “deeply concerning” if a foreign company could take control of a US group through a proxy fight without first gaining Cfius approval.Broadcom has sought to oust a majority of Qualcomm’s 11-person board at the company’s annual meeting next week, which could tip the balance for its $142bn proposed deal in the group’s favour.While Qualcomm this week said the two sides had made some progress on a deal, it found the price tag too low. Qualcomm is willing to agree to a deal that values the company at more than $160bn, according to people involved in the negotiations.Mr Cornyn also drew a line to Huawei — the telecoms equipment maker that US government agencies have warned poses a national security risk — writing that divestitures in a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would likely let the Chinese company “win the race” for 5G technology, the next generation network standard.Any disruption in Qualcomm’s business as a result of the hostile takeover could have the effect of significantly disadvantaging the United States, and on that basis alone, Cfius should evaluate whether prospective control of Qualcomm by Broadcom raises any risks to US national security“Any disruption in Qualcomm’s business as a result of the hostile takeover could have the effect of significantly disadvantaging the United States, and on that basis alone, Cfius should evaluate whether prospective control of Qualcomm by Broadcom raises any risks to US national security,” he said.Reuters on Monday reported that Cfius had met last month to discuss the possible deal between Broadcom and Qualcomm, and has been in touch with at least one of the companies.A Broadcom spokesperson said: “Cfius is not implicated unless a corporation comes under the ‘control’ of a foreign person. As Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan announced from the Oval Office last November, Broadcom is committed to reincorporating from Singapore to the US, and expects to receive the required approvals to do so by the end of Broadcom’s fiscal second quarter.”Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The call from senator Cornyn followed a letter to US President Donald Trump from congressman Duncan Hunter, who called on the White House to block a hostile takeover of Qualcomm. There have been growing bipartisan concerns in Washington over the need to protect the US’s high-tech industry from foreign investors, particularly from China.Mr Cornyn is leading efforts, backed by the Trump administration, to give Cfius greater powers to review inbound investments in tech start-ups as well as outbound investments by US companies into countries like China where they are often forced to enter joint ventures with local partners and share proprietary technologies.US authorities have long been sensitive to foreign investments in chip manufacturers and any deal — even one involving a US ally like Singapore — was always likely to attract the scrutiny of Cfius, an inter-agency panel that reviews investments for national security reasons.Cfius last week rejected a $580m deal for Massachusetts-based semiconductor testing company Xcerra by a Chinese state-backed fund.Cfius experts say whether the committee has jurisdiction may come into question. The inter-agency committee, chaired by secretary Mnuchin, only has jurisdiction over deals involving foreign investments in the US. But the Singapore-owned chipmaker is in the process of moving its headquarters back to the US with chief executive Tan joining Mr Trump in the Oval Office last November to announce the move just days before launching his bid for Qualcomm.That move was seen by analysts as a way to avoid potential political objections.Broadcom also won US antitrust approval last November for its $5.9bn takeover of Brocade, a US network gear supplier.
106;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Qualcomm open to Broadcom bid but seeks $160bn price tag;Change in chipmaker’s stance marks big shift in negotiations over tech deal;Qualcomm has dropped its objections to being acquired by Singapore’s Broadcom and is willing to agree a deal with its rival chipmaker if it raises its takeover offer to $160bn including debt, according to people involved in the negotiations. The shift in stance marks a significant change for Qualcomm executives, who had been objecting to the deal on antitrust grounds. People close to Qualcomm said Broadcom has recently made enough progress in addressing the competition issues to allow the talks to shift to reaching an agreed price. Qualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 per cent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid, to reach what would be the biggest tech deal ever struck, people involved in the talks said. The total $160bn price tag would include Broadcom assuming $25bn in Qualcomm debt.Several people close to Qualcomm’s senior management said the company is now willing to close the deal, but the takeover was in the hands of Hock Tan, Broadcom’s deal-hungry chief executive. He must decide whether to reverse course and raise his offer price. The narrowing of differences between the two chipmaking giants comes as Qualcomm agreed on Monday to open its books to Broadcom in an attempt to bring the two closer together on agreeing a price. It publicly reiterated that the existing $79 per share offer undervalued the company. Paul Jacobs, chairman of Qualcomm, said in a letter to Mr Tan, made public on Monday, that his team was interested in pursuing a non-disclosure agreement that would allow the two sides to begin due diligence. Mr Jacobs also proposed that the chipmakers arrange a meeting “as soon as mutually convenient” to negotiate a price. However, Broadcom dismissed the move as “engagement theatre”. In a statement, the company said: “Broadcom does not believe that the process outlined by Qualcomm today is designed to lead to a prompt agreement”. However, it added that it was prepared to negotiate on terms that were “realistic for both parties”.Earlier this month Broadcom offered as much as $146bn, including debt, in a “best and final” offer, a figure that was rebuffed by Qualcomm’s board of directors. Broadcom later cut that price to $142bn after Qualcomm agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductor for $44bn.In the midst of the takeover battle, Qualcomm has sought to show it is still operating as normal in areas such as 5G, striking deals in China for the next-generation wireless technology. It also pressed ahead with a deal for NXP, a Dutch group that specialises in providing chips for automobiles.On Monday, Mr Jacobs said that a meeting between the two companies, held on Friday, had led to “further progress” on a deal that would likely face significant regulatory hurdles.The San Diego-based company sought an increase in the termination fee to 9 per cent of the transaction’s enterprise value, payable by Broadcom if a deal were to be blocked by regulators. At the existing offer of $142bn, that would represent roughly $13bn. Broadcom had previously proposed a breakage fee of $8bn.Qualcomm also said it would not require Broadcom to sign a “hell or high water” clause. This would have forced the buyer to commit to closing the deal no matter what remedies are demanded from regulators.“The path forward . . . provides the appropriate level of protection to Qualcomm stockholders commensurate with the high degree of regulatory risk associated with this potential transaction,” Mr Jacobs wrote. “If acceptable to Broadcom, this would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.”After Mr Jacobs published his letter, Qualcomm shares rose more than 4 per cent to $65.88.Mr Jacobs’s letter comes days before Qualcomm shareholders will vote on a slate of new directors nominated by Broadcom for the US chipmaker’s board.
107;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-26T17:35:27Z;Broadcom calls latest Qualcomm offer a ‘disingenuous process’;;Broadcom hit back against an offer by rival chipmaker Qualcomm on Monday to open its books and begin due diligence that could lead to a potential deal between the two, calling it a “disingenuous process” and saying that it did not believe it was “designed to lead to a prompt agreement”.The Singapore-based group said that at a meeting on Friday, Qualcomm refused to confirm that it would hold its annual meeting as previously scheduled for March 6. Broadcom has proposed a slate of nominees for Qualcomm’s board as it has sought to win support for its $142bn takeover.“Broadcom’s proposal has never been conditioned on due diligence and Broadcom continues to be prepared to move forward immediately, without diligence,” the company said in a statement.It added: “If the current Qualcomm board remains unwilling to genuinely engage — and continues with ‘engagement theater’ on this basis — Broadcom looks forward to negotiating in good faith with the newly-elected Qualcomm board following the Qualcomm annual meeting on March 6.”

At $142bn, that would represent roughly $13bn.Broadcom had previously proposed a breakage fee of $8bn.“The path forward . . . provides the appropriate level of protection to Qualcomm stockholders commensurate with the high degree of regulatory risk associated with this potential transaction,” Mr Jacobs wrote. “If acceptable to Broadcom, this would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.”Qualcomm shares rose nearly 3 per cent in pre-market trading to $65.
109;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Qualcomm says Broadcom ‘made an inadequate offer even worse’;;Qualcomm has fired back at Broadcom’s latest proposal, saying that its rival chipmaker’s reduced bid “makes an inadequate offer even worse” in the wake of Qualcomm’s new deal for Dutch company NXP Semiconductors.Qualcomm said on Wednesday afternoon:“The Qualcomm Board is committed to maximising value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether that be through executing its growth strategy or selling the company. Broadcom’s revised $79.00 per share proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm, fails to take into account the strategic and financial benefits of acquiring NXP, and continues to face a long and highly uncertain path to regulatory approvals.”Earlier in the day, Broadcom cuts its offer for the San-Diego based company by $4.5bn in an attempt to win support ahead of a shareholder vote on March 6 that could pave the way for the acquisition.Broadcom had said it remained “fully committed” to purchasing Qualcomm but that the US company’s $44bn deal for NXP would transfer more than $6bn to shareholders of the Dutch group.Qualcomm shares are 0.92 per cent lower in afternoon trading at $63.40, while Singapore-based Broadcom is up 0.67 per cent to $251.29.
110;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-21T18:10:05Z;Broadcom lowers offer price for Qualcomm by $4.5bn;Company accuses rival’s board of acting ‘against best interest of its stockholders’;Broadcom has lowered its offer for Qualcomm, in the latest twist in a long-running hostile takeover battle between the rival chipmakers that would be the largest technology deal in history.A day after Qualcomm raised its bid by 16 per cent for Dutch group NXP Semiconductor, Broadcom reduced its offer for the San Diego-based company by $4.5bn in an attempt to win support ahead of a shareholder vote on March 6 that could pave the way to the acquisition.Broadcom said it remained “fully committed” to purchasing Qualcomm but that the US company’s $44bn deal for NXP would transfer more than $6bn to shareholders of the Dutch group.As a result, it lowered its offer to $79 a share from a “ best and final” proposal made earlier this month of $82 per share. The revised bid values Qualcomm at about $142bn, including some $25bn of debt that Broadcom would assume if a deal was successful.“Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders,” said Broadcom in a statement. It added that a “responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value” by following the recommendation of Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy adviser that urged it to a negotiate a deal with its rival.Qualcomm fired back, defending the NXP deal. “Broadcom’s reduced proposal has made an inadequate offer even worse,” it said, “despite the clear increase in value to Qualcomm stockholders from providing certainty around the NXP acquisition.”Broadcom is pushing shareholders to vote for six new members for Qualcomm’s 11 person board. Last week, ISS and Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory group, urged Qualcomm to engage with Broadcom in the best interest of its investors.Instead of engaging with its rival, Qualcomm decided to bump its bid for NXP, hoping a higher offer would seal the longstanding deal and bolster its own defences against Broadcom.Christopher Rolland, a senior analyst with Susquehanna Investment Group, said the reduced Broadcom bid “decreases the chance of a deal coming together in my opinion, but it’s not fully off the table yet”.“The key to this whole thing right now is whether Broadcom will get six board seats or not,” he added.Mr Rolland said that Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan was “fairly pragmatic” and believed Qualcomm was “well aware” that a lower offer was possible if it paid a higher price for Dutch group NXP.The chipmaker increased its bid for NXP earlier this week to win over shareholders, including hedge funds Elliott Management and Soroban Capital. It is still awaiting regulatory clearance in China.Broadcom said the rest of its proposal to take over Qualcomm remained unchanged and that it would still offer to pay an $8bn break fee if the deal fails to win approval from regulators. It added that it would increase its offer back to $82 a share if Qualcomm does not complete its acquisition of NXP.Shares in Qualcomm fell 1 per cent on Wednesday to $63.28, while Broadcom was roughly 0.3 per cent lower at $248.78.
111;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm/Broadcom: slumpitrage;It will take shareholder pressure to get a deal done now  ;It is not the typical pattern of negotiations: “Will you accept $82 for it?” “No way!” “How about $79 then?” But this is the unorthodox gambit of Hock Tan, chief executive of Broadcom, in his pursuit of Qualcomm, a rival semiconductor company.The rationale is straightforward: against Broadcom’s wishes, Qualcomm had bowed to the demands of hedge funds and raised its bid for NXP, another chipmaker, by about $6bn. Broadcom has therefore chopped from its own offer $3 a share, or about $4bn, to account for the “excessive value” transferred to NXP shareholders. If the NXP deal founders at this late stage, Broadcom promises to revise its bid back up to $82.In this gruelling campaign — a rare hostile bid that would also be the largest ever technology acquisition — this move is not decisive. Qualcomm had always been in a tough spot on NXP. Cynics can argue it is tossing away cash as a poison pill to Broadcom. But NXP investors led by Elliott Management had a commanding position for “bumpitrage” and the higher price for the Dutch chipmaker is still inexpensive. Even if Broadcom had never showed up, Qualcomm would have had to improve its offer.Having consistently warned Qualcomm not to raise its NXP bid, Broadcom had to react somehow. Short of pulling out entirely, the reduction is provocative but not barmy. A higher price is still reachable via talks.There are none, however. This looks unlikely to change before an annual meeting next month when Broadcom is looking to install its own directors at Qualcomm. There is not only the downer of a lower bid but also Qualcomm’s lead director saying this week that the original $82 was “not in the ballpark”. For a company whose stock last closed at that level in 1999 in the dotcom bubble era, that is absurd. A change is likely to come after the March 6 meeting, when Broadcom has a good shot at electing at least some of its proposed directors. Then the negotiations can get on to a more normal track.Sign up to Lex’s new midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters. 
112;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-21T14:07:30Z;Broadcom lowers Qualcomm offer after new NXP deal;Revised bid comes after Qualcomm upped its offer for NXP;Broadcom is not giving up on its efforts to buy rival US chipmaker Qualcomm, trimming its offer but also pledging to add back to it if Qualcomm’s own efforts to buy Dutch company NXP Semiconductors fall through.Broadcom said on Wednesday said that in light of Qualcomm’s higher bid for NXP, it is now prepared to offer Qualcomm shareholders a total of $79 a share. Its previous “best and final offer” for Qualcomm was $82 a share, from the initial $70 a deal Qualcomm shareholders were offered in November.Qualcomm has said it would be open to new discussions with Broadcom that reflect its “true value”, but it has rebuffed the series of offers, arguing they are too low and did not compensate for regulatory risks that could yet derail the massive tech tie-up.The latest proposed deal would be sweetened by $3 cash per Qualcomm share if Qualcomm fails to seal the deal for NXP, according to a statement. The rest of the terms of the proposed deal remain unchanged, including an $8bn reverse termination fee that Broadcom would pay Qualcomm if the deal does not receive regulatory approval.The move comes after Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy adviser, said that the US company should negotiate a deal with Broadcom and called into question the company’s current business model.Broadcom said in the statement:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders.Despite this direct value transfer, Broadcom remains committed to delivering a value-maximising offer to Qualcomm stockholders.Qualcomm shares are down about 0.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
113;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-20T13:44:23Z;Qualcomm agrees $44bn deal for Dutch chipmaker NXP;Move seen as effort to bolster defences against hostile takeover from Broadcom;US chipmaker Qualcomm has bowed to investor pressure and raised its bid for NXP Semiconductors, hoping a new $44bn offer to buy the Dutch company will seal the longstanding deal and bolster its own defences against a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom.After months of pressure from hedge funds including Elliott Management to up its offer, Qualcomm agreed to increase its bid to $127.5 per NXP share, a bump of 16 per cent from the initial price of $110 per share proposed in October 2016.Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it entered into a binding agreement with nine NXP shareholders, including Elliott and hedge fund Soroban Capital, which collectively hold more than 28 per cent of the group and have agreed to tender their shares at the new price. It also reduced the acceptance threshold for its bid to just 70 per cent of NXP’s investor base from 80 per cent and set a deadline for investors of March 5.The company has pursued NXP as part of an effort to diversify its business away from smartphones and into other areas, such as supplying the automotive and security sectors. Qualcomm said it had agreed to finance the increased bid with cash on hand and new debt.Steve Mollenkopf, the US company’s chief executive, said: “With only one regulatory approval remaining, we are working hard to complete this transaction expeditiously.” The deal is still awaiting approval from Chinese authorities.The agreement marks a significant victory for hedge funds in their efforts to squeeze more money out of Qualcomm, as well as for UBS, which worked with Elliott in a rare example of an international investment bank teaming up with an activist investor against a corporation.By agreeing a new deal with NXP, Qualcomm is also complicating the plans of Broadcom, the Singapore chipmaker that has been trying for months to force its US rival to engage in takeover discussions over its $146bn bid for the company. If it were successful in acquiring Qualcomm, Broadcom has said it would not follow through on a deal for NXP at a price of more than $110 per share.However, a person close to Broadcom’s senior management said Qualcomm’s higher offer for NXP would not lead them to walk away from their existing pursuit of the San Diego company.“It is frustrating but it doesn’t end things,” said a person close to Hock Tan, Broadcom chief executive.Tom Horton, a Qualcomm board member, said: “If we don’t do Broadcom, we’ve just made Qualcomm more valuable. If we do decide to go down the Broadcom track, it just makes the company that much more valuable, which strengthens our hand in those negotiations. It was a no-brainer.”Shares in US-listed NXP were up more than 6 per cent by early afternoon to $125.70, while Qualcomm shares were down 2.3 per cent to $63.36.Broadcom has offered Qualcomm an $8bn break fee, one of the largest in dealmaking history, if the transaction is agreed and then blocked by competition authorities. It is also attempting to overthrow a majority of Qualcomm’s board next month at a shareholder meeting.Qualcomm’s new agreement with NXP comes as Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy adviser, said that the US company should negotiate a deal with Broadcom and called into question the company’s current business model.However, ISS advised Qualcomm shareholders to elect only four out of the 11 Broadcom nominees to its board, less than the majority needed by the Singaporean rival to force a deal.“The election of four Broadcom nominees to the 11-member board seems to offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal, which is likely to be the most beneficial path for shareholders,” ISS said.It added: “Qualcomm’s optimistic vision of the future would likely resonate more effectively among shareholders if the company’s record was more like that of its would-be acquirer.”

The company also reduced the acceptance threshold for its bid to just 70 per cent of NXP’s investor base.The move to boost the NXP offer also aims to derail Broadcom’s hostile $146bn takeover attempt of Qualcomm, which is trying to overthrow the board of the San Diego-based company.The Singapore-based company’s pursuit has been complicated by Qualcomm’s existing NXP takeover plans. Broadcom has stated that it would not follow through on a deal for NXP if it was successful in securing a deal to buy Qualcomm at a price of more than $110 per share.Qualcomm has pursued NXP as part of a bid to diversify its business, which is dependent on smartphones, while its target is heavily focused on the automotive sector. Qualcomm said it had agreed to finance the increased bid with cash on hand and new debt.Qualcomm’s new agreement with NXP comes as influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said that the San Diego-based company should negotiate a deal with Broadcom and has called into question the company’s current business model.After refusing to engage with Broadcom over its offers, Qualcomm’s chairman met with Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan last week. However, the meeting ended with Qualcomm continuing to reject Broadcom’s offer, citing fears that a deal would be blocked by antitrust regulators. Broadcom has offered Qualcomm $8bn, one of the largest break-fees in dealmaking history, if it is agreed and then blocked by competition authorities.

The meeting between the two semiconductor companies comes a month before Qualcomm’s annual meeting, when shareholders will vote on a Broadcom-backed proposal to replace six of the 11 members of the company’s board.Broadcom has offered to pay Qualcomm $8bn if regulators block the deal, and has lined up as much as $100bn in debt financing to pay for the acquisition.“Our board is highly cognisant of the need to protect Qualcomm’s stockholders from the considerable risks of agreeing to a transaction that does not close,” Mr Jacobs wrote. “A break-up fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks.”Shares of Qualcomm were little changed on Friday at $65.18, while Broadcom shares declined 1 per cent to $249.12.

117;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-12T12:47:31Z;Broadcom lines up $100bn funding for Qualcomm bid;;Broadcom said on Monday that it has lined as much as $100bn in debt financing to fund its $146bn hostile bid for Qualcomm, putting further pressure on its rival ahead of the two companies’ meeting this week.A group of 12 banks have agreed to provide Broadcom with up to $100bn in credit facilities, including a $5bn revolving credit facility and bridge financing.Private equity groups Silver Lake, KKR and CVC have also joined in, with an agreement to provide $6bn of convertible debt for the deal and post-closing working needs.News of the financing comes as the two companies are prepared to meet for the first time this week to discuss Broadcom’s sweetened $82 per share proposal.Qualcomm’s decision to give Hock Tan, the acquisitive chief executive of Broadcom, a chance to make the case for a combination is the first indication that the San Diego-based company could be open to a possible deal.The sticking point is whether Mr Tan can convincingly reassure Qualcomm’s board that a combination to create a semiconductor juggernaut would win regulatory approval.In a bid to assuage Qualcomm’s concern, Broadcom is offering to pay an $8bn break-up fee if the deal fails to win regulatory approval.Qualcomm shareholders will meet on March 6 to vote on a Broadcom-backed proposal to unseat and replace the entire board of the US chipmaker, which would pave the way to a deal if the proposal is successful.

The $8bn fee represents about 6.6 per cent of the deal’s $121bn equity value, higher than typical break-up fees which are usually less than 5 per cent.Qualcomm’s decision to give Hock Tan, the acquisitive chief executive of Broadcom, a chance to make the case for a combination is the first indication that the San Diego-based company could be open to a possible deal.The sticking point is whether Mr Tan can convincingly reassure Qualcomm’s board that a combination to create a semiconductor juggernaut would win regulatory approval.In a letter on Thursday to Mr Tan, Paul Jacobs, chairman of Qualcomm’s board, said that “if Qualcomm entered into a merger agreement and, after an extended regulatory review period the transaction did not close, Qualcomm would be enormously and irreparably damaged”.People close to Qualcomm said that the higher than usual break-up fee would not be sufficient for the US company to enter an agreement.“We would be prepared to meet with you to allow you to explain how you would attempt to bridge these gaps in both value and deal certainty and to better understand the significant issues that remain unaddressed in your proposal,” Mr Jacobs wrote.Qualcomm’s soft rejection is the latest twist in the months-long drama that kicked off when Broadcom submitted an unsolicited takeover bid for the company, which Qualcomm subsequently rejected as undervaluing it.On Monday, Broadcom came back with a sweeter deal, boosting its offer about 17 per cent to roughly $146bn, including $25bn in debt, in an attempt to deliver a knockout blow.The bid represents a 54 per cent premium to Qualcomm’s average stock price in the 30 days before the bid. The new proposal also included an undisclosed “ticking fee” for Qualcomm investors if the deal is not closed within a year of its announcement.Qualcomm shareholders will meet on March 6 to vote on a Broadcom-backed proposal to unseat and replace the entire board of the US chipmaker, which would pave the way to a deal if the proposal is successful.
119;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-09T14:40:54Z;Broadcom offers Qualcomm $8bn reverse termination fee;;After Qualcomm’s board unanimously rejected Broadcom’s revised $82-a-share takeover offer, Broadcom is sweetening the pot with an offer to pay its rival chipmaker an $8bn break-up fee if the deal fails to win regulatory approval.The offer was made in a letter from Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan to Qualcomm’s executive chairman, Paul Jacobs, released on Friday. While reiterating that $82 a share was its “best and final offer”, Mr Tan said that the proposed merger agreement would be revised to add the $8bn fee as well as a 6 per cent per year regulatory ticking fee on the cash portion of the consideration, net of dividends.The $8bn fee represents about 6.6 per cent of the deal’s $121bn equity value.Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s first unsolicited takeover bid last year, claiming that the offer had undervalued it.The Singapore-based company came back with the revised offer earlier this week, which was unanimously rejected by Qualcomm’s board, according to a statement on Thursday. But Qualcomm created a narrow opening for what would be the largest technology deal in history, saying it was prepared to meet with Broadcom’s chief executive to “address the serious deficiencies” in the proposal.A key sticking point has been whether Mr Tan can convincingly reassure Qualcomm’s board that a combination would win regulatory approval.But Broadcom said the latest proposed agreement was “highly favourable to Qualcomm and its stockholders.” Mr Tan said he looked forward to discussing the matter with Qualcomm “promptly” and offered to meet as early as this weekend.
120;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-08T21:24:05Z;Qualcomm rebuffs revised Broadcom bid;;The second time might not be a charm for Broadcom. The company’s revised $146bn bid for Qualcomm was rejected unanimously by the rival chipmaker’s board.Qualcomm said Thursday that its board “determined that the Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm and falls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the Board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.”But the San Diego-based company added that it had not closed the door altogether, saying that it had offered to meet Singapore-based Broadcom “to see if it can address the serious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.”The rejection is the latest twist in the months-long drama that kicked off when Broadcom submitted an unsolicited takeover bid for the company, which Qualcomm subsequently rejected as undervaluing it. Earlier this week, Broadcom came back with a sweeter deal, boosting its offer about 17 per cent to roughly $146bn, including $25bn in debt, in an attempt to deliver a knockout blow.
121;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Broadcom raises Qualcomm bid to $146bn;New offer for rival chipmaker includes significant break-up fee;Broadcom has boosted its offer for rival chipmaker Qualcomm to about $146bn ahead of a key shareholder showdown that will decide the tech industry’s biggest-ever takeover attempt.The Singapore-based chipmaker raised the value of its unsolicited bid by 17 per cent, including $25bn in debt, in an attempt to deliver a knockout blow and win support from Qualcomm shareholders ahead of a de facto referendum early next month.The new offer will ignite what is expected to be one of the most bitterly fought hostile takeover fights in recent mergers and acquisition history. Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s lower offer, and people close to the company have said the company is unlikely to be impressed by the higher bid. However, they admitted the new offer would put Qualcomm’s board under pressure to at least start talks with Broadcom. The combination would create a semiconductor juggernaut positioned as a market leader in everything from the production of chips for mobile phones to next-generation electric vehicles.Under Broadcom’s “best and final” offer, Qualcomm shareholders will receive $82 a share — $60 in cash and the remainder in stock — compared to the $70-per-share deal they were offered in November. The bid represents a 54 per cent premium to Qualcomm’s average stock price 30 days before the bid.Qualcomm shares were down 2.6 per cent in late-morning trading, while Broadcom stock was up more than 3 per cent.The new proposal also included an undisclosed “ticking fee” for Qualcomm investors if the deal is not closed within a year of its announcement. Broadcom added that it would pay a significant termination fee, without specifying the amount. Both moves were designed to reassure investors that the combination would win regulatory approval.Qualcomm shareholders will meet on March 6 to vote on a Broadcom-backed plan to unseat and replace the entire board of the US chipmaker, which would pave the way to a deal if approved.We studied everything and I can tell you we wouldn’t have made this offer if we weren’t sure we could get this doneHock Tan, chief executive of Broadcom, said in an interview that his record of doing multibillion-dollar deals should reassure Qualcomm investors.“We studied everything and I can tell you we wouldn’t have made this offer if we weren’t sure we could get this done,” Mr Tan told the Financial Times.The deal-hungry executive accused Qualcomm of scare mongering and spreading false fears about a potential combination being blocked by competition watchdogs.Mr Tan added that Broadcom had spoken to a number of regulators about the proposed acquisition and was ready to sell two overlapping units — the WiFi networking processors and so-called RF Front End chips for mobile phones — to get the transaction approved. “There isn’t an antitrust issue that can’t be resolved,” he said.Daniel Wall, an antitrust lawyer at Latham & Watkins, who is advising Broadcom, said Qualcomm’s regulatory concerns “are short on specifics and heavy on a type of rhetoric that really doesn’t matter very much in the antitrust merger clearance process”.Mr Tan said Broadcom did not want to disclose the break-up fee as it would like Qualcomm to engage with it first, but he stressed the company was prepared to pay a “hefty” amount in the “unlikely case the deal is blocked”.People close to Mr Tan said the 65-year-old Malaysian was determined to get a deal done in a friendly manner. They said he would be prepared to withdraw the proxy fight to remove Qualcomm’s board of directors.“We continue to hope you choose to engage with us for the benefit of your stockholders,” Mr Tan said on Monday in a letter to shareholders. “However, we will withdraw this proposal and cease our pursuit of Qualcomm immediately following your upcoming annual meeting unless we have entered into a definitive agreement or the Broadcom-nominated slate is elected.”Qualcomm management has constantly argued Broadcom’s offer is opportunistic, given that the US chipmaker’s stock price has been depressed by a series of issues the company is confident can be solved in due course.Qualcomm has been in a legal fight with Apple over a number of issues including chip royalties, and has also been involved in a $39bn takeover of Dutch rival NXP. The US company said that once these problems were resolved, in combination with the launch of 5G — a wireless standard that will connect a much wider range of devices — its stock price would rise.Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the increase was necessary after Qualcomm raised its earnings guidance, though it still did not make up for the fundamental difference in the companies’ business models and was likely to fail. “At any price, this is a strategic mismatch — Qualcomm creates IP and Broadcom implements it,” he said. “Their investment horizons are different.”However, other analysts said the higher offer, and Broadcom’s threat to walk away if it is not accepted, had put extra pressure on Qualcomm as it tries to close its bid for NXP. Shareholders in NXP have balked at the $110-a-share offer, and Qualcomm’s board is running out of room to manoeuvre as Broadcom puts a deadline on its own bid, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note on Monday morning.“Qualcomm is going to have to make a choice, and come to terms with NXP shareholders . . . very soon,” they said. Shares in NXP slipped less than 1 per cent on Monday and continued to trade at more than $10 above the current Qualcomm bid.A group of Chinese smartphone manufacturers, including Xiaomi and Vivo, voiced their opposition to Broadcom’s acquisition of Qualcomm last month, arguing that a combination would negatively affect them. 
122;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Broadcom/Qualcomm: in Hock;‘Best and final’ is just a starting point in M&A;“Best and final” proclaims Hock Tan, the Broadcom chief, of his improved offer to buy Qualcomm, the latest semiconductor group he covets. Broadcom’s bid of $82 a share is 17 per cent higher than its first attempt in November. Mr Tan’s ostensible knockout punch must satisfy a key constituency besides Qualcomm shareholders: his own, which must wonder if the market conditions that supported a deal are evaporating.Broadcom’s bid has required no fewer than six big banks to commit to funding the deal along with equity from Silver Lake Partners. The cash component of the transaction — $60 per Qualcomm share — implies a whopping $90bn of funding. With fears of inflation heightening in recent weeks, the US 10 year treasury has jumped closer to 3 per cent. At the same time, record low spreads in high-yield bonds have widened. Debt remains historically cheap but its steady drift upward makes a tight transaction risky.The entire bid boost comes from Broadcom shares. Qualcomm investors should prefer more cash. Over three months, Broadcom shares are down 15 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 5 per cent.Mr Tan’s immediate goal is to get Qualcomm to negotiate. Directors have steadfastly resisted so far (hence Broadcom agitating to dump the Qualcomm board). While the $82-a-share bid looks on the face of it to be the highest Broadcom is willing to pay, its shareholders have plenty to sweat still. Mr Tan is now offering a “ticking fee”, owed if the transaction takes more than a year to close. Additionally, he has promised a termination fee, likely worth billions, if trustbusters quash the transaction entirely.Having come this far, undoubtedly there are more goodies Qualcomm could extract. There is no downside to engaging with Mr Tan to find out. “Best and final” in US M&A is just a starting point. And an admonition to Broadcom shareholders to be wary.

124;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-02-01T00:47:11Z;Qualcomm bolsters bid defence with Samsung 5G tie-up;US chipmaker is fighting a hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom;"Qualcomm has promised investors that 5G networks and devices based on its chips will launch around the world in little more than a year, as it struck a new five-year deal with Samsung that includes the high-speed wireless technology.To fend off a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom that Qualcomm argues undervalues the company, the San Diego-based chipmaker must convince investors that a new wave of growth is coming soon — particularly as a legal dispute with a major customer, Apple, drags down profits. The new Samsung partnership announced on Wednesday adds to recent alliances with Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi, as well as mobile operators in several markets. Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president, said on a call with analysts that the 5G market — which promises a range of benefits over 4G LTE, including higher speed and lower power demands — is accelerating.“We now have line of sight to a number of deployments of [5G] networks . . . in the latter part of this year,” he said. “We are working with a number of [manufacturers] to have smartphone launches in the first half of 2019 . . . Scale is going to be an advantage for us.”Those 2019 deployments include two of the four US mobile carriers; three European operators in markets including the US and Germany; telecoms groups in South Korea, Japan and Australia; and China Mobile, which plans to begin a rollout of 5G in the second half of 2019. Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive, said: “These generation changes have always provided us with an opportunity to benefit from our significant technology lead and this will be true again to an even greater degree as we expand into 5G.”Qualcomm executives are becoming increasingly confident about the company’s lead in 5G over rivals such as Intel, said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “Right now, Qualcomm is the only game in town,” he said. “They think they might have a 12-24 month lead, when it comes to [5G] mobility. Very rarely do they ever say that.” We are working with a number of [manufacturers] to have smartphone launches in the first half of 2019 . . . Scale is going to be an advantage for usThe new deal with Samsung was announced as Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue growth of just 1 per cent to $6.1bn, as Apple continues to withhold royalty payments in a fight over the value of Qualcomm’s intellectual property. Qualcomm swung to a net loss of $6bn in the three months ending in December, largely because of the effect of new US tax legislation — including a one-time $5.3bn tax bill on its overseas profits — as well as a $1.2bn fine over what the EU ruled was an anti-competitive deal with Apple. The company said revenues for the quarter ending in March would range between $4.8bn and $5.6bn, on the lower end of Wall Street’s forecasts. It blamed a slowdown in smartphone sales in China and a “larger than normal reduction in orders sequentially from a large modem customer”, which Mr Moorhead said was likely to be Apple.Broadcom in December turned hostile in its $130bn takeover bid for Qualcomm. The Singapore-based chipmaker hopes to unseat Qualcomm’s entire board at March’s annual shareholder meeting.Qualcomm is vehemently opposed to a deal, which it has portrayed as opportunist and fraught with regulatory risk. Broadcom, which analysts say needs Qualcomm to avoid being left behind in the 5G era, has argued that it would be able to resolve its target’s many legal and regulatory challenges and cut costs in order to increase shareholder returns."
125;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;New Qualcomm-Samsung alliance to ease antitrust woes;;Qualcomm has struck a broad new alliance with Samsung, which could help the mobile chipmaker resolve its antitrust case in South Korea and fend off a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom.As part of a new patent cross-licensing agreement, Samsung “will be withdrawing its interventions” into Qualcomm’s appeal against a Won1.03tn ($868m) fine in 2016 over what the Korean Fair Trade Commission called “excessive” licensing fees.Qualcomm did not disclose terms of the amended deal but said it was “consistent” with its “global handset-level” pricing.The two companies also said that they would work together on a “multiyear strategic relationship” for Qualcomm’s processors that includes the “transition to 5G”, as device makers and network operators prepare for a new generation of superfast wireless networks launching in the coming years. Last week, Qualcomm secured similar commitments on 5G from a group of Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.The deals were announced as Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue growth of 1 per cent to $6.1bn, as licensing revenues were again hit by its ongoing legal dispute with Apple and its suppliers over iPhone royalties.Qualcomm swung to a net loss of $6bn in the three months ending in December, largely due to the impact of new US tax legislation, including a one-time $5.3bn tax bill on its overseas profits, as well as a $1.2bn hit from a European Commission fine over what the regulator alleges was its anti-competitive deal with Apple. Losses per share were $4.03, down from earnings of 46 cents a year ago.Qualcomm’s shares, which closed up 1.9 per cent on Wednesday at $68.25, were broadly flat in after-hours trading but fluctuated as investors digested the slew of announcements.The San Diego-based company said that revenues for the quarter ending in March would range between $4.8bn to $5.6bn. Going into the quarter, Wall Street had estimated revenues of $5.6bn for what is Qualcomm’s fiscal second quarter.Qualcomm needs to demonstrate strong momentum in its business to help it rebuff a hostile $70-per-share takeover bid from rival chipmaker Broadcom. As part those efforts, it announced a $1bn-per-year cost reduction programme earlier this month.Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights, said that the Samsung deal was a “surprise move”.“The Samsung announcement is important as it lowers Qualcomm uncertainty which has weighed on the stock for a year and contradicts many of Broadcom’s claims of a broken model,” Mr Moorhead said.
126;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-26T22:21:59Z;Week in Review, January 27;Regulatory blow for Murdoch, drugmakers’ M&A, Qualcomm’s fine, US airlines and GE;A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Regulator has bad news for Murdoch’s £11.7bn Sky bidRupert Murdoch’s plans to take full control of Sky hit a hurdle this week when the UK regulator scrutinising his £11.7bn bid said the deal would concentrate too much power in the media mogul’s hands, writes Matthew Garrahan.The finding by the Competition and Markets Authority is a setback for Mr Murdoch’s second and final attempt to buy Sky. But it is unlikely to derail Walt Disney’s plans for the satellite broadcaster when it completes its proposed $66bn takeover of the entertainment assets owned by Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.That deal, which must be cleared by regulators in the US and Europe, includes Fox’s 39 per cent of Sky — and will include 100 per cent if Mr Murdoch’s bid is eventually approved.The provisional finding by the CMA, which is expected to be accepted by the government, said the Sky acquisition would give the Murdoch family “too much control over news providers across all media platforms, and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda”.However, analysts still expect the deal to go through after the CMA suggested remedies that could allay its concerns.These include a sale of Sky News, Sky’s news channel, or creating a “firewall” around the channel to prevent the Murdoch family from exerting influence over its management team.With the media industry undergoing a period of profound change Disney has been attracted by Sky’s customer base which has grown to close to 23m people across Europe.The pan-European broadcaster this week raised the prospect of the end of the satellite era with plans to launch its full subscription pay-TV range over the internet rather than the airwaves.The company hailed the plans to launch Sky as a streaming service in Italy and Austria before taking it other countries, including the UK, as a “major development”.It cautioned that the move did not mean it was ending its use of satellite technology, which is how 12m Britons receive Sky, but said streaming would “open up headroom” in existing markets.Drugmakers pay hefty premiums for M&A dealsDrugmakers announced a string of takeovers this week, bringing the total value of deals since the start of the year to almost $30bn and marking the strongest start for healthcare mergers and acquisitions in a decade, writes David Crow.But the buyers paid hefty premiums to seal their respective deals, raising fears of a bubble in biotech valuations among some industry executives.Sanofi said it would pay $11.6bn for the haemophilia specialist Bioverativ, a 63 per cent premium, while Celgene agreed to pay $9bn for Juno Therapeutics, a cellular therapy company — almost two times as much as the group was worth before news of the deal leaked earlier this month.Later in the week, Biogen said it would pay up to $217m for an experimental brain drug that has not yet been tested in humans, although it handed over just $10m as a downpayment, with the rest contingent on clinical trial results and commercial success.Bankers and lawyers who specialise in M&A said they were busier than they had been since 2008, and predicted more deals to come.But some industry figures expressed concern about the valuations ascribed to the takeover targets as data from Dealogic showed the average premium paid in 2018 so far was 81 per cent, well above the historic average.“I think the smaller companies that have yet to generate sales or revenues are still very expensive relative to companies that have approved [drugs],” said Robert Bradway, chief executive of Amgen, the world’s largest biotech group.Qualcomm’s €997m fine takes shine off China bashAt a time when its legal and takeover battles are rarely out of the headlines, Qualcomm had hoped that this week’s news would be dominated by technology for a change, writes Tim Bradshaw.At a splashy event in Beijing, the US-based chipmaker lined up some of the biggest names in Chinese smartphone manufacturing to show their commitment to its mobile processors and new 5G superfast wireless platform.But on the eve of Thursday’s function, the EU slapped Qualcomm with a €997m antitrust fine. Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said that Qualcomm’s billions of dollars’ worth of payments to Apple to use its chips exclusively from 2011-16 amounted to illegal foreclosing of the market, holding back innovation and competitors such as Intel.Qualcomm disagreed with the verdict and said it would appeal.A day later in Beijing, Qualcomm was trying to get back on the front foot with its announcement that Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo and Vivo would all join its “5G Pioneer” initiative, pledging to launch smartphones compatible with the ultra-high-speed cellular network as soon as next year.Qualcomm also received a boost from the Chinese smartphone makers in its attempt to fend off a $130bn hostile takeover bid from rival Broadcom.Executives at Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo said they opposed the proposed deal because it threatened to impede innovation.Investors jettison airline shares amid price war fearsThe airline sector suffered a sharp share sell-off over worries of an industry price war after American Airlines and Southwest Airlines joined rival United Continental in raising seat capacities for 2018, writes Daniel Thomas.Southwest Airlines and American Airlines fell more than 8 per cent on Wednesday and Thursday, while United Continental dropped 14 per cent, in spite of an otherwise decent set of fourth-quarter results.Both Southwest and American showed a rise in revenues but higher operating costs and — in the case of Southwest — lower fares weighed on bottom lines. Plans to increase seat capacity added to concerns over profit margins at both airlines.United started the rout by saying at an investor event on Tuesday night that it planned to increase capacity at a faster than expected rate of 4 to 6 per cent a year for the next three years and that it was prepared to do battles with budget airlines on price.While good news for consumers, lower fares could risk derailing the airline industry’s recovery in pricing power.Full-service carriers could potentially be hit the hardest given that they face higher costs and have been raising wages for their staff in recent years.United’s attitude towards low-cost rivals and its plans to add more seats revived memories of the intense competition that ravaged airline stock prices in the past — and which investors, including Warren Buffett, had come to hope would not be repeated.GE reveals watchdog probe over accounting practicesGeneral Electric revealed it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices, writes Ed Crooks.The announcement on Wednesday renewed concerns over the industrial conglomerate’s financial reporting that resulted in a settlement with US authorities less than a decade ago.It also dealt a blow to new chief executive John Flannery, who has been struggling to restructure the group and clean up financial problems left by his predecessor, Jeffrey Immelt.According to people briefed on the investigation, the SEC is looking at two issues: the company’s recent announcement that it needed to pay an additional $15bn to cover legacy insurance liabilities, and the way it has accounted for revenues from long-term contracts in the power industry.Jamie Miller, chief financial officer, said GE was “co-operating fully with the investigation which is in very early stages”.The company has a history of attracting the SEC’s attention. In 2009, it agreed to pay $50m to settle charges alleging it had misled investors by reporting “materially false and misleading results” in 2002-03. It did not admit or deny the allegations.The SEC notified GE in November that it was looking at its accounting for long-term service contracts in the power industry.It then widened its probe after the company disclosed last week that for the fourth quarter of 2017 it was taking a $9.5bn pre-tax charge for insurance liabilities, which mostly relate to long-term care policies.
127;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-25T21:00:30Z;Qualcomm’s Chinese partners speak out against Broadcom bid;American chipmaker turns to Chinese regulators to defend against hostile takeover;Qualcomm has won the backing of a group of Chinese smartphone manufacturers in its fight to fend off a $130bn hostile bid from rival Broadcom, a day after the company was fined €997m by the EU in a move that piles further pressure on the US chipmaker.Senior executives of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo all voiced their opposition to the proposed acquisition at a Qualcomm event in Beijing on Thursday,“When we first heard of [the Broadcom bid], our biggest concern was, if it happened, would there still be era-defining communications products?” said Lin Bin, Xiaomi president.Chinese lawyers have said that the country’s antitrust regulators could pose the biggest obstacle to the deal, which would create a dominant player in the mobile chip market and post a challenge to domestic companies.China is also the last country yet to approve Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP, which was given the green light by European regulators last week.Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm president, said his team had met with “a number of government members” in recent days, as the company boasted of its local partnerships at its first ever China Tech Day.“The relationships that we have in China . . . will play a very strong role with the regulators’ view of the future of Qualcomm,” he said.Mr Amon added that he expected China, now Qualcomm’s second-largest market, to soon become its largest, with revenues from Chinese smartphone makers already twice the size of Apple-related revenues.“The remarks by Qualcomm’s partners will certainly influence any future decision by Chinese regulators over the Broadcom bid,” said Cui Kai, an analyst at IDC. “China is trying to upgrade its manufacturing. These manufacturers highly rely on Qualcomm, and that will be an important consideration for the regulators.”Qualcomm’s pivot towards China comes after a year of multibillion-dollar legal battles with Apple, which could end in the iPhone maker dropping the company’s chips out of its next handset, according to people familiar with the matter.“When I look at the litigation that we have with Apple, I’ll say, China is definitely a good place to do business with intellectual property,” said Mr Amon, referring to its patent disputes with the iPhone maker which are being disputed in the US. The American business community in China has long complained of IP theft, a problem currently under investigation by the US government.Qualcomm also launched its “5G Pioneer” initiative on Thursday with a group of Chinese smartphone makers, to bring superfast, next generation devices to market as early as next year.Chinese telecoms companies have said that 5G will be commercially available later this year, putting the country in the running to be first to launch the standard globally.Alex Katouzian, general manager of Qualcomm’s mobile division, said the company’s international resources would help Chinese companies expand overseas. “We will put all of those assets at the disposal of our partners here to launch them globally,” he said.Analysts have said that if Qualcomm can show strong revenue potential from 5G patent licensing, it could also help it to fend off Broadcom.
128;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-25T04:44:52Z;Qualcomm in tie-up with Chinese mobile giants to launch 5G;;Qualcomm has formed a consortium of Chinese smartphone manufacturers to launch superspeed 5G devices as early as next year.The US chip giant launched its “5G Pioneer” initiative on Thursday on stage in Beijing with the presidents and CEOs of its Chinese smartphone partners, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo, as well as top-level executives from ZTE and Lenovo.Qualcomm also announced a memorandum of understanding with Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo to purchase a total of $2bn of Qualcomm components over three years. The components make it easier for mobile phone antennae to be used with 5G connections.Qualcomm is cosying up to Chinese partners in the face of troubles in Europe and the US. Yesterday European regulators hit Qualcomm with a €997m fine for abusing its market dominance. For the past year, the company has been locked in numerous court battles with its major client Apple, which could end in the iPhone maker leaving Qualcomm’s chips out of its next handset, according to people familiar with the matter.
129;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-24T14:35:28Z;EU hits Qualcomm with €997m fine for abusing its dominance;US tech giant paid Apple to use its chips exclusively in its smartphones and tablets;Brussels has hit US chipmaking giant Qualcomm with a €997m fine for abusing its dominant market position by paying Apple to use its chips exclusively in its smartphones and tablets.Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, said that Qualcomm’s arrangement with the iPhone maker amounted to illegal foreclosing of the market that had held back innovation and contributed to the company’s rise.While the case concerns billions of euros in payments to Apple, Ms Vestager said the company was not seen as being involved in any wrongdoing and that Brussels’ focus in the case was exclusively on Qualcomm.“No rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,” she said.Qualcomm said that it “strongly disagrees” with the decision and will appeal in the European courts.The EU investigation is one of several antitrust probes the company has faced in different countries. The fine imposed by Brussels related to payments made by Qualcomm to Apple in exchange for buying all of its “baseband chipsets” from the company between 2011 and 2016. The chipsets are essential to the functioning of smartphones and other devices.Apple is also pursuing numerous court cases against Qualcomm around the world, accusing the chipmaker of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties” that it alleges have cost it billions of dollars.Ms Vestager said that Intel had been one victim of Qualcomm’s payments to Apple. The chipmaker “really wanted to challenge Qualcomm, and this was made, for this very important customer, impossible”, she said. The fine amounts to 4.9 per cent of Qualcomm’s turnover in 2017.She said that the arrangement had “definitely” contributed to Qualcomm’s dominance, and that there were already signs the market was opening up since the company stopped making the payments in 2016.“We see the market is changing now — it is more competitive than what we saw,” she said.Don Rosenberg, executive vice-president of Qualcomm, said the company was confident that the payments to Apple “did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers”.Wednesday’s fine was the latest in a series of actions taken by the EU to punish anti-competitive behaviour in the tech sector.Ms Vestager has fined Google €2.42bn for abusing its dominance of search to allegedly give preference to its shopping service. The EU has two open investigations into Google and a second probe into Qualcomm.Ms Vestager has also moved to recover €13bn of back taxes from Apple and has fined Facebook €110m for providing misleading information during its WhatsApp merger process.Ms Vestager played down any link between the Apple court cases against Qualcomm and Wednesday’s ruling, saying they covered different issues.
130;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-24T10:47:34Z;Qualcomm fined €997m by EU competition watchdog;Commission says chipmaker abused dominance by paying Apple for exclusivity;Brussels has handed chipmaker Qualcomm a €997m antitrust fine for abusing its dominance when it paid Apple to use its chips exclusively in its smartphones and tablet devices.Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, said that the company’s actions had “denied consumers and other companies more choice and innovation – and this in a sector with a huge demand and potential for innovative technologies.”“This is illegal under EU antitrust rules and why we have taken today’s decision,” she said.The EU investigation focused on payments made by Qualcomm to Apple in exchange for the iPhone maker buying all of its communication chipsets from the company between 2011 and 2016.Ms Vestager said that the arrangement meant that “no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were.”The ruling may give a boost to Apple’s multibillion-dollar legal campaign against the chipmaker. The iPhone maker has accused Qualcomm of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties” that it alleges have cost it billions of dollars in recent years.Qualcomm has consistently argued that its business model provides fair compensation for the innovation that its chips enable.The EU investigation centred on the “baseband chipsets” that are essential to the functioning of smartphones and other connected devices.The fine handed down by the Commission represents 4.9 per cent of Qualcomm’s turnover in 2017.The European Commission launched its investigation in July 2015 and issued a charge sheet five months later.It is one of a number of investigations into Qualcomm in multiple jurisdictions.
131;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-23T17:14:13Z;Qualcomm set to be censured by European antitrust watchdog;Finding that company abused dominance could boost Apple’s cases against chipmaker;Brussels is poised to censure Qualcomm for abusing its dominance when it paid Apple to use its chips exclusively in its smartphones and tablet devices, in a ruling that could boost the iPhone maker’s multibillion-dollar legal campaign against the chipmaker. Europe’s antitrust watchdog is expected on Wednesday to say that the world’s largest provider of baseband chips hurt competition and innovation when it paid Apple to buy all of its communication chipsets from Qualcomm between 2011 and 2016, according to people familiar with the process. EU fines aim to both punish the company and deter future offences, and are capped at 10 per cent of annual turnover. For Qualcomm, that could suggest a maximum levy of $2bn. Such a ruling would also provide legal firepower for Apple’s numerous court cases against Qualcomm around the world. From California to Beijing, the iPhone maker has accused the chipmaker of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties” that it alleges have cost it billions of dollars in recent years. Qualcomm has consistently argued that its business model provides fair compensation for the innovation that its chips enable. The San Diego-based company also blames Apple for stirring up regulatory attacks and is seeking to block sales of iPhones that do not use its modem chips in several key markets. The European Commission launched its investigation in July 2015 and issued a charge sheet five months later.At the time, Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, said: “I am concerned that Qualcomm’s actions may have pushed out competitors or prevented them from competing.”Apple used Qualcomm’s modem chips exclusively until 2016, when it also began using Intel modems in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus devices. Last year, it emerged that the company was considering dropping Qualcomm modems from its next iPhones altogether. While the EU decision relates to one specific contract, Qualcomm has faced a number of investigations in multiple jurisdictions.The mounting legal issues have hit the share price of Qualcomm and opened the door to a $130bn hostile takeover bid from rival Broadcom. European officials are still investigating if Qualcomm abused its dominance between 2009 and 2011, when it sold a type of baseband chip set to two customers below cost “with the aim of forcing (rival) Icera out of the market”, according to the commission charge sheet.Antitrust officials in China, South Korea and Taiwan have fined the company a total of $2.6bn over its licensing policies and pricing. The court cases between Apple and Qualcomm echo the broader battle over profits between device makers and the companies behind the communication technology and standards underlying those products, such as Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson. Traditionally, royalties for the communication technologies have been charged based on a percentage of each piece of hardware. Device makers have alleged these charges are excessive and want to pay royalties at the chip level, which would cut the cash paid to Qualcomm and its peers. The telecoms industry has defended the status quo, saying it is both easy to administer and justifies the substantial investment made to develop communication standards such as 5G mobile technology which will underpin the internet of things. Qualcomm is buying Dutch chipmaker NXP for its expertise in IoT, specifically in communication technology for cars. Brussels and Seoul cleared that deal last week. Beijing’s approval is still required and some NXP investors want a higher price for their shares.Qualcomm and the commission declined to comment. 
132;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;US regulators seek further review of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm;‘Second request’ from Federal Trade Commission signals more scrutiny for the $130bn proposed deal;The US Federal Trade Commission is requesting more information as part of its antitrust review of Broadcom’s proposed $130bn takeover bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm.Broadcom said on Friday that it had received a so-called second request from the FTC. For mergers it reviews, the agency typically conducts a preliminary review, at which point the “vast majority” of deals are cleared, according to the FTC’s website. If competition issues are identified, it can extend the review and call for more information on its potential impact.Broadcom said that the second request “was expected as a normal part of the regulatory approval process . . . this signifies that Broadcom is moving into the next stage of the US antitrust review process.” After complying with the second request, the agency will have 30 days to complete its review and take any actions.A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would be the largest ever pure technology deal, resulting in a company with a market value of more than $200bn and which would serve a crucial role in the production of smartphones — including Apple’s iPhone.But Qualcomm has dug in against the deal, saying the $70 cash-and-stock per share offer undervalues its worth. Broadcom, in turn, has proposed ousting Qualcomm’s entire board to smooth the path for the transaction.
133;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-18T17:43:23Z;Qualcomm’s $47bn takeover of NXP gets green light in Brussels;EU and Korean authorities clear deal as US chipmaker fends off Broadcom bid;"Qualcomm moved two steps closer to buying NXP, as authorities in Brussels and Seoul cleared a $47bn deal that could also strengthen the US chip company’s defence against a hostile bid from rival Broadcom.After three years of industry consolidation, Qualcomm is at the centre of two megadeals as companies in the sector try to scale up and shift from powering smartphones to the growth markets of artificial intelligence and the ‘internet of things’.Qualcomm wants to buy NXP, a Dutch group focused on payments and automotive technology, while also trying to fend off Broadcom’s attempt to buy it with or without NXP.EU and Korean officials gave the green light for the NXP deal on Thursday after the San Diego-based chipmaker excluded some key patents and made promises about royalty rates and inter-operability with rival smartphone technologies.“We use our smartphones for many different things and now also more and more as mobile wallets,” said Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner.European officials had raised concerns that the takeover could increase prices, cut choice and reduce innovation in the semiconductor industry.Qualcomm made three commitments in an attempt to address these worries: it will not buy NXP’s standard-essential patents for contactless payment; Qualcomm will license NXP’s fare-collection technology — used by many European transport authorities — for eight years at current prices or better; and its smartphone technology will work consistently with both NXP products and those made by rivals for the same period of time.European approval was expected and the deal has already been cleared in six other jurisdictions, including the US, Mexico, Russia and the Philippines. Beijing has yet to rule.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, was “pleased” with the approvals granted on Thursday and was “optimistic that China will expeditiously grant its clearance”.Thursday’s approvals came as Qualcomm fends off a $70-per-share Broadcom bid that would likely face greater regulatory scrutiny with NXP involved, as the Dutch company and Broadcom both have WiFi chip businesses.On Tuesday, Qualcomm wrote to its shareholders saying the bid was “opportunistic”, “inferior” and carried significant regulatory uncertainty. It also urged investors to reject a separate proposal by Broadcom that the San Diego company replace its board.Qualcomm has come under pressure from shareholders including Elliott and Ramius to raise its $110-a-share offer for NXP. Ramius argued earlier this week that Qualcomm’s “highly opportunistic” 2016 bid “dramatically undervalues” the Dutch chipmaker.NXP on Thursday was trading at $120, implying investors expected Qualcomm to go higher despite the US company’s insistence last month that its original price was “full and fair”.Qualcomm is embroiled in a number of corporate and legal battles. These include fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour from Apple, one of its largest customers, as well as two EU investigations into historical pricing policies.The company has also been hit by antitrust fines over licensing fees in China, South Korea and Taiwan in recent years.

134;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm makes case to investors amid Broadcom hostile bid;;Qualcomm, the $100bn US chipmaker that is trying to fend off a hostile bid approach from rival Broadcom, laid out its case to shareholders on Tuesday, saying the company would be better off as a standalone company.The San Diego-based group said in a letter to shareholders that Broadcom’s $70-a-share offer was “opportunistic” and “inferior” and carries significant regulatory uncertainty.It also urged investors to reject a separate proposal tabled by Broadcom to replace its board with a slate of 11 new directors, saying the nominees in question are “conflicted” and have “minimal experience”.“[The deal] is designed to benefit only Broadcom stockholders – not Qualcomm stockholders,” said Qualcomm, the world’s largest market of smartphone chips. “We have a specific game plan and are committed to delivering $6.75 – $7.50 in Non-GAAP EPS by FY 2019.”Broadcom said in a statement that its $130bn offer represents “significant value” to Qualcomm shareholdersQualcomm management has repeatedly overpromised and under-delivered since the announcement of its “strategic realignment plan” in 2015, resulting in an inability to meet financial targets as well as deteriorating profitability and destruction of stockholder value. Qualcomm’s approach is a transparent attempt to sell a quick fix by the Qualcomm Board of Directors and management team and an obvious tactic to deny its own stockholders the opportunity to receive a compelling premium for their shares and significant upside potential in the combined company.Qualcomm shares are up nearly 4 per cent to $67.98.
135;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;How high does a hostile takeover bid need to go?;First offer by Hock Tan’s group just shy of average premium for such US M&A bids;Standing in the Oval Office, Hock Tan licked his lips. President Donald Trump had praised Mr Tan as a “great, great executive” running Broadcom, “one of the really great, great companies”. Mr Tan, there to celebrate the Singapore-domiciled chipmaker moving to the US, replied: “We are making America home again!”The lip licking probably did not betray Mr Tan’s anticipation of devouring Qualcomm, but only days after the November event at the White House he went public with an unsolicited $130bn bid. The San Diego-based chipmaker promptly rejected the offer. Broadcom urged Qualcomm shareholders to replace their board. Qualcomm’s annual meeting is on March 6. The phoney war is about to turn real.If it were at all consistent, the Trump administration might worry about Broadcom prevailing. Officials are concerned about China’s strategic push to build a semiconductor industry. Chinese companies attempting to acquire US chip assets (possibly any assets) face a veto. Yet, newly draped in the Stars and Stripes, Mr Tan can buy Qualcomm, a US leader in chips for smartphones. A serial dealmaker who likes to cut costs, Mr Tan is sure to go after Qualcomm’s $6bn annual budget for research and development. There is some concern from parties in Silicon Valley that US prowess gets hurt in the process. Antitrust problems may still arise. However, unpopular for its pricing practices, Qualcomm has few firm friends. Broadcom’s success will come down to cold cash.Qualcomm expressed the required disgust at Broadcom’s $70 a share offer, which “dramatically undervalues” the company. Yet the offer was not as laughably meagre as Qualcomm pretends. It was a 33 per cent premium to the average share price in the month beforehand and a 28 per cent premium to the last undisturbed price. That was a similar premium paid by Mr Tan when, as head of Avago, he successfully acquired Broadcom in 2015 (and later took its name). Certainly, it is opportunistic. Qualcomm’s share price had been unusually weak as it wages a brutal legal war over licensing fees with Apple, its biggest customer. But that weakness is earned: the Apple battle has an uncertain outcome that cannot be simply wished away.The proposal to replace the board with new directors is unlikely to go anywhere without a higher offer. People close to the would-be acquirer indicate a serious improvement is coming. Precedent suggests this strategy often works, sometimes with only a modest bump. In 2008, InBev disclosed a $65 a share offer for Anheuser-Busch and, after it was rejected, filed to replace the target’s board. The two sides then agreed a $70 a share deal. In 2010, Astellas Pharma went public with a $52 a share offer for OSI Pharmaceuticals and then nominated new directors. The two sides agreed a $57.50 offer. In one counter-example, Air Products bid $60 for Airgas in 2010, succeeded in installing new directors at the target but still suffered rejection on a final $70 bid.How high would Mr Tan have to go? The average premium for hostile US M&A bids since 2010 is 35 per cent, according to Dealogic, so his initial bid looks only a little light. Data from Dealogic also show that the average increase in an offer on ultimately successful deals is 17 per cent. That latter metric would suggest an $82 offer from Broadcom, which would be hard to refuse. Qualcomm’s shares scaled those heights, only briefly, 18 years ago during the dotcom bubble. There is a narrative, though, that Mr Tan — described this week as travelling in a “shabby-looking Toyota car” — is too parsimonious to pay that much. He does not like to raise much beyond his first bid. Typical of that is his final successful $5.5bn bid for Brocade in 2016, which was only 6 per cent higher than his initial offer. On the other hand, the initial bid was more generous than the Qualcomm offer and Brocade ended up with a 47 per cent premium. At Qualcomm, that equates to $81. This already complex picture is made gnarlier still when you consider that there is so much debt involved and that Qualcomm is simultaneously trying to acquire another chipmaker, NXP, for $47bn. If he can get to $81 or $82, Qualcomm’s board would be hard-pressed to reject Mr Tan. Until then, they are not licked.tom.braithwaite@ft.com
136;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-11T06:00:08Z;Smartphone addiction worries put tech groups on defensive;Executives respond to investor campaign at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas;At the annual Consumer Electronics Show, there were few problems to which the technology industry’s solution was not “more technology”.So as the world’s gadget makers this week descended on Las Vegas for their biggest annual show, the timing could not have been worse for two Apple shareholders who together own about $2bn of the iPhone maker’s stock to launch an activist campaign over technology addiction and children’s health. Worse still, the investors turned a social issue that had been steadily gaining momentum over the past year into a threat to share prices, arguing that the “long-term health” of young people and society are “inextricably linked” to the “long-term viability” of companies such as Apple.Having the topic thrust back into the headlines just as CES got under way blindsided the industry. Unlike artificial intelligence, robots or virtual reality, digital addiction was hardly a hot topic on the show floor this week.Many tech executives have been privately grappling with the problem, with a growing number of Silicon Valley parents limiting smartphone usage by their children. Yet the perceived impact on the bottom line of encouraging customers to use their products less makes it difficult for tech companies, software developers or telecoms operators to discuss the problem. “Folks at the device manufacturers have been aware of it for some time,” says Fred Bould, founder of Bould Design, a studio that has worked with tech companies including Nest, GoPro and Roku. “The onus is on the parents but it would be great if social media companies and device manufacturers had some controls that are easy to use, accessible and transparent. I don't think that exists right now.” In an open letter to Apple published on Sunday, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System pointed to the “growing body of evidence” that smartphone and social media usage among younger users “may be having unintentional negative consequences”. These could range from distraction at school and sleep deprivation to depression and diminished empathy. The investors cited research suggesting that half of American teenagers report feeling “addicted” to their phones. “There is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset,” the investors wrote, “and no company can outsource that responsibility to an app designer, or more accurately to hundreds of app designers, none of whom have critical mass.”Even some of the individuals who helped to create the iPhone agree on the looming crisis and say it is adults, not just children, who are at risk. “Device addiction is real,” Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the device and founded Nest, said in a flurry of tweets on the matter this week. “Apple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter — they’ve gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit. They now have a responsibility & need to start helping us track & manage our digital addictions,” Mr Fadell said. “We will have regulations some year only if the tech companies don’t step up.”Apple has responded by insisting it has “always looked out for kids” and already offers “intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system”. But while saying that its employees “think deeply about how our products are used”, Apple conceded that it could do more. “We have new features and enhancements planned for the future, to add functionality and make these tools even more robust,” it said this week. In interviews during CES, tech executives defended the social impact of their products.“I believe that the transformation created by the smartphone on society is probably as significant as what we have seen with the automobile and electricity,” said Cristiano Amon, president of Qualcomm, whose chips lie at the heart of many mobile devices. While the smartphone’s benefits outweigh the downsides, he added, “like anything, the downsides need to be understood [and] need to be addressed”.Yang Yuanqing, chief executive of Chinese electronics group Lenovo, took a similar line. “Definitely smartphones make our lives easier and more convenient,” he said. “If you spend too much time on your smartphone, it’s not good — it probably will impact your health as well.”Motorola, the mobile device maker that is owned by Lenovo, is one of the few smartphone makers to openly address the issue. It has an online quiz to help customers assess their “phone-life balance”, which asks: “Do you own your phone or does your phone own you?”It also recommends more technology to help manage the problem — apps such as Offtime, AntiSocial and Quality Time that help parents limit their children’s smartphone usage or block distracting notifications. But Simon Segars, chief executive of mobile chip designer Arm Holdings, said the “onus is on people”, not technology, to ensure children use smartphones responsibly. “It is sometimes worrying to wander around and see some very small child staring at a phone but this is about parenting,” he said. “Before the days of phones, it would have been something else.”

The European Commission last June expressed concerns that the tie-up might harm competition and opened an in-depth investigation into the takeover. “As semiconductors are used in practically every electronic device, we are dependent on them,” Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, said at the time. “With this investigation, we want to ensure that consumers will continue to benefit from secure and innovative products at competitive prices.” The EU believed that the combined entity could exclude rival suppliers and increase royalties. It was also anxious that the companies could bundle Qualcomm’s “baseband” wireless processors with NXP’s “near field communication” chips (NFC) and “secure elements”, which together are used in wireless mobile payment systems.Qualcomm has previously said NXP provides complementary assets, specifically in NFC and chips used in the ‘internet of things’.The company’s commitments to win approval include assurances over licences, intellectual property and system elements.Brussels’ move could also bolster Qualcomm’s battle against Broadcom, which launched a campaign to buy the US chipmaker late last year. That bid would face greater regulatory scrutiny with NXP involved, as the Dutch company and Broadcom both have WiFi chip businesses. The Commission and Qualcomm both declined to comment.Qualcomm is embroiled in a number of corporate and legal battles. These include a fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour from Apple, one of its largest customers, as well as two EU investigations into historical pricing policies. The company has also been hit by antitrust fines over licensing fees in China, South Korea and Taiwan in recent years.Despite its regulatory woes, Qualcomm is seeking to maintain a business-as-usual approach as it seeks to diversify its revenues beyond smartphones. It launched the Snapdragon 845 processor, its next generation chip that will offer artificial intelligence capabilities, last month despite its legal battles as it looks to new sectors such as virtual and augmented reality.
138;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2018-01-05T09:41:19Z;Google to begin Alexa fightback at Consumer Electronics Show;Hardware groups that once reigned are pawns in a bigger battle between tech titans;Tens of millions of homes welcomed a new member to their household this Christmas: Alexa. Amazon said its Echo Dot, powered by the virtual assistant it has called Alexa, was the top selling item across its entire online store in the run-up to the holidays. If Amazon and Alexa won Christmas 2017, rival Google’s fightback begins next week in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show. The Alphabet-owned internet group will have its biggest ever presence at CES this year, as it tries to push its own virtual helper, Google Assistant, into an array of speakers, televisions, cars and household appliances. Tens of thousands of tech executives, entrepreneurs and marketers will gather in hotels in the city in the hopes of finding or launching the next big thing. The hype cycle can be brief and brutal, as previous years’ buzz around drones, wearables and virtual reality gives way to smart speakers, autonomous cars and augmented reality. “You go to CES to see what the industry is excited about,” says Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies, even though “some stuff will never make it and some is still years away” from real-world utility. Yet the companies actually manufacturing the electronics are increasingly finding themselves pawns in the ever-widening battle between global internet and software giants. As well as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Chinese tech groups including Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba will have prominent showings this year too, all looking to recruit gadget makers to their respective platforms. That marks a reversal of recent years, when many of Silicon Valley’s software and internet companies questioned whether CES was still relevant, says Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. “In the past few years at CES, arguably the most disruptive companies in tech have been completely absent,” he says. “This year we are beginning to see a change in that. Hardware is the delivery vehicle for their services, so the show is taking on a new importance.” Working with Amazon wasn't as simple as they were hopingMany of the exhibition halls are still given over to CES staples such as ever-larger television sets and thinner, faster laptops, alongside rapidly commoditising gadgets such as smartwatches and cameras. Nonetheless, the plummeting cost of chips and sensors creates fertile ground for more unusual innovations. One Chinese start-up has promised to unveil a “smart suitcase”, the 90 Fun Puppy 1, which balances itself on two wheels to follow its owner around the airport. That builds on last year’s trend to embed “artificial intelligence” into everything from fridges to hairbrushes and toothbrushes. “Artificial intelligence is going to dominate the show in every sense,” says Mr Blaber. “Everyone will be claiming some sense of AI capability but it’s becoming increasingly nebulous.” Many hardware makers with little to no experience in software or algorithms are happy to outsource these smarts to Amazon or Google. Yet some are nervous about ceding too much control. LG, for instance, has said it is embedding Google Assistant in some 2018 TVs and a new “smart speaker”, but it is also pushing its own ThinQ system for “intelligent” programme guides and voice control. Ms Milanesi says some manufacturers did not see the benefits that they had initially hoped for by integrating Alexa into their devices. “Working with Amazon wasn’t as simple as they were hoping and the return on the investment in the devices didn’t seem to pay back,” she says. “I remain sceptical, especially around speakers, that there is money to be made.” Whoever is making them, this burgeoning “internet of things” is useless without connectivity. Next-generation mobile networking standard 5G will be a hot topic, as the likes of Intel and Qualcomm vie for position ahead of the first demonstrations at the forthcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. This wireless technology promises to offer higher speeds at lower power, enabling a much wider array of devices to be online all the time.The first 5G standards were approved by the 3GPP industry consortium last month and AT&T announced this week that it plans to roll out 5G networks in a dozen US markets by the end of this year — even though few compatible smartphones and devices are likely to be available by then. “It’s still a lab-experiment type thing but we are getting closer,” says Ms Milanesi. As Google, Amazon and their rivals race to embed smarts and connectivity in every conceivable object, the opportunity comes with risks, too. This week’s disclosure of Meltdown and Spectre, two massive security vulnerabilities, threatens to overshadow the CES gadget bonanza.“The more we are connected, the more we are open to stuff like that,” Ms Milanesi warns. “It gets scary very quickly that someone could control anything from your home to your car.”
139;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-29T15:26:21Z;Qualcomm hopes for profit lift after 5G wifi;Chipmaker fighting hostile takeover says long-term potential not reflected in shares;The next generation of high-speed mobile networks, known as 5G, should give a lift to Qualcomm’s modem business as it tries to fend off the $130bn hostile bid from rival chipmaker Broadcom, according to Wall Street analysts.However, some questioned how big the 5G bounce would be, or whether it would arrive soon enough to save Qualcomm from succumbing to the largest-ever technology takeover.The first technical foundations for 5G were laid last week, when an industry-wide group known as 3GPP approved standards that govern the way devices will connect to the new networks. 5G is designed to bring more capacity to mobile networks and support new applications such as the “internet of things”, which rely on machine-to-machine communications and an explosion in the number of sensors collecting data.Qualcomm has been scrambling to convince Wall Street that the longer-term potential of this next generation of networks is not reflected in its share price.The first phase of 5G was put on an accelerated timetable earlier this year, reflecting the pressure on mobile carriers to make up for a shortage of capacity. The technology exploits higher frequency parts of the radio spectrum that are not currently used for wireless communications. The shorter wavelengths in these higher bands do not travel far or easily penetrate physical barriers, adding to the technical complexity and playing to Qualcomm’s strengths.The standard should see it win back a strong market lead for the modems that connect smartphones to mobile networks, according to analysts. Qualcomm had a dominant position in the first phase of the current 4G wireless technology, though it has recently lost ground to rivals including Samsung and MediaTek.“It’s looking with the move to 5G that they will remain the dominant modem supplier, particularly in the mid and high-end market,” said Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura.The 5G bounce should bring a revival of Wall Street confidence in Qualcomm, echoing the rebound in the company’s share price as 4G took hold, said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. At the start of this decade investors had worried about the company’s “huge R&D spending”, but those fears dissipated as mobile operators started investing in 4G, he said.The new technology standards should also boost Qualcomm’s licensing business, which relies on charging royalties on all devices that connect to 5G networks. The company will “own one of the strongest patent portfolios for 5G”, said Dimitris Mavrakis, research director at ABI Research. That should help particularly in the early stages of 5G, when the technology depends heavily on earlier generations of wireless communications where Qualcomm was a key inventor, he said. However, some analyst have warned that it was too early to judge the overall impact.Much of the investment in 5G will be in areas where Qualcomm has a weaker technology position than it has in the air interface. These include the infrastructure needed to handle the huge volumes of data on the new networks, and technologies to manage the more difficult parts of the radio spectrum where 5G operates. “The real winners will be Broadcom and Intel,” said Mr Shah, limiting the benefit to Qualcomm.Qualcomm also faces pressure over its licensing arrangements. It has said that it plans to maintain its existing pricing when it comes to royalties for 5G devices, charging up to 3.25 per cent of a handset’s price. However, Broadcom’s bid has put pressure on it to settle a protracted legal battle with Apple, something that analysts expect would lead to deep cuts in its revenues from the iPhone maker and could affect deals with other large manufacturers.Timing may also be against Qualcomm. The first commercial 5G networks are expected to go into operation in the second half of 2019, with demand picking up towards the middle of the next decade“It’s still a bit early,” said Mr Walkley. If Broadcom’s bid succeeds, it will have completed a takeover by the time Qualcomm’s business starts to register the lift from 5G, he said. “Broadcom’s timing couldn’t be better.”
140;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-11T18:46:17Z;Elliott Advisors urges Qualcomm to raise NXP bid;Hedge fund’s call could help US chipmaker fend off hostile offer from rival Broadcom;Paul Singer’s activist hedge fund has called on Qualcomm to increase its “insufficient” offer for Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors, a move that could indirectly help the US company fend off a separate $130bn hostile takeover bid by rival Broadcom.Elliott Advisors, the UK arm of Mr Singer’s fund, said on Monday that Qualcomm should raise its asking price to $135 a share from $110 per share, an offer that values NXP at about $47bn.Qualcomm, which is opposed to raising its NXP bid, may now consider increasing its offer as part of a defensive move to fend off Broadcom.The Singapore-based semiconductor giant offered to buy Qualcomm for $70 per share last month and has said it would also buy NXP at $110 per share, the price for which the Dutch group agreed to be bought by Qualcomm last year.The San Diego-based company has firmly rebuffed Broadcom’s bid, arguing that the offer “significantly undervalues” its business and is fraught with regulatory risks.That prompted Broadcom to launch a hostile takeover campaign, recommending the replacement of Qualcomm’s entire board of directors with 11 new members who would be more amenable to a merger between the two chipmakers.Qualcomm said the nominees were “inherently conflicted given Broadcom’s desire to acquire Qualcomm in a manner that dramatically undervalues” the chipmaker.“No company in the industry is better positioned than Qualcomm in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking and to lead the transition to 5G” wireless technology, said Tom Horton, Qualcomm’s presiding director.Elliott disclosed its NXP stake in a regulatory statement in August, arguing that the company’s shares were “significantly undervalued”. Mr Singer’s firm says it advises funds that hold an economic interest in NXP of about 6 per cent.“We believe NXP’s prospects are bright,” Elliott said in a letter to the Dutch company’s shareholders on Monday. “Approximately half of NXP’s revenue is exposed to exciting growth engines of the semiconductor market — automotive and industrial. We believe NXP shareholders have the opportunity to unlock a material valuation gap that exists today.”The San Diego-based chipmaker’s current offer “is acting as a ceiling on NXP’s valuation”, the fund added.Qualcomm said on Monday that it would continue with the transaction at $110 a share.“Elliott’s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda. We remain fully committed to closing the acquisition of NXP and believe that the agreed-upon price of $110 is full and fair,” the company said.

142;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-06T22:00:46Z;Broadcom boosts dividend, raises forecasts as it trains its sights on Qualcomm;;Broadcom boosted its dividend by 75 per cent and raised its long-term financial forecasts on Wednesday, as it continues to gear up for its hostile takeover battle for Qualcomm.The US chipmaker also reported higher-than-expected profit margins and earnings per share, helping to lift its shares nearly 1 per cent in after-market trading.Broadcom launched hostilities on Monday over what would be the tech industry’s biggest-ever takeover with the announcement of a slate of 11 new directors for Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm has rejected the $70-a-share offer as too low and said that regulatory uncertainties make a deal too risky to pursue.On Wednesday, in announcing results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, Broadcom lifted its quarterly dividend to $1.75, pushing the dividend yield on its stock up to 2.7 per cent. It also offered a more optimistic view of its long-term prospects, lifting the forecast for its gross margin to 65 per cent, from “greater than 60 per cent”. It also raised its long-term targets for operating margins and free cash flow.The confident outlook came as the company delivered higher quarterly profits than Wall Street had been expecting. Its gross profit margin, at 63.3 per cent, was above expectations, while pro forma earnings per share, at $4.59, were 7 cents ahead of forecasts.While Broadcom continued to make headway on cost efficiencies, its revenues continued to slow. Revenues grew 17 per cent from a year earlier to $4.84bn in the latest quarter, in line with expectations, and the company left its long-term revenue growth forecast of 5 per cent unchanged.
143;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-06T21:07:23Z;Qualcomm launches new processor despite Apple and Broadcom battles;Chipmaker unveils product as it fends off legal disputes and hostile takeover;Qualcomm launched its latest Snapdragon processor and a renewed push into Windows PCs at an event in Hawaii this week, as it looks for sources of revenue beyond the smartphone.The event showed how the chipmaker is trying to maintain a business as usual approach despite the increasing distractions of its legal battle with Apple and a hostile takeover bid from rival Broadcom. The Snapdragon 845 will offer new artificial intelligence capabilities, more sophisticated virtual- and augmented-reality applications, and a new “secure processing unit” to better guard passwords and biometric information from hackers, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, said it would be among the first companies to use the new Snapdragon platform to power its main devices next year. Qualcomm is launching the latest generation of its signature product ahead of its usual schedule. Its predecessor, the Snapdragon 835, was launched in January at the Consumer Electronics Show. The chip’s earlier debut will fuel speculation that Samsung, whose top-end Galaxy devices typically run Qualcomm’s processors, is preparing to launch a flagship smartphone at CES next month incorporating the 845. Before it unveiled the details of the Snapdragon, Qualcomm showed off a range of Windows PCs from HP and Asus offering persistent cellular wireless connections and multi-day battery life. Only a number of smartphones are running Snapdragon 835 and it’s been out for almost a year. They really have to bring that technology down to the mid-rangeThe laptops and convertible tablets, branded as “Always Connected PCs”, are the first fruits of a renewed partnership between Microsoft and Qualcomm. The companies are hoping to overcome the failure of Windows RT, an earlier attempt to bring Microsoft’s operating system to more portable devices, to compete with Apple’s iPad. Qualcomm is trying to reduce its dependence on the smartphone and branch out into other kinds of gadgets, from PCs and servers to virtual reality headsets. The Snapdragon 845 will enable so-called “room scale” VR, which will allow the wearer of a headset to walk around in virtual worlds drawing on a variety of cameras and sensors. Earlier mobile VR headsets were designed for a stationary experience. In the fast-growing field of AI, Qualcomm’s latest platform offers a three-fold performance improvement over its predecessor for tasks such as virtual assistants.Qualcomm will also bolster smartphone makers’ ability to compete with Apple with its secure processing unit. The feature is similar to the Secure Enclave in the iPhone which powers its Face ID and Apple Pay systems. Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, said the Snapdragon showed how Qualcomm’s shift to a new processor architecture has enabled it to become more “flexible and dynamic”, introducing features more quickly to compete with the likes of Apple, which designs its own chips. However, Mr Bajarin added that the chip would be too expensive to capitalise on the growth of lower-priced smartphones, particularly in China. “Only a number of smartphones are running Snapdragon 835 and it’s been out for almost a year,” he said. “They really have to bring that technology down to the mid-range.”
144;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-05T05:09:01Z;Showdown: Broadcom v Qualcomm;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"One thing to start: If you could change/add/tweak one thing about DD in 2018 what would it be? Drop us a line: Due.Diligence@FT.comBroadcom clearly isn’t afraid of a fight. But is the chipmaker’s move on Monday to overthrow the entire board of directors at its rival Qualcomm the right strategy to win a $130bn hostile takeover battle?Given that there is no prospect of the two reaching a friendly agreement at the current terms — $60 in cash and $10 in Broadcom stock for every Qualcomm share — going hostile might indeed be the only way.Last week we reminded DD readers about how hard it is to win hostile deals. According to Dealogic, since 2010 less than 50 per cent have succeeded, meaning that the odds are against Hock Tan and his long list of deal advisers (Moelis, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities on financials; Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Latham & Watkins on the legal; Joele Frank on PR).But what are the next steps for Broadcom? Several analysts and investors are wondering why it doesn’t just raise its bid. The answer is simple: it would be tactically stupid now.Qualcomm’s annual general meeting is on March 6. That’s more than three months away, so if Broadcom raised the offer now, it’d likely result in a back-and-forth that would force it to increase it even more.So unless the San Diego-based chipmaker has a change of heart (which is unlikely), Broadcom will only make a fresh bid in early February, before meeting with ISS, the influential proxy advisers, which will advise shareholders whether to back a number of new directors (and the hostile bid).If ISS backs Broadcom’s proposal, Qualcomm will come under pressure to engage its rival in merger talks in a bid to avoid an embarrassing showdown at the AGM on March 6.What’s Qualcomm’s most likely response? On Monday it said that Broadcom’s board nominees are “inherently conflicted given Broadcom’s desire to acquire Qualcomm in a manner that dramatically undervalues” the chipmaker.The strongest argument of Qualcomm - which is being advised by Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Centerview Partners and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; George Sard on comms - is likely to remain that no matter what Broadcom offers, the deal will face huge antitrust hurdles. Although Broadcom’s advisers believe that there is a path to getting the deal done without competition regulators laying down too many road blocks, there is no doubt that Qualcomm’s antitrust concerns are legitimate.Intelligent curation and exclusive information: This is Due Diligence, the FT’s daily briefing on corporate finance, private equity and M&A.

Get in touch with us: Due.Diligence@FT.com A scoop from the FT’s Robert Smith and Harriet Agnew on Monday — about Goldman Sachs’ efforts to sell on debt exposure to Altice — sent some of the cable and telecom company’s bond prices to their lowest levels in well over a year.So what was Goldman trying to sell and why?To get to the answer you first have to understand Altice’s rather complicated debt structure. (If you need a primer on Altice and its founder Patrick Drahi, read here.)Debt investors do not simply buy “Altice bonds” — the company splits its €51bn of debt across several distinct “silos”. As a result, bond fund managers are less likely to run into credit concentration limits that restrict them from owning too much debt from one company. Chief finance officer Dennis Okhuijsen learnt this trick from Liberty Global — where he was previously the treasurer.The best way to picture this is to think of a wedding cake, with the cakes on the different tiers representing debt at different entities.On the bottom tier are bonds from Altice’s main operating companies — such as Altice France (SFR) in Europe and Suddenlink in the US, for example — that are closest to the company’s assets. In the middle, the company has further debt at intermediate holding companies — such as “Altice Luxembourg”, an entity that sits above the company’s French and international businesses and has €6.2bn of debt.At the very top of the structure is Altice’s “topco” — the entity at which its Netherlands-listed shares sit and which has more than €2.3bn of debt. In contrast to most of Altice’s €51bn debt pile, this has never been publicly syndicated to institutional investors and sits on the balance sheets of what the company calls its “relationship banks”.As concerns grew about Altice’s performance in November, Goldman quietly approached several funds in an attempt to sell part of this topco debt, which some say helped contribute to some of the jangled nerves in debt markets.“I think for a lot of people it was a big warning sign,” says one credit fund manager.On top of this, banks such as Goldman also have exposure to Drahi — the Franco-Israeli billionaire who founded Altice. While Drahi’s main investment vehicle Next Alt no longer has margin loans outstanding with Goldman, the US bank two years ago provided it with a “funded collar” facility — a complicated derivatives options trade on Altice shares.While Altice has always maintained that it is financially stable despite the decline in its share price, it’s easy to see why some institutions’ risk managers are taking another careful look at the whole structure.A simple question sits at the heart of a battle between one of Singapore’s richest men Kwek Leng Beng and a group of investors in UK-listed Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. Should the hotel group, in which Kwek’s City Developments Limited owns a 65 per cent stake, be valued as a hotel group or a property company with intriguing prospects. A 552.5p per share offer unveiled in October by Kwek’s CDL was pitched at a 21-23 per cent premium. It was accepted by M&C’s independent directors, who had rebuffed two previous bids.But two funds — International Value Advisers, which owns about 7 per cent of the hotel group’s shares, and a unit of Michael Dell’s family office, which owns 1.4 per cent — are intent on a significant increase. They also may have support from other investors, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Fidelity International.Kwek needs 50 per cent of minority investors to accept his offer to execute a deal that would give him control over the remainder of M&C.The situation has prompted what one insider has described as a “Singapore stand-off” with a December 8 put up or shut up deadline looming (though the deal is still awaiting approval from authorities in New Zealand, which may cause further delays).The question is how willing is Kwek to raise his offer and what will the investors do if he bumps only slightly. Rio Tinto has appointed director Simon Thompson as its new chairman, after seriously flirting with the idea of naming Xstrata man Mick Davis to the role. Thompson, a Briton who also chairs UK private equity group 3i, will take up the position in March, when Jan du Plessis steps down.

145;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-04T18:24:03Z;Broadcom/Qualcomm: the bidactivist;The fight is winnable — but only if the predator goes for a knockout blow;"To win its fight for rival chip group Qualcomm, Broadcom could have put forward a knockout offer. Instead it is trying to convince its US target’s shareholders that they are ill-served by a cosy board of directors. The first move — a significant improvement on a $130bn indicative offer — would stretch it financially; the second stretches credulity.With hindsight, Qualcomm can be grateful for its 2015 battle with activist Jana Partners. The eventual peace deal brought three new directors vetted by Jana and the departure of two long-tenured members. To think this board is in cahoots with management in rebuffing takeover offers is risible. Broadcom might also be grateful to Jana — if it were still around to demand that Qualcomm start talks. Jana has scarpered. No other activist has materialised to stir the pot. The hope from the potential acquirer is that long-only Qualcomm investors will push the board to open discussions, even if they want more than $70 a share, a meagre 28 per cent premium to a depressed share price. That looks unlikely in the short term.The opportunity comes in the run-up to the annual meeting in March. Then Broadcom must submit a more compelling offer and Qualcomm will have to listen or face a greater chance of a shareholder revolt. The San Diego company has avoided ruling out a deal.Qualcomm’s defence would be helped by an improvement in the share price unrelated to the bid. It has trailed the otherwise booming chip sector. On the to-do list: peace on good terms with Apple; a successful acquisition of NXP at the current price; evidence that the chipmaker will cash in on the new 5G standard. The timetable is tight, though.Only two hostile takeovers have been completed this year, according to Dealogic, for just $575m. Still, Broadcom has numerous lenders and M&A advisers on its side and buyout firm Silver Lake ready to deploy funds too.

146;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-12-04T14:57:12Z;Broadcom seeks to oust Qualcomm board in hostile bid;Chipmaker’s move comes after rival rejected its $130bn takeover offer;Broadcom turned its $130bn takeover offer for Qualcomm into a full-blown hostile bid on Monday after it proposed overthrowing the entire board of its rival chipmaker in an effort to win the biggest technology deal in history.The Singapore-based group presented a new slate of 11 directors to replace the entire board of the world’s largest maker of smartphone chips, putting in motion what is likely to be a heated proxy fight.Broadcom’s move comes after the board of Qualcomm rejected its $70-a-share offer — of which $60 is in cash — saying it undervalues its business and presents “significant regulatory uncertainty”.Winning a hostile takeover battle requires several stars to align. Changing the target’s entire slate of directors is a necessary condition but not the only one. Satisfying shareholder concerns on price and regulatory risks is also needed. Since 2010, 57 per cent of global hostile takeover approaches have failed, according to Dealogic.In a statement on Monday, Qualcomm said Broadcom’s nominees are “inherently conflicted given Broadcom’s desire to acquire Qualcomm in a manner that dramatically undervalues” the chipmaker.“No company in the industry is better positioned than Qualcomm in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking and to lead the transition to 5G” wireless technology, said Tom Horton, Qualcomm’s presiding director.“Qualcomm stockholders expect a board that will support this innovation while evaluating objectively the full range of opportunities available to maximise value for all Qualcomm stockholders.”The San Diego-based company is set to argue that it has a strong and fresh board comprising technical, operational and investment experience, whose members have an average tenure below the average for S&P 500 companies, in part due to the addition of three directors at the instigation of activist investor Jana Partners in 2015.Broadcom said earlier on Monday that it plans to nominate nine men and two women to be Qualcomm directors at the target company’s annual meeting on March 6, 2018.It added that it supports the reappointment of Mark McLaughlin, Anthony Vinciquerra and Jeffrey Henderson — the Qualcomm directors backed by Jana — and would seek to enlarge the size of the board to accommodate them.“The nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm’s directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us,” said Hock Tan, Broadcom chief executive.A deal, which would be the latest in a wave of consolidation in the chipmaking industry, would create a semiconductor juggernaut that would position the combined company as a market leader in everything from the production of chips for mobile phones to new generation electric vehicles.Qualcomm, which remains vehemently opposed to a deal, had been courting its shareholders in recent weeks to gain their backing in the expected proxy fight.People close to Qualcomm’s management have dismissed Broadcom’s takeover approach as an opportunistic attempt to capitalise on its current weaknesses. Qualcomm has been in a protracted legal fight with a major customer, Apple, over a number of issues and has been struggling to close its $39bn takeover of rival NXP Semiconductors.Qualcomm believes that once it settles these matters it will be able to grow at a faster pace. It also believes that it already stands in a position to benefit significantly from the introduction of 5G, a wireless standard that will connect a much wider range of devices.These factors, Qualcomm has argued in recent weeks, will help lift the stock value of the chipmaker, which at about $65 per share is lagging behind Broadcom’s offer.Several large investors in Qualcomm have expressed their opposition to the current offer but would be open to a higher bid, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
147;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Broadcom to nominate 11 members to Qualcomm board as it gears up for proxy fight;;The gloves are coming off.US chipmaker Broadcom has on Monday announced plans to nominate a new slate of 11 directors to replace Qualcomm’s board after its San Diego-based rival rejected its $130bn unsolicited takeover approach.The move sets Broadcom up for a potential proxy fight with Qualcomm and marks the first step by the Singapore-based chipmaker towards a hostile bid.Broadcom said in a statement that it plans to nominate nine men and two women to Qualcomm’s board during its target’s annual meeting on March 6, 2018. Broadcom added that it supports the reappointment of Mark McLaughlin, Anthony Vinciquerra and Jeffrey Henderson as directors and would seek to enlarge the size of the board to accommodate them.“The nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm’s directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us,” said Hock Tan, Broadcom president and chief executive.The news comes three weeks after Qualcomm unanimously rejected Broadcom’s $70-a-share offer, saying it “dramatically undervalues” its business and presented “significant regulatory uncertainty”.The move will put further pressure on Qualcomm’s management to come to the table or better explain to shareholders why it should remain an independent company.Broadcom for its part said its “strong preference” remains to engage in a constructive dialogue with its takeover target.The 11 nominees that Broadcom is seeking to elect to Qualcomm’s board are:
148;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-30T01:46:36Z;Qualcomm seeks block on iPhone X in latest patent battle with Apple;;Qualcomm is seeking to limit sales of the iPhone X in the US with another new round of litigation that accuses Apple of patent infringement.The three new cases, which are being filed on Wednesday at the Southern California district court and the US International Trade Commission, come just hours after Apple launched a patent-infringement lawsuit of its own against Qualcomm, accusing it of infringing its intellectual property around smartphone power management.The two companies have become embroiled in an ever-widening range of lawsuits since January, when Apple accused one of its leading chip suppliers of ”exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”.In the latest development, Qualcomm alleges that Apple infringes 16 patents covering a broad range of smartphone functions, from the user interface and battery management to a camera’s auto-focus.Five of those patents are asserted in a case at the ITC, an agency which has the power to issue an “exclusion order” banning imports of infringing patents. Qualcomm brought a similar case to the ITC in July but in the latest litigation it is seeking a block on the iPhone X as well as earlier models.As with its first ITC case, Qualcomm is only seeking an exclusion order against iPhones that use its rival Intel’s modems, not its own chips.In Wednesday morning’s filing, Apple took aim at that approach, saying that Qualcomm was seeking to “extend its monopoly” over certain cellular wireless chips by asking the ITC to “exclude its only remaining competitor”.Qualcomm has already dropped one of the initial six patents at issue in its original ITC case, while also expanding the litigation to seek similar bans in China and Germany.In Wednesday’s brief, Apple also accused Qualcomm of behaving like a “common patent troll”.Responding to that in an interview with the FT, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said the claim was “rhetoric” that had “no effect on the merits of the case”.“Qualcomm has been at the centre of the development of the very core technologies that have facilitated companies like Apple to enter the [smartphone] market,” Mr Rosenberg said.“If you’re a company as strong and powerful, and successful and profitable as Apple is today, at some point you start to believe your own marketing statements… Not only are they the most profitable company in the world but they also have a history of squeezing their suppliers.”Qualcomm is expanding its patent litigation against Apple because the iPhone maker has told its suppliers to stop paying royalties until their legal disputes are resolved, Mr Rosenberg said.“We’ve got to explain to Apple tat taking our intellectual property is not without recourse,” he said.Apple declined to comment.
149;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-29T16:23:53Z;Apple accuses Qualcomm of acting as a ‘common patent troll’;iPhone maker launches latest round of litigation in dispute with chip designer;Apple has accused supplier Qualcomm of behaving like a “common patent troll”, as the iPhone maker responds to the mobile chip designer with another round of litigation. The latest lawsuit and sharpening rhetoric will fuel fears on Wall Street that Apple might drop Qualcomm’s modem chips from the next iPhone, as relations between the two companies continue to deteriorate. Since the beginning of the year, the two companies have become embroiled in multiplying legal fights. Apple accuses Qualcomm of overcharging for its intellectual property and of anti-competitive behaviour. The chipmaker says Apple could not have invented the iPhone without its innovations and, in July, began seeking an import ban against the smartphone in several key markets amid alleged patent infringement. Wednesday morning brought Apple’s latest response to July’s lawsuit, accusing Qualcomm of infringing on its own battery management patents. Apple says Qualcomm incorporated its power-efficiency inventions into its flagship Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors, which power many leading Android smartphones, including Samsung’s Galaxy S7. Defending itself against the accusations of patent infringement, Apple’s legal team says the San Diego-based chipmaker has asserted “weak patents that nibble at the edges of the smartphone platform and cover concepts that Apple simply does not use”. The iPhone maker’s accusation that Qualcomm is behaving like a patent troll — a company that hoards intellectual property without making any real products, generating most of its money from lawsuits — marks a new low in the pair’s relationship. “This case presents a tale of two companies,” Apple writes in Wednesday’s legal filings. “On one hand we have Apple who literally created the modern smartphone as a product category, with the iPhone’s cutting edge design, easy connectivity, superlative battery life, and interactive applications that make the smartphone the smartphone. On the other we have Qualcomm, who developed rudimentary telephone technology that carried voice calls in the early days of feature phones, but whose technology is dated.” Apple did not specify the scale of the damages it is seeking over the power-management patent infringement. Qualcomm’s share price has declined sharply since hostilities first broke out with Apple, one of its largest customers, in January.The stock’s weakness opened the door to an unsolicited $130bn takeover approach from rival chipmaker Broadcom, which Qualcomm’s board has rebuffed as being too low. Broadcom is expected to turn hostile with its approach in the coming weeks, as it prepares to launch a proxy battle against Qualcomm.Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
150;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;EU to draw up counterfeiting ‘watch list’ in fight against fakes;;Brussels will draw up a list of countries and online marketplaces that are the biggest source of fake goods and piracy coming into Europe, as the EU steps up its fight against the multi-billion euro counterfeiting industry.The European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans to help curb the sale of fake goods in the EU, which make up 5 per cent of all imports into the continent and are worth €85bn.As part of the measures to protect intellectual property rights, the EU will compile a “watch list” of the biggest non-EU markets involved in producing and selling fake goods and tighten up security at Europe’s customs borders.China is the biggest single source of the world’s fake goods, according to the EU’s Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), with Montenegro, Hong Kong, and Malaysia also big producers. Footwear, leather goods, clothing, electrical goods and watches are the main fake items seized by European customs authorities, according to the EUIPO.But Brussels has been criticised by the world’s biggest consumer and luxury brands for failing to come down harder on online websites where fake goods sales have proliferated in recent years. Over a 100 companies and associations, including Louis Vuitton, Adidas, and Prada, wrote to Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president, earlier this month calling on the EU to draw up laws against counterfeiting rather than asking websites and advertisers to cooperate on a voluntary basis. Brussels has said its existing laws are still “fit for purpose”.Michelle Gibbons, of the European Brand Association, said the measures were “far from enough”.“Unless the legislative framework to protect European innovation and creativity is modernised and strengthened, counterfeiting will continue to expand dramatically, as will negative impacts for the health and safety of European consumers” said Ms Gibbons.In another highly-anticipated set of guidelines being watched by Apple and Qualcomm, the Commission said it would not be taking sides in the battle between patent holders like Qualcomm and Nokia against companies like Apple and Samsung who use wireless technologies in their devices.The EU said it backed a “fair and balanced” system for the licensing of these “standard essential patents” (SEP) where manufacturers can get access to chip technology and intellectual property holders are also rewarded fairly.“Some people have asked us to take sides. We believe stakeholders should solve the issue between themselves” said Jyrki Katainen, EU commission vice president.Morgan Reed, president of the App Association, said the guidelines were a positive result for app developers and tech start-ups who rely on chip technology for innovation.“We appreciate the clear recognition the Commission gives to the role that SMEs and startups play in the innovation process. We applaud the Commission for providing transparent and predictable conditions for SEP licencing, and at the same time respecting everyone’s intellectual property”, said Mr Reed.

152;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-26T16:27:22Z;Let the 5G battles begin;There is exponentially more wealth to be made and tech titans are vying for position;The consumer internet revolution of the past 20 years has brought us many amazing things, from online search engines to phones doubling as personal assistants. But as dramatic as that change was, it’s nothing compared with the coming evolution of 5G wireless and the internet of things, which will involve putting data mining chips in everything from your fridge to your car.This will not only create entirely new businesses, but also allow advertisers to reach you in ever more targeted ways (they’ll know not only where you are, but if your garden needs watering or if you are running out of milk). The economic stakes are high. As rich as big tech companies are, there is exponentially more wealth to be created in this new 5G world. Yet the technology that underpins it all is being threatened by a battle over which businesses and industries will seize which slice of this juicy pie.Traditionally, companies such as Apple, Google, Samsung and others that make wireless devices have paid the developers of crucial wireless technologies — including Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson — a licence fee to use their chips and other essential patented intellectual property (IP). Standard-setting bodies in the US and Europe designated which technologies were essential to building the underlying system, and then allowed innovators to patent them provided they would offer “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” access to all market players.Of course, there are big disagreements about what’s “fair”, particularly as connectivity becomes more widespread across a greater variety of devices.One of the most contentious issues has been whether the value of essential patented technologies should be based on the price of a chip (which might only cost a few dollars) or the phone it powers (which could be hundreds of dollars). The tech giants, of course, want to locate the licence value in the chip, which would mean they pay less for IP.Companies such as Qualcomm want it based on the price of a finished product, a phone or even a car, for example. They argue that connectivity needs are very different for a device that, say, monitors water levels in soil once a week versus an always-on autonomous vehicle, and prices should reflect that.This is all part of a deep and growing divide between the largest consumer brands, such as Apple, which see their ability to put tens of thousands of bits of patented technology together in a beautifully finished product as the biggest contributor to value, versus US and European innovators that argue they have spent billions on research and development creating standards and technologies that actually make smartphones smart — and are now being bilked.The result, according to one recent survey, is that roughly three-quarters of wireless tech IP holders are refusing to provide assurances that they’ll license their latest technologies in certain circumstances, something that could start to undermine connectivity. The epic legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm reflects this stand-off. Qualcomm has withheld some chip testing software from Apple, while Apple has refused to pay fees Qualcomm says are owed.Both sides have a point. Critics say Qualcomm is charging too much for its technology but also that Apple is wrong to hold out on paying licence fees. “The fact that there’s so much litigation now means that neither regulators in the US or the EU are doing their jobs,” says Elvir Causevic, a managing director and IP specialist at Houlihan Lokey, the San Francisco-based investment bank. Indeed, the regulatory signals coming from either side of the Atlantic have been contradictory.In 2015, the US standards-setting body, the IEEE, moved towards a position that favours big tech companies. But on November 10, US assistant attorney-general Makan Delrahim, gave a speech indicating that he thought players who “hold out” and refuse to pay licence fees (such as Apple) were a bigger problem than patent owners who “hold up” the system by demanding higher fees.The European Commission, meanwhile, had been headed in the opposite direction. You’d think it would be a no-brainer for Europe to protect its own telecom players. Yet there is a battle within the commission, with innovation advocates (who fund the research conducted by companies such as Nokia) arguing for the telecoms businesses and those in antitrust seeing patents as a monopoly that should not be protected.It’s also possible that the antitrust contingent is looking to protect an entirely different group of stakeholders. If cars become phones on wheels, then French, German and Italian automakers will need access to cheap wireless tech, just as Apple and Google do. It may be that the commission will throw telecoms (and the existing patent system) under the bus to give European carmakers a leg up with smart vehicles.They may also decide to punt and see which direction the US goes in, not only in terms of wireless standards but patent rights in general. This week, confirmation hearings will begin for the presidential nominee for director of the US Patent Office, and the Supreme Court will hear the “Oil States” case that could shift the entire patent system in the US. Corporate lawyers of the world, rejoice — the 5G battles are only just beginning.rana.foroohar@ft.com
153;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Chipmaker Cavium’s shares hit new all-time high after Marvell deal;;Shares of semiconductor maker Cavium soared to a new record high on Monday after Marvell Technology announced a $6bn takeover deal for the smaller chipmaker.Cavium shares jumped 8 per cent after the opening bell on Monday to as much as $82.60. Marvell shares, meanwhile, ticked up 1 per cent to $20.50.The deal, announced Monday morning, will see California-based Marvell acquire all the outstanding shares of Cavium for $40 a share in cash, and 2.1757 shares per Cavium share. The transaction values Marvell shares at $80 apiece, based on their price before November 3, when reports of a possible deal first emerged, giving the transaction a value of about $6bn.Both companies’ boards have already approved the deal, Marvell said. Marvell said it expects the deal to make it a leader in infrastructure solutions with annual revenue of approximately $3.4bn. Including Monday’s share movement, Cavium has a market cap of about $5.24bn, while Marvell’s market cap is just over $10bn.Marvell president and chief executive Matt Murphy called the deal “an exciting combination of two very complementary companies that together equal more than the sum of their parts.”It’s the latest deal to shake up the US semiconductor sector, which has seen a flurry of activity this year. At the beginning of the month, Qualcomm rejected an unsolicited $130bn takeover offer from rival Broadcom, paving the way for a possible hostile takeover attempt.
154;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-19T08:00:26Z;Chipmakers bet on the ‘big bang’ of artificial intelligence;Broadcom’s $130bn bid for Qualcomm reflects semiconductor companies’ desire to depend less on smartphones and vie for a foothold in AI;No one in Silicon Valley wants to be called a “chip company” these days. Qualcomm, which makes the processors found in many Android phones and iPhone modems, describes itself as a “platform company”. Intel, once proudly “inside” most of the world’s PCs, now positions itself as a “data company”. Nvidia, whose soaring share price has made it one of the best-performing stocks of any sector in the past two years, describes its graphical processors as “amplifying human intelligence”, thanks to their growing role in deep learning research.Yet just as quickly as semiconductor companies are trying to rebrand themselves as something else, dealmakers are rushing into the sector. Since 2015, the chip sector has seen more than $150bn-worth of mergers and acquisitions — and that was before Broadcom chief Hock Tan made his bold $130bn move on Qualcomm this month.Broadcom is the product of several of those deals, not least its $37bn buyout by the smaller Avago in 2015, which retained its target’s name.Its bid for Qualcomm, whose board has rebuffed its $70-a-share offer as too meagre, is likely to prove a high water mark in the current consolidation frenzy. “In a way, all the M&A has happened,” says James Wang of Ark Invest, an investment adviser. “This is the last one you could even imagine.” A deal could create the world’s third-biggest chipmaker behind Samsung and Intel.Qualcomm and Broadcom sit at the top of a complex but rapidly shrinking food chain. Before Broadcom swept in, Qualcomm itself was trying to complete the chip sector’s biggest deal to date, buying NXP, the Dutch chipmaker that only two years ago paid $12bn for Freescale. Broadcom and Avago are still integrating with each other after a merger in 2015. It is enough to give even a veteran dealmaker like Mr Tan indigestion.The last few years’ activity reflect a unique set of circumstances in the tech industry. A decade after the introduction of the iPhone, the smartphone market is vast but mature, offering slower, less profitable growth to companies such as Arm Holdings and Qualcomm.Executives are convinced that artificial intelligence and augmented reality will soon sweep the globe like the personal computer and the smartphone before them. Softbank’s $32bn buyout last year of Arm, the UK-based chip designer, was a gutsy bet on the internet of things, or IoT, by the Japanese conglomerate’s founder, Masayoshi Son.However, it is not quite clear when or even which of these revolutions will happen. The result is something unusual in the land of disruption: the status quo is holding. Apple, which is sitting on $269bn in cash and whose latest iPhone X is already proving successful, seems unlikely to fall on harder times like Nokia or BlackBerry anytime soon. The awkward alliance between Samsung and Google based on the latter’s Android operating system is holding up, while the South Korean electronics group’s dominance in chip manufacturing continues to grow. The prospect of a new entrant loosening Lenovo, Dell and HP’s collective hold on more than half of the PC market seems remote too.The global dominance of a few big tech companies may be causing concern in Washington and Brussels, but it presents an opportunity for the likes of Mr Tan. If consolidation in maturing markets has been one force driving the prolific deal making, the other has been a rush by established powers and newcomers alike to position themselves for the next wave of growth.“When you have a small number of very powerful customers, you have to have a very small number of powerful suppliers,” says Michael Marks, former chief executive of electronics supplier Flextronics and a former Broadcom director. “Thirty years ago you had 200 computer customers, now you have three. Fifteen years ago you had 20 cellphone customers, now you have two. The hardware sector has consolidated massively over the last 30 years . . . I’m surprised it has taken this long for there to be more consolidation in the semiconductor market.”At a time when the likes of Intel and Qualcomm have been investing in search of that elusive next big thing, from forays into smartwatches and virtual reality to multibillion-dollar bets on autonomous cars, Broadcom has shown a more narrow focus in the less glamorous parts of the supply chain.Intel is best known for the central processing units that power Windows PCs and Macs, but its other chips can be found in iPhone modems, data centres, drones and self-driving cars. Unlike many of its rivals, it manufactures chips as well as designs them. Its $17bn acquisition of Altera in 2015 added new capabilities.Founded in 1993, Nvidia’s strength has always been in graphical processing units, which run alongside a CPU. Nvidia is still popular with gamers, including players of Nintendo’s latest Switch console, but the GPU has taken on a new life in cryptocurrency mining, training artificial intelligence systems and autonomous cars.San Diego-based Qualcomm’s heritage is in wireless technology, particularly in 3G and 4G cellular networking, where it owns foundational intellectual property. It capitalised on the growth of Android smartphones with its Snapdragon “system on a chip”, while also selling modems to Apple since the first iPhone. It is now investing in the hope of dominating the next generation of 5G wireless networks.Broadcom supplies components to telecoms, enterprise and industrial companies, which are used in TV set top boxes, smartphones, broadband infrastructure and energy systems. Its origins date back to the 1960s at Hewlett Packard and in AT&T’s Bell Labs. A driver of its $130bn bid for Qualcomm was to expand into cellular wireless chips for mobile devices.“Broadcom has always been an ingredients supplier, that’s very much their heritage,” says Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insights.Mr Tan puts it a little differently. “We have bought five companies over the past five years,” he explains. “The way our business model works is, when we buy a business we look at the strong, the core sustainable product lines . . . We very often invest even more than the original owners have invested in those businesses.”He is dismissive of diversions into “peripheral” or “adjacent” businesses that the management teams of his targets “can’t help dabbling in”, adding: “In those businesses, we tend to go through an asset rationalisation.”Contrast that approach with Intel, which went far beyond mere dabbling with this year’s $15bn acquisition of Israel’s Mobileye, a maker of sensors and cameras for computer-assisted and autonomous driving. Self-driving cars are moving from science fiction to reality faster than many expected: Alphabet’s Waymo is already putting truly driverless cars into public service, many of them powered by Intel’s processors.Even after winning its first slot in the iPhone last year, Intel is searching for new sources of growth beyond the central processing unit, the workhorse chip driving most PCs and servers, after largely missing out on the smartphone revolution. Its attempt to reposition itself as a data company also reflects its strength in data centres, where Intel says it is targeting a $50bn market opportunity for silicon ranging from server processors to networking and AI.Here, the rise of cloud computing has helped drive faster growth than the PCs that make up its “client” business, which still makes up more than half of Intel’s total revenues. Despite the hype, the “internet of things” accounted for only 5 per cent of Intel’s $45.7bn in revenues for the first nine months of this year. Pressure to diversify also motivated Intel’s $400m acquisition of Nervana, whose technology is more suited to AI systems than the CPU.In autonomous cars specifically and AI generally, Intel is seen as playing catch-up with Nvidia, whose graphics processing units have been eagerly adopted by researchers working on deep learning. Last year, Nvidia was the best performing stock on the S&P 500, rising by 224 per cent. Its shares have doubled in value again this year.“Nvidia is at the centre of AI, machine learning and deep learning and where the value really resides, which is in neural networks and training,” says Mr Blaber. “That doesn’t mean it’s not going to face competition from Intel, and Google and Facebook are investing in their own silicon [for AI]. But Nvidia is in a remarkably strong position.”It has achieved this stronghold without buying its way into the market. Like Intel, Nvidia missed mobile, prompting its 2011 acquisition of Icera, a maker of smartphone modems that competes with Qualcomm. But the modem business was closed last year, just as the value of its original focus on graphics chips was becoming clear in AI.“We enabled the AI big bang to happen because of this new computing architecture that we invented,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, told the FT in an interview this year. “Just as software ate the world, AI is going to eat software.”For now, more than half of Nvidia’s sales still come from gamers wanting the latest graphics cards for their PCs. Though less than a quarter of its most recent quarterly revenues come from AI-centric applications in data centres, it is growing fast, doubling year on year.“When people think about IoT, that’s an AI problem. When people think about self-driving cars, that’s an AI problem,” Mr Huang said. “I believe there’s going to be a trillion, multiple trillions of devices in the world that are going to have inference capability . . . basically, localised AI capability.”Once seen as a takeover target, Nvidia’s surging share price has given it a market capitalisation of $126bn — seen by most analysts as too large for potential buyers such as Intel.Until recently, the same was said for Qualcomm, whose valuation was eclipsed by Nvidia this year. The two companies’ share prices give a clear picture of investors’ enthusiasm for their respective stories: while Qualcomm’s stock would have been broadly flat without the recent rally driven by Broadcom’s bid, Nvidia has increased by more than 600 per cent in the same period. “It comes back to the fact that it’s a very opportunistic move on Broadcom’s part,” says Mr Blaber.Qualcomm’s stock has been hit hard since January by its antitrust battles with Apple over pricing and patents. Apple has stopped paying Qualcomm, which is trying to block iPhone sales from San Francisco to Beijing. Investors are worried because Qualcomm’s licensing business, QTL, is “just such a disproportionate amount of profit that the Apple weight on its earnings quarter to quarter is substantial”, says Mr Blaber. “Plus [there are] long-term fears about all the other regulatory cases and how that might impact the business model.”To its proponents, Qualcomm’s biggest strength is its unique combination of chipmaking, with hundreds of millions of modems and “Snapdragon” processors sold to smartphone makers round the world every year, and intellectual property licensing, which feeds off an accumulated $47bn investment in research and development since its foundation in 1985. Critics, including Apple and regulators in several continents, argue that the combination is fleecing customers by allowing Qualcomm to collect more royalties than it deserves for its patents for cellular wireless networking.If regulators do not intervene first, Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm would create even greater supplier concentration for smartphone makers. “With Qualcomm, Broadcom would be able to offer basically every chip in the iPhone besides [Apple’s] A-Series processor,” says Mr Wang.Yet the presence of the iPhone’s A-Series processor points to what Mr Wang sees as the semiconductor industry’s most successful deal: Apple’s 2008 acquisition of PA Semi, for what now seems like a modest price, $278m. The deal has allowed Apple to take control of the chips at the heart of its devices and with it much of the iPhone’s competitive differentiation.As the UK-based graphics chipmaker Imagination Technologies found out this year, Apple can quickly go from your largest customer to a brutal competitor. After the iPhone maker said it would bring design of graphics chips in-house, Imagination’s shares fell and it was forced to put itself up for sale.Hardly anyone wants to be a chip company these days, it seems, except for the world’s most valuable company.Additional reporting by Richard WatersRegulators have taken a close interest in consolidation among chipmakers, holding up Qualcomm’s $47bn NXP deal and Broadcom’s $6bn bid for Brocade in recent months. Given its size and complexity, analysts expect Broadcom’s $130bn attempt to seize Qualcomm will also face a lengthy review. Qualcomm itself, which is resisting the bid, is using that threat as part of its defence.Yet chopping up Qualcomm or selling off business units would fit the dealmaking modus operandi of Hock Tan, Broadcom’s consolidator in chief. One idea already pushed by activist investors in Qualcomm is to split its highly profitable intellectual property licensing business from its chipmaking unit. Under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners two years ago, Qualcomm’s board launched a review of the idea but chief executive Steve Mollenkopf ultimately decided there were too many “strategic benefits and synergies” from the combination.Nonetheless, that unique combination lies at the heart of many of Qualcomm’s current legal and regulatory troubles.Concerns about these and the NXP deal preoccupied analysts on Qualcomm’s most recent quarterly earnings calls. Instead of discussing its moves into healthcare, robotics or smart cities, investors are worried that its licensing issues with Apple threaten contagion to other customers. Qualcomm has said it is already in dispute with one large Asian smartphone maker, which many analysts believe to be Huawei, although the situation has not yet deteriorated into litigation.Even before launching his bid for Qualcomm, Mr Tan had been cosying up to the US government. At a press conference alongside President Donald Trump, he promised to relocate Broadcom’s headquarters from Singapore to the US.Given Broadcom’s considerable overlap with Qualcomm, he may need more than a presidential photo-op to accomplish tech’s biggest ever deal.
155;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-13T17:40:28Z;Broadcom Qualcomm deal moves closer to open hostility;Target rejects $70-a-share offer but bidder says it is ‘fully committed’ to acquisition;Broadcom’s $130bn attempt to buy Qualcomm moved a step closer to open hostilities on Monday morning, as the two chipmakers dug in for a bitter fight over what could be the tech industry's biggest ever deal.Qualcomm’s board on Monday unanimously rejected Broadcom’s $70-a-share offer, first made a week ago, saying it “dramatically undervalues” the San Diego-based company and presented “ significant regulatory uncertainty”.In response, Broadcom maintained that it was “fully committed to pursuing its acquisition”. The exchange set the stage for what is likely to become a proxy fight in the coming weeks, where Broadcom will try to oust Qualcomm board members and replace them with new directors more amenable to a deal. Broadcom argues its offer of $60 in cash and $10 in shares represents an “attractive” 33 per cent premium to the company’s average share price of the past month. As part of the deal, Broadcom would also assume about $25bn in net debt. Qualcomm points to the fact that its shares were trading close to $70 as recently as December. Qualcomm’s stock rose almost 2 per cent after both statements were issued but, at $65.65, remains below Broadcom's offer price, suggesting investors remain sceptical about whether a deal can be completed.Tom Horton, presiding director of Qualcomm, said: “After a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with our financial and legal advisers, the board has concluded that Broadcom’s proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty. We are highly confident that the strategy Steve [Mollenkopf, chief executive] and his team are executing on provides far superior value to Qualcomm shareholders than the proposed offer.”Mr Mollenkopf added that he was “confident in our ability to create significant additional value for our stockholders” as it moves from mobile devices into automotive chips and the “internet of things”. Several large Qualcomm shareholders have told the company that they back its position, people familiar with the matter say. Qualcomm's share price has been battered in recent months by a widening legal fight with Apple, one of its largest customers. Broadcom will be hoping to capitalise on shareholder uncertainty ahead of what could be years of courtroom battles. Hock Tan, Broadcom chief executive, said on Monday that he had received “positive feedback from key customers” and was “encouraged” by shareholder reaction to the deal. “We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders,” he said. “Many have expressed to us their desire that Qualcomm meet with us to discuss our proposal. It remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm’s board of directors and management team.”At the same time, people familiar with Broadcom’s plans say that it is preparing to force a deal if Qualcomm continues to shut it out. Broadcom could seek to put its own appointees on the board of Qualcomm by winning over existing shareholders in a proxy battle ahead of Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting in March next year. Broadcom has until early December to nominate directors who would be open to its bid.“In a proxy fight we believe the debate would be — can [Qualcomm’s] management that has overseen severe underperformance and been unable to resolve key disputes turn the ship or do shareholders put faith in Hock and take the exit?” said Amit Daryanani, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “At the right price ($80?) we think investors would choose the [Broadcom] option.”
156;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-13T17:10:19Z;Broadcom ‘encouraged’ by Qualcomm shareholder reaction to $130bn offer;;Broadcom said on Monday it was “encouraged” by Qualcomm shareholders’ reaction to its unsolicited $130bn bid, in the strongest sign yet that the company is gearing up for a potentially long and drawn-out proxy fight in order to create a chipmaking juggernaut.Just hours after Qualcomm formally rejected its $70-a-share offer, Broadcom said in a statement that it “remains fully committed” to pursuing its San Diego-based rival and that it has been in contact with Qualcomm shareholders.“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” it said. “Many have expressed to us their desire that Qualcomm meet with us to discuss our proposal.”It added: “It remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm’s Board of Directors and management team.”Qualcomm said earlier on Monday that Broadcom’s offer “significantly undervalues” its business and that the timing is opportunistic. Qualcomm shares have slumped in recent months due to a potentially damaging licensing dispute with Apple. Qualcomm also believes that any combination would face severe scrutiny from competition authorities.People close to Qualcomm added that several large investors have backed the board’s decision to reject the current Broadcom offer.
157;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm rejects Broadcom’s $130bn takeover approach;;Qualcomm’s board has unanimously rejected Broadcom’s $130bn takeover offer, setting up the stage for a potential proxy fight between the two US chipmaking giants.Broadcom made a $70 per share cash-and-stock offer last week, valuing Qualcomm at about $103bn, in what could be the largest tech deal in history. As part of the pact, Broadcom would also assume about $25bn in net debt.In a statement on Monday Qualcomm said Broadcom’s offer “significantly undervalues” its business and is fraught with regulatory risks.After a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, the Board has concluded that Broadcom’s proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty. We are highly confident that the strategy Steve and his team are executing on provides far superior value to Qualcomm shareholders than the proposed offer.Chief executive Steve Mollenkopf added that the company is confident in its ability to “create significant additional value” for its stockholders given its position in mobile and automotive chip sectors.The rejection is likely to kick off a potentially long and drawn-out proxy fight between the two. According to people informed on the matter, Broadcom could seek to put its own appointees on the board of Qualcomm by winning over existing shareholders in a proxy battle ahead of Qualcomm’s AGM in 2018.Hock Tan, chief executive officer and master dealmaker behind Broadcom, said last week Broadcom’s “proposal is compelling for stockholders and stakeholders in both companies.”“Our proposal provides Qualcomm stockholders with a substantial and immediate premium in cash for their shares, as well as the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company,” he said at the time.Qualcomm shares are up 1 per cent in pre-market trading
158;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Hock Tan moves into the spotlight with $130bn Qualcomm bid;Broadcom chief executive has reputation for timing and operational efficiency;Hock Tan was feeling sensitive. As the most acquisitive executive in the chip industry, it was probably inevitable that his rapid-fire spate of deals — capped this week by a $130bn run at struggling Qualcomm— would bring charges of opportunism.“I’m feeling pissed about that,” he said, when asked earlier this week about his public reputation. “We don’t pay bottom prices, we pay full prices.”Mr Tan, chief executive of Broadcom, has never had to give much thought before to how he’s perceived. At 65, he has spent a career outside the public spotlight, building a reputation with a growing band of Wall Street supporters for his strong sense of timing and eye on operational efficiency. It is a modus operandi that has remained consistent — and successful — since he was recruited 12 years ago, when the company (then named Avago) was the subject of a buyout by Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firms.But the unsolicited offer for Qualcomm, which would rank among the five biggest acquisitions ever, will take a different set of skills — and, as one ally of Mr Tan says, that will include working harder on his public image.Mr Tan caught the financiers’ eye after turning round and selling Integrated Circuit Systems, a much smaller company. Moving to a company with five times the revenue — and then expanding that company’s sales more than tenfold, largely through acquisitions — has not changed his basic business philosophy.One former Broadcom sums up Mr Tan’s approach this way: “Plane tickets, not advertisements.” He takes an axe to marketing and advertising spending at the companies he buys, and insists instead that executives spend their time visiting customers.His small-business mentality also shows through in a strong distaste for the kind of pet projects that can lead other chief executives astray and sap the strength of even the biggest companies. Since buying the larger Broadcom and adopting that company’s name, he has ended projects to develop chips for things such as autonomous cars and servers.“Where do you put your big bets, and remove your small bets?” says Ken Hao, a partner with Silver Lake and Broadcom board member. “Small companies are good at that, big ones aren’t. It’s a mentality that he’s retained.”Mr Tan has not followed the usual path to the top echelons of corporate America. He came to the US from his native Malaysia to take up a scholarship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Degrees in mechanical engineering and an MBA at Harvard followed, before a move into finance positions at PepsiCo and General Motors.I would compare his raw IQ and horsepower against any business executive I’ve ever metThe strong finance leaning has helped in his debt-fuelled rise. “He’s not a chip guy, he’s a dollar guy,” says the former Broadcom executive. “Investors love him because he pays off loans fast.”Supporters credit him with a clear-eyed view of his company’s fundamental business. “He never tried to copy anyone, he starts with first principles reasoning,” says Mr Hao. “I would compare his raw IQ and horsepower against any business executive I’ve ever met.” He also describes him as “an extreme workaholic”.These days, Mr Tan splits his time between Silicon Valley and Philadelphia, where two of his three adult children live. Along with wife Lisa Yang, he has made multimillion-dollar donations to MIT and Cornell University for research into autism — a condition that affects two of his children.Mr Tan may have flown under the radar up to now but all that is about to change given the sheer scale and audacity of the Qualcomm bid. Winning over regulators, shareholders, customers and Qualcomm’s board will involve political skills he has not needed previously.He gave his public persona a rare outing last week in an event at the Oval Office, handing a political gift to President Trump by promising to shift his company’s legal base from Singapore to the US, from where it is already in effect run. It was his first time at the White House, as well as the first time meeting the president, he said afterwards.Given what lies ahead, it was not a bad place to start.
159;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-09T17:53:39Z;Qualcomm has been playing a weakened hand;Broadcom takeover bid comes at a time of stress for US chipmaker;It has not been easy for a disinterested bystander to decide which side to root for in the epic intellectual property battle between Qualcomm and Apple.The legal claims and counterclaims have touched on fundamental issues for the tech industry. How far should companies that create new technology standards and platforms be able to profit from their inventions? What are fair returns to the creators of intellectual property in a world desperate for more innovation?But questions like these have been overshadowed by an inescapable conclusion. This is a fight between two giant corporations over dividing the spoils of the smartphone boom, with the courts merely serving as a backdrop.For Qualcomm, this week’s huge takeover offer from Broadcom has turned these questions into an existential crisis. It has looked like a wounded company since Apple went for the jugular, cutting off royalty payments to force its case. The pressure to do a deal with the iPhone maker is now intense. The Broadcom camp, not surprisingly, has done nothing to damp speculation that it may already have reached a rapprochement of its own with Apple. That has led, inevitably, to conspiracy theories that Apple has been pulling the strings to make this bid happen as a way to force Qualcomm to the table.Qualcomm’s predicament says much about how the balance of power has shifted in the tech industry. And it highlights how difficult it has become even for pioneering tech companies with forests of patents and fierce legal departments at their disposal to prevail.The San Diego chipmaker has proved very effective at monetising its technology over the years — something that has antagonised customers and regulators alike. Courtroom battles stretch as far back as its fight with Nokia over 3G technology, and it has been hit by antitrust rulings as recently as October, when Taiwan handed it a $774m fine.But as the balance of power has steadily shifted to phonemakers, life has become harder even for a Qualcomm.Apple sold 217m iPhones over the past 12 months. Even with a big discount from the price of about $20 that Qualcomm usually charges for its cellular baseband modems, that makes Apple a massive customer and gives it considerable leverage to get its way.The concentration of profits in the smartphone industry — where Apple and Samsung account for the lion’s share — has forced a consolidation among some suppliers, while leaving others out in the cold. Just ask Imagination Technologies, the UK chip company that was forced to put itself up for sale after losing Apple as a customer.Governmental power has also become a bigger factor. Two years ago, under pressure from a Chinese antitrust investigation, Qualcomm agreed to lower the royalties it charges its many customers there. The way China uses its significance as both tech manufacturer and increasingly important end-market now hangs over the entire tech sector. Companies are loath to complain publicly but many feel they have no option but to give up valuable IP in return for market access — an issue that is now under investigation by the Trump administration.In the short term, Qualcomm may succeed in getting out from under its cloud and slip out of Broadcom’s reach. Completing its delayed purchase of European chipmaker NXP — held up by regulatory scrutiny — and resolving its fight with Apple would remove big uncertainties.Life may even return to normal with the next breakthrough mobile communications technology. Trials of 5G, a wireless standard that will connect a much wider range of devices at a far lower cost, are due to start next year.Royalty rates have not been set yet. But Qualcomm, which claims a big slice of the technology underpinning 5G, hopes to capture much of the upside.It could well succeed. The kind of battles being waged over the current generation of its technology are typical of what happens when markets stop growing and customers focus on margins.When new applications and markets open up, the industry’s sights turn back to growth, and the cost of a single component becomes less important than capturing the new market opportunity. That is a time for component suppliers with a technology lead to make hay.Even if Qualcomm can escape Broadcom’s clutches and make it through to this promised land, however, there is no escaping the fact that the world has changed.richard.waters@ft.com
160;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-07T22:15:16Z;Tech sector leads pullback for investment grade debt market;Bonds sold by Apple, Sprint, Oracle, AT&T and Qualcomm suffer from pressure on market;Bonds sold by some of the country’s largest technology, media and telecommunications companies have come under pressure this month, buffeted by sparring in US Congress over tax reform and as investors face a spate of multibillion-dollar new debt sales.Risk premiums for investment grade rated US technology and electronics companies have climbed 8 basis points since the start of last week, according to data from ICE BofAML Indices.Bonds sold by Apple, Sprint, Oracle, AT&T and Qualcomm have been among those under pressure, showing weakness that has not been mirrored by tech shares, which have climbed more than 1 per cent this month.Investors pointed to the Republican tax plan for some of the weakness, with a proposal to tax multinationals a potential weight on groups with large international operations. The tech sector generates more of its sales globally than any other sector.Merger talks between Disney and 21st Century Fox, as well as Broadcom’s spurned approach to take over Qualcomm and the end of negotiations between Sprint and T-Mobile, have also dragged on debt prices.Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance, said the rally in technology bonds this year coupled with possible changes to the tax code could be prompting some selling.“We are seeing a little bit of profit-taking as we go into year-end,” he said. “Spreads have had a great run.”Premiums, as measured by the spread over a benchmark US Treasury yield, on nearly 80 per cent of the most actively traded corporate bonds across the three sectors on Tuesday were wider for the month according to MarketAxess data.In contrast, roughly a fifth of issues in those sectors were tighter for November.“There are concerns that there will be more deals done and a lot of supply,” said Monica Erickson, a portfolio manager with asset manager DoubleLine Capital.Ms Erickson added that more borrowing could ensue if many of the largest tech companies brought their offshore cash home and fund acquisitions or share buybacks and dividends.A sense of market indigestion was highlighted by the second day performance of $7bn in bonds that had been sold by Apple on Monday.The deal attracted $16bn of investor orders. The iPhone maker’s new 10-year debt, the most actively traded corporate bond on Tuesday, changed hands with a spread of 77 basis points halfway through the trading day. That was up 5 basis points from the previous day.Oracle also tested investor appetite with a $10bn bond sale on Tuesday, in a deal it said the company said would fund general corporate purposes including share buybacks and dividends.That adds to the $261.5bn tech, media and telecom companies already have borrowed through US debt markets this year, an all-time high, according to Dealogic.“We’re at a time of year when there are a lot of issues [that] don’t have a lot of sponsorship,” added Matthew Freund, the chief investment officer of fixed income at Calamos. “It doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of real money buying.”
161;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-07T12:57:46Z;Broadcom-Qualcomm deal expected to face China challenge;Beijing regulators likely to want to protect domestic semiconductor groups;A proposed tie-up between rival semiconductor manufacturers Broadcom and Qualcomm is expected to come under particular regulatory scrutiny in China as authorities there look to protect domestic players in a key industrial sector. “Given China’s ambitions in the chip and mobile telecoms space, I can’t see the Chinese authorities taking kindly to a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger. It would likely create the biggest and most powerful player in the mobile chip market,” said a Hong Kong-based technology lawyer who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Broadcom on Monday unveiled an unsolicited $130bn bid for Qualcomm, which would be the single largest pure technology deal in history and create a $200bn manufacturing giant making semiconductors crucial for everything from smartphones to computers. Yet lawyers say the deal could encounter its biggest challenge in China, where policymakers are looking to foster domestic chip champions, such as SMIC and Tsinghua Unigroup, and reduce reliance on foreign companies. They say there is a growing chance that China could use its antitrust review to modify global deals or add commercial requirements to align with its own industrial policy. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has blocked a number of Chinese bids for US tech companies as the two countries become more protective over technology deals — an issue US President Donald Trump is likely to raise when he arrives in China on Wednesday. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, is one of 29 US business leaders accompanying the president on his trip. Although relatively nascent, China’s antitrust approval process has become an important consideration for global dealmakers. Since 2008, China’s ministry of commerce has required all deals involving parties with a combined global turnover exceeding Rmb10bn ($1.5bn) or combined China income exceeding Rmb2bn ($300m) — an unusually low filing threshold — to apply for Chinese merger approval. Although the Chinese government intervenes in a lower number of deals than its European counterparts, antitrust lawyers say the country has become more confident in delaying or changing deals. “There is a suspicion — but it is just a suspicion — that at least sometimes, China uses the review process to raise other concerns from stakeholders about a deal that may not be strictly antitrust,’’ said a Beijing-based M&A lawyer who declined to be named because of a client relationship. Mofcom introduced an expedited 30-day review process for more straightforward deals in 2014. However, a deal as big and significant as the potential Broadcom-Qualcomm merger would almost certainly be required to undergo the full 180-day approval process. “If a deal does not help Chinese economic growth, then it will not likely pass. [Mofcom] must see if the deal helps the domestic industry sector and policies, as well as global competition,” said Zhou Chunsheng, a finance professor at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. China typically prefers to make conditional approvals for deals rather than block them outright, for instance requesting that parties divest of assets within China or make commitments to certain market conditions for a limited period of time. “I expect Mofcom won’t go so far as to block the deal, but I expect they will ask for concessions and deals for Chinese companies,’’ said the Hong Kong technology lawyer. Both Broadcom and Qualcomm have previously come under Chinese regulatory scrutiny. In August, Mofcom conditionally approved Broadcom’s efforts to acquire telecoms company Brocade for $5.9bn, a deal that has been delayed by Cfius in the US. To gain Chinese approval, Broadcom must maintain transaction conditions of certain products for 10 years within China. In 2015, Qualcomm was forced to fork over a record $975m in fines after Mofcom found it guilty of charging Chinese customers both the cost of its products plus patent royalties.@emilyzfeng 
162;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-06T18:46:55Z;Broadcom seeks advantage over weakened Qualcomm;Largest tech deal faces significant challenges — not least from the US group itself;A year ago, Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf was riding high. The chipmaker was planning to take over rival NXP in the biggest deal ever in the sector. The resolution of regulatory investigation in China had unlocked a wave of new smartphone licensing deals in the world’s largest mobile market.In an interview with the FT last November, Mr Mollenkopf said he could “see a path” to his company becoming the world’s largest chipmaker.Then in January, Apple struck. One of Qualcomm’s largest customers hit it with the first blow in what would become a flurry of litigation and snowballing regulatory inquires over its pricing and alleged anti-competitive behaviour.By September, Qualcomm had lost a quarter of its value and its stock was trading close to its lowest point for several years.This week Qualcomm was presented with another shot at creating a challenger to Intel and Samsung as the world’s top chip supplier — but not in the manner that Mr Mollenkopf would have liked.An unsolicited $130bn takeover bid from rival Broadcom would create a semiconductor juggernaut, the world’s largest tech deal creating a one-stop shop for smartphone makers looking for everything from cutting-edge processors to wireless networking. But the timing and price looks opportunistic to its potential partner.Qualcomm’s board is only just beginning its evaluation of the proposal but people familiar with the company’s thinking say that the $70-per-share offer is well below what it would be prepared to accept, having traded close to that level just a year ago.They dismiss the bid as an attempt to capitalise on Qualcomm’s weaknesses, as it faces the prospect of a long fight with Apple and potential delays to closing the NXP deal. These people argue that the price disregards the company’s future earnings potential, especially as it builds towards its first deployment of next-generation 5G wireless networks by the end of the decade.And there is also the problem of form. Qualcomm’s board and senior management were not happy finding out about Broadcom’s potential offer through media reports on Friday afternoon, according to people close to the group.Qualcomm has hired advisers including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Sard Verbinnen in an effort to defend the company from opportunistic takeovers.But Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan will not be easily deterred. The Malaysian-born businessman is no stranger to complex takeover negotiations, having completed five significant deals in five years, including — as head of Avago — his $37bn takeover of the larger Broadcom in 2015.Talking to the FT, Mr Tan says that he was “still very hopeful . . . that both sides can agree on a mutually beneficial transaction”. He declines to comment on whether Broadcom would consider raising its bid, adding that “we have put forward what we think is a compelling offer” and pointing to his previous deal record as proof that the company is “disciplined acquirer”.Broadcom could even seek to put its own appointees on the board of Qualcomm by winning over existing shareholders in a so-called proxy battle ahead of Qualcomm’s AGM in 2018, say people informed on the matter.But it is not just Qualcomm’s management that might take issue with a deal bringing together two of the world’s largest suppliers of chips, which have become the essential technology behind the global shift to mobile devices, connected cars and equipment, and the ‘broader internet of things’.People familiar with Qualcomm’s thinking say that there are also concerns that the deal presents potentially insurmountable regulatory issues. According to Broadcom’s most recent regulatory filings, about half of its revenues in wired infrastructure overlap with Qualcomm and NXP, while nearly 30 per cent of its sales in wireless communications overlap with its San Jose rival.“A deal would face antitrust scrutiny in markets where Broadcom and Qualcomm have leading positions, such as integrated circuits used in global navigation satellite systems,” says Erik Gordon, professor at Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.“This approach from Broadcom is fraught with challenges and in its current form is highly unlikely to proceed,” adds Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight.The NXP deal could be key, according to analysts. Mr Tan says he would be prepared to press ahead with Qualcomm’s NXP deal, on the condition that the current $110 price does not increase as some shareholders in NXP have been agitating for in recent months.That combination would make the deal “much more transformational” than simply buying Qualcomm alone, says Karl Ackerman, analyst at Cowen.“The sensors, analogue, and near-field communications portfolio would solidify Qualcomm’s ability to set the 5G standard, which will be a key technology in autonomous vehicles and the industrial internet of things,” he says.Other Wall Street analysts are equally bullish on the financial benefits of the transaction, thanks to potential synergies. Crucially, while Qualcomm and Apple are at loggerheads, Broadcom has built a stronger relationship with the iPhone maker.“We think we can improve on and optimise their business model,” Mr Tan says. “We believe we can be very constrictive in their relationship with key global suppliers . . . We like to think we could generate a better financial return to shareholders through this constructive approach.”He says he would be “very practical” about the value of Qualcomm’s intellectual property — a key sticking point with Apple.“We believe there should be some reset in the business model,” he says, adding that he did not want to “talk out of school” before engaging with Qualcomm’s management.Yet Broadcom would have to face challenges internally as well as externally. Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, suggests that the cultural difficulties of integration would be even larger than they normally are with large-scale M&A.“It’s not the most friendly culture,” he says of the combined Broadcom and Avago. “A lot of people left after they merged because it is hard to work there. It’s not really a culture of R&D . . . It’s all about maximising profits.”Mr Tan calls that view “hogwash”.“When we buy a business we look at the strong, core sustainable product lines,” he says. “We very often invest even more than the original owners have invested in those businesses.”However, he says that many of his targets have “adjacent businesses that are really not core but they can’t help dabbling in. In those businesses, we tend to go through an asset rationalisation”.Some analysts have suggested that the same issue that could agitate regulators — creating a one-stop shop for key smartphone silicon including Bluetooth, WiFi and modems — would give the combined company greater negotiating power with the likes of Apple and Samsung.Mr Tan, however, is sceptical of that strategy. “Much as I’d love to dream about that, that doesn’t work,” he says, pointing out that even a $200bn chip company is small compared to Apple, the world’s most valuable company.“These guys are so much bigger than us,” he says. “They are the masters of the universe, I’m a mere mortal.”
163;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-06T18:11:04Z;Broadcom/Qualcomm: hosed;Hock Tan has failed to persuade investors a deal will happen;"Fireman Tan is trying to rescue Qualcomm shareholders from a burning building. They are acting like they do not want to be saved.Certainly, a whiff of smoke is coming from the house of Qualcomm. It is the only big chip stock to fall this year. It is fighting Apple, its biggest customer. And it is struggling to close its $39bn purchase of rival NXP.Broadcom, led by Hock Tan, is offering $70 a share for Qualcomm, including a 30 per cent premium. That bid stands whether NXP is acquired or not. And it is surely a first shot. Yet rather than leapfrog that price in anticipation of more to come, Qualcomm’s shares opened below $65 on Monday. Investors are unpersuaded that a deal will happen. Why?First, Qualcomm can put out the fires by itself. On Apple, Qualcomm could just agree a smaller cut of iPhone sales; it can afford to shave near-30 per cent operating margins. Broadcom suggests its superior relationship with Apple will speed a resolution. Perhaps. But Apple is not known for warm, fuzzy feelings towards suppliers.On NXP, shareholders are holding out for a bigger price. Qualcomm may get away with not paying it and even a face-saving bump would be worth it for the earnings enhancement.Second, Broadcom’s fire engine is likely to hit a jam. It was smart of Mr Tan to cosy up to President Donald Trump last week but that does not rule out an antitrust review. Encouragingly, there is little overlap in the companies. But rivals will cry foul.Third, Mr Tan’s debt ladder looks wobbly. Assume banks put up $113bn of debt — $88bn representing the cash component of the deal and $25bn for net debt carried by Qualcomm after it buys NXP. That is a giant sum and a high multiple at almost five times combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.It is perfectly reasonable to expect a quick pay-down. It is less logical to expect more cash in any higher bid. If Broadcom can reach $80 per share — which would be much harder for Qualcomm to turn down — it is likely to contain a bigger stock component. That is if Fireman Tan is willing to swing his axe that far.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is Broadcom’s offer for Qualcomm too big and complex to succeed?

After an MBA from Harvard and financial positions at General Motors and Pepsi, he moved into the tech industry in the early 1990s with a job at personal computer maker Commodore.Mr Tan said last week he was seeking to “give back” to the country that had given him a chance by moving Broadcom’s legal base and headquarters back to the US. It was, among other things, a gift to a US president who wants to be seen as a job creator.But what that narrative omitted was that Mr Tan also had a grand plan up his sleeve that relied on securing a stronger US base. He is now playing a bigger political game in which handing the president of the US a timely endorsement could pay big dividends.Just days after the White House appearance, Mr Tan went public with a bid for Qualcomm — and, potentially, NXP which Qualcomm is already trying to buy. Combining all three would put him at the helm of the world’s third-biggest chipmaker, behind Samsung and Intel.His willingness to seize opportunities has made Mr Tan the arch-consolidator amid a wave of dealmaking in the global semiconductor industry. His sense of timing, along with a relentless eye for costs and making the most of what have often been humdrum parts of the chip market, have led him to build a disparate group worth more than $100bn.Rather than just cutting expenses, Mr Tan has shown a willingness to invest in promising product lines, says Karl Ackerman, an analyst at Cowen. “He has a very strong record of growing and extracting value from niche product lines across a lot of different industries,” he says.Another person who has observed Mr Tan up close for years says he also has a strong strategic sense.That is about to face the ultimate testAs Mr Tan pointed out at the White House, his company, known until 2016 as Avago Technologies, has absorbed the legacy semiconductor businesses of three of the US’s most renowned research groups: AT&T’s Bell Labs, Hewlett-Packard and Broadcom. If he succeeds in adding Qualcomm to the list, he will have outflanked a good part of the entire US chip industry.
165;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-06T14:37:30Z;Hostilities loom as Qualcomm set to snub Broadcom’s $130bn;Chipmaker’s offer for rival would be biggest ever tech takeover;Broadcom paved the way for a hostile bid for Qualcomm on Monday as its California-chipmaking rival prepared to reject an initial $130bn unsolicited takeover offer.Broadcom left open the option that it could nominate a slate of directors and pursue the ouster of Qualcomm’s board members at its annual general meeting in March, setting the stage for a long and vicious battle between the two companies.A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would be the largest ever pure technology deal, create a company with a market value of more than $200bn and form a business that would be crucial to the production of smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone.Qualcomm confirmed that it had received Broadcom’s “unsolicited proposal” and said its directors would assess the $70 per share offer, which is comprised of $60 in cash and the reminder in stock.However, Qualcomm is not prepared to engage with Broadcom and is poised to rejected the offer on multiple grounds, several people informed on the matter told the Financial Times.Qualcomm believes the offer significantly undervalues its business and that the timing is opportunistic, as the target’s share price slumped in recent months due to a potentially damaging licensing dispute with Apple. Qualcomm also believes that any combination would face severe scrutiny from competition authorities, these people said.Under Qualcomm’s corporate rules, Broadcom has until early December to nominate directors who would then be voted on at a shareholder meeting scheduled for March. By doing so, Broadcom could appoint representatives who would be more open to its bid.The bid marks the culmination of a ferocious consolidation spree in the chip industry by Broadcom’s Hock Tan, who took the reins of what was then a modest private company in 2006 and transformed the company through a series of blockbuster deals.Shares in Qualcomm rose 1.7 per cent in early afternoon New York trading to $62.82, giving it a market value of $92.6bn and adding to its sharp gains from Friday when news of Broadcom’s planned approach leaked. Broadcom’s shares fell slightly to $272, reflecting a market value of around $111.4bn.The Broadcom offer was accompanied by a letter to Qualcomm’s board from Mr Tan, who defended the industrial rationale to combine the two companies, while playing down the antitrust risks.Mr Tan has overseen a wider consolidation of chipmaking businesses over the past decade, but his tilt at Qualcomm would be his most audacious yet.“We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination, and we do not anticipate any material antitrust or other regulatory issues,” he said.Five banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley — have lined up to provide financing to Broadcom. Silver Lake, the US private equity group that has played a crucial role in Broadcom’s transformation, has committed to providing $5bn convertible debt financing to support the offer.Broadcom said that its offer stands whether or not Qualcomm completes its planned $38bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which has yet to close amid antitrust concerns in Europe.Qualcomm’s mobile processors and modems, backed by a strong portfolio of intellectual property that underpins cellular communications in most modern mobile phones, have left it well placed as the rollout of 5G begins in the next few years.Broadcom sells a wide range of chip designs for networking equipment, from back-end telecoms infrastructure to the WiFi and Bluetooth controllers in the latest iPhones.Last week Mr Tan, a Malaysian-born executive educated at MIT and Harvard Business School, appeared at the White House alongside President Donald Trump to announce that Broadcom would switch its legal base and headquarters to the US, a decision that was seen as a prelude to further acquisitions. The move was expected to clear the way in the short term for Broadcom’s $5.5bn acquisition of Brocade.The company, formerly known as Avago, had its planned acquisition of Brocade held up by a security review in Washington after redomiciling to Singapore to capture tax breaks. That move came after a $37bn takeover of Broadcom in 2016, which saw the company take its target’s name.The offer comes as chipmakers are seeking to play a bigger role in the world of self-driving cars and the “internet of things”, while reducing their dependence on smartphone and PC makers. Since 2015, SoftBank has acquired the UK’s Arm Holdings for $32bn, Intel Corp bought Altera for $17bn and Qualcomm agreed to buy NXP.Broadcom is being advised by Moelis & Company as well as the five banks involved in the bid financing as well as law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Latham & Watkins.Qualcomm is working with Goldman Sachs and Evercore, while Paul Weiss is acting as its legal counsel.
166;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-06T14:13:40Z;Broadcom-Qualcomm pact would top past tech M&A mega-deals;;Broadcom on Monday unveiled a $130bn offer, including debt, to buy Qualcomm, a move that, if completed, would be the biggest M&A deal in the tech sector’s history. fastFT has a look at the deals that would be trumped by the move.Dell-EMC tie-upDell Technologies’ $64.6bn purchase of computer storage maker EMC, which was announced in 2015, currently tops the list, according to Dealogic data.The Financial Times said at the time:The acquisition is the most dramatic sign of the consolidation sweeping across the tech industry as IT companies react to the upheaval of cloud computing, and will create a company that rivals IBM as the largest IT supplier measured by revenues.BCE spins off Nortel stakeYou need to go back to the turn of the millennium to find the next-biggest deal.BCE, a Canadian telecom group, spun off its stake in network equipment maker Nortel Networks in a $61.2bn deal. BCE was concerned about the surging value of shares amid the dot-com bubble. The pact was announced in January 2000, just three months before the Nasdaq Composite peaked in a moment that is remembered as the beginning of the end of the tech bubble.This is a clipping of the FT article from January 27, 2000:EBay spins off PayPalNext up on the list is EBay’s spin-off of PayPal, the payments website. The deal, announced in September 2014, allowed EBay to focus on its main marketplace business. PayPal has a much higher value than Ebay, with a market capitalisation of $88.2bn compared with $39.2bn for its former parent.The FT wrote at the time:The company might be named eBay, but the part of the business to which that brand referred – its ecommerce Marketplaces – were not the group’s headline performers. That distinction went to PayPal, the payments business that has grown nearly twice as fast and with revenue now nearly on par.As a separate company, executives and analysts said, eBay can reinvest the profits it had been devoting to its faster growing subsidiary.“As a focused entity, it has very strong cash flow, it has very strong margins, and it will have the opportunity to invest its own cash flow and margins back into the growth of its business,” said John Donahoe, chief executive.
167;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-06T12:44:22Z;Qualcomm poised to reject Broadcom’s takeover offer;;Qualcomm is set to reject Broadcom’s takeover offer, as the US chipmaker views its rival’s $130bn proposal as too low and fraught with regulatory risks, people familiar with the matter said.Broadcom made a $70 per share cash-and-stock offer on Monday valuing Qualcomm at about $103bn, in what could be the largest tech deal in history. As part of the pact, Broadcom would also assume about $25bn in net debt.The offer made by Hock Tan, Broadcom chief executive, is seen as opportunistic and highly risky from an antitrust perspective by Qualcomm’s senior management, according to people briefed on the situation.One of these people said that a $70 per share offer was far from anything Qualcomm’s board would consider seriously.Another person added that the offer was opportunistic because Qualcomm’s share price has been depressed due to its licencing dispute with Apple. The shares traded as high as $81.97 in 2014, according to Reuters data.The person added that once Qualcomm gets regulatory approval for its $38bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors and solves the dispute with Apple, the stock would trade significantly higher.
168;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Broadcom proposes $130bn deal to buy Qualcomm;;Broadcom unveiled on Monday a much awaited $130bn offer, including net debt, for Qualcomm, in what could be the largest tech deal in history.Under Broadcom’s proposal, Qualcomm shareholders would receive $70 per share – $60 in cash and $10 in shares of its rival. It would value Qualcomm’s equity at roughly $103bn.The offer represents a 28 per cent premium over Qualcomm’s stock price on November 2, after it first emerged that Broadcom was preparing an offer.Broadcom also said that its offer stands whether or not Qualcomm completes its $38bn acquisition of NXP, which has yet to close.If completed, it would be the biggest ever takeover in the technology sector and create a company with a combined market capitalisation of more than $200bn.Hock Tan, chief executive officer and master dealmaker behind Broadcom, said the “proposal is compelling for stockholders and stakeholders in both companies. Our proposal provides Qualcomm stockholders with a substantial and immediate premium in cash for their shares, as well as the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company.”Image source: Reuters
169;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-05T17:52:02Z;Broadcom’s dealmaker readies $100bn bid for Qualcomm;Successful move by Hock Tan would cap run of big deals in semiconductor industry;Hock Tan, the master dealmaker behind Broadcom, was putting the finishing touches to his most ambitious deal yet on Sunday as the chipmaker prepared an unsolicited $100bn bid for Qualcomm.If Mr Tan is ultimately successful in convincing Qualcomm’s board, its shareholders and regulators of the merits of the merger, it will cap a stunning run of multibillion-dollar deals for the semiconductor industry in general and Broadcom in particular. If completed, it would be the biggest ever takeover in the technology sector and create a company with a combined market capitalisation of more than $200bn.Chipmakers are jostling for position amid the shift from an industry dominated by PCs and smartphones into a world of self-driving cars and the heterogeneous “internet of things”, all fuelled by the emergence of 5G wireless networking. That has already triggered Softbank’s $32bn takeover of Arm and Intel’s $17bn purchase of Altera, as well as Qualcomm’s recent $39bn bid for NXP.Qualcomm’s mobile processors and modems, backed by a strong portfolio of intellectual property that underpins cellular communications in most modern mobile phones, have left it well placed as 5G rollout begins in the next few years.Broadcom sells a wide range of chip designs for networking equipment, from back-end telecoms infrastructure to the WiFi and Bluetooth controllers in the latest iPhones. However, its weakness in current 4G/LTE networking technology leaves it at a potential disadvantage for the next wave, analysts say.“Net net, Broadcom needs LTE and 5G capability that they don't have today,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “That’s what this comes down to. What comes with it, though, is a ton of complexity. There is a lot of overlap in WiFi and Bluetooth, which could absolutely raise the ire of the regulators.” Yet Mr Tan, a Malaysia-born 65-year-old who has a background in engineering and finance, has not been daunted by either regulatory or financing hurdles in the past.In 2015, as the head of Avago, Mr Tan launched an audacious $37bn takeover of Broadcom, a company almost twice its acquirer’s size by revenues in what was then the biggest deal in the chip industry.With its origins inside Hewlett-Packard’s semiconductors division, Avago had gone public in 2009. In 2014 it bought LSI, which makes networking and storage chips, for $6.6bn.What ultimately became Broadcom now has joint headquarters in San Jose, California — in the heart of Silicon Valley — and Singapore. Last week, Mr Tan shook hands with President Donald Trump in the White House as he announced Broadcom’s move to domicile the company in the US.At the time, that move was seen as an attempt to smooth regulatory approval of another big deal that was already in motion, Broadcom's $5.9bn acquisition of Brocade.Now, Broadcom’s expected cash-and-stock bid for Qualcomm would take advantage of the two companies’ divergent share prices. Broadcom’s stock is up almost 60 per cent in the past 12 months, including Friday’s 5.5 per cent jump as news of the potential deal emerged.Qualcomm, whose licensing revenues has been dented by a fast-escalating legal battle with Apple and its largest suppliers over pricing and alleged anti-competitive behaviour, has not traded above Broadcom’s anticipated $70-per-share offer price for more than two years. Its market capitalisation on Friday stood at $91bn, with Broadcom at $112bn. To pull off the blockbuster deal, Broadcom has lined up huge levels of debt financing with several top Wall Street banks, according to people familiar with the matter. However, several cash-and-stock offers have struggled to win acceptance by acquirers in recent months because of concern that the market is close to its peak. By noon on Sunday in New York, Qualcomm had not yet received any offer. People close to the company have indicated that its leadership would prefer to remain independent and pursue its own growth strategy.
170;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-03T22:21:28Z;Broadcom plans $100bn unsolicited bid for Qualcomm;Mooted deal, to be presented this weekend, would be largest in semiconductor industry;Broadcom is planning to make an unsolicited takeover bid for Qualcomm that could value its rival US chipmaker at more than $100bn, according to two people briefed on its plans.The Singapore-headquartered chipmaker’s advisers are planning to present an offer to Qualcomm as early as this weekend in what would be the largest ever semiconductor deal, those people added.One person close to Broadcom said the offer for Qualcomm would be about $70 per share, a level the stock has not seen for more than two years.Shares in Qualcomm rose 12.7 per cent on Friday in New York to close at $61.81, giving the company a market value of $91.1bn. Broadcom climbed 5.5 per cent to $273.63, making it worth $111.6bn. Any deal between the two companies would face significant regulatory scrutiny, given the already heavy level of consolidation in the chip industry.As part of its proposal, Broadcom is willing to also buy NXP, which Qualcomm agreed to buy in 2016 in a $38bn deal that is yet to complete due to a continuing antitrust investigation.Broadcom’s offer comes after months of weakness in Qualcomm’s stock, as its legal battle with Apple over wireless chip pricing, patents and alleged anticomptitive behaviour has continued to escalate.A deal would cap an acquisition binge which has made Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, the chip industry’s leading dealmaker in a period of heightened consolidation. Starting out as Avago, a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard’s chip division, the company has mounted a series of purchases of companies that had once appeared out of its reach.These included a $6.6bn purchase of LSI in 2013, a $600m deal for Emulex in 2015 and $37bn acquisition of Broadcom in 2016, which allowed the company to redomicile its base to Singapore and capture a lower tax rate in a so-called tax inversion. Avago was renamed Broadcom after the deal.Mr Tan said on Thursday that Broadcom would switch its legal base and headquarters to the US, a move that was seen as a prelude to further acquisitions. The move, which he announced in the the Oval Office alongside President Donald Trump, was expected to clear the way in the short term for Broadcom’s $5.5bn acquisition of Brocade, which has been held up by a security review in Washington because Broadcom’s legal base is outside the US. But analysts said it would also remove a barrier which stood in the way of Broadcom’s next phase of acquisition-fuelled growth.A famously cost-conscious operator, Mr Tan’s round of dealmaking has had the backing of Silver Lake, the technology private equity firm. Silver Lake mounted a buyout of Avago in 2005, along with KKR, before taking it public again in 2009.For Qualcomm, an approach would come as it continues to struggle to close its planned acquisition of Europe’s NXP Semiconductors, which was agreed in October 2016. In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive, said that there was a good chance of the deal’s closing moving into next year.Shares in Qualcomm were battered this week by poor quarterly results, which saw profits plunge sharply, and by reports that Apple is preparing new iPhones and iPads without components from the chipmaker.Before the gains late on Friday, the company’s stock had fallen close to 18 per cent over the past year. That compares with a 50 per cent jump in the share price of Broadcom in the same period.Meanwhile, shares in New York-listed NXP fell 2.1 per cent to $115.02.Bloomberg first reported that Broadcom was considering a bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm declined to comment.
171;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Broadcom/Qualcomm: narrow path;Praising the president is a great start to this megadeal, but there are other issues;Broadcom’s chief executive was in the Oval Office this week, announcing that the chipmaker would move its domicile to the US. Hock Tan took the opportunity to praise President Donald Trump. Wise man. With uncanny timing, Broadcom is now trying to acquire fellow chipmaker Qualcomm in a deal that would naturally draw the attention of Mr Trump’s antitrust police.Soaring valuations have been blamed for the lack of tech acquisitions this year. In selecting Qualcomm as its prey, Broadcom has alighted on one of the few poor performers. But even if Broadcom surmounts antitrust concerns, a deal between the two chipmakers comes with a laundry list of challenges and a still-fearsome price.Of the world’s top 30 semiconductor companies, Qualcomm is the only one to have suffered a share price decline in 2017. Before its shares rose on news of a potential takeover bid, Qualcomm was down 16 per cent compared with a 40 per cent increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.That hardly screams bargain, though: the weakness is well-grounded and still leaves a market value of $90bn. Qualcomm also has $15bn of net cash, but plans to spend all of it, and to borrow an additional $23bn, for its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. Broadcom has a $110bn market capitalisation but is reportedly planning a mainly cash bid — requiring huge loans since it already has $14bn of net debt.The NXP deal — for now, the largest agreed semiconductor deal on record, according to Dealogic data — could be unwound but Broadcom apparently wants it, too. That requires alleviating one of Qualcomm’s existing headaches. NXP shareholders, led by Elliott Management, are agitating for a higher price. This bumpatrage had looked likely to succeed. NXP’s shares have been trading above the offer price for three months. On Friday, though, they fell on the possibility that a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal might exclude NXP.If Broadcom navigates that situation it then has to consider Qualcomm’s war with the richest company in the world. Apple has sued Qualcomm, annoyed at the price charged to license mobile chip technology. With Apple increasing the pressure by considering alternative manufacturers, the situation is a messy one for an acquirer to wade into.Broadcom would need to broker peace, without sacrificing too much of the margin expansion that the consolidation of the two companies should otherwise allow.Mr Tan’s trip to the White House is only the start of some exhausting diplomacy.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Will Broadcom prevail?
172;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Broadcom open to buying NXP in addition to Qualcomm;;Broadcom is prepared to buy NXP Semiconductors in addition to acquiring Qualcomm as part of its effort to create a global chipmaking giant to compete with Chinese rivals, people familiar with the matter said.This comes as the Singapore-headquartered chipmaker plans to make an unsolicited takeover bid for Qualcomm that could value its rival at more than $100bn, people briefed on its plans added.As part of its proposal, Broadcom is willing to also buy NXP, which Qualcomm acquired for $38bn in 2016 but has yet to complete the deal amid continued regulatory scrutiny.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the FT this week that the NXP deal could take until early next year to close.“We think this thing is going to close in 2017 although we do believe there is a possibility it could leak into 2018,” Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the FT in an interview on Wednesday as it reported its latest quarterly numbers. “We are not seeing anything we didn’t expect to see, it’s just taking a little longer.”
173;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Broadcom readies $100bn unsolicited bid for Qualcomm;;Broadcom is planning to make an unsolicited takeover bid for Qualcomm that could value its rival US chipmaker more than $100bn, according to two people briefed on its plans.The Singapore-headquartered chipmaker’s advisors are planning to present an offer to Qualcomm as early as this weekend in what would be the largest ever semiconductor deal, those people added.One person close to Broadcom said the offer for Qualcomm would be around $70 per share, a level the stock has not seen in more than two years. A $70 a share offer would also represents a 28 per cent premium to Qualcomm’s Thursday closing price.Shares in Qualcomm rose 12.5 per cent in mid-afternoon New York trading to $61.65, giving the company a market value of $90.5bn. Broadcom climbed 4.5 per cent to $271, making it worth $110.5bn.Bloomberg first reported that Broadcom was considering a bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm declined to comment.
174;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-03T18:05:51Z;Qualcomm shares jump on reports of Broadcom bid interest;;Qualcomm shares surged more than 17 per cent in early afternoon trading on Friday amid reports that rival chipmaker Broadcom is exploring a takeover of the $91bn company.According to Bloomberg, Broadcom, which boasts a market value of $107bn, is speaking to advisers about a potential deal.A separate report from the Wall Street Journal said Broadcom could launch its unsolicited approach as soon as this weekend.A move to acquire Qualcomm is likely to be complicated given that the San Diego-based chipmaker is in the midst of trying to close its own $38bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. Any deal is also expected to be challenged by antitrust regulators given the size of the two companies.Still that did little to discourage investors from bidding Qualcomm shares up 17.71 per cent to $64.17.Broadcom shares gained 3.2 per cent to $267.65, while NXP fell 2.9 per cent to $114.01.
175;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-11-01T21:12:39Z;Qualcomm chief says NXP takeover could be delayed until 2018;;Qualcomm’s blockbuster $38bn buyout of NXP could take until early next year to complete, as regulatory scrutiny of the chip industry’s largest ever deal continues.“We think this thing is going to close in 2017 although we do believe there is a possibility it could leak into 2018,” Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the FT in an interview on Wednesday as it reported its latest quarterly numbers. “We are not seeing anything we didn’t expect to see, it’s just taking a little longer.”European antitrust regulators have been extending their in-depth review in recent months. Mr Mollenkopf did not comment on last month’s reports that Qualcomm has offered to jettison certain NXP patents in order to salve concerns that it might squeeze out rivals.Dealing with several regulatory agencies around the world over NXP is just one of the legal challenges facing Qualcomm, which is also fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour from Apple, one of its largest customers.Qualcomm saw its shares fall around 7 per cent on Tuesday after the FT and other media reported that Apple might drop its modems from next year’s iPhones altogether, amid the ongoing legal row.“I would caution people from reacting to any one rumour,” Mr Mollenkopf said when asked about the potential iPhone design loss. “We are pretty happy with the way we sit with our [product] roadmap.”Qualcomm’s shares, which closed up around 5 per cent on Wednesday, rose another 1 per cent in extended trading.The share price gains come as Qualcomm beat Wall Street’s forecasts with its fiscal fourth-quarter results.Revenues were down 5 per cent year-on-year to $5.9bn, after Apple and four of its contract manufacturers decided to withhold royalty payments while their litigation continues. “We expect these licensees will continue to take such actions in the future until the respective disputes are resolved,” Qualcomm said in its report.Nonetheless, Mr Mollenkopf said that its separate semiconductor business saw a “very solid quarter”, with “broad strength” in China and other newer markets. “It’s a good solid beat [to Wall Street’s forecasts] on strong execution,” he said.Net income slumped 89 per cent from $1.6bn to $168m in the three months to September 24, as the hit to its highly profitable licensing business from the Apple case was compounded by a $778m fine from the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission.Qualcomm said the first quarter of fiscal 2017 could see revenues of $5.5bn-6.3bn, a range suggesting a decrease of 8 per cent to an increase of 5 per cent on the prior year, with increases in its chip business offset by further declines in licensing revenues.
176;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-31T17:08:25Z;Apple wrangle on parts sends Qualcomm shares lower;Dispute over components at heart of every iPhone causes investor jitters;Qualcomm shares tumbled on Tuesday over investors’ rising concerns that Apple might dump the chipmaker’s components entirely from its iPhones and iPads as soon as next year.The two companies are already locked in a multi-faceted legal battle over the pricing, intellectual property and terms of supply of the wireless modems that stand at the heart of every iPhone. Apple is considering switching away from Qualcomm for its modem supplies and instead tapping rivals such as Intel, according people familiar with the matter.Intel already supplies some of the modems in the latest iPhone models but Qualcomm currently provides some technologies that are necessary for connecting to every mobile network around the world.Some analysts have predicted a complete switch for months, as the two companies’ litigation widened to include four iPhone manufacturers and an attempt by Qualcomm to ban sales or imports of the smartphone in several parts of the world. Nonetheless, Qualcomm shares were down more than 7 per cent on Tuesday morning, after a news report on Apple’s potential move in the Wall Street Journal.Qualcomm’s stock is on track for its worst day since January 23. That was when news emerged of Apple’s lawsuit accusing the chipmaker of abusing its dominant position in the mobile modem market.At issue in their latest tussle is whether Qualcomm has supplied Apple’s engineers with all the tools and technologies necessary to test and build the modem component into future iPhones. Qualcomm supplied its modem to Apple several weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter, and a final decision on component supply is not usually taken until several months into next year, raising questions about why the dispute has emerged now. Both companies are reporting their quarterly earnings later this week.In a statement, Qualcomm said: “The Qualcomm modem that could be used in the next generation iPhone has already been fully tested and released to Apple. We are committed to supporting Apple’s new devices consistent with our support of all others in the industry. Qualcomm’s wireless solutions remain the gold standard for premium tier smartphones.”Apple declined to comment.Chris Caso, analyst at Raymond James, said that while a full exclusion of Qualcomm’s componentry was possible, it was not likely due to the legal and technical risks involved for Apple of relying only on Intel, which has only recently started producing modems capable of supporting the iPhone. Qualcomm is attempting at the US International Trade Commission to obtain an injunction preventing Apple from importing iPhones that use other providers’ modems. “Were Apple to completely exclude Qualcomm for next year’s iPhone, it would essentially eliminate Apple’s back-up plan in the event of such an injunction,” Mr Caso said in a note to clients on Tuesday.Additionally, he said, Intel’s new modem is the first to support CDMA networks, which are used by mobile operators including Verizon Wireless, bringing “inherent risks” for Apple if the rollout does not go smoothly.Mr Caso estimates that for 2018 Qualcomm’s share of iPhone modems will drop to 30 per cent, from 50 per cent at present.
177;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-31T14:49:00Z;Qualcomm shares slide on report that Apple will drop its components;;"Qualcomm shares tumbled on Tuesday following a report the Apple will dump the chipmaker’s components in iPhones and iPads that it is designing for next year.Qualcomm shares were down 7.4 per cent to $50.61 at pixel time and were on track for their worst day since January.The WSJ said that Apple’s move comes as Qualcomm withheld software needed to test its chip in the tech giant’s iPhone and iPad prototypes and that it was now considering building those devices with components from Intel and MediaTek.The two companies have been engaged in a long-running legal battle that saw the mobile chipmaker accuse Apple of patent infringement in a Beijing court. Qualcomm said it was seeking an injunction that would halt both sales and manufacture of iPhones in China and seeking sales or import bans in the US and Germany.Chris Caso, analyst at Raymond James, notes that while a full exclusion is possible, it is not likely. He points to two reasons that such a move would be risky for Apple.First is simply carrier acceptance and qualification; while Intel’s new modem does support CDMA, it will be their first generation CDMA device, which carries inherent risks. In addition, Qualcomm has a patent infringement case against Apple pending at the ITC, with the first rulings due later in 2018. If Qualcomm were to be successful at ITC, the likely remedy would be an injunction against non-Qualcomm iPhones to prevent import to the U.S. Were Apple to completely exclude Qualcomm for next year’s iPhone, it would essentially eliminate Apple’s backup plan in the event of such an injunction.Mr Caso estimates that for 2018 Qualcomm’s share of iPhone modems will drop to 30 per cent, from 50 per cent at present."
178;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-19T12:03:56Z;LG/Qualcomm: driverless car share;Investment in the connected car parts industry cleverly utilises existing expertise;LG Electronics, the South Korean conglomerate famous for flatscreen TVs and washing machines, is planning an altogether racier project in autonomous vehicles. On Thursday, the group announced a collaboration with chipmaker Qualcomm to develop auto network technology. Shares popped 7 per cent. The tie-up is a good idea but investors should temper their expectations.Even before the jump, shares in LG Electronics had nearly doubled over the past 12 months. The rally is driven by record profits from sales of TVs and home appliances. Meanwhile LG’s smartphone unit continues to suffer losses. Investment in the connected car parts industry cleverly utilises existing expertise in that suffering sector. It helps that competitors in the field are rare. The market for car-related chip technology, in which Qualcomm and Infineon compete, is more crowded.LG Chem — a sister company under LG Group— is a leading supplier of batteries for electric vehicles. As such the electronics group is looking beyond its own shortcomings in the mobile phone market. A partnership could make the push even more convincing.Autonomous driving technology has a clearer path to implementation than the advent of massive fleets of battery-driven cars. LG Electronics stands a strong chance of inserting itself into an industry that requires fast wireless connectivity and entertainment for bored passengers — two areas in which the group has rich experience.So far, however, the vehicle unit loses money. Measured by revenues it is also the smallest, albeit the fastest growing, of the group’s four businesses. The deal with Qualcomm is about research, not profits.The tie-up alone is therefore not worth the Won1tn ($900m) gain in market capitalisation. With LG Electronics’ ratio of stock price to earnings close to its five-year average the potential benefits have been more than priced in.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

179;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-19T05:27:59Z;LG shares surge to 6-yr high on Qualcomm autonomous driving tie-up;;Shares of LG Electronics surged to a six-year high on news of its research tie-up with Qualcomm to strengthen its competitiveness in the burgeoning self-driving auto parts industry.LG shares jumped 5.42 per cent to Won95,300 on Thursday afternoon after jumping nearly 8 per cent in morning trade, outperforming a 0.5 per cent fall in the Kospi benchmark index.The two technology giants have agreed to open a joint research lab in Seoul to develop a telecoms solution for autonomous driving, integrating LG’s strength in connected car parts and Qualcomm’s advanced communications chipset technology.LG said the technology solution that it will develop with the US chipmaker will bolster telecoms connectivity among cars, related infrastructure and even pedestrians to ensure safe autonomous driving. The 5G auto network technology to be developed by the two companies will be about four to five times faster than the long-term evolution (LTE) network used for self-driving cars, LG said.The South Korean company has expanded components supply for electric vehicles such as GM’s Bolt. Analysts expect LG to emerge as a major player in the connected car parts industry thanks to its vertical integration with affiliates including battery maker LG Chem, display maker LG Display and camera module supplier LG Innotek.Local brokerage Eugene Investment & Securities estimates sales of LG’s auto parts business to reach up to Won7tn in 2020 from Won2.8tn last year. LG reported Won1.8tn in auto parts sales in the first half of this year. But the business remains in the red because of huge initial investments.
180;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-17T01:35:50Z;Qualcomm claims victory in 5G ultrafast wireless race;Chipset’s speed of 1 gigabit a second raises stakes for rivals in broadband battle ;Qualcomm’s is claiming a world first in the race to bring ultrafast wireless technology to the market by showcasing the first working 5G data connection to a mobile device.The demonstration, conducted in Qualcomm’s San Diego labs and released in a video at a Hong Kong event on Tuesday, will up the ante against rivals such as Intel and Huawei in the battle for the next generation of mobile broadband. In the test, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X50 NR modem chipset achieved speeds of up to 1 gigabit, or 1,000 megabits, per second — several times faster than the 4G LTE wireless networks that are used by today’s smartphones. “This major milestone and our 5G smartphone reference design showcase how Qualcomm Technologies is driving 5G NR in mobile devices to enhance mobile broadband experiences for consumers around the world,” said Cristiano Amon, executive vice-president at Qualcomm Technologies. The chipmaker said commercial launches of 5G smartphones and networks would begin in the first half of 2019. That timetable is more aggressive than many in the wireless industry had envisaged, thanks to changes announced earlier this year by 3GPP, the standards body that governs cellular networks such as 5G. Analysts expect 5G take-up by mobile operators and handset makers to be more rapid around the world than it has been for 4G. Research group CCS Insight predicts that 300m 5G smartphones will be sold by 2021 — about 15 per cent of total global shipments. Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight, said of Qualcomm’s announcement: “This is an important step along the road to 5G and commercial devices in 2019 and is consistent with expectations that Qualcomm will carry its 4G strength into the next generation.”However, he warned that with 5G still in early trials, it is “difficult to draw firm conclusions” about which companies will prove the winners. Qualcomm is the industry’s largest standalone vendor of smartphone modems but it faces increasing competition in mobile processors from in-house chip units at Apple, Samsung and Huawei. Meanwhile Intel, whose modems Apple has started to incorporate into some of its iPhones, is also ramping up its investment in 5G. Intel stands to benefit from the huge increase in the number of connected devices and the data that they create, which 5G is expected to trigger, Mr Blaber said.“The industry likes to focus on the battle between Intel and Qualcomm but the reality is different,” he said. “Intel faces a challenge in rivalling Qualcomm in modem technology but its real strength is in the data centre as 5G becomes a [computational] as much as a connectivity challenge.”Slowing growth in the smartphone market makes harnessing the move to 5G all the more important for Qualcomm and its rivals. CCS predicts that smartphone shipments will grow by 4.4 per cent to 1.5bn this year and reach 1.9bn by 2021 — a compound annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent between 2016 and 2021.
181;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-13T18:06:23Z;Qualcomm seeks iPhone sales and manufacturing ban in China;;Qualcomm has made its most dramatic legal move yet in its long-running battle against Apple, by seeking to halt manufacturing of the iPhone in China.The mobile chipmaker has accused Apple of patent infringement in a Beijing court. It is seeking an injunction that would halt both sales and manufacture of iPhones in China, where the vast majority of the devices are produced.The move means that Qualcomm is now seeking iPhone sales or import bans in the US, Germany and China, which together make up many of Apple’s largest markets.Qualcomm confirmed the legal action, which was first reported by Bloomberg, but did not provide further comment. The legal filing was originally made at the end of September.Apple’s shares were little changed by the news by lunchtime in New York, trading 0.5 per cent higher at $156.86. Qualcomm too was flat at $52.97.Apple said in response that Qualcomm’s claim is meritless.“Apple believes deeply in the value of innovation, and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. In our many years of ongoing negotiations with Qualcomm, these patents have never been discussed and in fact were only granted in the last few months. Regulators around the world have found Qualcomm guilty of abusing their position for years. This claim is meritless and, like their other courtroom maneuvers, we believe this latest legal effort will fail.Apple and Qualcomm are embroiled in a wide-ranging legal battle around the world, chiefly over pricing and patents. In January, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for intellectual property related to cellular wireless technologies. In July, four of Apple’s largest suppliers in Asia joined its legal battle against Qualcomm, alleging anti-competitive behaviour and breaches of contract.Qualcomm has sued the same four suppliers for refusing to pay royalties, at Apple’s request. The San Diego-based chipmaker has accused Apple of using its “enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable licence terms”, as well as patent infringement. It denies overcharging for the 3G and 4G technology that it claims provides an essential foundation for every smartphone.As the dispute escalates, Qualcomm is facing a squeeze to its profits as Apple halts royalty payments. It is also fighting regulatory battles around the world. On Wednesday, it was hit by a record $774m fine by regulators in Taiwan. The Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position over certain key mobile phone chips by refusing to provide products to clients that do not agree with its conditions. Qualcomm has said it will appeal.The latest step in its Apple fight is not Qualcomm’s first legal tangle in China.In 2015, China’s National Development and Reform Commission found that Qualcomm violated its anti-monopoly law, fining it $975m and forcing the chipmaker to make changes to how it does business in the region. The resolution of that investigation unlocked a new wave of licensing agreements for Qualcomm in China.
182;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-12T12:01:07Z;China/US 5G: wavelength warfare;Chinese push for bigger share in design of next spectrum should worry Qualcomm;Qualcomm is under attack for its dominant position in intellectual property for mobile chips. On Wednesday the US chipmaker was hit with a T$23.4bn (US$774m) fine by Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission.A lower-profile skirmish over chips for the forthcoming 5G standard could be more consequential, however. China is pushing for a bigger share in the design of the next generation of mobile data services. If it succeeds, Qualcomm will be hurt, equipment makers such as ZTE and Huawei will benefit and operators such as China Mobile will pay the bill.The US chip group owns 12.5 per cent of patents essential for the current 4G standard, according to Jefferies. Qualcomm recorded royalty revenues of $4.4bn in the nine months to June. China is the largest mobile market — China Mobile alone has 873m customers — but the nation’s share of intellectual property has historically been small.The intellectual future involves more Sino influence. China owns a tenth of essential 5G patents, Jefferies notes. The country has moved to strengthen its role in the international regulatory bodies. So much so that US officials have complained about efforts by “authoritarian governments” to influence future networks.The future of the standard rests in large part on the international co-operation necessary to make sure devices and protocols work across borders. The most basic difference between the approaches of the two countries concerns which frequencies 5G should use. US companies claim an advantage in high frequency millimetre waves. China will likely aim to be a first mover with its lower frequency approach, in hopes of swaying undecided countries.Mobile operators will have to bear most of the costs of implementation — estimated at Rmb1.65tn ($250bn) to 2025 by government researchers. Equipment manufacturers and patent owners will benefit via higher royalties. Shares in ZTE more than doubled this year. Investors betting on the group must simultaneously believe in the success of China’s patent push.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

183;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-11T18:31:42Z;Qualcomm handed record $774m antitrust fine in Taiwan;Regulator follows Korea in ruling chipmaker has abused its mobile phone dominance;Regulators in Taiwan have become the latest to slap US chipmaker Qualcomm with an antitrust fine.The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday it had fined the San Diego-based company T$23.4bn (US$774m), accusing it of abusing its dominant position over certain key mobile phone chips by refusing to provide products to clients that do not agree with its conditions.The penalty is the largest handed out to a single company since the Taiwanese antitrust authority was established. Regulators claimed Qualcomm had been violating antitrust rules for at least seven years. During this time, it sold $30bn worth of chips to local companies and collected $13bn in licensing fees from them, Taiwan alleged. The ruling is another regulatory blow for Qualcomm, which is fighting a wide-ranging legal battle against Apple, one of its largest customers, over pricing and patents. South Korean regulators last December hit Qualcomm with a fine of about $850m for violating competition laws with its patent licensing and chip sales. That was followed in January by the US Federal Trade Commission charging Qualcomm with anti-competitive behaviour. The wireless chipmaker has consistently denied wrongdoing and defended its business model in the US and Korean cases. Qualcomm said in a statement that it “disagrees with the decision” announced on Wednesday and planned to appeal. The chipmaker hopes to be able to “stay” any required changes to its business practices while it appeals. The appeal process will begin after the Taiwanese FTC’s formal decision is handed down in the next few weeks.“The fine bears no rational relationship to the amount of Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan, and Qualcomm will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” Qualcomm said.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Wednesday that the $773m fine represented less than 5 per cent of Qualcomm’s current net cash balance. “The fine represents an incremental overhang in slew challenges impacting the company’s licensing business,” RBC said. “However, we believe [investor] sentiment has become overly pessimistic.”Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he expected the impact on Qualcomm to be short-term. “There will be lots of debate on whether the TFTC is acting as a price-fixer to shield the country’s modem makers and phone manufacturers. I don’t think this ruling will have an impact on the EU or the US. Korea could find inspiration out of it, but that ruling is already being appealed.“Qualcomm holds intellectual property that is central to how 3G and 4G networks operate, and supplies cellular chips and processors to many of the world’s mobile device makers. It is also fighting to get its planned $38bn acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP approved by the European Commission.A notice this week posted to the commission’s website said Qualcomm had offered certain concessions to get the deal approved. Reuters reported that Qualcomm had offered to exclude NXP’s standard essential patents from its takeover offer.Meanwhile, some shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott, have been pushing Qualcomm to increase its offer for NXP. In a note to clients this week, Morgan Stanley said discussions with investors pointed “overwhelmingly” to a higher bid. Qualcomm’s stock, down 18.6 per cent over the past 12 months, dipped on opening but recovered after news of the appeal to trade slightly higher at $54.28.
184;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-11T14:03:09Z;Taiwan hits Qualcomm with $773m antitrust fine;;Regulators in Taiwan have become the latest to slap US chipmaker Qualcomm with an antitrust fine.The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday that it has fined the San Diego-based company $NT23.4bn ($773m), accusing it of abusing its dominant position over certain key mobile phone chips by refusing to provide products to clients who don’t agree with its conditions.Regulators claimed Qualcomm has been violating antitrust rules for at least seven years. During this time it sold $30bn worth of chips to local companies and collected NT$400bn in licensing fees from them, Taiwan alleged.Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The penalty is the largest handed out to a single company since the Taiwanese antitrust authority was established. It also marks the latest blow to Qualcomm, which has been hit in recent years by similar fines by anti-competition regulators in the EU, as well as China and South Korea.Qualcomm supplies cellular chips to many of the world’s mobile device makers, including Apple and Samsung, and holds intellectual property central to how 3G and 4G networks operate.The stock, down 18.6 per cent over the past 12 months, dipped 0.1 per cent lower in early trading on Wednesday.
185;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-10-06T17:42:39Z;Apple’s chief lawyer retires as it battles Qualcomm and Samsung;Bruce Sewell also led fight against FBI demand for help breaking iPhone encryption;Apple’s top lawyer, who has guided it through battles with Samsung and Qualcomm and taken on the US government over iPhone security, is retiring, as the Silicon Valley company brings in a new general counsel from Honeywell.Bruce Sewell, who is 59, became Apple’s general counsel in 2009 and will step down at the end of the year.Kate Adams, formerly of US industrial conglomerate Honeywell, will take a seat on Apple’s executive team, reporting directly to chief executive Tim Cook, and lead global security, as part of her new role as general counsel. Mr Sewell’s departure comes as Apple is taking on Qualcomm on several fronts, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for its wireless modem technology and patents, in a legal battle that has also embroiled several of the iPhone’s top suppliers in Asia. Its patent battle against Samsung over iPhone designs is still rolling through the courts.Apple is also fighting the European Commission over what Brussels claims is €13bn in illegal tax benefits from Ireland. This week, the EU said it would take Ireland to court to force it to recover the sum from Apple. “The move takes on greater significance given the number of battles Apple is facing in and out of the courtroom,” said Neil Cybart, an Apple analyst at Above Avalon.“While there is never a perfect time for such a transition, it makes sense for Apple to pass on the baton to a new general counsel sooner rather than later given the company’s intensifying war with Qualcomm.”Mr Cook said in a statement on Friday that he was thrilled to welcome Ms Adams, who will help steer the company’s legal strategy on issues ranging from customer privacy to intellectual property. “She’s a seasoned leader with outstanding judgment and has worked on a wide variety of legal cases globally. Throughout her career she’s also been an advocate on many of the values we at Apple hold dear,” he said.He also thanked Mr Sewell for having “tirelessly defended our IP, our customers’ right to privacy and our values”.Apple has used privacy and security issues to differentiate itself from Silicon Valley rivals such as Google and Amazon.In 2016, it found itself in conflict with the US government, when FBI investigators into the San Bernardino shooting asked for assistance in circumventing the encryption that locked the attacker’s iPhone.Apple, whose legal response was led by Mr Sewell, argued that it could not help the FBI break into the device because doing so would compromise all its customers’ security. Ms Adams said that she was “excited to help Apple continue to grow and evolve around the world, protecting their ideas and IP, and defending our shared values”.To replace Ms Adams, Honeywell on Friday named Anne Madden, who has served as vice-president of corporate development and global head of mergers & acquisitions since 2002, as its new general counsel.Before joining Apple, Mr Sewell worked in Intel’s legal team for many years. He also serves as a director of Vail Resorts, which owns ski resorts including Whistler in Canada, Northstar in California’s Lake Tahoe and Park City, Utah. In line with other Apple executives’ pay, Mr Sewell received $22.8m in total compensation in 2016, according to regulatory filings, including $20m worth of stock awards and $1m salary.
186;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-09-28T15:45:05Z;BlackBerry rides high on shift to software and services;Once-struggling phonemaker’s revenues and profits beat market forecasts;BlackBerry’s transformation from a struggling mobile phone maker to a software and services company has gathered pace, after it comfortably beat expectations for revenues and profits in the second quarter, sending its shares more than 12 per cent higher.BlackBerry’s revenues in the second quarter were $249m, higher than the $221m expected by the market. Net income hit $26m. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share to be zero, but they came in at $0.05.The financial progress was heralded as evidence that the decision to quit the smartphone market, and focus on software and services related to mobile products, is starting to pay off.John Chen, the chief executive behind the plan, said: “We achieved historical highs in total software and services revenue and gross margin, as well as the highest non-GAAP operating margin in over five years, reflecting our complete transformation to a software company.”BlackBerry shares were 12.5 per cent higher at $10.38 in morning trade in New York.The Ontario-based company had disappointed with its first-quarter performance, which gave rise to fears that its shift into software and services could stall its recovery. But Mr Chen said on Thursday he expected its software and services revenues to grow 10 to 15 per cent in the year to March.The company also has $2.5bn of cash on the balance sheet, boosted by a settlement with Qualcomm. The chipmaker was forced to repay it $815m. Mr Chen said it would look to acquire companies in the cyber security and automotive software markets to boost its growth, but would take its time. “We are very patient. We don’t want to over pay,” he said.There are already more than 60m cars on the road that use BlackBerry’s software and the company has struck deals with manufacturers like Ford, as well as specialist component makers. Mr Chen said that the push toward driverless cars would benefit BlackBerry, but expected the full launch of such vehicles to take longer than expected. “Everyone says 2020/21 but I don’t believe it . . . 2024/25 seems a more realistic timeframe,” he said.BlackBerry expects overall revenues for fiscal 2018 to be between $920m and $950m and for the company to be profitable and generating cash.Revenue in the second quarter of last year was $352m, boosted by the sale of 400,000 handsets, but the company just broke even.The revenues figure is a fraction of the $2.9bn it reported in the second quarter of 2013, when the Canadian company was still a big player in the smartphone market. Its attempts to keep up with Apple and Samsung in the consumer market, and later to revert to being a business phone specialist, eventually failed. That led to billions of dollars of losses and Mr Chen has earned praise for slimming down the business and returning it to profitability, as he wound down its famous devices business.BlackBerry-branded phones are still available in some markets, such as Indonesia, where they remain popular. But they are no longer made by the Canadian company, which has instead licensed its brand to “white label” manufacturers in China and India.
187;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-09-06T16:59:22Z;Intel wins review of EU’s €1bn antitrust fine;Ruling could affect other cases against US tech groups such as Google and Qualcomm;Europe’s top court boosted Intel’s eight-year attempt to overturn a €1bn fine for anti-competitive behaviour, raising the bar for EU efforts to rein in other powerful US tech giants such as Google and Qualcomm.The European Court of Justice said an appeal by Intel against the fine — levied for allegedly encouraging computer makers to use its chips over rival AMD through so-called exclusivity incentives — would need to be re-examined by the general court, a lower tribunal.It said the court should review all aspects of Intel’s arguments, including whether exclusivity incentives had actually harmed competition.The ECJ concluded that exclusivity arrangements as used by Intel — which gave rebates to computer makers if they bought at least 95 per cent of chips from the US group — were illegal by nature. But it said companies could mount a defence that there was no harm to rivals, which antitrust authorities must consider.The decision could have a significant affect on the EU’s outstanding cases against Silicon Valley companies that have used similar tactics by raising the burden of proof.EU competition officials have three open investigations directly affected by the ruling. Google is being investigated about its contract terms with phonemakers and networks using its Android software, as well as its ban on AdSense customers using rival ad services. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is being probed over payments to Apple for exclusively using its broadband chipsets in iPhones and iPads from 2011.The Intel case sets a useful precedent for companies, according to antitrust lawyers. “They can take comfort that properly devised schemes can be defended if they show no potential for exclusion of rivals with a similar cost base,” said Bill Batchelor of law firm Baker McKenzie.“The court of justice confirms exclusivity rebates as abusive by nature, but if a defendant argues, with supporting evidence, that its conduct could not restrict competition from equally efficient rivals, the commission has to rebut that,” said Maurits Dolmans of law firm Cleary Gottlieb, which counts Google among its clients.Rebates are standard practice in many companies with high fixed costs but EU rules are unclear if these discounts are illegal by design or only if they harm competition.The ECJ sent the case back to the general court to reconsider the commission’s decision and its analysis of whether the rebates harmed competition.“It is more a criticism of the general court for not looking at the whole decision but only looking at a part of it,” said Kevin Coates, of law firm Covington.The ruling does not imply that Intel will win its appeal, but it will have another hearing of its arguments.The Intel fine was a record ‘abuse-of-dominance’ fine until Google’s €2.4bn bill in July this year.The ECJ ruled on two other points. The EU can prosecute cases about pricing that affects the European market even if the relevant agreements are made outside the union. The court decided all meetings, both formal and informal, between regulators and companies must have minutes recorded and made available to the defendant.Intel said: “We have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition. We look forward to the next step in this process, in what is a respectful disagreement between Intel and the EC’s competition regulators.”The commission said it was studying the decision. Qualcomm could not be reached for comment and Google declined to comment.
188;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-09-06T09:16:52Z;EU court ruling restrains Brussels antitrust enforcers;;Round three goes to Intel.The European Court of Justice gave Intel a lifeline in its appeal of the €1bn EU fine for illegal price rebates by sending the case back to the General court to reconsider the chip-maker’s arguments against the 2009 decision.Wednesday’s ruling raises the burden of proof for Europe’s antitrust watchdog to make a case against pricing incentives offered by dominant companies, increasing the commission’s workload to make its case in its open investigations into Google and Qualcomm.“This is a rebuff for the commission in its wish to apply form-based reasoning without considering the business realities,” said Alec Burnside of law firm Dechert.Price cuts or rebates for volume-buying are standard practice in many companies but current EU rules are unclear whether these discounts are illegal by design or only if they harm competition.Legal precedent since the 1970s – including Intel’s first appeal in 2014 to the General court – said certain types of rebates were always not allowed – so-called illegal by design or form-based reasoning. However the commission’s 2006 policy guidance said the incentives should only be an infringement if they harmed competition.The ECJ’s decision rejected that 2014 General court decision but does not imply that the original 2009 commission decision to fine Intel will be overturned, as the regulator did analyse the effect of the rebates in its decision and concluded they harmed competition.The General court will now reconsider the 2009 decision including examining if the regulators had sufficiently proved that the rebates harmed competition.The ECJ said it “refers the case back to the General court so that it may examine, in the light of the arguments put forward by Intel, whether the rebates at issue are capable of restricting competition.”The ECJ did reject other arguments raised “alleging that the commission lacked territorial jurisdiction to penalise the abuse, and alleging procedural irregularities”.
189;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-09-05T23:01:27Z;Quartz chases advertising with new media initiatives;Business site shows faith in ad model with sponsored book and fresh brands;Quartz, the Atlantic Media-owned business news site, is increasing its push for advertising, at a time when other publishers are turning to video, paywalls and e-commerce to counter the pressures of the digital ad market.The company is publishing its first print book, launching new management and lifestyle brands, and adding a second daily email newsletter. All of the expansions incorporate new advertising opportunities for Quartz, which derives all of its revenue from ads and event sponsorships.For its print debut — a book titled The Objects that Power the Global Economy that goes on sale on September 6 — Quartz included branded content, a form of advertising that drives 60 per cent of its revenue. The book, which explores subjects including gene sequencing, blockchain technology and lithium-ion batteries, is sponsored by Qualcomm, a longtime advertiser, and features a section about the chipmaker’s role in mobile communications.“We’re going against the trend, in the sense that we unapologetically believe that there is a healthy and better advertising model to pursue,” said Jay Lauf, Quartz publisher and co-president.“It starts with the premise that I don’t believe that people hate advertising, they hate bad advertising experiences,” he said. “We believe that if you try to create advertising that is an additive, interesting, pleasant experience for the user, you’re going to get a better experience for the advertiser.”The privately held company, founded in 2012, does not disclose financial results, but is projecting double-digit revenue growth this year. In 2016, it turned a profit for the first time, earning more than $1m on revenue of about $30m, according to a person familiar with the matter. In August, it drew 22m unique visitors to its website.Quartz’s success in building a profitable advertising business comes as many publishers are struggling with the growing dominance of Google and Facebook. The tech giants soaked up 72 cents of every new dollar spent on digital ads in the US last year, according to eMarketer.Quartz sells display advertising on its website, mobile app and newsletters, but the majority of its revenue comes from custom content, such as a chat bot it created for Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the Qualcomm book partnership. As a result, the company’s cost per thousand impressions (CPM) is in the $60 range, when the average CPM for display ads in 2016 was $13.88, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau and PwC.“Their whole philosophy is that they’re selling scarcity,” said Ken Doctor, media analyst at Newsonomics. “It’s why print and traditional broadcast worked. There’s a limited space and time.”Liya Sharif, Qualcomm senior director of global brand, said the book allowed the chipmaker to advertise “in an unexpected and breakthrough manner”. She added: “The audiences for Quartz and Qualcomm align well — these are the people involved in building and shaping our relationships with technology.”For its new management and lifestyle brands, Quartz has signed up new and existing sponsors, including Prudential and Lincoln, which will advertise on the Quartz at Work management site.Kevin Delaney, Quartz editor and co-president, said the company had identified “untapped appetite” for management and lifestyle coverage. “These are opportunities for readership and, on a business model level, are as big as where qz.com was when we launched it five years ago,” he said.
190;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-08-24T22:14:45Z;Qualcomm president quits amid Apple battle;;The Qualcomm executive most closely associated with its ongoing legal battle with Apple is leaving the company.Derek Aberle has decided to leave Qualcomm at the end of the year, after 17 years at the company, the mobile chipmaker announced on Thursday.As president and former head of the licensing division, QTL, that is fighting Apple and four of its top suppliers over royalty rates and patents, Mr Aberle has taken on a more visible role in the last nine months. A former lawyer, Mr Aberle has been on Qualcomm’s executive team since 2008 and played a crucial part in recent licensing negotiations with the Chinese government and local manufacturers.Mr Aberle will be working through his four-month handover period and plans to take time off once he leaves. After that, Alex Rogers, who now runs QTL, will report directly to Qualcomm’s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf.Although the departure comes in the midst of litigation in which billions of dollars are at stake for Qualcomm, the tone of the announcement suggested his exit was amicable. “I want to thank Derek for the vision, creativity, dedication, and judgment he brought to the company and wish him all the best in the future,” Mr Mollenkopf said.Mr Aberle said he was “very proud to have been a part of [Qualcomm’s] tradition of innovation, and of all that we’ve been able to accomplish during my tenure”.Qualcomm’s shares were little changed in after-hours trading at $52.49, having lost almost a fifth of their value so far this year.
191;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Elliott discloses 6% stake in NXP, eyes fight with Qualcomm;;Get ready to rumble.Activist investor Elliott Management has set itself up for a fight with US chip giant Qualcomm after it disclosed a 6 per cent stake in NXP Semiconductors and signaled its plans to force Qualcomm to raise its $37bn bid for the company.In a regulatory statement, Elliott said it believes NXP shares are “significantly undervalued” and that it would continue to “engage in a dialogue” with the chipmaker’s board and “potential acquirers” to maximise shareholder value.The comments indicate that Elliott, owned by billionaire Paul Singer, plans to push Qualcomm to sweeten its offer for US-listed but Netherlands-based NXP.Under the terms of the offer unveiled last October, Qualcomm agreed to pay $110 a share for NXP, valuing the equity of its European rival at about $37bn. Along with existing debt, the offer puts NXP’s total enterprise value at $47bn.Shares in NXP rose 1.8 per cent to $112.50, well above Qualcomm’s offer. Should they close at that level, it would represent a new closing high for the stock.

Earnings per share were $0.58 during the period.Qualcomm’s earnings were hit during the most recent quarter by a $927m payment to the Korea Free Trade Commission and a $940m payment it made to Blackberry as part of a royalty dispute settlement.Its numbers were also affected by disputes with licensees, which Qualcomm says are not paying proper royalties for the Qualcomm licenses that they are using.The company reported muted guidance for its current quarter, when it expects sales to fall to between $5.4bn – $6.2bn, a decrease of 6 per cent at the midpoint from the same period last year.Earnings will also fall during the current quarter, when Qualcomm forecasts earnings per share between $0.55 and $0.65.Qualcomm has been bogged down in a prolonged legal battle with Apple on multiple fronts, including accusations by Qualcomm that certain elements of the iPhone allegedly violate its patents, as well as accusations by a group of Apple suppliers that Qualcomm has allegedly engaged in anti-competitive behavior.“We believe that we hold the high ground with regard to the dispute with Apple, and we have initiated new actions to protect the well-established value of our technologies,” said chief executive Steve Mollenkopf in the earnings statement.Qualcomm’s share price fell 3 per cent in after-market trading following its earnings announcement.*This post has been updated to reflect that profits were $866m.

The first deals exclusively carried out by the Vision Fund are investments in Brain Corp, a robotics company based in San Diego, and Plenty, which is pioneering a new kind of agricultural technology in the San Francisco Bay Area.At the same time, SoftBank itself is leading a $159m funding round into Nauto, a Silicon Valley-based autonomous vehicle technology company. The investment is expected to be offered to the Vision Fund at a later date.The deals were unveiled ahead of chairman Masayoshi Son’s keynote speech on Thursday at SoftBank World, the Japanese group’s annual conference, where some of its latest investments, including robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics and chip designer Arm are expected to be shown off to customers and partners. The Vision Fund was established late last year as a combination of equity and debt from backers including the state investment funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, as well as tech groups including Apple, Qualcomm, Foxconn and Sharp. Mr Son has promised to “think big” with its bets on many facets of what he calls the “information revolution”, ranging from artificial intelligence to the internet of things. The fund’s first deployments will set the tone, with a company using sensors and big data to create a “hyper-yield” farm and another that is hoping to become the standard operating system for autonomous robots, in the same way that Android did in smartphones. Plenty is raising $200m to help with what Mr Son said was a plan to “remake the current food system”. Matt Barnard, chief executive and co-founder of Plenty, said its indoor farms would produce “hyper-organic food with no pesticides nor GMOs while cutting water consumption by 99 per cent”. The facilities, which grow food vertically inside towers lit by bright LEDS, will be created close to large cities to avoid having to transport and store their produce. “We’re now ready to build out our farm network and serve communities around the globe,” he said. The Vision Fund’s other investment announced on Wednesday is a $114m bet that manually operated vehicles in warehouses and other industrial applications can be turned into autonomous robots. San Diego-based Brain, which was first backed by chipmaker Qualcomm, offers “AI as a service”. Brain’s first application was a floor-cleaning robot, but its founders say its technology will eventually be as “commonplace as computers and mobile phones are today”. “We believe tomorrow’s robots will be intelligent autonomous machines that take care of us,” said Eugene Izhikevich, Brain’s chief executive. “This funding will allow us to accelerate our mission, and we look forward to collaborating with the SoftBank Vision Fund as a long-term strategic partner.”Nauto, which is part of Android founder Andy Rubin’s Playground Global hardware incubator, is the latest Silicon Valley autonomous driving start-up to see a multimillion-dollar cash injection. Its device can be installed into existing vehicles and looks inside and outside the car, to help prevent distracted driving. Its initial target customers are fleet managers of commercial vehicles who want to track their drivers remotely and improve safety, with a longer term goal of applying the same technology to develop fully self-driving cars. Stefan Heck, Nauto’s chief executive, said its system was “learning how to drive from the best drivers — professional drivers”. “We will be integrating our algorithms into future production vehicles,” he said. “So it will go from a driver coaching system to guiding the car to actually driving.” As well as Nauto, SoftBank is expected to offer the Vision Fund a stake in Arm, as well as graphics chipmaker Nvidia, satellite start-up OneWeb and simulation technology provider Improbable. 
194;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm/Apple: patently offensive;Chipmaker cannot afford to fold on its demand for iPhone import ban;Seal the borders! Seize the contraband! Qualcomm on Thursday asked the US International Trade Commission to block imports of some iPhones, saying that Apple infringes its patents.In a previous lawsuit, Apple had claimed Qualcomm held it to ransom by overcharging for standard essential patents: the chipmaker just designs the boring old modem, the iPhone maker suggested, while an increasing portion of the device’s value comes from unrelated cool stuff such as cameras and fingerprint sensors.By selecting six patents which have little to do with the wireless capability, Qualcomm is looking to undermine that narrative. There is a middle view — that Qualcomm’s technology is not as limited as Apple pretends, but not so crucial that it should it entitle the company to a big cut of the overall device price. Citigroup estimates Qualcomm takes a 1.5 per cent royalty on a $700 phone. A negotiated settlement should be possible.That was the outcome the last time Qualcomm went to the ITC. The case against Meizu, a Chinese smartphone maker, was brought last October and culminated in a worldwide licensing agreement in December. It boosted investor confidence that Qualcomm could protect its intellectual property even in tougher markets.Apple has already anticipated this move, with chief executive Tim Cook dismissing its prospects for success. The ITC is a part of the administration of Donald Trump, who might like the idea of blocking foreign-made iPhones since he has called for Apple to manufacture them in the US.For Apple, the maturity of its biggest product line means it can no longer bank on revenue growth to keep powering profits — it needs to squeeze suppliers and it is doing so, hard. For Qualcomm, the threat feels more existential. Cave into Apple’s demand and other device makers will demand their own concessions, wrecking its high-margin royalty model.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

195;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-07-06T20:30:59Z;Qualcomm calls for iPhone ban as Apple patent case intensifies;Chipmaker claims infringement by some models and seeks ‘cease and desist’ order;Qualcomm is asking a US agency to ban the import of certain iPhone models that it alleges infringed on its latest patents, escalating its legal battle with Apple.The maker of Snapdragon processors and wireless modems claims the iPhone infringes on up to six patents, covering recent developments in smartphone performance, efficiency and power management.At the same time as filing a new patent infringement case against Apple in the Southern District of California, Qualcomm is asking the US International Trade Commission to issue a “limited exclusion order” against the iPhone, which is assembled in Asia. It also hopes to block sales of infringing devices already in the US through a “cease and desist” order.“This is a pretty straightforward case: we’ve got six patents that we are confident they are infringing,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “We are obviously very concerned about the fact that Apple has unilaterally decided it doesn’t have to pay for property it takes and uses.”The patents Qualcomm is asserting are not part of the bundle of standard-essential patents for modem technologies and cellular networking standards that are at issue in its legal fight with Apple over royalty payments. Instead, they cover more advanced features in the latest smartphones, such as carrier aggregation, graphics processing and signal amplification.“We would be happy to license these patents to a willing licensee if they wanted to negotiate with us. Apple has said they do not want to negotiate with us,” Mr Rosenberg said. “This [litigation] also puts the lie to the notion that somehow our inventions were in the past. We continue to invent all the time.”Apple has argued that Qualcomm is unfairly profiting from ageing wireless patents that have little to do with the iPhone’s other innovations. The San Diego-based chipmaker has countered that Apple could not have entered the mobile phone market a decade ago without getting a leg-up from its technologies.In its ITC claim, Qualcomm is only seeking to block imports of iPhones that use wireless processors made by its rival Intel, leaving its own chip sales unaffected if the order is granted while also limiting the damage it would cause to Apple. Intel first began supplying these processors to Apple with last September’s debut of the iPhone 7.“This is the best chance yet for Qualcomm to get a favorable ruling as they have narrowed the case,” said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “I believe Qualcomm limited the complaint to non-Qualcomm based phones to lower the potential negative ITC reaction stemming from an analysis of potential consumer harm if they tried to block all iPhones.”The near-term impact on sales of Apple’s most profitable product will be limited. The ITC typically takes at least 18 months to conduct an investigation and make a ruling, so any resulting restrictions to iPhone sales are unlikely to come into effect until after next year’s model is released, assuming Apple sticks to its annual September launch schedule.Qualcomm’s move marks yet another twist in the two companies’ legal battles. Apple first sued the chipmaker over what it called “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties” in January. It broadened its case last month by attacking the validity of Qualcomm’s patents and demanding a “restitution of all excessive license fees that Apple paid”.This is a pretty straightforward case: we’ve got six patents that we are confident [Apple] are infringingQualcomm has also sued four top iPhone manufacturers for breach of contract after Apple choked off its royalty payments that are usually paid through the suppliers.Analysts had previously voiced concern that the row with one of Apple’s largest suppliers could interrupt iPhone sales. When Tim Cook was asked about the possibility of an import ban in a recent quarterly earnings call, the Apple chief said that Qualcomm had an obligation to offer its “standards-essential” patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms.“That’s both the price and the business terms,” he said. “I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.”The last time Apple faced a threat against US iPhone sales came during its protracted legal struggle with Samsung over smartphone designs. In June 2013, the ITC determined that some iPhone and iPad models had infringed Samsung’s patents and ordered a halt to imports. The agency’s decision was vetoed by then President Barack Obama two months later.Qualcomm went to the ITC last year in its case against Chinese smartphone maker Meizu but the two companies settled and signed a licensing agreement in December.As well as its multi-faceted lawsuits against Apple, Qualcomm is facing continued regulatory scrutiny around the world. Late last month a judge in California rejected Qualcomm’s bid to have the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against it dismissed. Qualcomm has said the FTC’s complaint that its licensing practices impeded competition in the mobile chips market are “without merit” and that the agency lacks evidence to support its claim.
196;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-06-22T12:24:33Z;Imagination on the market after Apple setback;Shares surge after interest grows in buying entire UK chip designer;Imagination Technologies, once held as an example of British technology success, has put itself up for sale after Apple chose to stop using its products to manufacture the iPhone.The British chip designer, which was founded in 1985, had already put two of its three core divisions on the block after it warned in April that Apple would stop using its graphics processors in its iPhones and iPads.Imagination said on Thursday it had received interest from a number of parties in acquiring the whole business, and so had appointed investment bank Rothschild to assess any formal offers.The decision could mark the end of one of the UK’s most highly feted tech firms of the last two decades. It follows the sale of rival chip designer Arm to SoftBank last year, which raised questions about whether Britain can foster companies able to compete with Silicon Valley.Imagination, originally known as VideoLogic, grew from supplying graphics capabilities for Sega’s game consoles in the 1990s to become one of Britain’s largest technology companies, as its processor designs became a critical component of smartphones and tablets. Its position at the forefront of the industry was endorsed when both Apple and Intel bought significant stakes in the business in 2009.An attempt to expand into other markets, including computer processors when it bought MIPS in 2012, backfired, as the business started to struggle. Apple’s move in April sent the shares to their lowest level since 2009, as 60 per cent of Imagination’s value disappeared in one day.Imagination launched a dispute with Apple, which still owns an 8 per cent stake in the British business, but moved to dismantle its divisions in May, by putting up for sale MIPS and its Ensigma unit, which develops “internet of things” technology. At that stage, it intended to retain its PowerVR graphics business, but it is now considering selling the whole group.Imagination shares surged 16 per cent on the news to 143.25p, valuing the company at £407m. A person familiar with the company said Tsinghua Unigroup, a chip company backed by the Chinese state, is a likely bidder given it acquired a 3 per cent stake last year.Tsinghua raised $22bn this year for acquisitions. But Janardan Menon, an analyst with Liberum, noted that there could be regulatory issues in selling Imagination to a Chinese state-backed business. Apple has long been linked with a takeover of Imagination, but ruled out such a move in 2016. However, Mr Menon argued that the iPhone maker could reconsider if Qualcomm bids for Imagination to strengthen its patent portfolio. Apple and Qualcomm are involved in a multibillion-dollar legal dispute over royalties. “An acquisition of Imagination could be an additional weapon in its fight with Apple, given the existing dispute between Imagination and Apple. Qualcomm would also see value in Imagination’s ray tracing IP, while MIPS would be a useful asset in addressing many product segments including automotives,” the analyst said. Other bidders could include Intel, which has targeted automotive technology with the acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that uses Imagination’s technology, and MediaTek, which also uses MIPS. CEVA is also rumoured to be interested. A sale of Imagination would likely represent another former UK technology stalwart being sold to a foreign buyer, after SoftBank’s takeover of Arm Holdings and the acquisitions of Wolfson Microelectronics, CSR, Logica and Autonomy in recent years. Monitise received an offer last week from US company Fiserv.Richard Holway, an analyst with TechMarketView, said: “With Apple having a stake, I guess we all believed that Apple would buy Imagination if they really wanted their own graphics chip. I still think that would be the best solution. But whatever happens, methinks yet another really Great British company will fall to a foreign predator.”
197;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-06-21T00:52:08Z;Apple uses Supreme Court decision to attack Qualcomm;Lexmark ink case shows chipmaker should not be ‘double-dipping’, iPhone maker argues;Apple has fired its latest legal salvo at Qualcomm, broadening its multibillion-dollar battle over wireless chip royalties by attacking the validity of the chipmaker’s patents and leaning on a US Supreme Court decision to support its allegation of “double-dipping”.The tech groups have spent recent months raising the legal stakes after Apple in January accused Qualcomm of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”, running into billions of dollars over the past few years. The world’s leading mobile chipmaker has argued that claim is baseless, accusing Apple of encouraging regulatory attacks against it around the world by “misrepresenting facts and making false statements” and of interfering in its business by withholding royalties it is owed by the iPhone’s manufacturers.In a legal filing on Tuesday, Apple pointed to a ruling by the US Supreme Court to try to bolster its case that Qualcomm is charging too much for access to patents covering cellular and WiFi connectivity in mobile devices.At the end of May, the court found that patent law cannot be used to prevent the resale of Lexmark printer cartridges refilled with toner by other suppliers.“A patentee’s decision to sell a product exhausts all of its patent rights in that item, regardless of any restrictions the patentee purports to impose,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court’s ruling, reversing a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.Apple’s lawyers say the “landmark decision” suggests Qualcomm’s practice of obliging customers that buy its chip modems to also pay a patent royalty — which the US Federal Trade Commission called in its own complaint a “no license, no chips” model— is a “violation of US patent law”.“This is precisely the kind of double-dipping, extra-reward system that the Court’s decision in Lexmark forbids,” Apple argues in its filing.Qualcomm responded to Apple’s latest legal broadside late on Tuesday, accusing the iPhone maker of “distortions” to minimise the importance of the chipmaker’s technology and misrepresent its licensing practices. Don Rosenberg, general counsel, said Qualcomm’s technology was behind many of the iPhone’s most important features, including the App Store, mobile video and audio quality.In the document, Apple calls for the “restitution of all excessive license fees that Apple paid”, after its initial demand for a “fair and reasonable” royalty.Qualcomm, which countersued Apple in April, has said it will “vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry”. The maker of wireless communication modems for the iPhone and Snapdragon processors for smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S8 warned in April of a significant revenue shortfall after Apple stopped paying the equivalent of royalties to the contract manufacturers that build the iPhone, choking their ability to pay Qualcomm.After Qualcomm sued four top manufacturers including Foxconn last month for breach of contract, Apple on Tuesday described the action as “bullying” the suppliers, amounting to “retaliation, obstruction of justice, and greed”.In the 160-page filing, Apple also asked the court to declare invalid a selection of Qualcomm patents the chipmaker has deemed “essential” to the 3G and 4G standards. In doing so, Apple is hoping to emulate its legal strategy in another case over wireless patents against Ericsson, which ended in a settlement in December 2015.The case between Apple and Qualcomm is likely to take years. Qualcomm’s request for a preliminary injunction against Apple’s contract manufacturers, to force them to continue paying royalties while its fight with the iPhone maker continues, will be heard in California in a few months.
198;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-06-09T17:56:18Z;Brussels launches probe into Qualcomm-NXP deal;Competition regulator raises concerns that chipmaker deal could hurt competition;Brussels has opened an in-depth probe into Qualcomm’s $47bn takeover of European chipmaker NXP, slowing a deal the US giant needs to offset revenue pressures from its battle with Apple over royalties.The EU’s competition regulator announced on Friday it will take a closer look at the largest technology acquisition ever in Europe as it worried that the combination of two leading semiconductor makers could be bad for consumers and innovation.The commission will focus its investigation on short-range wireless chips used in mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay and on technology for connected cars.The investigation comes on top of Qualcomm’s antitrust battle over its licensing practices with the US Federal Trade Commission, which began in January.Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, said in a statement: “As semiconductors are used in practically every electronic device, we are dependent on them . . . With this investigation, we want to ensure that consumers will continue to benefit from secure and innovative products at competitive prices.”The EU said on Friday that it had concerns that the combined entity could exclude rival suppliers and increase royalties.Another area of focus is on the potential for bundling Qualcomm’s “baseband” wireless processors with NXP’s “near field communication” chips (NFC) and “secure elements”, which together are used in wireless mobile payment systems.This acquisition is complementary, and driven by the belief that the combined efforts of the two companies will produce even greater innovation than they would aloneQualcomm said it “is confident that it can address the (EU’s) concerns”, adding that “both companies expected a thorough review process”. The US chipmaker expects the transaction to close by the end of the year. “This acquisition is complementary, and driven by the belief that the combined efforts of the two companies will produce even greater innovation than they would alone,” Qualcomm said. NXP referred a request for comment to Qualcomm.Shares in Qualcomm fell about 1 per cent as news of the investigation emerged on Friday afternoon in Europe, while NXP was down by less than 1 per cent having traded higher earlier in the day.The European watchdog will make a decision on the deal by mid October, although that deadline could be extended. The US FTC cleared the deal in April. With an extensive patent portfolio relating to cellular communications, Qualcomm is a leading supplier to the mobile industry.However, shareholder pressure is increasing as the smartphone market, which provides 90 per cent of the company’s revenues, has showed signs of maturing.At the same time, Qualcomm has become embroiled in a range of legal cases, both with Apple, one of its largest customers, and antitrust regulators around the world. The San Diego-based company cut its quarterly revenue forecasts in April after the iPhone maker said it would withhold payments from contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which the companies would normally owe to Qualcomm in royalties for iPhone sales.NXP is a leading provider of chips for the automotive market and a wide range of industrial applications, across the so-called internet of things. “This significant investment by Qualcomm [in NXP] will help our industry partners in the automotive, IoT (internet of things) and security sectors advance their digital transformation and further the digitisation of industries worldwide,” Qualcomm said. Qualcomm has promised to pay $110 a share for NXP, valuing its equity at about $37bn. Along with existing debt, the offer puts NXP’s total enterprise value at $47bn.Activist investor Elliott Management recently demanded that the US company pay more. Elliott has taken a stake, via shares and derivatives, worth more than 3 per cent of NXP, according to a person familiar with the position.
199;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm/NXP: chip more in;Others may join Elliott in pressing for a higher price for Dutch semiconductor group;Qualcomm would have got away with it were not for those pesky hedge funds. In October, the US chipmaker agreed to acquire NXP for a less-than-generous $110 a share. Now, Elliott Management is demanding a higher price.It is late and the activist hedge fund does not ostensibly have the votes. Elliott is believed to hold more than 3 per cent of NXP — a long way from the 20-30 per cent required to scupper the deal. True, only 14 per cent of NXP shares have been tendered so far, but that may reflect the fact that the deal still has to win regulatory approvals in Europe and China. Many investors will tender once that process is complete, which is expected to around October.But the top of the register is a who’s who of hedge funds, from Och-Ziff to DE Shaw to Farallon Capital — and that’s just the disclosed ones. There is no guarantee that long-only holders, headed by T Rowe Price, will fall in line with the companies. Other holders, especially retail investors, may not care enough to tender their shares. The offer requires 80 per cent acceptance, but this can be reduced to 70 per cent with NXP’s consent.Qualcomm, which is buying automotive semiconductor leader NXP to diversify beyond the mobile phone market, had offered a standard premium of 34 per cent above NXP’s undisturbed share price. But the Dutch company was still digesting its own acquisition of Freescale and waving goodbye to big private equity owners. Its operational performance since October has exceeded expectations.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has risen 32 per cent since the deal was announced. If one assumes that NXP would have performed in line, its shares might well have reached the $110 bid level by now. In fact, it may have outperformed the index, given that its growth and margins are above the industry average.Qualcomm could just tough it out. After all, investors — hedge funds or not — may prefer cash in hand. But the likelihood is that the bid will rise.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
200;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-05-23T02:57:33Z;Electric car makers look along the road to contactless charging;Lack of infrastructure remains an obstacle to mass adoption;Last week in Paris, the US chipmaking company Qualcomm unveiled technology far removed from its traditional heartland of smartphone processing and computers — a wireless charger for an electric car. On a 100m test track, the company showed that two Renault Kangoo vans were able to take charge directly from cables under the road while driving along. The demonstration marks a breakthrough for a technology that has the potential to change the economics of electric vehicles.Sales are rising, as carmakers push newer models that can drive further on a single battery. But lack of charging infrastructure, along with price and battery range, remains an important obstacle to mass adoption.Analysts expect sales of battery-driven vehicles to take off once the price of ownership draws level with a traditional internal combustion engine car, possibly within five to 10 years.As a result, the industry is turning its attention to a time when there will be too many electric cars on the road for conventional top-up chargers.“At some point, there will be a big shift and mass adoption and we must think about new things,” says Edouard Fischer, a director at Sanef, the company that operates France’s toll motorways. “We must prepare for what will happen in 10-15 years.”After installing charging points at every 80km along its 2,000km toll road network, Sanef has in the past year witnessed a 250 per cent increase in the number of electric cars driving on them, Mr Fischer told the FT’s Future of the Car Summit.But there will come a time when fixed point charging can no longer cope with the number of electric vehicles on the road. With under-road charging, a system of cables laid under motorway lanes could put just enough charge into a car to keep its battery from being run down during the journey.The car would drive off the motorway with the same amount of charge as when it joined the road, possibly many hundreds of kilometres earlier. This has the potential to transform the range of electric vehicles, since they currently must stop to top up before they run out, thus lengthening journey times for any long distance trip.Developments are also moving “very, very fast” in the field, says Gilles Normand, head of electric cars at Renault. BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes, are already developing induction pads for their plug-in hybrid cars that allow them to charge without the use of a cable. Nissan demonstrated its first prototype system in 2010. The car is parked over the induction pad and the energy transfers wirelessly into vehicle. At some point, there will be a big shift and mass adoption and we must think about new thingsMr Normand notes that three years ago Renault’s induction pad needed to be just half a centimetre from the road to connect. Today, that gap is 4cm, while the equipment needed weighs a fraction of what was required three years earlier.But while the technology may work well in a garage, getting the same system to operate flawlessly and safely at speed on a motorway will prove more difficult. Sensors under the road must be able to detect a vehicle and deliver charge before it moves on, requiring nanosecond response times. Qualcomm says its new system can charge at highway speeds, with two cars charging on the same stretch of road.There are other logistical hurdles before it can move from the test track to the highway. One lane would have to be reserved for these vehicles with on-the-road charging facilities, or the sensors would have to be able to detect when a non-chargeable car was travelling on the road.The cars would also pay for the electricity as they drive, requiring instant payment systems to be installed in vehicles.The costs of tearing up motorway lanes in order to install cables and sensors would be astronomical — in the tens of billions of euros even if such a system were rolled out only in Europe.Some think the hurdles and costs mean the technology is unlikely to be adopted any time soon. Erik Fairbairn, founder of electric charging company POD Point, says the vision of under-road charging is “wide of the mark”.Charging behaviour will change, he predicts. Chargers will be more commonly installed in homes and workplaces, rather than motorists being dependent on “an electric version of the petrol pump”, topping up when needed.Because most electric cars will be fully charged at home, Mr Fairbairn says only 3 per cent of motorists on average will need to top up during a particular journey. In this case, the vast majority of journeys made in electric vehicles will be completed without any need to recharge along the way. “If your car had a full tank of petrol every morning, how often do you go beyond that? For most of us, it’s an extreme case,” he says.

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces?

The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
202;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-05-19T22:35:22Z;Qualcomm fundraising highlights appetite for US corporate bonds;Hunger for higher yields drives demand for $11bn sale to help finance NXP takeover;Investor orders for one of the largest corporate bond sales of the year stretched into the tens of billions of dollars on Friday as US chipmaker Qualcomm sewed up the financing for its $47bn takeover of NXP Semiconductors.The interest underlined the appetite from investors across the globe for higher-yielding US corporate bonds, as more than $10.7tn of debt trades with a sub-zero yield. The $11bn bond sale, which tied as the year’s third-largest corporate debt deal, had attracted orders of more than $40bn, two investors with knowledge of the sale said.Low global interest rates coupled with central bank easing in Europe and Japan have driven investors into the US credit market in their search for income. Investment grade corporate bond funds in the US have counted nearly $55bn of inflows this year, according to Lipper.Andrew Forsyth, a portfolio manager with BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said that there was “strong demand” from both domestic and foreign investors for US corporate credit.If a company is a “highly-rated credit . . . people are going to be all over it. Fund flows are still very positive,” he said.The solid interest allowed underwriters to tighten Qualcomm’s borrowing costs across the nine-tranche transaction. Investors were initially marketed $2bn of new 10-year notes with a yield 125 basis points above benchmark Treasuries. That spread was cut to 105bp by the time banks closed their order books.Existing Qualcomm debt due in 2025 last traded hands with a yield 77bp above similarly maturing Treasuries. The company issued new fixed- and floating-rate debt across two- to 30-year tenors on Friday.Matt Brill, a portfolio manager with Invesco, characterised the demand as “off the charts”, particularly after a global equity sell-off earlier this week damped investor enthusiasm. US stock markets rebounded on Thursday and Friday, providing Qualcomm an opening for its $11bn bond sale, he said.“The reach for yield has been exacerbated because Treasuries have held in and if you want additional yield you have to get . . . into credit,” he said. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury, which falls as its price rises, has declined 39bp from a March high. It was at 2.34 per cent on Friday.“Just buying Treasuries won’t get you above your yield hurdle,” Mr Brill added. “It forces investors to take on additional credit risk.”Companies and banks have borrowed more than $750bn through US debt markets this year, the second-fastest pace on record, Dealogic data show. Microsoft completed the largest deal of 2017 in January, raising $17bn, which is trailed by a $13.6bn bond sale by chipmaker Broadcom.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch led Qualcomm’s bond offering on Friday.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
203;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-05-17T21:34:36Z;Google to launch standalone VR headset later this year;Company hopes device will improve sluggish adoption of the technology;Google has unveiled a new kind of standalone virtual reality headset that does not need to be wired to a PC or external sensors to offer more realistic graphics and movement tracking, in the hopes of kick-starting what has been sluggish consumer adoption of the technology.Device makers HTC and Lenovo are working with Google and chipmaker Qualcomm to launch the headsets starting later this year, Google announced at its I/O developer conference in Silicon Valley on Wednesday.“The whole device is designed just for VR,” said Clay Bavor, Google’s head of VR, drawing a contrast with devices such as its own Daydream viewer and Samsung’s Gear VR, which repurpose a standard smartphone to form the basis of a headset’s screen and processing power.The new headset will offer “positional tracking”, a technique that helps users to look and move around inside a virtual world that until now has only been available on PC-based VR headsets such as Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive. Positional tracking is seen by many in the VR industry as essential for achieving the comfort and realism that will win over more users to the technology.All this makes Google’s standalone headset easier to use, Mr Bavor said. “Getting into VR is as easy as picking the thing up,” he said. “By building every part of the device specifically for VR, we’ve been able to optimise everything . . . to give a stronger sense of being transported.”Most of Google’s I/O keynote was focused on artificial intelligence, with improvements to its virtual assistant and enhancements to apps such as YouTube and Photos. While those products are available on hundreds of millions of devices today, virtual reality is a lot further away from mainstream adoption.Google, like other companies investing heavily in VR, is still experimenting with products and designs to see what will capture consumers’ attention, in the hopes of avoiding a fate similar to 3D TVs, whose novelty quickly faded.Facebook’s Oculus and Intel have each previously shown off their own prototypes of standalone VR headsets but neither company has yet released a version that consumers can buy.Intel has said that the first headsets based on its “Project Alloy” design, which it describes as “merged reality” because it incorporates elements from the real world as well as digital images, will launch in the fourth quarter of this year. Oculus previewed its “Santa Cruz” prototype of a fully integrated VR headset, which unlike its Rift headset does not require a wired PC connection, at its Connect developer conference last October.Google is working with mobile chipmaker Qualcomm on the device. Qualcomm first showed a prototype for a standalone VR headset in September, in the form of a “reference design” to demonstrate to manufacturers what was possible with its latest chipsets and sensors.“Our companies share the same vision: to make it possible for everyone to enjoy rich and immersive VR experiences on a smartphone device or a dedicated heat-mounted display while being fully mobile, rather than being restricted by cables or limited to predefined rooms set up for outside-in tracking,” said Keith Kressin, senior vice-president for product management at Qualcomm Technologies.With its latest standalone product, Google’s new WorldSense platform is building on its experience with the Daydream virtual reality software that it unveiled a year ago and its Tango augmented reality sensors.Until now, Google has offered two separate platforms for virtual and augmented reality. Tango was first released in 2014 and the first smartphones featuring its twin-camera system were released only within the past year by Lenovo and Asus. Daydream was announced a year ago with its Pixel smartphone, released in October, the first compatible device that consumers could buy.Developers of Daydream apps say that usage data suggest sales of the headset remain small, in part because of the short supply of smartphones that meet the specifications in screen resolution and processing power that Google’s system demands. Only a handful of Daydream compatible devices are on the market, from manufacturers including Motorola and Huawei. Google said on Wednesday that the latest devices from Samsung and LG would support Daydream later this year.The virtual reality market continues to attract new entrants even as sales to consumers remain slow to take off. Microsoft’s latest version of Windows 10 will support a variety of what it calls “mixed reality” headsets made by manufacturers including Acer and HP, which will ship this summer.Samsung released a new version of its Gear VR headset, which incorporates its flagship Galaxy smartphones, when it launched its S8 in April. The new Gear also includes a motion-sensitive controller similar to the one that Google introduced with Daydream. Tencent is also planning to launch a virtual-reality headset later this year, people familiar with the matter have told the Financial Times.
204;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-05-17T11:31:05Z;Apple’s top suppliers dragged into Qualcomm legal battle;Chipmaker sues contract manufacturers including Foxconn for refusing to pay royalties;Qualcomm is suing four of Apple’s top suppliers for refusing to pay royalties at the iPhone maker’s request, adding a new twist to the two companies’ already complex legal battle.The latest round of lawsuits, filed in Southern California on Wednesday, drags Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal into the deepening row between Qualcomm and Apple over the value of the chipmaker’s intellectual property.Qualcomm’s latest complaint alleges the four Taiwanese manufacturers breached longstanding licensing deals and seeks unspecified damages.“It is unfortunate that we must take this action against these long-time licensees to enforce our agreements, but we cannot allow these manufacturers and Apple to use our valuable intellectual property without paying the fair and reasonable royalties to which they have agreed,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel.Late last month, Qualcomm warned investors that it faced a shortfall in sales and profits because Apple, one of its largest customers, had stopped paying an amount equivalent to Qualcomm’s previous share of royalties to the manufacturers that produce the iPhone and iPad. Those contract manufacturers in turn had stopped paying Qualcomm by the same amount.Apple argues that Qualcomm has overcharged it by “billions of dollars” over several years and that the mobile chipmaker has demanded “excessive royalties” in relation to its wireless communications patents.The dispute started in January when Apple sued Qualcomm for $1bn, accusing it of abusing its monopoly position — accusations Qualcomm dismissed as “baseless”.Because Qualcomm’s licensing deals relating to the iPhone and iPad are not with Apple itself but with the contract manufacturers that produce the devices, the maker of Snapdragon processors and wireless modems cannot sue Apple directly for withholding those royalties. Qualcomm has already filed a separate claim against what it describes as Apple’s “interference”.In Wednesday’s complaint, Qualcomm alleges that Apple “orchestrated” the actions of the contract manufacturers against it.“In addition to withholding payments from defendants for Qualcomm royalties, Apple instructed defendants to withhold corresponding royalty payments from Qualcomm,” the filing reads. “Moreover, Apple has agreed to indemnify defendants for any damages they may incur as a result of breaching their agreements with Qualcomm, further demonstrating Apple’s strong-arm tactics.”Apple on Wednesday referred to a statement it released last month, saying that would suspend royalty payments “until the correct amount can be determined by the court”. That process could take years.“We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said. “As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.”Foxconn said it was aware of the dispute but had “not received any formal communications related to this lawsuit”.The other manufacturers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
205;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-05-10T07:33:23Z;Softbank’s full-year profit tops expectations, announces 5G tie-up;;SoftBank has delivered a net profit for the financial year that came in above estimates, and announced it was teaming up with Qualcomm and Sprint to develop technologies for 5G wireless.Operating income at the Japanese telecommunications giant rose 12.9 per cent to ¥1.03tn in the 12 months to March 31, although sales crept higher by less than 1 per cent to ¥8.9bn.Net profit more than tripled to ¥1.43bn in the company’s financial year, beating the ¥975bn forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.A large portion of the bottom line boost came from asset sales, but results were also affected by the recognition of a ¥232bn loss on derivatives related to its stake in Alibaba, the Chinese internet giant. That paper loss is likely to be translated into a gain at a later date when the bonds are converted to Alibaba shares.For SoftBank’s domestic telecommunications operations, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 4 per cent over the year to ¥1.2tn, while adjusted Ebitda at Sprint, the US telco, was up 9.8 per cent. High competition meant Spring experienced its first loss in customers in two years, a speedbump as it continues its multi-year turnaround strategy.Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder and chief executive, at a press briefing in Tokyo, said preparations for the company’s $100bn Vision fund, focused on tech investments, were on track.
206;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-04-28T12:40:23Z;What is at stake in the Apple-Qualcomm dispute?;The costly battle between the two smartphone giants explained;"Qualcomm warned of a significant revenue shortfall on Friday, after Apple said it would withhold payments to its own iPhone suppliers, choking their ability to pay royalties on the chipmaker’s designs.The move represents a significant escalation of the dispute between two giants of the smartphone world over royalties and the licensing of intellectual property. Here are some answers to the questions over what is at stake:How significant is the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm? Is it just another chapter in the patent wars?
Apple has already engaged in various disputes with rivals including the long-running Samsung battle and a patent disagreement with Nokia that has reared its head again this year. Yet the battle with Qualcomm is distinct from those and is a direct attack on the chipmaker’s business practices. The original dispute, filed in January when Apple demanded $1bn, accused Qualcomm of abusing its monopoly position which it had preserved through “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”. Qualcomm said those accusations were “baseless”.Who else is in Apple’s corner?
There is industry-wide concern that Qualcomm is becoming too powerful, particularly as the telecoms market moves toward 5G networks. Meanwhile, regulators have been agitating over its strength. South Korean authorities levied a $854m fine on the company in December, accusing it of charging “excessive” licensing fees, a probe in which Apple participated. The European Commission launched a similar investigation in 2015 and the Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm in January over its licence terms.What is Qualcomm accused of doing?
Regulators are concerned that the chipmaker refuses to license its patents for essential standards used in basebands — the part of the phone that connects to the network — to rivals such as Intel and Taiwan’s MediaTek. Instead it levies royalties on the handset makers based on the total cost of their products, which translates into a higher royalty rate. Qualcomm, which operates a policy called “no licence, no chips”, counters that only a portion of its licence fee directly relates to basebands and its host of other patents mean it makes sense to encompass the whole product in its terms.Why is Foxconn embroiled in this?
This has become a proxy war, with Apple looking to strangle Qualcomm’s flow of royalty payments by slowing payments to companies including Foxconn that make the phones. With the companies that assemble the handsets not passing on the lucrative payments to Qualcomm, Apple has upped the ante in trying to force the chipmaker to the table given the length of time it usually takes to settle vicious patent disputes. Apple is not a direct licensee of Qualcomm, which sees its action as interfering in long-standing relationships it has with those companies.What does it mean for Qualcomm’s structure?
Qualcomm both licenses and makes chips. The licensing business under attack has been its saviour in recent years, due to its staggering earning power. Last year, its licensing business generated $7.7bn of revenue, which translated into a $6.5bn profit. In contrast, its manufacturing arm generated $15.4bn of sales, but only $1.8bn of profit. Other chip manufacturers have been forced to consolidate due to market pressure and the decreasing cost of processors. Qualcomm was forced by activist investors to review its structure in 2015 when it ruled out a split.The dichotomy is nowhere more apparent than with Apple, which has started using chips made by Intel for its iPhones after a five-year exclusivity deal with Qualcomm ended last year. Qualcomm’s licensing business keeps it in the game however as it still takes a slice of the profit on every iPhone sale due to royalties.Is Apple cracking down across its entire supply chain?
It would appear so. Alongside the Qualcomm dispute was the move to end its longstanding relationship with British graphics chip designer Imagination Technologies. Shares in the chipmaker, in which Apple holds a stake, crashed 60 per cent earlier this month after the iPhone maker said it would use its own internally designed graphics processors in the future. That sent a chill through the components market and shares in Dialog lost a third of their value after an analyst predicted that Apple was also working on developing its own power management chips.Didn’t Qualcomm just pay out to BlackBerry? Was it the same issue?
Qualcomm was forced to refund BlackBerry to the tune of $815m two weeks ago, but the circumstances were different. That settlement related to a dispute over royalty payments. The Canadian company had, in effect, overpaid for the use of Qualcomm patents as sales of its BlackBerry phones collapsed between 2010 and 2015. Qualcomm shares dipped 3 per cent after it was forced to settle the dispute."
207;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-04-28T11:35:18Z;Qualcomm warns of big shortfall as Apple chokes supplier royalties;Proxy war between iPhone maker and leading chipmaker intensifies as payments withheld;"Qualcomm warned investors on Friday that it could face a multibillion-dollar shortfall in sales and profits over the coming years if it is unable to resolve its legal fight with Apple, after the iPhone maker choked the ability of its own suppliers to pay royalties to the chip designer. In a drastic deterioration in the legal battle with one of its largest customers, Qualcomm slashed its revenue guidance for the current quarter by about $500m. Apple’s move fulfils what one Wall Street analyst had previously described as a “doomsday scenario” for the world’s biggest wireless chip company. Qualcomm shares were down 3 per cent to $51.58 in mid-morning trading on Friday.Apple told Qualcomm this week that it is “withholding payments” from contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which the companies would normally owe to Qualcomm in royalties for iPhone sales — a practice Qualcomm has described as an “example of Apple wielding its enormous commercial leverage over its suppliers”. In turn, these suppliers are dependent on Qualcomm’s intellectual property for key wireless components of the iPhone.“Apple has indicated it will continue this behaviour until its dispute with Qualcomm is resolved,” the chipmaker said in a statement, a process some analysts believe could take years. As a result, for the quarter ending in June, Qualcomm said its revenues would be in a range of $4.8bn-$5.6bn, compared with its previous expectation for sales of $5.3-$6.1bn, making a year-on-year decline all but inevitable. Diluted earnings per share would be markedly lower than it had previously suggested to investors, in a range of $0.52-$0.62, down from $0.67-$0.92. Friday’s cut to its outlook suggests Apple is responsible for more than 20 per cent of the chipmaker’s sales for the March quarter. Analysts estimate Qualcomm relies on Apple royalties for more than a quarter of its earnings.Qualcomm’s warning comes just a week after it had told investors that it did not anticipate “a scenario where no payment is made by the contract manufacturers”. Qualcomm had, however, warned of greater uncertainty in its forecasting due to the Apple litigation. On Friday, Qualcomm said Apple’s contract manufacturers “may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant”. Its new guidance assumes no payment is made for the quarter. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said.Apple contends that it has been “overcharged billions of dollars” over several years by Qualcomm, accusing the chipmaker of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”. “We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and . . . we have no choice left but to turn to the courts,” the iPhone maker said in January. On Friday, it responded: “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.”We are surprised by the number of investors that believe the two companies are likely to reach a quick settlementApple’s litigation included a demand for $1bn that the iPhone maker claims Qualcomm owes it and withheld after Apple participated in an investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Earlier this month, Qualcomm warned that Apple had withheld that $1bn sum from its suppliers. The iPhone maker’s latest move goes much further, with far-reaching consequences for the designer and maker of Snapdragon processors and other key smartphone components. Analysts at Citi in January had described the prospect of Apple withholding royalties from Qualcomm as a “Doomsday scenario”, while Morgan Stanley, in a recent note, predicted the legal battle could last for two to three years. “We are surprised by the number of investors that believe the two companies are likely to reach a quick settlement,” Morgan Stanley analysts said. In a note on Friday, analysts at Stifel cut their estimates for Qualcomm’s full-year earnings, saying that Apple's royalty payments represent as much as 30 per cent of the company’s total earnings.“We view Apple's refusal to pay Qualcomm's royalties as a bold gesture and an escalation of the tensions between the two companies,” Stifel said. “While we view the reduced contribution from Apple as being priced into the shares, we believe investors remain concerned that Qualcomm will be forced to change its broader licensing business strategy.”Apple has never held a direct licence for Qualcomm’s IP, instead relying on agreements between contract manufacturers such as Foxconn. Mr Rosenberg said that Qualcomm’s licence agreements with Apple’s suppliers “remain valid and enforceable”. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” he said. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” He added: “We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.”Apple’s action threatens to escalate further a bitter legal battle that is already raging in courts across three continents. Earlier this month, when it filed its legal response against Apple, Qualcomm said that the iPhone maker’s “tortious interference” in its contracts with suppliers “violated . . . California law”. “The prospect of Apple’s continued interference threatens significant additional injury to Qualcomm,” it warned in the April 10 filing, leaving open the possibility that it could seek further legal redress against Apple or its suppliers after its latest move.

Qualcomm’s stock dropped 3 per cent.The two companies had entered arbitration talks in February over Qualcomm’s “agreement to cap certain royalties applied to payments made by BlackBerry under a licence agreement”. The Canadian company had, in effect, overpaid for the use of Qualcomm patents as sales of its BlackBerry phones collapsed between 2010 and 2015.The chipmaker, whose extensive intellectual property in telecoms often puts it at the centre of patent disputes, said in a statement: “While Qualcomm does not agree with the decision, it is binding and not appealable. The arbitration decision was limited to prepayment provisions unique to BlackBerry’s licence agreement with Qualcomm and has no impact on agreements with any other licensee.”John Chen, chief executive of BlackBerry, was keen to draw a line under the arbitration, as it will continue to work with Qualcomm in its new form as a software and security company. “BlackBerry and Qualcomm have a longstanding relationship and continue to be valued technology partners,” he said.BlackBerry and Qualcomm have a longstanding relationship and continue to be valued technology partnersThe repayment is a major boost to BlackBerry’s coffers. Mr Chen has reduced losses and cash burn at the Canadian company since he was appointed in late 2013. He restored the company’s cash balance to reassure his customers that BlackBerry was not on the verge of collapse, despite the rapid slowdown in its smartphone business.The Qualcomm payment will raise its cash balance to at least $1.9bn according to Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um, which is equivalent to half of its market value. That raises the prospect of acquisitions or a share buyback, according to the analyst.The payout comes as Qualcomm is facing a barrage of legal and regulatory attacks over its pricing and business practices. It is fighting Apple, one of its largest customers, in courts in the US, UK, China and Japan, as the iPhone developer accused the chipmaker of overcharging by billions of dollars for its intellectual property.Earlier this week, Qualcomm launched legal action against Apple, claiming it had lied to regulators who were investigating Qualcomm for allegedly abusing its market position. Qualcomm also accused Apple of interfering with royalty payments from the iPhone’s manufacturers to the chipmaker.Last year, Qualcomm was hit with a $890m fine from the South Korean antitrust authorities. It is also battling allegations of anti-competitive behaviour from the US Federal Trade Commission.

After Apple sued it for at least $1bn in January, the world’s second-largest chipmaker is now seeking “significant” damages from the world’s most valuable public company.“We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel.That defence includes accusing Apple of attempting to gag its response to third-party reports late last year that found Qualcomm’s chips outperformed rival Intel’s when both were included in different models of the iPhone 7.Qualcomm claims that Apple “effectively chose to limit the performance of the Qualcomm-based iPhones” so that consumers would not realise its chips performed “far better” than Intel’s. It alleges that Apple told reporters there was “no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models”, but subsequently threatened that Qualcomm’s “standing as an Apple chip set supplier would be jeopardised” if the processor provider attempted to dispute the statement.San Diego-based Qualcomm is seeking to establish itself as a pioneer of cellular technology that has invested $40bn in R&D over three decades to create wireless networking standards that are used across the industry.“Apple has built the most successful consumer products in history by relying significantly on cellular technologies pioneered by Qualcomm. Now, Apple wants to pay far less than fair value for a licence to Qualcomm’s patents,” its legal team wrote.Monday’s filing describes a long history of difficult negotiations between the two companies over the value of that intellectual property.Apple has never held a direct licence for Qualcomm’s IP, instead relying on agreements between contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, and Qualcomm alleges that Apple has “directly interfered” with these deals as part of an effort to pressure its business.Apple has held “on and off negotiations” for years about a direct licence, Qualcomm said, including as recently as 2015, until the iPhone maker filed its lawsuit in January.Apple contends that it has been “overcharged billions of dollars” over several years by Qualcomm. Its litigation includes a demand for $1bn that the iPhone maker claims Qualcomm owes it and withheld after Apple participated in an investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission.Qualcomm has now accused Apple of withholding a similar figure from four contract manufacturers which they, in turn, have held back from paying to Qualcomm.“The prospect of Apple’s continued interference threatens significant additional injury to Qualcomm,” the chipmaker said in Monday’s filing.That news could unsettle Qualcomm’s investors, given analysts expect around $1.9bn or 8 per cent of the chipmaker’s overall revenues this year and an even greater portion of its earnings to come from Apple-related royalties.Analysts at Citi in January described the prospect of Apple withholding royalties from Qualcomm as a “Doomsday scenario”.While some amount does now appear to have been withheld by Apple’s manufacturers, the exact sums involved were redacted from the public version of Qualcomm’s latest legal documents.In response to Monday’s filing, Apple reiterated its earlier statement, accusing Qualcomm of “exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”.“We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and . . . we have no choice left but to turn to the courts,” the iPhone maker said in January.Apple is also suing Qualcomm in China, the UK and Japan, and the chipmaker is simultaneously fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by the US Federal Trade Commission. Last week, Qualcomm asked a judge in California to dismiss the FTC’s case altogether.
213;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-03-16T21:09:09Z;The augmented reality of Blippar chief’s life story;AR app’s co-founder did not study at LSE nor float his first company, records show;In a few months, Ambarish Mitra will arrive in Monaco as a contender in Ernst & Young’s global Entrepreneur of the Year awards.The chief executive and co-founder of augmented reality app Blippar, one of Britain’s few “unicorns” — as tech start-ups valued at a billion dollars or more are known — will be there to represent the UK against 60 other countries.When he was nominated last October, EY’s judges called him “a man with big vision” whose social conscience is “driven at least in part by his own early life experiences” — a reference to Mr Mitra’s frequently told tale of triumph over adversity in the slums of Delhi, which prompted the BBC to dub him a “real life slumdog multi-millionaire”.Mr Mitra has raised over $100m for Blippar from the likes of Qualcomm and a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. The start-up has built an app that recognises real-world objects and superimposes relevant information. CNBC placed it ninth in its top 50 “disrupters” in the world.But when it comes to the story of his remarkable life, a closer look at Mr Mitra’s background suggests significant discrepancies between the real-world evidence and the overlaid tale people have wanted to believe.For instance, the founding myth of Mr Mitra’s career is a business he started and floated in India during the dotcom boom, yet we could find no record of an initial public offering for the company in which he was involved. Mr Mitra also reportedly claimed to have attended the London School of Economics, but the university said he was never a student. The “three large-scale disasters” Mr Mitra is said to have launched in the UK before founding Blippar were personal projects he never incorporated as companies.Mr Mitra told the FT it was “a bit complex to analyse my life without truly understanding me” and said he had been misquoted by the media. After we approached him, Mr Mitra removed several claims from his LinkedIn page.The story told in the numerous articles about Ambarish Mitra begins in India in the mid-1990s, when he ran away from his family home in Dhanbad, an industrial town in the east of India, to land in the slums of Delhi. It was there he had his first big break.As the story goes, around 1996 or 1997, Mr Mitra saw an advert in a newspaper for a business plan competition. His proposal for a women-focused website won and, with the $10,000 prize money, he launched womeninfoline.com. In 2000, he floated the company in India.However, the FT has found no official mention of Ambarish Mitra, his exploits or the stock market float. Instead, in the contemporary reports and on the archived version of womeninfoline.com, there is a reference to a company called “Mudra Consultants”.Mudra’s chairman when womeninfoline.com launched was Ashok Kumar Gadiya, who is now chancellor of Mewar University in Rajasthan, a region in the north-west of India. Mr Gadiya told us it was his company, Mudra Consultants, that launched womeninfoline.com. He said Mr Mitra “was not a regular employee” and suggested he might have acted as a consultant. Later, he said, “I am sure that he was not associated with us in any manner”.Mr Mitra strongly disagrees with Gadiya’s account. He said Mudra became the legal owner of womeninfoline.com, but insisted the website was his idea and that he built it.“I have always mentioned in my interviews that I was very young and was not in full control of the business,” he said. This week, after questions from the FT, he said in a blog it was Mudra Consultants that took it public, after he had left.After womeninfoline.com, Mr Mitra moved from India to the UK, where he attended university. In 2015, Mr Mitra tweeted a story by The Sunday Times that reported he “earned a masters degree” from the London School of Economics. In August 2016, The Economic Times reported him as saying, “I went to LSE because of this deep-rooted Indian mindset of getting a degree”.The LSE said they could not find Mr Mitra in their alumni database. Mr Mitra told the FT he did not study at the LSE and suggested he was not the source of the claim.The next part of his life is the years spent in the UK as an entrepreneur before co-founding Blippar in 2011. Last year, The Times of India reported Mr Mitra as saying he launched “three large-scale disasters” during the 2000s while in the UK. According to The Sunday Times, he “launched” five companies, four of which failed.However, he has only been the director of one company in the UK, according to Companies House records, and that is Blippar.Mr Mitra said the other ventures were not registered as companies “as we never got funding”.“Entrepreneurship doesn’t mean you own something with legal stamp paper — it also means when two friends spend a lot of time in their flat building things [and] spending their own money,” he told the FT.From its founding in 2011, Blippar has grown to hundreds of employees in 10 offices around the world. It lost £26m in the 16 months to March 2016, but says its augmented-reality app has 65m users.Now 38, Mr Mitra has come a long way from the slums of Delhi. Success for him has come after what he calls “a fairly tough life with lots of ups and downs”.He said if Blippar had never happened, no one would have been interested in his past, which “exposes the superficial side of […] society”.“Blippar is my real start,” he said.A full version of this article is at ft.com/alphaville
214;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-03-14T06:37:06Z;Intel joins Silicon Valley’s race into self-driving cars;Chipmaker’s acquisition of Mobileye follows bets by Qualcomm, Samsung and SoftBank;When Intel’s chief executive addressed shareholders at last month’s investor day, he insisted that the “traditional market view” of the company as a Silicon Valley stalwart making chips for PCs and servers was wrong.“The way we look at the world is a bit different,” Brian Krzanich said. “We are a data company.”Investors would soon discover just how differently Mr Krzanich was looking at Intel’s world. On Monday, he announced the $15bn acquisition of Mobileye, a leader in the fast-growing market for assisted-driving systems — the second-largest deal in Intel’s 49-year history.“Together, we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving,” Mr Krzanich said, “and we see this market as growing to an over $70bn TAM [total addressable market] by 2030.”Semiconductor makers are swarming over the automotive industry in the hope that the increasing use of electronics in cars will offset a slowdown in smartphones and the PC’s decline.Last year Qualcomm paid $47bn for NXP and Samsung bought Harman for $8bn, while Softbank’s $32bn acquisition of UK-based chip designer Arm Holdings was also partly motivated by the anticipation of smarter, more connected cars.Mobileye, founded in Israel in 1999, has pioneered computer-vision systems that can “see” cars, pedestrians and other objects on the road, then help vehicles avoid them. Its EyeQ chips and cameras are installed in 15m vehicles, in partnership with 25 automakers, giving it a market share of roughly 80 per cent in “advanced driver assistance systems”.The market will be huge and they are in a dominant position“The market will be huge and they are in a dominant position,” says Mike Ramsey, auto industry analyst at Gartner, the research group.Together, Intel and Mobileye hope to offer car manufacturers a one-stop shop for autonomous-driving technology.“Intel has mapping and infrastructure assets in data centres, artificial intelligence and machine learning, which complements our assets in hardware and simulators,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said on Monday. “If you put all of that together you get an end-to-end solution for autonomous driving — from car to data centre. It is a very powerful value proposition.”Like Mr Krzanich, Mr Shashua describes his company not as a chipmaker but as a data company. Starting next year, Mobileye plans to use a new generation of EyeQ to build a constantly updated map of the real world from sensors carried by 2m vehicles. This “crowdsourcing”, which Mobileye calls “road experience management”, is one way in which it has evolved to become a “completely different company” in the two and a half years since its $7.6bn initial public offering, Mr Shashua said in January.Yet despite the hype in Silicon Valley around self-driving cars and the proliferation of companies experimenting with autonomous vehicles, the market remains nascent.While Mr Krzanich estimates the first driverless cars could be on the roads by the early 2020s, some analysts predict legal and regulatory roadblocks could push that back by as much as a decade. Mobileye’s revenues are expected to grow from $358m in 2016 to about $500m this year, representing less than 1 per cent of Intel’s $59bn sales last year.Ambrish Srivastava, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, notes that Mobileye’s enterprise value of 29 times sales compares with the semiconductor industry’s average of about 5 times. “They are paying, in our view, a very high premium for an opportunity that is still developing,” Mr Srivastava says.Taking into account Monday’s 2 per cent fall after the deal was announced, Intel’s shares are up 11 per cent over the past 12 months. Over the same period, rival chipmakers AMD and Nvidia have raced ahead, up by more than 400 per cent and 200 per cent, respectively.Analysts say the steep price Intel is paying — a 34 per cent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday — reflects the chipmaker’s fear of missing another big opportunity, after sitting out the last decade’s smartphone revolution. “This is a bet that they felt they had to make,” says Mr Ramsey.Other autonomous-driving entrepreneurs say Jerusalem-based Mobileye is ahead of its Silicon Valley rivals because of its ownership of hardware and software.“They provide both the chips and the application layer on top,” says Rani Wellingstein, chief executive of Oryx Vision, an Israeli company that is developing laser-scanning technology for self-driving cars.Thanks to Mobileye’s record with automakers and relationships with top-tier suppliers such as Delphi, Intel is instantly gaining “a front-seat position in the next-generation mobility business”, Mr Wellingstein says.Intel has just bought Mobileye, a leader in the fast-growing market for assisted-driving systems, for $15bn. Why was this small Israeli company so attractive to the semiconductor giant and will the deal pay off? Madhumita Murgia puts the question to the FT’s Sujeet Indap in New York a John Reed in JerusalemUntil now, many analysts had attributed pole position in autonomous driving to Nvidia, the maker of graphical processing chips beloved by video gamers and programmers of artificial intelligence systems alike. Last year, in a bitter falling-out with Mobileye, Tesla switched to a computer-vision system developed in-house and powered by Nvidia’s processors for its Autopilot assisted-driving system. In January, Nvidia struck partnerships with Audi and Mercedes-Benz.Mobileye faces further competition from top-level auto suppliers such as Bosch and Continental as well as Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo.Mobileye’s Mr Shashua, however, has been dismissive of new competitors from Silicon Valley. “I meet these people only at CES,” he said at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “I don’t meet them in the marketplace.”
215;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-02-28T13:05:32Z;China smartphone maker Xiaomi designs its first chip;Chinese tech companies look to create own IP rather than buy from foreign makers;China’s Xiaomi has become the world’s fourth smartphone maker to design its own processor, revealing its “Pinecone” chip on Tuesday aimed at breaking its reliance on foreign providers such as Qualcomm.The handset maker is leading a wave of Chinese tech groups that are trying to follow Apple, Samsung and Huawei by creating their own internal intellectual property, rather than relying on external sources.“The ability to create its own chip sets is the pinnacle of achievement for any smartphone company. For Xiaomi, the move is an essential next step in our development,” said Lei Jun, chief executive, at the launch.Zhang Ziming of Analysys, a tech consultancy, said: “These Chinese firms want to break the monopoly on chip technology by foreign companies and take part more in upstream competition.”Like most other smartphone makers, Xiaomi had previously relied on Qualcomm to supply chips. But the US group’s global dominance has led to complaints over how it charges smartphone companies to use its designs.It is hard and expensive to design the best chips — and of course, redesign the next generation and next generationIn December, the company was fined $854m by South Korea for abusing its market position and charging excessive fees. It is now facing two lawsuits over licensing fees, one from US regulators, as well as a $1bn case involving Apple.“Designing chips in-house means that Chinese companies will suffer less from supply-chain disruptions. Xiaomi has previously had to delay the launch of its flagship phone because of problems with Qualcomm’s chip set,” said Ding Jie, an analyst at Canalys, a tech research group.Xiaomi’s chip ambitions date to October 2014, when the company set up a subsidiary, Beijing Pinecone Electronics.China has been slowly developing domestic chips. China-based companies’ share of chip designs in the global market roughly doubled to 11 per cent in the four years to 2015, while US-based companies have more than 60 per cent, according to Christopher Thomas of McKinsey.“Building differentiation via developing phone chip designs is a good strategy — all the top three phone players do it. The challenge is execution: it is hard and expensive to design the best chips — and of course, redesign the next generation and next generation,” added Mr Thomas.Mr Lei admitted that chip design was a high-risk field with “nine ways to die for every one way to survive”, but that the company needed to break into the field in order to upgrade itself.The chip design could cut costs long-term when compared with buying other companies’ designs, said Mr Zhang. Moreover, Xiaomi emphasised that designing a more energy-efficient central processor and graphics processor meant its new phone could save on battery weight.The Pinecone Surge S1 chip will be included on Friday in Xiaomi’s new 5c phone. The company shunned Barcelona’s Mobile World Conference and stayed in Beijing to launch its new mid-range phone, which is priced at Rmb1,499 ($218).Xiaomi has been looking for an edge to boost revenues, as its smartphone sales have suffered over recent years due to heightened competition from Oppo, Vivo and other low-end manufacturers in China’s increasingly crowded smartphone market.
216;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-26T18:57:40Z;US tech groups at risk of losing their global hegemony;Trump pulled country out of TPP whose ground rules favoured US industry;The biggest American tech companies have long known how to find foreign battlefields where they can fight out their competitive rivalries.Ever since complaints from Microsoft’s domestic enemies contributed to the series of European antitrust actions that tied the software company in knots in the 1990s, Brussels has been a favoured venue for such battles. One effect has been to increase the influence of EU regulators in setting global digital norms.China has been another matter. Often left on the outside, US tech companies have been far more likely to complain of a lack of protection for their intellectual property, or heavy-handed actions that block market access, than seek to use the mainland legal system to their own advantage.Apple’s decision to lodge an antitrust claim this week against its domestic rival Qualcomm in China marks a notable departure.The case is a private suit filed in a Chinese court, and echoes the way private battles over IP between the leading tech concerns have spilled over into many different jurisdictions.But the complaint also looks like a barely veiled invitation to Chinese regulators to weigh in again, two years after they forced the US chipmaker into a $975m antitrust settlement.The dispute also confirms China’s growing influence over digital issues with global resonance. The sheer size of its domestic market, and a tough domestic anti-monopoly law that has been wielded aggressively, most notably against Qualcomm, have given it new power.The Apple lawsuit was not the only sign this week that a path is opening up for China to become a more significant arbiter for the information economy. Half a world away, in Washington, President Donald Trump formally withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact whose strategic intent was to cement American influence over trade policy in Asia and act as a counterweight to China.Digital trade was a key part of the deal. The TPP would have been the first international trade agreement to enshrine formal rules for cross-border ecommerce — specifically, banning countries from insisting that data be held locally or putting up blocks to prevent data flows.These ground rules have favoured the US tech industry, and have supported the emergence of the large-scale data storage and computing clouds that are coming to dominate the IT landscape.Silicon Valley, wary of riling the new president, was silent about Trump’s withdrawal from TPP, though the ITI, a trade group whose members are a who’s-who of tech, including Apple, Google and Facebook, allowed itself an expression of regret.Abandoning the US ground rules opens the door for China to have more influence over policy in the region — to the benefit of its own digital companies. At least, that is the theory. Whether China can effectively step into the vacuum is a different matter.In reality, it has become increasingly unsuitable as a trading partner for digital services, according to Erik van der Marel, an economist at the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels.He tracked the “complementarity” between the US and China as a trading partner for other nations covered by the TPP when it comes to cross-border services that are delivered over the internet. In effect he was looking at whether Chinese companies could easily step into the shoes of American concerns and provide the same services.According to this analysis, until 2008, the gap between the two countries was narrowing and China was becoming more digitally competitive. But since then it has widened sharply again.There is no great mystery to this, according to Mr van der Marel. He says that China’s restrictive stance on things like data flows and investment in digital services have made it poorly suited to act as a hub for emerging cross-border digital commerce.For now, despite the collapse of TPP, the region will still do things the American way. But that isn’t a guarantee for the long term.It is no accident that the rise to global hegemony of the US tech giants followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, when there was little resistance to the spread of the liberal economic order they represented.That era may be coming to an end. The next quarter of a century is not likely to offer the same opportunities for unbridled global expansion as the last.richard.waters@ft.com
217;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Apple-Qualcomm: modem operandi;US-made iPhones will need cut-price components;US factory workers have shown little appetite for the wages, or dormitories, of their Chinese counterparts. Tax breaks may sweeten the deal, but if Apple is coerced into building the iPhone within the US, it will also need to find big savings to make up for soaring labour costs.If the world’s biggest company resists the world’s most powerful person, it still needs to boost margins as iPhone sales decline.This is the moment that Apple decides it is the victim of “price gouging” and sues Qualcomm, a wireless chipmaker, for demanding “exorbitant royalties” for modems. Qualcomm, whose shares have fallen 15 per cent since Friday’s lawsuit, rejected Apple’s allegations during its earnings call on Wednesday evening, saying the “irresponsible claims” would be proved false.Qualcomm does not lack the legal muscle — half of its business is based on defending its intellectual property. Apple is railing against a long-established structure when it complains that Qualcomm should not take a cut of the final price of each phone. It also unfairly diminishes the chipmaker’s innovation.Yet whatever the merits, as a margin-boosting tactic, the lawsuit is likely to bear fruit. Together with Samsung, Apple makes up more than 40 per cent of Qualcomm’s total revenues. Analysts estimate that it accounts by itself for about $3bn of the licensing division’s annual $8bn top line. A settlement, even if it incorporates a smaller cut of iPhone sales, is a better outcome than a protracted court battle with your most important customer.Life would be easier for Apple if it had an alternative to Qualcomm’s IP. Intel has started supplying modems to some iPhones but they have been received poorly. If any iPhone production shifts from Shenzhen, the best bet is that American workers would still be implanting Qualcomm components — albeit on slightly better terms to Apple.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
218;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-25T23:46:34Z;Qualcomm accuses Apple of ‘driving regulatory attacks’;Chipmaker’s profits cut in half by South Korean fine;Qualcomm has accused Apple of “driving regulatory attacks” against it around the world, in a deepening legal row between the mobile chipmaker and one of its largest customers.The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in the US and China in the last week, accusing the chipmaker of abusing a “monopoly” position in cellular technologies. Apple is seeking $1bn in the US and around $145m in China.The US Federal Trade Commission also sued Qualcomm last week over the way it licenses its technology for mobile phones. Furthermore, Qualcomm is fighting with antitrust regulators in South Korea, home to Samsung Electronics, and in Europe.“The US FTC complaint and Apple’s complaint are not coincidental in content and timing,” said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm president, in a conference call on Wednesday. “We will prove that Apple’s irresponsible claims of extortion are false.”In its latest quarterly report, Qualcomm said that profits had fallen by more than half after an $868m fine by Korea’s antitrust authorities, as the chipmaker pledged to “vigorously defend our business model” against mounting legal challenges.Apple and Samsung together make up more than 40 per cent of Qualcomm’s revenues, including intellectual property licensing and chip sales.Analysts peppered Qualcomm with questions about whether its fight with the world’s most valuable company could cause the iPhone’s contract manufacturers, such as Foxconn, to halt their royalty payments during the dispute.“We would hope and expect that Apple would not interfere with the terms of those [licensing] agreements,” Mr Aberle said, adding: “We can’t fully control those actions.”Aside from its growing legal battles, Qualcomm is also grappling with a slowing smartphone market. It warned that revenues might decline in the current quarter. Global shipments of 3G and 4G devices will increase by between 4 per cent and 10 per cent this year to 1.75bn-1.85bn units, it forecast.The San Diego-based company posted slightly better than expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter, while revenues came in a touch below Wall Street forecasts.Revenues grew 4 per cent to $6bn, compared with consensus estimates of $6.1bn. Earnings per share, after adjusting for certain items, were up 23 per cent to $1.19, just ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $1.18. Net income dropped 54 per cent to $0.7bn, largely because of a one-off charge related to an investigation by the Korean Federal Trade Commission, which was announced in late December. Qualcomm has said that it will appeal against that ruling.“We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive.Qualcomm’s outlook for its fiscal second quarter fell broadly within Wall Street’s expectations. Revenue guidance of $5.5bn to $6.3bn suggests that sales could fall 1 per cent in the worst-case scenario or increase 13 per cent at the high end of its range. Earnings will increase by between 11 per cent and 20 per cent to between $1.15 and $1.25, Qualcomm said.Qualcomm’s shares, which had gained 3.5 per cent during normal trading on Wednesday, lost about 4 per cent after hours.Apple declined to comment beyond its statement last week, which accused Qualcomm of reinforcing its “dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties”.Qualcomm’s general counsel Don Rosenberg said that Apple’s lawsuits were “just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than 100 other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.”This month at the Consumer Electronics Show, Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 835 chip, which claims a 25 per cent reduction in power consumption and will take up about 35 per cent less space than its previous generation. Samsung is expected to use the latest Snapdragon chip in its forthcoming Galaxy S8 handset.

Earnings, after adjusting for certain items, were up 23 per cent to $1.19, just ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $1.18. Net income dropped by 54 per cent to $0.7bn, largely due to a one-off charge related to its investigation by the Korean Federal Trade Commission, which was announced in late December.Qualcomm’s shares, which had gained by 3.5 per cent during normal trading on Wednesday, lost around 3 per cent after hours.“We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive.The latest results come as Qualcomm faces a barrage of new legal threats, sending its shares down by around 15 per cent in the past week – a drop worth about $13bn in market capitalisation.“The recent legal and governmental actions against Qualcomm are at their core driven by commercial disputes,” Mr Mollenkopf said. “As we have done in the past, we will vigorously defend our business model and the value of a portfolio of technologies that has been so instrumental to the success of the mobile communications industry.”Last week, the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm over the way it licenses its technology for mobile phones. That was swiftly followed by a lawsuit from Apple, a Qualcomm customer, which accused the chipmaker of abusing a “monopoly” position in cellular technology by demanding “excessive royalties”. Earlier on Wednesday, Apple also initiated legal action against Qualcomm in Beijing, citing similar complaints. Apple is seeking $1bn in the US and around $145m in China.“These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” said Qualcomm’s general counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement on Wednesday. “Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.”

In addition to Apple, Qualcomm is also being sued by the US Federal Trade Commission and is the subject of investigations in the EU and Taiwan.As Mr Shah noted:QCOM needs approval from multiple countries, including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the EU, and QCOM has current outstanding investigations with all except for China.Our downgrade and lower target price multiple are based on the increased uncertainty around the timing of accretion and diversification benefits from the NXPI acquisition, which we previously assumed would close in the second half of 2017.Apple is demanding a payment of $1bn it believes is due as a rebate for licensing fees, which it claims the chipmaker is holding back as punishment for Apple “responding truthfully” to the South Korean investigation. Qualcomm, it claims, charges Apple at least five times more than what it pays all its other cellular patent licensers combined.Qualcomm in response has said that Apple had “intentionally mischaracterised” the agreements and negotiations between the two companies.
221;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-21T01:57:36Z;Apple sues Qualcomm for $1bn for abusing its monopoly position;iPhone maker says chipmaker owes it a rebate for licensing fees;Apple has filed a $1bn lawsuit against Qualcomm accusing the chipmaker of abusing a monopoly position, after the US and South Korean regulators argued it exploited its market dominance at the expense of handset makers.Shares in Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $62.88 just before the markets closed on Friday when the lawsuit was published. This is the first direct challenge by one of Qualcomm’s major customers but it follows a lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, and an $890m fine from the South Korean antitrust authorities late last year.Apple is demanding a payment of $1bn it believes is due as a rebate for licensing fees, which it claims the chipmaker is holding back as punishment for Apple “responding truthfully” to the South Korean investigation. Qualcomm, it claims, charges Apple at least five times more than what it pays all its other cellular patent licensers combined.“Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement.“We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts.”Qualcomm said that Apple had “intentionally mischaracterised” the agreements and negotiations between the two companies.The smartphone patent wars are heating up, as questions left unanswered in the last round of litigation between Apple, Samsung, Google and Motorola emerge again.Last month, Apple and Nokia launched legal challenges against each other on both sides of the Atlantic, with Apple accusing two companies associated with the Finnish group of trying to extract and extort exorbitant revenue, and Nokia claiming Apple had infringed 32 of its patents in products that include the iPhone and iPad.In the complaint in the Qualcomm case, Apple asks the court to look at a representative sample of Qualcomm’s patents to see if they are valid and to examine if the royalties are too high. Every time Apple adds a new feature, such as touch ID to access Apple Pay, or increasing the memory on an iPhone, Qualcomm collects a larger royalty, the complaint claims.“Apple products are among the most innovative in the world, yet because of its monopoly power, its suppression of the disclosure of information to government agencies investigating Qualcomm, and an abusive licensing model, Qualcomm believes it is entitled to collect its ‘tribute’ on every such improvement,” it writes.Apple also accuses Qualcomm of coercing customers into remaining quiet in an effort to keep courts and regulators in the dark.“Qualcomm pursues its illegal practices through a secret web of agreements designed to obfuscate its conduct,” it added.Dan Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s executive vice-president and general counsel, said Qualcomm was still reviewing the complaint but it was clear the claims were “baseless”.“Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world,” he said. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.”
222;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Apple files $1bn lawsuit against Qualcomm;;"Apple has filed a $1bn lawsuit against Qualcomm accusing the chipmaker of abusing a monopoly position, after the US and South Korean regulators argued it used its dominance at the expense of handset makers.
Shares in Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $62.88 just before the close when the lawsuit was published, the first direct challenge by one of Qualcomm’s major customers, reports Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco.It follows a lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission earlier in the week, and a $890m fine from the South Korean regulators late last year.Apple is demanding a payment of $1bn it believes are due as a rebate for licensing fees – and claiming that the chipmaker is holding back the money as punishment for Apple’s contribution to the South Korean investigation.“Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in a statement.“Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.”Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment."
223;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm: chipped away;Chip company’s resolve over the royalties it charges is slowly weakening;Qualcomm has fended off threats to its business model from an activist investor and the government of China. There is no reason to think a lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission will have a different outcome.As owner of patents to vital smartphone components, Qualcomm’s licensing division makes a third of the group’s $24bn annual revenues, but three-quarters of profits. Jana Partners believed spinning off this jewel from the remaining chipset business might prompt a valuation upgrade. International regulators are more concerned with putting the jewel under the microscope to look for flaws.The FTC’s complaint, filed three days before a new US administration takes over, argues that Qualcomm is abusing its dominance to harm customers such as Apple, rivals such as Intel and ultimately the customer via higher prices. The shares fell 4 per cent in anticipation of the lawsuit, but pared that loss in after-market trading.The underlying criticism is that Qualcomm charges too much for licensing its technology. In particular, handset manufacturers are aggrieved that royalties are levied on the price of the entire device, whose features such as high-end cameras are far removed from mobile connectivity.But the FTC’s convoluted argument is that customers are prevented from making that case in court because Qualcomm would withhold supply of crucial components. Qualcomm denied ever threatening to withhold supply to secure a licensing agreement. And as with other late-in-the-day actions from the Obama administration, there is unlikely to be much desire to pursue it under president-elect Donald Trump.Qualcomm’s royalty rate has already fallen from 3.3 per cent in 2013 to 2.9 per cent last year. Rivals with heft are resolved to weaken Qualcomm’s ability to set mobile technology standards and then reap huge royalties. Kudos for all the victories, but Qualcomm cannot preserve its fat margins forever.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
224;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-17T23:24:29Z;US sues Qualcomm over licensing technology for mobiles;Move comes weeks after South Korea said it would slap $854m fine on the company;The US has sued Qualcomm over the way it licenses its technology for mobile phones, hitting at the business that generates most of the US chip company’s profits.The case follows an investigation begun in 2014, but which was accelerated in recent weeks as the Federal Trade Commission moved towards filing a high-profile antitrust case just days before a new administration takes control in Washington.Qualcomm’s shares fell more than 4 per cent on a report by Bloomberg about the impending action. It comes three weeks after South Korea said it would slap a $854m fine on the company over similar licensing concerns.The FTC’s decision to sue was on a majority 2-1 vote by its commissioners, whose ranks were depleted from the normal five ahead of the change of administration.In an unusual statement of dissent, commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen claimed the action was based on a “flawed legal theory …that lacks economic and evidentiary support, that was brought on the eve of a new presidential administration, and that, by its mere issuance, will undermine US intellectual property rights in Asia and worldwide”. Ms Ohlhausen, a Republican appointee, was outvoted by the two Democratic appointees on the commission.Given the …change in administration that will bring major changes in the composition of the commission, this may be last-minute grandstanding with little danger to Qualcomm“Given the dissent of one commissioner and the change in administration that will bring major changes in the composition of the commission, this may be last-minute grandstanding with little danger to Qualcomm,” said Erik Gordon, assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.The US complaint centres on the patents that other companies need to license to be able to implement communications standards such as 3G. Given the obligatory use of these so-called standards essential patents, companies like Qualcomm agree to certain limits on how they negotiate licences.According to the lawsuit, filed in the Northern district of California, Qualcomm unfairly uses its other main business — selling baseband processors to handset makers — to force them to agree to pay higher royalties for its patents. Under a company policy called “no licence, no chips”, Qualcomm threatens to cut off the supply of its basebands unless the customers agree to its patent licensing terms, resulting in higher fees, the FTC alleges.The US action also challenged the chip company over its practice of only licensing its technology to handset makers, and refusing to sell it to rival makers of basebands such as Intel and Taiwan’s MediaTek, which compete with it in selling components for devices like smartphones.That complaint echoed the action late last year by South Korean regulators, who also said Qualcomm should make its technology available to component suppliers. Critics say that levying royalties only on handset makers, based on the total cost of their products, is a way for the chipmaker to charge higher fees than it would otherwise be able to.However, Qualcomm executives argue that only a small portion of their patents are exclusively linked to cell phone basebands, which handle communications between the device and a mobile network. They claim their technology is integral to many other aspects of how phones function, making it natural to charge based on the overall product.In a further allegation, the FTC accused Qualcomm of giving Apple preferential royalty rates in return for buying only Qualcomm basebands between 2011 and 2016, a policy that the regulators say was designed to hurt other makers of basebands.Qualcomm shot back at the FTC, accusing it of rushing to file a case before this week’s presidential inauguration and of coming up with a complaint that was based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and misconceptions about the mobile technology industry.“This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of …the transition to a new administration,” said Don Rosenberg, general counsel.Qualcomm denied the central argument in the FTC’s case, that it “withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms”.

Given the obligatory use of these so-called standards essential patents, companies like Qualcomm agree to certain limits in how they negotiate licences.Qualcomm forces cell phone makers to pay higher royalties by “threatening to disrupt [their] supply of baseband processors,” according to the US lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in California.FTC commissioners voted 2-1 in favour of suing. The agency has been operating with just three commissioners ahead of the change of administration, instead of the typical five.In an unusual statement of dissent, commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen claimed the action was based on a “flawed legal theory… that lacks economic and evidentiary support, that was brought on the eve of a new presidential administration, and that, by its mere issuance, will undermine US intellectual property rights in Asia and worldwide.”Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

That comes after Qualcomm agreed to pay $975m to settle a complaint in China in February 2015.The company is also the subject of investigations in the EU and Taiwan.
227;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
228;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-04T18:03:33Z;Oracle’s Ellison, Apple, Qualcomm invest in SoftBank fund;Vision Fund hits $100bn and is still taking in money;Oracle founder Larry Ellison will join Apple, Qualcomm and Foxconn in backing SoftBank’s record-setting technology fund, allowing the Japanese telecoms group to hit its $100bn goal weeks ahead of schedule.Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund is also in talks to invest in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, according to people briefed about the negotiations. These people added that the fund will remain open to additional investment until the end of January as demand from both large companies and sovereign funds remained strong.The ease with which SoftBank has been able to attract investors, highlights the huge appetite global companies have for tech assets despite fears that the sky-high valuations of tech start-ups such as Uber and Snapchat are driving a new bubble.SoftBank has set up an investment committee that met for the first time on Tuesday, as the Japanese company begins exploring potential deals, the people said.Masayoshi Son, the deal-hungry billionaire who built SoftBank into a global internet powerhouse, announced the launch of the fund in October after securing the support of Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. He agreed to invest up to $45bn via the Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund.Since Donald Trump won the US election in November, Mr Son has been actively courting the president-elect, by vowing to invest as much as $50bn in American start-ups. Analysts believe the move could help SoftBank expand its other US businesses. SoftBank owns a controlling stake in telecoms group Sprint.The Vision Fund will be headed by Rajeev Misra, a former debt-trader at Deutsche Bank and UBS. He joined SoftBank at the end of 2014 as head of strategic finance.The main focus of the fund will be cutting-edge tech companies focusing on artificial intelligence and robotics as well as the “internet of things”, said two people informed about the investment strategy.Apple confirmed it is planning to invest $1bn in SoftBank’s vision fund, an unusual move for the company which has historically avoided large deals and has not run its own venture capital arm like many other large tech companies such as Google and Intel. Recently, it has slowly begun to invest more, with its $3bn purchase of headphones maker Beats in 2014 and its $1bn investment in Chinese ride-sharing service Didi Kuaidi last year.“We’ve worked closely with SoftBank for many years and we believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple,” a spokesman said.Apple is looking for ways to use its cash pile of about $240bn to spread its bets across new technologies, as investors wait for it to develop a product as successful as the iPhone.Late last month, SoftBank invested $1bn in OneWeb, a US satellite start-up, and cited it as the kind of investment it planned to carry out through the fund. In July, SoftBank spent $32bn to acquire Arm Holdings, a British company that designs chips used by smartphones and other connected devices.SoftBank confirmed that Mr Ellison’s family office, Qualcomm and Foxconn planned to invest in the fund. The individual companies and the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund were not immediately reachable.Additional reporting by Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco
229;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2017-01-03T22:00:26Z;Space-saving chips to usher in slimmer smartphones;Latest Qualcomm processors, taking up 35% less space, due in 2017 handsets;Thinner smartphones or more space for larger batteries are on the way this year, thanks to a big reduction in the size of the latest mobile processors that power them.Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipmaker, said on Tuesday that the new version of its flagship processor — the Snapdragon 835 — would take up about 35 per cent less space than last year’s model and consume roughly 25 per cent less power.Battery life has become mobile users’ biggest pain point, as people make ever greater demands of their smartphones.The latest Qualcomm chip, unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, has made an unusually big leap in energy efficiency, Keith Kressin, senior vice-president of product management for Snapdragon, told the FT in an interview — using about half the power of similar processors just a few years ago.“It’s really hard to do that level of jump year in year out,” he said. “This is a big one.”Handset makers are looking for new ways to differentiate themselves, to attract customers back to a slowing smartphone market. Qualcomm’s customers, which include Samsung, LG and Xiaomi, tend to employ its latest Snapdragon chips in their flagship devices. The first smartphones to take advantage of the new capabilities are expected to launch in the first half of 2017.The external design of the ubiquitous black rectangle has changed little in recent years, but Mr Kressin predicts “more experimentation” this year as a result of Snapdragon’s improvements. He expects modular designs that allow add-on hardware, foldable displays and thinner handsets. “Manufacturers aren’t anxious to increase the physical size of their devices,” he said. “They want to slim the bezel and make the screen bigger.”The world’s second-largest chipmaker by revenues hopes the new Snapdragon 835 will also enable smaller and lighter head-mounted displays for virtual and augmented reality, as well as bolstering its competitiveness with market leader Intel in portable PCs.“One of the things we really focused on in this generation is using the 835 for virtual reality,” Mr Kressin said, by making it more efficient so it gives off less heat — an important consideration when the device is worn on the face. The new Snapdragon also helps ensure smoother graphics and more accurate tracking of head movements. Any phone that uses it will be able to support Google’s Daydream mobile VR platform, which launched last year.One of the things we really focused on in this generation is using the 835 for virtual realityQualcomm has worked closely with software and internet companies including Google, Facebook and Tencent to help optimise its chips for untethered mobile headsets, which so far have lagged far behind their PC-connected counterparts, such as Oculus Rift, in the quality and realism of VR.Demonstrating Qualcomm’s ambitions for its new chip at CES this week, Osterhout Design Group will show a new version of its augmented-reality eyewear, using Snapdragon 835. The San Francisco-based company, which recently raised $58m in funding led by 21st Century Fox, will unveil its R8 headset, for release later this year.The eighth generation of its eyewear weighs just under 4.5 ounces and is priced below $1,000 for the first time, in an attempt to increase the consumer appeal of a device that so far has largely been used in industrial or corporate environments. The R8 will allow digital images to be viewed as a solid screen within the glasses or to appear like real objects, persisting in the real world that is also visible through the clear lenses.“Our goal is to develop a very powerful augmented reality headworn computer — smartglasses that can do pretty much everything your phone and tablet can do, and more,” said Peter Jameson, ODG’s chief operating officer.
230;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-12-29T17:42:14Z;Tech groups see new future with augmented reality;‘Mixed reality’ devices to feature prominently at January’s Consumer Electronics Show;Augmented reality is set to be one of the big themes of January’s Consumer Electronics Show as investment pours into start-ups working on new headsets and other systems that throw digital “holograms” on top of the real world.The ability to visualise and manipulate 3D images as though they were real objects, tell immersive stories and communicate in new ways is attracting entrepreneurs and some of largest technology companies to AR, also known as “mixed reality”.Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, has said AR would become an “everyday” experience for consumers. Apple has been experimenting with headset prototypes in its labs over the past year, people familiar with the situation have told the Financial Times, after accelerating its recruitment in related technologies such as optics and computer vision.Several companies are planning to show their latest headsets at CES, the gadget industry show in Las Vegas, taking advantage of the latest advances in image processing and lower energy consumption from chipmakers such as Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia. Others will show off AR cameras embedded into smartphones, enabling a more sophisticated take on apps such as Pokémon Go.Many in Silicon Valley believe that devices along the lines of Microsoft’s $3,000 HoloLens head-worn computer or start-up Magic Leap’s promised goggles will one day surpass smartphones as the dominant way people interact with computers. Advocates argue they could be a more natural way of using technology than staring down at a tiny screen.“AR is fundamentally a new technology that will enable the next generation of computing,” says Radu Rusu, chief executive of Fyusion, a software start-up focused on AR. “It’s the next step after your phone.”But even among executives and entrepreneurs within this emerging industry, there are wildly divergent opinions about when AR will be ready for broad scale consumer adoption.While some headsets targeting consumers will go on sale as soon as 2017, other manufacturers are targeting industrial applications and corporate users, believing that the cost and complexity of AR will be prohibitive for several years.“AR is very much in the Newton phase, if these were tablets,” says Brian Mullins, chief executive of AR hardware maker Daqri, referring to Apple’s personal digital assistant from the mid-1990s, which is widely regarded as a technical pioneer but commercial failure.In the “near term”, Mr Mullins says, the high cost and heightened expectations of what AR can do creates a “very high risk of disappointing consumers”. Daqri’s “smart helmet” is aimed at workers on construction sites, factories and other industrial situations with specialised requirements for hands-free, contextual information.We want to make sure we are in everyone’s daily routine in some wayRecent controversy about Magic Leap, even before it has launched, illustrates the challenge. The secretive Florida-based start-up has raised $1.4bn from investors and is expected to unveil its first AR headset in 2017. But its technology may differ to the early demonstrations given to investors and some initial promotional videos, according to a recent report by tech news site The Information. People close to Magic Leap told the FT earlier this year that it could take years to miniaturise its early prototypes, which were said to resemble a helmet attached to a server.Magic Leap, which has its own manufacturing facility in Florida, is currently testing production of its headset, which Rony Abovitz, Magic Leap chief executive, promised would be “small, sleek, cool”.Whether or not Magic Leap and others can deliver on high expectations, funding continues to pour into the market.In December, San Francisco-based ODG raised $58m led by 21st Century Fox for its range of AR headsets, which so far have been sold primarily to businesses and industrial users. ODG’s eyewear features “see-through” 3D displays that Pete Jameson, its chief operating officer, says can “replace all the screens in your life”.Mr Jameson says the company needed extra funds to scale up production as it felt “the undeniable pull of the consumer”.Others are raising funds to reach the same objective. Earlier this year, Meta, another AR headset maker, raised $50m in June, while Lumus, a Tel-Aviv based maker of AR displays, raised $45m during 2016 from investors including HTC. Fyusion, the AR software maker, is in the process of raising a $30m round.“We want to make sure we are in everyone’s daily routine in some way,” says Mr Rusu.He insists that it will not take five more years for AR to become mainstream. “The technology is ready,” he says. 
231;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-12-28T03:44:21Z;Qualcomm fined $854m in South Korea antitrust case;Watchdog accuses US chip designer of abusing market dominance in licensing charges;South Korea has fined Qualcomm Won1.03tn ($854m), accusing the company of abusing its market dominance in wireless chips to force “excessive” licensing fees on smartphone makers.The penalty, one of the biggest antitrust fines in history, could have wider ramifications, with Qualcomm facing a string of similar actions around the world over its licensing practices for technologies that are core to high-speed wireless communications standards. “Qualcomm has forced unilateral, unfair terms on licensing contracts without going through a fair calculation process,” Shin Young-sun, a director at the Korean Fair Trade Commission, said in Seoul on Wednesday. “This would be our first ruling to correct Qualcomm’s unfair business model . . . to revive fair competition in the telecoms sector.” The case centres on complaints by South Korea’s smartphone manufacturers that the world’s biggest standalone chip designer charged them excessive royalties by calculating its licensing fees based on the total cost of a handset, rather than that of the chipset or other components in which its technology is embedded. Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics rely heavily on Qualcomm’s semiconductors to provide their high-end handsets with processing power and speedy data connections on 3G and 4G networks. They have complained that the royalties they pay are too high. Analysts estimate that South Korean handset makers pay a combined Won1.5tn in annual royalties. South Korea accounts for one-fifth of Qualcomm’s annual global sales of $25bn, according to the KFTC.Samsung makes some of Qualcomm’s mobile chips on a contract manufacturing basis but it is also taking on Qualcomm by seeking to sell its own application processors to other smartphone producers. South Korean regulators intend the ruling to strengthen the hand of local device makers when they negotiate licensing terms with Qualcomm. But it drew a strong protest from the US chip company. Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said the company would challenge the findings in court, though it would still have to pay the fine pending appeal. He accused the South Korean regulators of building their case on a distorted view of how technology licensing works in the smartphone industry, and of failing to give the company a chance to defend itself adequately, required by trade agreements between the two countries. “All that flies in the face of reality,” Mr Rosenberg said. “The entire industry operates the way we do.” He also suggested that the regulators were showing favouritism towards Samsung, since they had refused to launch an investigation into the local electronics group after Apple lodged a complaint on a similar point. The South Korean antitrust agency has taken action against Qualcomm before, fining the company more than $200m in 2009 for abusing its market dominance.Last year, Qualcomm agreed to pay $975m to settle a complaint in China — a deal that opened the way to striking licensing deals with handset makers in one of its most important markets.
232;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-12-05T05:00:20Z;Silicon Valley’s quiet man — Steve Mollenkopf, CEO, Qualcomm;World’s biggest chipmaker must develop new products to survive;"Many technology companies have mastered the pivot. Twitter began as a podcasting company before switching to rapid-fire messaging. Slack was the side project of a video-game start-up before it became one of the fastest-growing companies in business software.Organisations usually pull strategic handbrake turns when they are young and nimble — not when they are 30 years old, valued at almost $100bn and at the centre of one of the world’s most dynamic markets: the smartphone. Qualcomm has done just that.When Steve Mollenkopf was appointed chief executive of Qualcomm in 2014 he could not have anticipated the challenges the world’s biggest mobile chipmaker would face. Activist shareholders pushed for a break-up of the company, an idea its board ultimately rejected; there was a bruising antitrust investigation in China, the world’s most important mobile market.On top of which Mr Mollenkopf has just executed the biggest takeover the semiconductor industry has seen, announcing in October the planned $47bn acquisition of NXP, Europe’s most valuable chipmaker.“We’ve had a lot to do,” says Mr Mollenkopf, in an interview at the Financial Times’ San Francisco offices. “We’ve had to really change where the company was going.”With revenues of $23.6bn in the fiscal year that ended in September, Qualcomm has been at the forefront of the mobile boom. Its intellectual property was used in almost 1.4bn 3G and 4G devices last year. Its Snapdragon processors are found in many of the best Android smartphones, including Samsung’s Galaxy S7, while its modems are used by some Apple products. Sales of these processors comprise two-thirds of revenues; patent licensing the rest.Yet the engine of this expansion — almost a decade of double-digit growth in the smartphone market — is slowing, especially in the expensive handsets fitted with Qualcomm’s technology. For Mr Mollenkopf, this meant Qualcomm had to make a bold bet on new markets, including the nebulous “internet of things” and automotive technology.“Unlike a start-up, when you have the freedom that [investors] will wait five years for something, when you’re a big company it’s probably harder to pivot,” he says. “You’ve also got this other existing business . . . that you have to nurture along the way.”A 20-year veteran of the company with two degrees in electrical engineering, Mr Mollenkopf rose to lead its chip set business before becoming chief operating officer. He is the first chief executive from outside the founding family. Irwin Jacobs co-founded Qualcomm in 1985 and led it before handing over to his son, Paul, in 2005, who remains executive chairman.A couple of years ago,Rick Clemmer, chief executive of Dutch chipmaker NXP, once teased his opposite number at Qualcomm, Steve Mollenkopf, that the two companies’ pitches to investors looked pretty similar: “You talk about automotive but we don’t see you guys playing in the market.”They can laugh about it now that the two companies are merging in the semiconductor industry’s biggest deal. Mr Clemmer describes Mr Mollenkopf is an “engineer’s engineer”.“He’s quiet, he listens a lot. When he talks, you know that it’s something that’s really been through his thought process.” During negotiations, Mr Mollenkopf gave his team a “lot of freedom” rather than being “intimately involved in the entire process” himself, says Mr Clemmer. “He allows them a lot of latitude and then gives them a lot of support.”A private character who lacks the hubris of some Silicon Valley chiefs, Mr Mollenkopf credits his engineering background with helping to keep staff motivated through the past two years.“In the end, we’re a product company and people were very focused and excited about the products they were working on,” he says.The most serious challenge came from China. Last year Qualcomm agreed to pay a fine of $975m after the National Development and Reform Commission found that it had violated antitrust law — then the highest fine of its kind in China. The complaint was that Qualcomm abused its dominant position in the smartphone chip market in how it licensed certain patents related to 3G and 4G. As part of the settlement, it agreed to license some patents to Chinese handset makers at a lower rate.“It wasn’t like we were new to China but the game that we had to play, the level of risk and the downside, was much higher,” Mr Mollenkopf says of that process.A big part of Qualcomm’s response to the Chinese authorities was to explain its contribution to an industry vital to the region’s development. “We’re kind of the hidden force behind a lot of things that people are aware of but they didn’t know Qualcomm was involved in,” he says, because the Chinese authorities were not as familiar with the company as with consumer-facing brands.Mr Mollenkopf insists he thrives in such crises. “People have opportunistic stress, that positive version,” he says. “Anybody in this industry is used to a lot of change in a short period of time and I’m no different. In fact, I think you actually have to like it.”The settlement meant Qualcomm could collect licensing revenues from the new wave of Chinese smartphone makers who were driving much of the growth there, paying dividends in its last quarter’s earnings. Its share price has risen by a fifth in the past six months.With the challenge resolved by the beginning of this year, Qualcomm was back to “playing offence”. In January, the chief executive of NXP, whose secure chips are used in cars and mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay, approached Qualcomm about a possible sale of its digital networking business. Mr Mollenkopf decided in June Qualcomm should buy NXP outright.He sees a particular opportunity in the automotive sector, where the smartphone is already being absorbed into the dashboard. The other driving force behind the deal is the “internet of things” — the idea that everyday objects will go online.When the NXP deal closes next year, the combined entity will be second only to Intel in the rankings of the largest semiconductor companies by revenues. Could Qualcomm, pitting its background in mobile against Intel’s PC legacy, ever get to number one? “We see a path, sure, but I think what drives us more [is] an end result of being meaningful in industries that are changing,” he says. “Engineers — and I’m an engineer at heart — care about working on something that they see every day and influences the entire world.“There’s not one industry today that’s not being disrupted by what’s happening at Qualcomm.”"
233;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-11-02T20:39:44Z;Qualcomm quarterly sales rise 13%;;Qualcomm posted a rise in quarterly profits and sales amid new licensing deals in China and stronger shipments.The company reported a 13 per cent year-on-year increase in fiscal fourth quarter sales to $6.2bn, higher than Wall Street estimates of $5.84bn. Net income jumped 51 per cent to $1.6bn, or $1.07 per share. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.28 a share beat expectations of $1.13.“Our fiscal fourth quarter EPS was above the high end of our expectations, reflecting new license agreements in China and strong chipset shipments,” said chief executive Steve Mollenkopf.Qualcomm said it expects sales of $5.7bn-$6.5bn in the current quarter, near the middle of Wall Street’s forecasts for $6.2bn. The lower end of its adjusted earnings guidance, which was in the range of $1.12-$1.22 per share, missed the $1.22 expected by analysts.The company’s shares have gained 35 per cent this year.Qualcomm in October agreed to pay $47bn for NXP, the world’s largest chipmaker for automobiles, in search for the next area of growth after smartphones.“We are well positioned to extend our mobile technology leadership and footprint into attractive growth opportunities, accelerated by our recently announced agreement to acquire NXP,” Mr Mollenkopf said.
234;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-10-28T17:41:32Z;Chip deals point to smart car future;Qualcomm buying NXP is latest tie-up showing the potential market for car technology;Masayoshi Son, chairman of Japanese technology group SoftBank, this week painted a nightmarish vision of what might happen when the roads are populated by intelligent automobiles.Cars are already crammed with hundreds of semiconductor chips to fire airbags, run infotainment system and control brakes. Once vehicles also become connected to the internet, Mr Son warned, and as autonomous driving features become more widespread, these rudimentary silicon brains will make an alluring target for hackers.Because cars were never designed with security as a major concern, he suggested, it might not be hard to plant a virus. Malicious code could be programmed to “wake up” at 9am one day, take over all the vehicles on the road and force them to crash at the same time.Such a doomsday scenario has done nothing to stop the headlong rush in the tech world to turn cars into computers on wheels. As a result, the tech supply chain is seeing a profound shake-up, capped by Europe’s the two biggest tech acquisitions.Mr Son, who was speaking at the annual conference of ARM Holdings, highlighted the opportunity to smarter cars as one of the main reasons he has just paid $32bn to buy the UK-based chip design company.And, also this week, another piece of Europe’s shrinking tech sector fell in an even bigger deal. Qualcomm, the US smartphone chip company, agreed to pay $47bn for Dutch rival NXP. A principle reason for its interest: NXP’s leading position in the automobile chip market.As Derek Aberle, president of the US chipmaker, puts it: “More and more of the car is going to come from the electronics.” In need of new markets for growth as the smartphone boom matures, Qualcomm, like many others in the tech world, has turned its sights to the road.The automobile chip business is set to grow from $29.4bn last year to $44.7bn by 2022, according to IHS Markit, a research firm. That would represent compound annual growth of around 6 per cent, well ahead of a semiconductor industry average closer to 2 per cent.*NXP is a leading maker of microcontrollers that handle automobile systems, boosted by the $11bn acquisition of US chipmaker Freescale late last year.Qualcomm, on the other hand, makes more powerful processors that can handle the growing information processing demands inside cars, as well as the communications chips to link to the outside world.The combination would make Qualcomm the biggest supplier of chips to the car world: along with its $2.4bn purchase of Cambridge-based CSR last year, it would generate $3.7bn in revenues from the business, $1bn more than nearest rival Infineon, according to IHS.Importantly, NXP has credibility with carmakers for highly demanding safety applications that Qualcomm lacks, according to Akhilesh Kona, an analyst at IHS. The chips that go into cars demand higher reliability and endurance than those in smartphones, he says, sometimes experiencing far higher temperatures, and with a requirement to function for many more years.Wall Street has certainly seen the clear industrial logic behind the deal, pushing shares in both companies higher since news of acquisition talks first broke. Their combined stock market values have risen $18bn since then, going a long way to vindicating Qualcomm’s attempt to break away from its smartphone base. Meanwhile, the combination may also signal further consolidation of companies behind the many fragmented systems inside cars, as more of the different components are brought under the control of a central silicon “brain”.If so, cars could follow the same trajectory as other computing devices, with more of the functions brought together on single slices of silicon. This is a trend that industry leaders such as Qualcomm have benefited from elsewhere in connecting devices.Mr Aberle is cautious about predicting how far this will go, but he says there are reasons why existing systems will take on more functions in future. For instance, he says, a car’s infotainment systems might also monitor a driver’s level of alertness.How smart cars will — and should — become is an open debate in the industry. Putting too many functions of a car under the control of a single system would increase its vulnerability to hackers, says Mr Aberle.A graphic demonstration came last week when hackers commandeered a range of everyday connected objects such as fridges and toasters and used them to mount an attack on a website. Next time it may be cars, not websites, that are doing the crashing.*The figure for compound annual growth has been amended from earlier publication
235;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-10-27T16:51:21Z;Qualcomm buys NXP for $47bn in Europe’s largest tech deal;World’s largest mobile chip company looks beyond smartphone era to automotive sector ;Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile chip company, agreed to pay $47bn for NXP, Europe’s most valuable chipmaker on Thursday, in the latest sign of the upheaval that has come as the industry looks beyond the smartphone era.The transaction is also the largest tech acquisition ever in Europe and the biggest in a string of acquisitions by chipmakers hunting for scale and diversification in a consolidating industry, capping the $37bn purchase of Broadcom by Avago last year.Qualcomm outflanked Intel, the dominant maker of PC chips, to become the leading supplier of the brains for today’s most widely-used intelligent devices, but has faced shareholder unrest since the smartphone market showed signs of maturing. It relies on the mobile market for 90 per cent of revenues, but that will fall to 68 per cent after the deal, according to UBS analysts.NXP has positioned itself as the leading provider of chips for the automotive market, which is undergoing rapid transformation, with the emergence of constantly connected, electric and autonomous vehicles. Its chips are also used in a wide range of industrial applications and so-called “internet of things” devices, and its security technology is used for mobile payments, such as Apple Pay in the iPhone.Qualcomm will tap its $28.6bn overseas reserves to help pay for the deal, eating into part of the massive cash mountain that the US tech industry has kept offshore rather than face higher tax bills in the US. The deal will also force it to borrow heavily and prompted the leading credit rating agencies to predict ratings downgrades on its existing $10bn of debt, though Qualcomm said it still expected to retain an investment-grade rating.The prospect of the US chipmaker putting its low-yielding cash to use and taking a big step into the chip industry’s next growth markets had already been enthusiastically welcomed by investors, with its shares jumping since reports of a possible deal started circulating late last month.Including further rises on Thursday, Qualcomm’s stock is up 13 per cent since hopes for the deal spread, while NXP’s shares are up 22 per cent, adding a combined $18bn to the value of the two companiesQualcomm said it would pay $110 a share for NXP, valuing its equity at about $37bn. Along with existing debt, the offer puts NXP’s total enterprise value at $47bn. The US company said the deal would add $10bn to its revenues, lifting it to $35bn, and give it access to chip markets worth $38bn that were previously beyond its reach.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, said: “The NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy to extend our leading mobile technology into robust new opportunities, where we will be well positioned to lead by delivering integrated semiconductor solutions at scale.”The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals, but the two companies said they expect the deal to close by the end of next year.The proposed sale is just the latest example of consolidation in the semiconductor space, as chipmakers face a flattening smartphone market and position themselves for the growth of the “internet of things”. Earlier this year, Japan’s SoftBank agreed to buy British smartphone chip designer Arm Holdings for £24.3bn, in what at the time was the largest-ever acquisition of a European technology business.Goldman Sachs and Evercore advised Qualcomm, Centerview advised the company’s board, while Paul Weiss, Cravath and Allen & Overy acted as legal advisers. Qatalyst Partners, Barclays and Credit Suisse were financial advisers to NXP. Skadden Arps and De Brau Blackstone were legal advisers.
236;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-10-27T16:48:13Z;Qualcomm / NXP: carjacking;The rationale for the US chipmaker is compelling but the Dutch target is going cheap;“Paradigm shifts” are a chance to pour money down the drain. It is the phrase SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son uses when explaining how an explosion of sensors powering the “internet of things” justified his £24.3bn acquisition of UK chip designer Arm Holdings. The jury’s out on that one. However, built on similar logic, Qualcomm ’s $47bn deal to acquire NXP could be a steal.Qualcomm, whose main business is supplying chips to the saturated mobile phone market, is buying the leader in automotive semiconductors. Believe the hype and cars will be stuffed with them as they add internet connections, entertainment systems and, ultimately, drive themselves.Qualcomm’s shareholders have cheered. The stock is up more than 10 per cent since the deal talk was first reported last month and confirmed on Thursday. Even if the road to self-driving cars is more winding than the enthusiasts believe, there is compelling financial sense. Qualcomm has almost $30bn of cash sitting offshore, with the Internal Revenue Service waiting to tax any that is repatriated to the US. Spending it on a Dutch-based company sacrifices none to the tax authorities and is the sort of smart, earnings-accretive deal that other cash-laden tech titans should consider, rather than praying the next president reforms the tax code. The rest of the all-cash deal will be funded by debt, which the combined company is well-placed to pay down with more than $10bn in earnings. Qualcomm also promises $500m in annual cost synergies.The deal is less obvious from NXP’s side. A bid 34 per cent higher than the undisturbed share price is a decent premium, but lower than the high reached last year. Also, 4.8 times next year’s revenues looks good against the 4 times revenue price Avago paid for Broadcom, but NXP is outgrowing its mature industry and had pledged more gains in margins and sales.Though Qualcomm is a natural fit, it is surprising the asset could not stir up the interest to drive the price higher.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
237;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;S&P, Moody’s warn Qualcomm on credit rating over NXP deal;;Rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have warned they may cut the credit rating of US technology group Qualcomm after it confirmed it would buy rival Dutch chip maker NXP in a deal valued at $47bn.S&P Global put Qualcomm’s A+ rating on credit watch negative Thursday morning following confirmation of the transaction, which is expected to close in late 2017 and will be financed by tapping offshore cash balances and about $11bn in debt.“The acquisition will use much of Qualcomm’s significant overseas cash balances, but we expect the company to maintain sufficient liquidity through the transaction and beyond given its strong cash flow,” said S&P credit analyst Andrew Chang.Moody’s senior vice-president Richard Lane said that the “benefits of the increased sale and diversification from Qualcomm’s core handset-driven business largely balance the higher financial risk due to the increased in debt and leverage and the integration execution risks.”But he added the company’s free cash flow will top $6bn annually, which could create the opportunity for rapid deleveraging.Moody’s said it expected to either lower by a notch or affirm Qualcomm’s A1 rating, barring any regulatory headwinds.

The combined company is expected to have annual revenues of more than $30bn.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, said:We have taken significant action to build a foundation for profitable growth and the acquisition of NXP is strongly aligned with our strategy. Our companies both have substantial expertise in delivering industry-leading solutions to our global customers, built upon a shared commitment to technology innovation, focused R&D investments and strong financial and operational discipline.As the FT’s James Fontanella-Khan recently reported, Qualcomm has come under pressure from investors to make a transformative acquisition that would accelerate its diversification from the smartphone market, where the best years of growth may have passed.
239;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-10-06T20:41:55Z;Facebook looks to broaden VR horizons through Oculus;Developer event puts emphasis on lowering the technology’s cost and growing content;Facebook is working to make virtual reality more accessible and appeal to an audience beyond gamers, by lowering the technology’s cost and building new social networking experiences for its Oculus headsets.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, opened Oculus’s annual developer event in Silicon Valley by saying that the virtual reality industry was expanding at a “faster rate than any of us had expected”, as Google and Sony launch their new VR headsets.“We are here to make VR the next major computing platform,” Mr Zuckerberg said. “At Facebook this is something we are really committed to.”That includes spending a total of $500m to fund development of new VR content, from games to 360-degree videos, including $10m for new educational experiences. Oculus is partnering with Walt Disney to bring some of its best-known characters to VR later this year.“The breadth and depth of content Oculus has secured reflects the unrivalled scale Facebook brings to the table,” said Ben Wood, tech analyst at CCS Insight.Mr Zuckerberg also showed off new kinds of communication between people both inside and outside VR. In one demonstration, virtual avatars chatted with a video caller using Facebook Messenger. Oculus is also enabling users to create avatars that they can use across a variety of games on its headset.“Virtual reality is the perfect platform to put people first because of [its sense of] presence: you feel like you are really there in another place with people,” Mr Zuckerberg said.He also revealed that Oculus is working on a standalone VR headset that promises to combine the best of PC and mobile VR and follows similar demonstrations of standalone VR prototypes by chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm in recent months.Oculus also unveiled new graphics processing technology designed to lower the cost of the PC required to support its existing Rift headset. The cheapest “VR-ready” PC will now cost as little as $500, down from $1,000 just a few months ago, after Oculus worked with graphics chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.The biggest new hardware products of the event were its handheld Touch controllers, costing $199, and a “room scale” sensor system that will allow users to walk around in a VR world, rather than using the Rift only while seated.Those announcements showed how Oculus was having to play catch-up with HTC Vive, its main rival in PC-based VR, Mr Wood said.“On hardware, this [event] felt more like catch-up than breakthrough innovation,” he said. “HTC seems to have the jump on them in hardware terms.”

However, they are at an early stage and one person close to the US company said that it was not sure a deal would materialise. Qualcomm and NXP both declined to comment.Qualcomm has come under pressure from investors to make a transformative acquisition that would accelerate its diversification from the smartphone market, where the best years of growth may have passed.NXP shares rose about 15 per cent on Thursday, valuing it at nearly $33bn, after the Wall Street Journal first reported the talks. Qualcomm rose 5.6 per cent, putting its market capitalisation at $99bn.A year ago Qualcomm bought CSR, a UK-based wireless processor specialist, for $2.4bn. That was among the smaller deals in the rapidly consolidating sector, where Avago bought Broadcom for $37bn and Intel acquired Altera for $17bn. Qualcomm had previously been seen as a potential buyer for Xilinx, a programmable chip supplier valued at $13.7bn.“The semiconductor industry is consolidating because companies only want to go to one component provider to get everything they need” to produce an electronic device, said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies.He said the NXP deal could make sense for Qualcomm but cautioned over the high price tag. NXP would increase Qualcomm’s “share of wallet” with large customers as well as bolstering its profits.“Qualcomm certainly need to do something to give investors upside …They need to make some big acquisitions,” Mr Bajarin said, given the company’s low revenue growth. “On paper it makes sense but it looks a very expensive deal.”Qualcomm certainly need to do something to give investors upside …They need to make some big acquisitions.

It also provides secure processors for smartphones to enable features such as mobile payments, such as Apple Pay in the iPhone. This unit has seen strong growth from handset makers in China this year, a market where Qualcomm has recently struck several licensing deals.NXP has been busy with dealmaking in the past year. At the end of 2015 it completed its $12bn acquisition of Freescale, giving it additional focus on automotive chips and bringing the group’s combined revenues to more than $10bn. NXP chief Rick Clemmer has projected cost synergies of up to $500m a year from the deal in future.At the same time, NXP sold its RF Power unit to China’s Jianguang Asset Management for $1.8bn to help finance the Freescale purchase. In July, NXP also sold its Standard Products unit to Jianguang and private equity group Wise Road Capital for $2.75bn.NXP split from its former parent Philips 10 years ago and went public in 2010.In a note to clients on Thursday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said NXP would make an “attractive acquisition” for Qualcomm and would be a “good use” of its $30bn in cash, $29bn of which is held offshore. The combination would reduce Qualcomm’s dependence on mobile handsets from 90 per cent to 60 per cent of sales, with automotive providing a historically more stable market.RBC said it expected Qualcomm to fund a deal with cash and debt, rather than equity, which could result in a downgrade to its credit rating.

243;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-09-01T16:57:00Z;Qualcomm unveils standalone VR headset;Chipmaker vies with Intel to get processors inside next wave of consumer electronics devices;Qualcomm has unveiled an ambitious prototype for a virtual-reality headset that does not require pairing with a separate PC or smartphone, just two weeks after arch rival Intel showed off a similar all-in-one device.The two leading chipmakers are vying for control of what many in Silicon Valley see as the next big shift in consumer electronics. They are priming the pump with so-called “reference designs” for VR headsets, which they hope manufacturers will use to accelerate their own product launches.Qualcomm said at IFA, a consumer electronics show in Berlin, that its Snapdragon VR820 headset design would be available to manufacturing partners before the end of the year, with commercial products expected to be on sale soon after. That gives it a head start over Intel’s “Project Alloy” VR headset design, unveiled at its developer conference in mid-August, which will be released for developers sometime next year.While Intel has dominated the PC market, Qualcomm has been a leader in smartphone processors. Each is hoping those respective strengths and the processing power they can provide will give them an advantage in the nascent market of virtual reality, where Facebook, Google, Samsung and others are pouring vast resources into a dizzying range of different headsets.Both Intel and Qualcomm are “hoping to sell an entire solution in a way that they couldn’t really do in mobile or PCs”, said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. “They want to be a provider of as many components as possible . . . to get a greater share of the market.”Qualcomm’s device is based on its latest Snapdragon 820 chip, which is used in premium smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7.“People talk about the cell phone being a supercomputer in your pocket. We take that same supercomputer technology and apply it to a problem like this,” said Raj Talluri, senior vice-president of product management for Qualcomm Technologies.Mr Talluri predicts that all-in-one headsets such as its prototype, which will cost several hundred dollars, will soon become as popular as mobile VR products like Samsung’s Gear VR or Google’s forthcoming Daydream products.Instead of relying on a smartphone’s screen, processor and motion sensors being combined with a headset to display virtual worlds, a standalone headset can offer higher resolution displays and more accurate head tracking, Mr Talluri said.While the Gear VR is mainly designed for use while sitting down, with its smartphone’s sensors able to track only a limited range of movement, Qualcomm’s headset allows the wearer to walk around in a virtual world as well as leaning in to examine virtual objects.People talk about the cell phone being a supercomputer in your pocket. We take that same supercomputer technology and apply it to a problem like thisThe effect provides the same “six degrees of freedom” as Facebook’s Oculus Rift or HTC’s Vive. However, while those devices require external sensors to be placed around the room and are tethered to a PC, Qualcomm’s prototype builds all its computing power and a motion-sensing camera right into the headset.Intel’s Project Alloy achieves the same effect, but uses the chipmaker’s own RealSense 3D imaging technology, as well as a high-definition camera, infrared and a laser projector. Qualcomm’s unit uses the same simple camera found in a typical smartphone for its motion tracking, in effect replacing the extra sensors with processing horsepower.Mr Talluri said this would make any headsets using its technology much cheaper and lower power. Headsets based on Snapdragon VR820 will have batteries that last for about two hours. Qualcomm’s device has been in development for about a year and a half.The prototype shown at IFA was produced in partnership with Chinese manufacturer Goertek. Qualcomm believes that China will be an eager early adopter of the technology, with internet companies there already developing 3D games and other content for VR.Also at IFA, Qualcomm showed off new smartwatches using its chips from watch maker Fossil and a reference design for a new TV media player box, similar to Apple TV.
244;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Cyber security alert on Qualcomm’s Android chips;Checkpoint discovers four flaws that criminals could exploit via malicious apps;Hackers could have accessed everything from encrypted corporate email to online banking apps using vulnerabilities recently found to affect Qualcomm chips in up to 900m Android smartphones and tablets.Checkpoint, an Israeli cyber security company that found four flaws in the chips, said cyber criminals could encourage users to download a malicious app and escalate its privileges so it can see everything on the device.Michael Shaulov, head of products, mobile and cloud security at Checkpoint, said by accessing the memory of the phone, hackers could peer into encrypted apps to see WhatsApp messages or email or note down banking passwords as they are typed in.“Everything is copied to the hackers,” he said, on the edge of the cyber security conference Def Con where Checkpoint presented its research on Sunday.Qualcomm is the leading maker of chips for advanced smartphones, with 65 per cent of the global market for 4G/LTE in 2015, according to data from ABI Research. Checkpoint said devices using Qualcomm chipsets include the Google Nexus 5X, 6 and 6P, HTC One M9 and HTC 10 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.Checkpoint informed both Qualcomm and Google, which develops the Android operating system, of the vulnerabilities.Google said users of Android devices that have downloaded the most recent security updates are protected from three out of the four flaws. The fourth will be included in an upcoming update.Until then, Google’s Android partners, manufacturers such as Samsung and HTC which make Android phones, can use Qualcomm’s patches to secure against the fourth vulnerability.There is no evidence to date that cyber criminals have exploited the flaws.Alex Gantman, vice-president of engineering for Qualcomm Product Security Initiative, said it had issued patches that fix the problems.“I take pride in our collaborative relationship with security researchers and I am always appreciative of community’s efforts to help us harden our products,” he said.Google also said it appreciated the researchers’ help in improving security of the mobile ecosystem, but said hackers would need to get a malicious app on to the phone in the first place.“Exploitation of these issues depends on users also downloading and installing a malicious application,” Google said. “Our Verify apps and SafetyNet protections help identify, block, and remove applications that exploit vulnerabilities like these.”
245;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-07-21T00:05:53Z;Intel struggles to offset decline in PC market;Qualcomm highlights brighter fortunes of smartphones with China mobile licensing deals;Quarterly results from Intel and Qualcomm on Wednesday highlighted the contrasting fortunes of the PC and smartphone markets, at a time when chipmakers are in greater focus thanks to SoftBank’s proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings this week.While Intel struggled to offset PC decline, a string of new mobile licensing deals in China sent Qualcomm’s shares up 7 per cent after hours.Intel’s net income more than halved to $1.3bn after it took a $1.4bn restructuring charge in its second quarter. Three months ago Intel said it would cut up to 12,000 jobs as it reconfigured its business away from PCs and towards cloud computing and the “internet of things”. About 6,000 employees have already left.In the most recent quarter, its $7.3bn client computing revenues, which include PCs, fell 3 per cent year on year, while the internet of things grew just 2 per cent to $572m.Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive, said he expected the PC market’s percentage decline to be in the high single digits for the rest of the year. Slower than expected IoT growth reflected “inventory burn” after a particularly strong first quarter, he said, though industrial applications and security video cameras saw stronger growth. Intel recently announced a partnership with BMW to develop autonomous cars and Mr Krzanich said he still saw “tremendous potential” in that area.Shares in Intel, which have risen more than 10 per cent in the past three months, fell 3 per cent after hours.At Qualcomm, whose chips power smartphones including the popular Samsung Galaxy S7, revenues grew 4 per cent to $6bn compared with the same period a year ago, with net income 22 per cent higher at $1.4bn. Samsung’s flagship handset outsold Apple’s iPhone 6S in the US over the past three months, according to analyst group Moor Insights, while Qualcomm also reported “favourable demand trends” for its latest chips in the mid to high-end of the smartphone market.Derek Aberle, Qualcomm president, said that licensing sales were boosted in the quarter by agreements with several tech companies in China which had previously been “withholding” backdated sales and royalties worth $200m. Qualcomm last month filed a legal complaint against Meizu, one of the larger handset makers in China that has so far refused to license its technology.Big progress from a few months ago and big impact on share priceMr Aberle added that if it closed several “key deals”, it would have licensed more than three quarters of Chinese equipment manufacturers, ahead of its expectations earlier this year.Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight, noted Qualcomm’s “confident tone” on licensing in China. “Big progress from a few months ago and big impact on share price,” he said in a tweet.Qualcomm’s forecast of up to $6.2bn in sales for the September quarter was also better than Wall Street’s current forecasts.
246;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-06-24T04:01:24Z;Formula E to race electric cars on the streets of NYC;Authorities agree to set up a circuit against Manhattan skyline;"Formula E, the electric car racing championship, has gained agreement for a race in New York next year — achieving an ambition long held by its conventional counterpart, Formula One, to stage an event against the Manhattan skyline.Today, the New York authorities and the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) — the world governing body for motor sports — are to sign off on a race at an as-yet undisclosed location within the city.However, the race organisers have said it will have the Manhattan skyline as its backdrop — in line with Formula E’s strategy of holding races on city streets, to provide more compelling images for TV audiences and better access for spectators.“You need the view,” said Alejandro Agag, chief executive of Formula E. “You need downtown New York.”For years, Bernie Ecclestone, head of Formula 1, has wanted to race petrol-
engined cars through city centres but found the difficulties of closing down busy roads insurmountable.It has proven easier to convince cities to make way for Formula E, though, as its events take place over a single day and feature quiet electric cars — causing far less disruption.Launched in 2014, Formula E was conceived as a showcase and test bed for electric car technology, with races taking place on temporary street circuits in places such as in Paris, Berlin and Buenos Aires.Adding a New York race is likely to provide a much needed financial boost to the privately owned Formula E business, which continues to be lossmaking in its second season, and has met with some scepticism within motor racing.According to Companies House, the holding company for Formula E made a pre-tax loss of £43.8m in the year ended 31 July 2015, on revenues of £14.8m. Mr Agag said that while revenues had “multiplied” in 2016, Formula E would not break even until next year at the earliest.A new US race is also expected to help offset the likely loss of races in certain other major cities next season — including London and Moscow — following some difficulties with residents and local governments.Mr Agag said the majority of cities pay a fee in the millions to host a race, with Formula E making additional revenues through sponsorship. Companies including Visa, DHL, Qualcomm, Michelin, and TAG Heuer have backed the series to date.In March 2015, Liberty Global and Discovery Communications — the media groups that are controlled by billionaire John Malone, and once tried to buy F1 — took an undisclosed stake in Formula E, reported to be as much as one-third.Among the big car manufacturers taking part are PSA Peugeot Citroën and Audi. Tata Motors’ Jaguar has agreed to join the series next season. Mr Agag said he was currently in talks with three to four other automakers with a view to having them join the electric car series over the next two years."
247;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-05-30T11:55:20Z;Technology intellectual property: patently obvious;More companies should think about monetising their innovations;"Not every Silicon Valley company with rich intellectual property bothers to defend it. Altruistic, perhaps, but it is also a recipe for an activist attack. Unprotected IP is money on the table.Qualcomm, the mobile chipmaker, faced activist questions last year. Jana Partners argued that the company should consider spinning off its higher-margin licensing division. But the Jana idea, which was ultimately rejected, only came about because Qualcomm is already assertive, supplying the fruits of its research and development to other companies and demanding fat royalties in return. Oracle, which last week lost a court battle with Google, also took an aggressive tack, accusing the search giant of violating its copyright to develop the Android operating system. Oracle’s defeat was applauded by software geeks prizing openness. But Oracle’s shareholders could have been $9bn better off.Google itself is not known for its proactivity. It has sued only twice over patents — BT in 2013 and SimpleAir this week — but both were retaliatory. By contrast, since 2010 Microsoft has sued 13 times over patents and brought 191 copyright cases, according to data from Lex Machina. Google can point to its relative youth but Intel also stays clear of courts and licensing despite being almost half a century old.There may be good reasons for inaction, beyond friendliness or indolence. Companies can be reluctant to sue their own customers, for example. But spinning off intellectual property into a separate company can work in some instances. The entities so created would be freer to monetise the technology — licensing it and suing infringers. As tech companies mature, they need to profit from their earlier innovation. Nortel Networks spun off its patents into a new vehicle; unfortunately only after it entered bankruptcy. AOL, under fire from activists, sold a patent portfolio to Microsoft in 2012. Less challenged companies might be forced to look at similar structures in future.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
248;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-04-22T11:13:02Z;Europe should forget Google and investigate its own shortcomings;It should ask why its biggest names are worth a fraction of those in the US, writes Michael Moritz;Imagine if, over the next 60 days, the European Commission staged a series of press conferences and bombarded journalists with a battery of announcements of pocket-sized investigations into the condition of the continent’s technology industry.One investigation might delve into the rate at which PhDs are granted to students of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects at Europe’s 20 leading universities. This might contain an appendix showing the percentage of Nobel Prizes given to people born and resident in Europe over the past 100 years.Another inquiry might examine the state of science education in high schools across the EU and how this compares to countries such as China, Singapore, Israel, India and the US. An appendix of this report might summarise the number of European high school students and college graduates that have elected to study in, or emigrate to, the US.Other lawyers and social scientists on the vast EU payroll might be dispatched to the patent filing libraries to see how the rate of European invention in critical fields has kept track with what has occurred in China and the US since 1990. Then, assuming there are still lawyers available — not an insurmountable challenge in Brussels — another taxpayer-financed squadron could be sent to examine why the rate of formation of technology companies in Europe trails that in other countries.Instead, the commission has chosen to launch a new investigation into one of its bête-noires — Google. This new witch-hunt, seeking to uncover skulduggery and anti-competitive practices in the way that Google has licensed its Android operating system, is in addition to a separate Commission probe into the company’s search business. Add to this the EU probes into the privacy policies and tax payments of US technology companies, and the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Qualcomm — six of the greatest businesses built over the past 30 years — must be thinking that, within Europe, no success goes unpunished.This same sentiment seems to be spreading to European boardrooms. Recently, the founders of Spotify, the Stockholm-based music-streaming service that has been engaged in a tooth-and-nail fight with some of the largest US technology companies, did the unthinkable. They voiced a distinctly American viewpoint by castigating Swedish politicians for the conditions they have to battle in their homeland. These included the acute housing shortage in Stockholm, the manner in which gains from stock options are taxed and the shortcomings of technical education — particularly for girls and young women. Little wonder that they threatened to move much of their company — lock, stock and smoked herring — to more hospitable climes.The commission might find some solace in an odd place — its own investigation of Microsoft which started in 2000 and extended for more than a decade. The accusations against Microsoft were every bit as pointed as the charges now levelled at Google. Yet consider what’s happened since. The EU filed its charges against the leader of the personal computer industry before Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat or Skype were even formed and at a time that Google was barely a year old. However, the inventiveness of these companies that had a much greater effect on Microsoft’s apparent ironclad lock on the technology industry than any set of mandarins infusing legal charges with a political marinade.The commission should examine one other fact. Over the past five years the eight most valuable technology companies developed in Europe have assembled a combined market value of around $32bn. That’s not a figure to be sneezed at any more than the admirable young European technology entrepreneurs who, despite all odds, are more inclined to take a risk than members of their parents’ generation. But EU legislators should be wondering why Europe’s eight most valuable companies are only worth about 10 per cent of Facebook or 6 per cent of Google.There’s nothing new about this strain of anti-Americanism running rampant in Brussels. Some of its intellectual roots stretch back 50 years to Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, the French publisher and journalist, who tried to galvanise Europeans into countering the threat from across the Atlantic with the publication, in 1967, of The American Challenge. Its echoes can be heard in this week’s press conferences in Brussels. Forget the fact that American ingenuity and daring has brought to hundreds of millions of Europeans phones cheaper and more powerful than the supercomputers of the 1970s, thousands of films and TV shows that can be streamed at the touch of a button, free text-messaging services, books that are delivered overnight and thousands of comfortable cars that can be summoned at a moment’s notice.Rather than pointing across the Atlantic and seeking scapegoats, the Commissioners who have just launched another fusillade against one of their favourite American bogeymen may want to start a series of investigations into Europe’s own shortcomings. This may be a more fruitful exercise than reigniting the spent flames of the 1960s.The writer is chairman of Sequoia Capital. Views expressed are his own.

You can sign up here.Google’s battle with the EU over Android, the dominant smartphone operating system with 81 per cent share, is a “lite” version of Microsoft’s strategy in its long drawn-out antitrust case over Windows, argues John Gapper.He says Google has never suggested, as Microsoft once did, that its applications are embedded in the operating system for obscure technological reasons and cannot be removed. The EU saw through that subterfuge and Google has not repeated it. It depends instead on subtle and sophisticated contracts with mobile phone makers to entrench its position.Murad Ahmed and Tim Bradshaw have also been comparing the two cases and point out that even if regulators do force Google to remove its own apps from Android, the operating system has already achieved one of the main strategic aims of what began as a $50m acquisition in 2005: preventing Windows from becoming as dominant on mobile devices as it had become on PCs.Qualcomm smarts a bit Smartphone sales look soft.

Worse news for Qualcomm, which makes money off virtually every handset sold — either through selling chips or licensing intellectual property.Qualcomm estimated during quarterly results on Wednesday that its customers made $52bn-$60bn in total device sales in the three months to the end of March. At the midpoint, that would be the worst quarter in four years.This would be bad enough if Qualcomm kept its current commanding market share, but it does not have the planet’s most placid customers. The chip supplier has had to quell a revolt over royalty fees in China and then a dispute with LG. There will be more bitter battles to come.Samsung and its peers prefer, where possible, to develop their own chips or go to rival chipmakers so hungry to displace Qualcomm that they will offer bargains on pricing. Apple is said to have used Intel’s technology as a supplement to Qualcomm in its upcoming iPhone 7. Such “second sourcing” is a big threat.Qualcomm should get a boost with 5G, the next generation of wireless technology, which promises faster speeds. As Goldman Sachs points out, Qualcomm was fading seven years ago when 3G chipsets became commoditised, only to profit from a stranglehold on the market for new 4G technology. If history repeats, the stock is cheap at about eight times forward earnings, discounting $30bn of cash.Yet, in the short term, the management’s position looks more perilous. Executives have insisted that its operating margin targets for the chip set business — 16 per cent by the end of the year and 20-22 per cent longer-term — are intact and take into account some diversification of supply from manufacturers. Results met reduced expectations on Wednesday. Having already cut costs sharply in response to an activist’s demands, there is little room for manoeuvre should the market or Qualcomm’s share deteriorate further.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

252;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Reuters reported at the weekend that the US Commerce Department was set to place export restrictions on the company. ZTE sells 8-10 per cent of the world’s telecoms equipment, according to Nomura, and counts Iran as a customer.“ZTE has been working with relevant US government departments on investigations, maintaining constant communication with relevant departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns,” it said in a statement.The company added that it would continue with normal operations while it conducted its own internal assessments.“As a responsible business, ZTE strives to ensure all operational activities adhere to international trade practices and the laws and regulations of host countries,” it said.The company on Monday suspended trading in its shares, according to statements to the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but did not explain why.ZTE’s Hong Kong-listed shares closed up 3.5 per cent on Friday, but are down 20 per cent so far this year.Leping Huang, telecoms and technology analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong, said official notice from the US Department of Commerce, expected on Tuesday, should make clear the scope of the restrictions.Nomura does not expect any impact on product sales in the US, but says restrictions would probably require any company shipping US-made parts or equipment to ZTE to first obtain a licence from the Commerce Department.In an analyst note, Nomura estimated that 10-15 per cent of the components used in ZTE’s telecom equipment and smartphones were supplied by US-based vendors as of last year. It said major suppliers include Qualcomm, which supplies smartphone chips, and Xilinx and Altera for base station chips.A person briefed by ZTE on the situation said the company does not foresee an immediate impact on production because it has just finished procurement of US parts for 2016. However, if restrictions remain in place over the long term, ZTE may experience some supply-chain disruption.This is not the first time the company has run into trouble with US authorities. In 2012 ZTE and Huawei, its larger domestic competitor, were informally blocked from selling telecoms infrastructure in the US and barred from investing in US companies after the House Intelligence Committee accused both of spying on behalf of Chinese authorities.Both companies have long rejected the spying accusations.While the 2012 restrictions meant that ZTE cannot sell its telecoms equipment in the country, they did not affect the company’s smartphone business. In the four years since, ZTE has quietly grown into the third-largest seller of Android smartphones in the US.

Qualcomm did not admit or deny wrongdoing.Qualcomm relies on China for around half its revenues, and during the last several years its business there has faced setbacks. Qualcomm says Chinese customers underpaid on their royalty agreements in 2014 and 2015, hurting its revenues. Last year Qualcomm settled an antitrust investigation in China, agreeing to a fine of around $1bn.The practice of hiring interns who are related to Chinese officials is not uncommon among western firms as they seek to navigate China’s challenging regulatory environment. A string of SEC investigations has been focused on companies where this practice was common, including JPMorgan, whose “ sons and daughters” programme helped place officials’ relatives at the company.Last month, HSBC said it was under investigation by the SEC over its hiring of people linked to Asian governments.The SEC settlement reveals an unusual level of detail about Qualcomm’s involvement with officials and their offspring. In one case, the company paid $75,000 for an academic research grant to help the son of an official complete his PhD programme; later a Qualcomm executive personally lent $70,000 to that same individual to help him buy a house. This individual was also hired by Qualcomm, despite the fact that people who interviewed him said “he would be a drain on teams he would join”.In another example, Qualcomm offered officials a deluxe Olympics hospitality package with a value of $95,000, although the company later rescinded these invitations due to concerns about violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm general counsel, said: “We remain committed to ethical conduct and compliance with all laws and regulations, and will continue to be vigilant about [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act] compliance.”"

Now the barbarians are not just at the gates of Silicon Valley, but through them and sitting in the boardroom. A report this week from the Boston Consulting Group lays out the extent of the threat. The tech sector was the top target in the US in the year to June 2015.BCG’s solution is that executives should “mimic a judo fighter”: take bold pre-emptive action including divestitures, cost-cutting and improved capital allocation. This is hardly judo. It is either common sense or it is another mat-based gym activity: rolling over. Companies are already doing it — Yahoo rolled once when Starboard told it to spin off its Alibaba stake, and then again the other way when the activist (now fearful of the tax consequences) told it to spin off the core business instead. Qualcomm agreed to cost cuts, buy back shares and reduce executive pay at the behest of Jana Partners. Apple conceded to Carl Icahn’s demands to boost its share buybacks. The results have been disappointing. Apple’s stock is up almost 50 per cent since Mr Icahn first disclosed a stake in August 2013 but has fallen more than a quarter since its high last year and has underperformed the S&P 500 in the past three years. Others have fared worse. Qualcomm’s shares are down by a quarter since Jana built its stake. Yahoo has fallen more than 20 per cent since Starboard became involved.True, there is no counterfactual — it is not certain whether these companies would have done any better had they told the activists to pack their bags, And it is not all a disaster. Elliott Management, which accounts for the bulk of tech activism, has racked up some victories. But in this besieged sector, not every activist suggestion works. Rather than judo, the best defence for targeted companies might lie in pointing out the mixed results of previous attacks.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The agreement covers Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G patents, which can be used in smartphones made by both Lenovo and its Motorola subsidiary and sold in China.Lenovo completes a set of China’s five largest smartphone makers for Qualcomm, after it signed up Huawei, ZTE, TCL and Xiaomi over the last few months, writes San Francisco correspondent Tim Bradshaw.The deals followed the conclusion a year ago of China’s antitrust investigation into Qualcomm, which had held up its licensing negotiations in the region. Last February, the chipmaker agreed to pay $975m as part of a settlement with the National Development and Reform Commission, which also required that Qualcomm lower its royalty rates for patents used in China.The deal with Lenovo was “consistent with the terms of the rectification plan” agreed with the NDRC, Qualcomm said.

But as it revealed that it would discontinue three of the six action cameras it currently sells, it said that it would take a $57m charge, even higher than expected, due to excess inventory and obsolete manufacturing equipment.“Growth slowed in the second half of the year and we recognise the need to develop software solutions that make it easier for our customers to offload, access and edit their GoPro content,” said Nick Woodman, GoPro’s founder and chief executive.GoPro’s sales fell by 31 per cent year on year to $436.6m in its fourth quarter, with net losses of $34.5m after $122.3m in net profit a year earlier. Gross margin, a key measure of performance for consumer electronics companies, tumbled from 47.9 per cent a year ago to 29.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015.The Silicon Valley-based company also said on Wednesday that Brian McGee, currently at Qualcomm, would replace Jack Lazar as its chief finance officer. Mr Lazar joined GoPro two years ago, just a few months before its initial public offering in June 2014.GoPro added that it expected revenues to be between $160-180m in the first quarter of the year, below the $300m expected by analysts. Its full-year sales forecast of $1.35bn-$1.5bn is also below Wall Street’s previous $1.6bn estimate.

But the company said on Thursday that operating profit at these units fell 36 per cent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, hit by a sharp fall in the prices of memory chips and display panels as the outlook for global electronics demand weakened.Samsung said full-year net profits fell 19 per cent to Won19.1tn ($15.8bn). Robert Yi, head of investor relations, told analysts the company would find it “challenging” to avoid a further decline this year given the broad slowdown in the sector.The warning from the world’s biggest electronics company by revenue came just days after Apple said the current quarter would bring the first year-on-year decline in iPhone sales— sparking a share slump that knocked $35bn off the company’s market value. A large part of the problem for the industry is a slowdown in handset sales in China, where the smartphone market had been growing at a double- or triple-digit pace in recent years. But last year, that growth rate was only in the “low single-digits”, according to researchers at IDC, who think the pace of global smartphone sales growth will continue to decline.Profits were also dragged down by a Won2.4tn increase in income tax payments, as well as Won2.5tn of non-operating expenses consisting mostly of writedowns in the value of investments in sister companies Samsung Card and Samsung SDI.Samsung said it would redouble its efforts to win new business in components, including sales of its most advanced display technology to outside customers, and contract manufacturing of logic chips.The company’s revenue in the latter sector has been growing. While Apple is expected to give all the processor manufacturing for its next iPhone to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, that blow will be softened for Samsung by new business from other customers including Qualcomm, said Peter Yu, an analyst at BNP Paribas.“People are not tempted to upgrade their phone every year. And emerging markets are weak in terms of purchasing power, particularly those reliant on commodity exports,” he said. “The components had really saved Samsung — but it looks like there’s now a pause in that component-driven growth.”CW Chung, an analyst at Nomura, added that Samsung was still enjoying strong demand for Nand semiconductors, a form of memory chip in which it has a significant technological lead over peers and which are used in laptops and servers. “But this will not offset the downside,” he said.Samsung’s smartphone business, meanwhile, has nearly staunched the sharp losses of market share to cheaper Chinese rivals. Its global market share was 23.9 per cent in the third quarter according to IDC, only 0.1 percentage point down from the previous year.Shares in Samsung closed 2.6 per cent lower on Thursday, while the broader Kospi index ended 0.5 per cent higher.Samsung took the latest step in a protracted restructuring on Thursday when the company sold its stake in the group’s credit card unit.Samsung Life, South Korea’s biggest insurance company, bought the 37.5 per cent holding in Samsung Card for Won1.45tn ($1.2bn), giving it a 72 per cent stake in the group.The deal eliminates one of the many cross-shareholdings in Samsung’s complex group structure — a longstanding source of concern for investors, who view it as a means for the founding Lee family to maintain control with relatively small, strategically placed equity holdings.Analysts at CLSA had predicted the deal as the group looked to separate its financial and industrial businesses. They added that it would probably be the precursor to an outright takeover of Samsung Card by Samsung Life, which would eventually become a holding company for the group's financial businesses.The reorganisation of Samsung attracted fierce controversy last year when Cheil Industries, controlled by group heir apparent Lee Jae-yong, acquired the construction group Samsung C&T. Some shareholders in the target company argued that the deal’s terms enriched Mr Lee at their expense.There had been some speculation of a merger of Samsung Electronics with Samsung SDS, also controlled by Mr Lee, which would be aimed at boosting his shareholding of the group. But Mr Lee said on Thursday he would sell Samsung SDS shares worth Won380bn ($315m) to take part in a capital increase at Samsung Engineering, which has suffered a string of heavy losses.

Apple shed more than $35bn in market value, equivalent to the market capitalisation of Delta Air Lines or FedEx.It extends the slide in Apple stock this year to 9.3 per cent as investors grow more concerned over cooling sales growth. The shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent since hitting a record high early last year.Even among the many Wall Street analysts who recommend buying Apple stock — with the consensus 12-month price target of $136.17 suggesting 43 per cent upside from current levels — there are fears that its shares may have further to fall before investor sentiment improves.“The bottom line is that we still like [Apple], but don’t expect a quick rebound,” Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie, wrote in a note to clients.Deutsche Bank’s Sherri Scribner said that a year-over-year decline in revenues in the Americas segment could indicate “possible saturation in [Apple’s] biggest market”. Ms Scribner also said commentary from management about potential volatility in China was “less than encouraging”.In the Americas, Apple’s largest region, operating income fell by 6 per cent to $10.0bn in its fiscal first quarter, while in Europe it declined by almost 2 per cent. However, operating income in greater China grew by 19 per cent to $7.6bn for the quarter, according to a regulatory filing published on Wednesday.R&D expenses, meanwhile, leapt by 27 per cent to $2.4bn in the latest quarter, as Mr Cook insisted Apple was not “retrenching”. “We are continuing to invest without pause,” he said. “We have some great things in the pipeline.”Wednesday’s filing also showed that off-balance sheet capital and purchasing commitments related to product tooling, inventory prepayments and R&D almost doubled to $7.9bn in the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. Off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, meanwhile, fell slightly year on year from $21.6bn in December 2014 to $20.7bn at the end of last year.Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, said the increase in advance commitments may indicate a change in how Apple manages its supply chain.“We had been hearing from certain suppliers Apple was ordering more components than it seems necessary for builds the next quarter,” Mr Bajarin said. “They could be doing this to get preferential pricing upfront or to keep their suppliers’ capacity high to make sure they meet demand.”Slowing demand for the iPhone is still affecting Apple suppliers large and small. Qualcomm, a leading supplier of mobile processors, warned on Wednesday of “some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer”, a reference analysts took to mean Apple.“There is a little softness in the premium tier, somewhat of a product-cycle issue, in terms of upgrades and the replacement cycle,” Derek Aberle, Qualcomm’s president, said in an interview. “We are seeing that offset particularly in China. The market there is actually very strong despite some of the macro issues.”Texas Instruments, another chipmaker, also warned in its outlook on Wednesday of “softness . . . within the personal electronics market” amounting to a $150m revenue shortfall compared with a year ago, which analysts again attributed to Apple.

Iliad could be planning a UK odyssey, the back-tax backlash against Google continues and an AI pioneer has died. #techFT is a daily newsletter on technology, digital media and telecoms. You can sign up here.Cash is still king in most countries and the digital money divide is widening, according to the annual digital money report from Citigroup and Imperial College London. Its latest findings show the least developed countries with the furthest to go made almost no progress last year, while mature markets showed the most improvement. That’s a pity, given the savings that can be made from the switch to digital. The graphic above illustrates how $350bn to $400bn of annual benefits can be unlocked just by moving a quarter of paper-based transactions to digital, in areas such as ecommerce, where cash on delivery is still the norm in emerging markets. Fees on cross-border remittances in Africa can be 20 per cent of the amount sent.In the UK, contactless is becoming king, with cards and phones enabled for tap-and-pay on transactions up to £30 ($43). Britain has moved up from seventh to fourth in a global league table still topped by Finland, Singapore and the US. The ease of use of tap-and-pay is a key to adoption, addressing the “muscle memory in users, becoming second nature to them and hitting the all-important tipping point”, according to the report. This is lacking in emerging economies, where cash is still trusted far more. “Digital liquidity” is missing as well – digital means of transacting needs to be available in all spheres and the dots need to be joined up between the different services. Government benefits should be charging digital wallets that can be used to pay household bills and be used at grocery checkouts. Such digital flows will boost adoption and repress the opportunities and our natural urges to convert to cold hard cash.Flag as ImportantBack-tax backlash Google’s deal to settle its UK tax bill continues to be scrutinised, with Downing Street distancing itself from the chancellor of the exchequer’s claim that the £130m being paid represented “a major success”.

262;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-01-25T17:14:18Z;Corporate tax: inverted logic;It may not add up for Alphabet, but Qualcomm could benefit from moving its domicile;"Alphabet remains in the bottom quartile of US-listed corporate taxpayers. Its effective rate of 19.3 per cent will barely budge on Friday’s news that its Google UK subsidiary will pay £130m in back taxes — unless governments in other countries decide to pursue similar settlements. There are other US technology companies who might actually want to pay more in the UK.Though low for the US, Alphabet’s rate is middle of the pack in the UK. This explains why there is continued chatter about which company will be next to exit the US via a so-called tax inversion. It is unlikely to be Alphabet but some investors fancy Qualcomm, the California chip designer and maker, as a candidate. Could it back itself into Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer? Arm has a market value of £14bn; Qualcomm is 3.5 times bigger.There are several reasons not to do so. One is that while Arm’s effective rate is identical to Alphabet’s — 19.3 per cent — Qualcomm’s has lately been lower than that, thanks to large non-US sales. Another is the operational logic. The obvious way to combine the businesses would be to merge Qualcomm’s royalty business with Arm and jettison the former’s chipset business. Activist investors have already pushed for such a split but Qualcomm’s board has seen off that idea for now.Tax inversion acquisitions are horribly political, too; US lawmakers are already railing at the proposed tie-up between Pfizer and Ireland’s Allergan. On top of all that, there are the usual regulatory concerns; Arm gets a lot of its business from Qualcomm, as well as its customers and competitors.Still, tax considerations have created worse chimeras. And there would be another benefit to emigrating. Like many other US companies, Qualcomm is keeping billions of dollars in cash offshore to avoid giving a slice to the Internal Revenue Service. If it ever had to repatriate this pile — about $30bn at the last count — it would have to pay more than $10bn in tax. Much of the cash that has piled up in the overseas accounts of US corporations has done so because of lower overseas tax rates. And while the UK likes moaning about aggressive corporate tax planning, it is happily facilitating it with a tax rate that will drop to 18 per cent by 2020.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Samsung Electronics last month announced an alliance with Medtronic to deliver real-time health data from medical devices — allowing doctors and patients to monitor symptoms and manage treatments remotely.Last year, Google agreed to work with Sanofi, the French pharma group, on technology to aid management of diabetes. The US internet group also has a partnership with Novartis to develop a “smart contact lens” that can monitor glucose levels in the tear fluid of diabetics and transmit the data to a wireless device.Apple, meanwhile, has launched a platform called ResearchKit that allows researchers to harness medical data from iPhone users.Many consumers are already using smartphones and wearable fitness tracking devices to measure basic functions such as heart rate and physical activity. Companies are now looking at whether miniaturised sensors can be used to collect more sophisticated clinical information for use in drug trials and frontline healthcare.Advocates for “ digital health” say innovations of this kind could hold the key not only to more effective care of individual patients, but also to analysis of population-wide patterns in search of the causes and cures of disease. However, there are concerns over the security of patient data and the reliability of potentially life-or-death information, such as the glucose levels of diabetics.GSK and Qualcomm declined to comment on their talks, which were first reported by Bloomberg.

267;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2016-01-14T04:25:12Z;Samsung starts work on new Qualcomm chip;Contract for Snapdragon 820 to offset anticipated loss of business from Apple;Samsung Electronics has started production of Qualcomm’s new smartphone processor, a contract that will help the South Korean group’s chip foundry to weather an anticipated loss of business from Apple.Samsung has been relying on its components businesses to shore up earnings over the past two years after the smartphones division, its erstwhile profit driver, began losing share of a slowing market.The foundry business— which makes logic chips based on customers’ designs — got a boost last year when it resumed producing processors for Apple’s iPhone, but analysts expect that business to shift to industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co for this year’s model.Samsung said on Thursday it has been manufacturing Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 820 processor since the end of last year, using an upgraded, lower power version of its 14-nanometre FinFET technology. Qualcomm — the world’s biggest standalone chip designer — effectively confirmed this deal in November when it revealed the chip would be made using that process.A previous loss of business from Apple left Samsung’s logic chip business with idle capacity and a loss of about $1bn in 2014, but the contract from Qualcomm should prevent a repeat this year, said Keon Han, an analyst at Credit Suisse.He estimated that Samsung’s logic chip business — which manufactures chips ranging from phone processors to drivers that power television screens, for Samsung and outside customers — made about $10bn in revenue last year, with Apple accounting for roughly a sixth of that.Samsung’s total revenue last year was about Won201tn ($166bn), it said in preliminary guidance last week.The new contract from Qualcomm, coinciding with the loss of work from Apple, would amount to “a swap”, Mr Han said.Samsung is expected to give details later this month of a slowdown in key parts of its components business, after its guidance for profit in the final quarter of last year fell short of analysts’ expectations.As well as trying to boost its foundry business, Samsung is taking on Qualcomm by seeking to sell its own Exynos processors to other smartphone producers, although uptake so far has been limited to relatively minor players such as China’s Meizu Technology.For Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 820 presents a chance for the US group to revive its fortunes after disappointing sales of its previous flagship Snapdragon 810 — largely because it was excluded by Samsung from its high-end phones after concerns about overheating.Qualcomm’s falling share price has made it a target for activist investors. It responded last year by appointing two new independent directors and promising heavy staff cuts, although it resisted calls for a break-up.On Wednesday it announced a $3bn joint venture with Japan’s TDK to pursue growth in filters, a fast-growing part of the wireless communications components market. But the company’s market value remains 38 per cent below its level at the start of 2015.

The filters — a key component that allows communication through radio frequencies — are also the fastest growing segment among the parts used in mobile devices.The aim of the deal will be to fill that gap so Qualcomm can provide a single package including all the components needed by smartphone makers. It will also allow the company to break into new areas at a time when it is under pressure from a broader pullback in the smartphone market.The deal will give the US chipmaker a 51 per cent stake in the Singapore-based venture. The remainder will be held by TDK, which will carve out its module design and manufacturing assets as well as related patents. The total transaction value is expected to be about $3bn.For TDK, the deal will allow the Japanese company to expand its spending on product development and capital equipment. The transaction value includes payments Qualcomm will make to TDK for the sale of its filters, totalling up to $200m over three years.In a statement, the two companies also announced that they will expand their collaboration in other fields such as sensors and wireless charging.Citing data from market research group Mobile Experts, the companies said the market for components to make radio-frequency chips was projected to expand from $10bn to $18bn in five years.Qualcomm’s attempts to break into new fields such as cars and robotics have accelerated on the back of slowing chip demand. Last year, the California-based company faced investor pressure for more aggressive cost cuts and a break-up of its structure. It was also hit by Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy devices, instead of Qualcomm’s.

The fact that Apple was able to create custom-designed hardware for just a single feature of the iPhone 6S highlights the expertise it has built in chip design, a technology that has traditionally been the preserve of specialist companies such as Qualcomm or Intel. Apple shone a spotlight on that capability this week when it promoted Johny Srouji, head of its team of silicon engineers, to its executive ranks, as part of a wider management reshuffle.“They are making some of the best chips in the world and yet they are only for themselves,” says Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. That level of integration in its devices is “not normal”, he adds, for consumer electronics companies, which typically use off-the-shelf parts for this most complex end of the technology supply chain. “They are quietly building this team that is enabling one of the biggest differentiators for their company.” Apple’s ability to craft its own silicon to add new capabilities to the iPhone could prove increasingly valuable as the smartphone market matures and devices that cost half the price offer many of the same functions. “They can be first to market with the coolest features in total secrecy,” says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights and Strategy. The scale of Apple’s ambitions in designing its own chips became apparent in 2008, when Mr Srouji joined Apple after 15 years at Intel and a stint making server chips at IBM. Apple also paid $278m that year to acquire low-power mobile processor company PA Semi — at the time, its largest acquisition since it bought NeXT.As well as chip-design expertise, PA Semi brought Apple an Arm architecture license, joining a small group of about a dozen companies that are able to customise the UK chip designer’s processors. Doing so is not just expensive but requires talent that is scarce. They are making some of the best chips in the world and yet they are only for themselves“Designing silicon and investing in those proprietary assets is capital intensive, but not a lot of humans on the planet can do that,” says Mr Bajarin. This expertise allows Apple to tune its chips to the precise requirements of its iPhone or iPad, without having to rely on another supplier to dictate what features it can or cannot include. Apple’s first custom processor, the A4, made its debut in the original iPad and the iPhone 4 in 2010. Three years later, the company surprised the semiconductor industry by making theiPhone 5sS the first consumer mobile device to run on a 64-bit architecture, a technology more commonly associated with desktop computers. Apple’s A7, introduced in 2013, was also joined by the M7, a motion-sensing chip produced in partnership with NXP that foreshadowed some of the Apple Watch’s fitness-tracking capabilities. Today, benchmark tests against other processors show that Apple’s A9 has a 50 per cent performance advantage over its rivals, while the iPad Pro's A9X compares favourably to recent PCs. The iPhone 6S’ 3D Touch, which allows the display to sense how firmly it is being pressed, is another example of how Apple beat its rivals to market. Mr Moorhead says the such success in this specialist field is rare. “Ninety-nine times out of 100, when somebody tries to go vertical with something as complex as a chip, it doesn’t end well,” he says.Apple’s position at the more profitable end of the smartphone market, while also manufacturing on a huge scale, only strengthens this position. Apple still relies on partners to develop and manufacture its processors. But selling 231m iPhones, as it did last year, gives it leverage with suppliers such as TSMC and Samsung, which make the A9. The company’s ambitions in silicon show little sign of letting up. This week, the Silicon Valley Business Journal reported that Apple paid $18.2m for a 70,000 square foot former chip manufacturing facility in San Jose, close to its Cupertino headquarters. The plant is not seen as being large enough for manufacturing at Apple’s scale, leading analysts to conclude that it is most likely to bring prototyping capabilities closer to home in an effort to improve the speed and secrecy of its R&D. It could be, in effect, a playground for chip designers in the heart of Silicon Valley. With Mr Srouji’s promotion, Apple is sending a message that chips are just as important as product design, supply-chain management or marketing — a move that will only further enhance its reputation among chip engineers. “Apple’s promotions always mean something,” says Mr Moorhead. “This gentleman has a seat at the big table.”
270;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm defies activist pressure to break up;Group says keeping licensing and chip set businesses together is best way to grow;US chipmaker Qualcomm has resisted pressure from an activist investor to break up, arguing its structure is the best way to grow.The California-based company, which has a market value of $70bn and employs about 31,000 people, has been examining options including a separation of its licensing and chip set businesses since July, as slowing chip demand brought investor scrutiny. The company has suffered this year from a broader pullback in the smartphone market and Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy devices, instead of Qualcomm’s.“The strategic benefits of the current structure will best fuel Qualcomm’s growth as we move through the upcoming technology transitions and extend our technologies into new user experiences, services and industries,” said Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive.The chip set business is a “significant contributor” to its patent licensing, he said, and drives adoption of new technology and intellectual property across the mobile industry.Mr Mollenkopf added that keeping the two units together fuelled both R&D and returns to shareholders, as well as being “meaningfully more cost and tax efficient”.Qualcomm shares, which have slumped 35 per cent this year, rose 2.5 per cent by markets close in New York. By contrast, the Nasdaq, home to the world’s largest technology companies, is up 5.5 per cent in 2015.At the heart of the issue has been whether Qualcomm would be better off separating its chipmaking business, which generates the bulk of its revenues, from its patent licensing arm that accounts for more of overall profits as it hoovers up royalties on patents.Jana Partners, an activist investor, took a $2bn stake in Qualcomm in April. In July, Qualcomm appointed two new independent directors and said it would cut up to 4,500 staff as part of a move to cut $1.4bn from its annual costs. The new representatives were part of the committee that undertook the review. Boston Consulting Group analysed potential alternatives, while Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Centerview Partners also advised.The committee considered “full and partial separation of our licensing and chip set businesses, tracking stocks, a subsidiary IPO and various changes to our capital structure”, Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chairman, said on a conference call on Tuesday.Qualcomm also considered whether splitting the business would help to resolve antitrust investigations, which have been a recurring issue for it around the world in recent years in various different aspects of its business. However, Mr Jacobs said the committee decided separating the chip set and licensing business would have no benefit in handling such investigations.Alongside the review, Qualcomm said that thanks to cost-cutting and underlying demand for chips used in mobile phones, its earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter would be either at or better than the high end of the range it had set out.Qualcomm has now signed deals with four of the top five equipment manufacturers in China , Mr Mollenkopf said. “We also continue to be encouraged by the support we are receiving from the Chinese government.”

Activists want a company to consider a break-up; company promises to think about it really, really hard; it then announces months later that it would rather not. Thank you anyway.In the case of Qualcomm, managers appear to have taken the no-expense-spared route (Goldman and Boston Consulting were among the advisers used) to the obvious result.Jana Partners had included a break-up in a list of possible remedies to boost the chipmaker’s sagging share price. It would have meant separating the company into a patent licensing business and a chip set business. Well before Tuesday’s publication of the results of the review, the idea had been roundly criticised. Hiving off the chip set business would deprive the licensing business of an important stream of new intellectual property as well as creating tax problems.The conclusion makes sense. What sticks in the craw is the assertion from chief executive Steve Mollenkopf that the company has “delivered substantial stockholder value over time”. Technically, this is true; anyone who bought at the 1991 initial public offering has enjoyed an 8,000 per cent return. More recent investors have been bitterly disappointed. A total shareholder return of 5.5 per cent in five years leaves Qualcomm at the bottom of its peer group; this year the stock is down more than a third.Jana may not have won structural change by holding Qualcomm’s feet to the fire but it has improved the company. A new goal of saving $1.4bn from expenses of $7.7bn is ambitious. The stock is now underpinned by a 4 per cent dividend yield.Most encouraging is the promise to talk in January about “progress” in China. Some Chinese device manufacturers had stopped paying for licences while new agreements were negotiated. Xiaomi has now cut a new deal; Lenovo is rumoured to have followed suit.

274;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-12-08T14:01:29Z;EU accuses Qualcomm of impeding rivals;European Commission says US tech group distorted competition in chipset market;The European Commission on Tuesday launched two antitrust cases against Qualcomm, charging the US technology company with distorting competition in the critical market for the chips used in smartphones and other mobile devices.Brussels said that Qualcomm “may have” made illegal payments since 2011 to an unnamed major manufacturer of smartphones and tablets for exclusively using its chipsets.The second charge was that Qualcomm sold its chipsets below cost between 2009 and 2011 to force its British competitor Icera out of the market. Qualcomm said that this charge of “predatory pricing” related to dongles — small USB devices that can be used on laptops to provide connectivity to the internet and external functions, such as audio, video and data.The charges come after the commission launched an investigation into Qualcomm earlier this year.Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, complained that these practices harmed European consumers, as smartphones and tablets play an ever more important role in the European economy.“Many consumers enjoy high-speed internet on smartphones and other devices — baseband chipsets are key components that make this happen. I am concerned that Qualcomm’s actions may have pushed out competitors or prevented them from competing,” she said.Qualcomm has several months to respond to the charge sheets, but insisted that it had done nothing that would hinder competition in the European market.“We look forward to demonstrating that competition in the sale of wireless chips has been and remains strong and dynamic, and that Qualcomm’s sales practices have always complied with European competition law,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel and executive vice-president.Qualcomm is the world’s largest supplier of baseband chipsets, which are vital components in smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.$25bnQualcomm’s revenue in the 2015 fiscal year to September 27In theory, the commission has the power to levy a fine of anything up to 10 per cent of the previous financial year’s turnover in antitrust cases, if it ultimately finds wrongdoing. Qualcomm’s revenue in the 2015 fiscal year to September 27 was $25bn, but a fine of $2.5bn would greatly exceed any sum that Brussels has ever demanded as a fine against a single company in one instalment.The EU’s action comes a month after South Korea became the first country to challenge a core aspect of its technology licensing practices, driving shares to a four-year low.Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that Taiwan’s regulators had requested information on the company’s patent licensing arrangements. Qualcomm said the case was in its early stages and added that it believed its business practices were legal.Opening a case against Qualcomm will only fuel accusations from US officials that Ms Vestager is targeting American companies more often than their European rivals.She opened a landmark antitrust case against Google’s retail search business earlier this year and has pursued high-profile investigations into European tax planning of Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and McDonald’s. She rejects the accusations of anti-US bias.

277;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Foreign companies in China must learn that respect is paramount;The better road is one of calm and thoughtfulness rather than agitation and hostility;China’s economic and industrial transformation is occurring so rapidly that foreign companies often fail to appreciate the risks of doing business in the country. This is particularly true in the sphere of intellectual property (IP), where companies now enjoy much greater protections but have simultaneously been tripped up by competition regulators’ increased scrutiny of their patent and licensing practices.China’s ability to protect patents has grown after decades of non-existence and non-enforcement. In 10 years, the number of patent litigations filed has more than quadrupled, with close to 10,000 cases submitted last year.The Chinese government’s new specialised IP courts now provide companies with an enforcement mechanism comparable to, if not better than, those in Europe and the US. Litigation in China also offers many advantages to patent owners, including win rates above 75 per cent (and even higher for foreign patentees), injunction rates above 95 per cent, short time to trial, scant discovery and low costs (less than one-tenth of those incurred in the US). Most importantly, because so many supply chains pass through China, a single litigation can effectively impose a global ban on sales of a disputed product.But not all patent owners should rejoice. Along with a strengthening of the patent system has come increased enforcement of China’s 2008 Anti-Monopoly Law (AML). Over the past three years, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has beefed up staffing levels and raised its price-related investigations fourfold.In 2013, the NDRC imposed price-fixing fines of Rmb353m on six Korean and Taiwanese LCD panel manufacturers. Last year the NDRC began investigating InterDigital, a US wireless technology company, after complaints by Chinese companies. InterDigital subsequently reached settlement agreements with the Chinese complainants and, in an undertaking with the NDRC, said it would scale back the royalty rates it charges.The NDRC also probed US technology giant Qualcomm on similar grounds and, earlier this year, imposed a record penalty of Rmb6.1bn. Qualcomm agreed to stop some of its “patent bundling” practices and lowered certain royalty rates by one-third.AML penalties and fines in China can be extreme. But in the case of Qualcomm, perhaps the worst consequence of its run-in with the NDRC was the separate antitrust inquiries that followed in South Korea, the European Union and US.There are a number of steps that companies can take to minimise the risks posed by regulatory investigations.First, companies must have friends in China. In a country where everything is based on relationships, every company must have multiple levels of relationships with both government officials and influential Chinese industry leaders who have their ear to the ground. This is not to encourage any type of corruption, but rather facilitate a free flow of information. In China, trust and respect are paramount and cannot be developed overnight.The challenge to Qualcomm might have been avoided or minimised if the US company had had better Chinese government contacts who could have advised it that problems were brewing and explained the need for action.It is at this sort of early stage that having knowledge of the problem and the ability to communicate a defence is paramount. Once the investigation was announced publicly in February 2014, there was no path for the NDRC to impose either a minimal penalty or no penalty without losing face.Had Qualcomm and NDRC instead been able to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution earlier — and with less publicity — the result may well have been a lesser penalty that did not trigger follow-up investigations in other jurisdictions.Second, all foreign companies and their executives, lawyers and other agents must act with great respect in dealing with Chinese officials. US companies in particular have a well-deserved reputation for lacking deference and humility.Had InterDigital and Qualcomm originally approached their situations with greater meekness, things might have evolved quite differently. Often it is the lawyers that get in the way, because when you are a hammer everything looks like a nail. The better road is one of calm and thoughtfulness rather than agitation and hostility.Third, any company that licenses patents or technology in China should always have in its back pocket a specific minimum acceptable royalty rate. That way any dispute can be nipped in the bud with a public announcement that the company is lowering its licensing rate to an “even fairer level”, with examples to support this claim. This is not ideal but far better than the alternative of having to face a formal AML investigation.The writer is chief patent counsel for Rouse, an international law firm specialising in intellectual property, and a former Qualcomm lawyer
278;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
279;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-11-18T21:54:34Z;Qualcomm shares tumble on South Korean antitrust probe;Mobile chip group’s technology licensing practices face challenge;Qualcomm’s shares tumbled nearly 10 per cent on Wednesday, hitting a four-year low, after it revealed that antitrust authorities in South Korea had become the first to challenge a core aspect of its technology licensing practices.The regulatory setback was the second blow this month to the US mobile chip company’s high-margin licensing business. It had already revealed problems in negotiating new licensing deals with some handset makers in China, following the settlement earlier this year of an antitrust case there. Together, the two have wiped $20bn from its stock market value, adding to pressure on the company at a time when activist investor Jana Partners has already called on it to consider a break-up.A staff-level report from the Korea Fair Trade Commission has concluded that a number of Qualcomm’s practices violate the country’s competition law, the company said late on Tuesday. These include its insistence on calculating its licence fee on the overall cost of a mobile device, rather than just the chips using its technology.“Device level licensing is the worldwide industry norm, and Korean companies have long enjoyed the benefits and protections of access to our patents, which cover essentially the entire device,” the company said in a statement.Untying chip licensing fees from the overall cost of a handset could make it harder for Qualcomm to justify its royalty rates and open the door to other regulators to mount similar challenges, said one antitrust lawyer familiar with the case.Qualcomm claimed the allegations and conclusions in the staff report were “not supported by the facts and are a serious misapplication of law”. It said it would contest the conclusions, which had yet to be confirmed by the commission.“Our patent licensing practices, which we and other patent owners have maintained for almost two decades, and which have facilitated the growth of the mobile communications industry in Korea and elsewhere, are lawful and pro-competitive,” it said.The antitrust challenge in Korea, like the earlier one in China, appeared to be provoked partly by concerns about the impact of Qualcomm’s licensing on local tech companies, said Patrick Moorhead, a US chip industry analyst. “This could very well be driven by Samsung ,” he said, given that the Korean company is one of Qualcomm’s biggest competitors.Qualcomm’s share of the intellectual property in 4G mobile communications is lower than in previous generations. However, phones are still shipped with earlier versions of the technology to make them compatible with older networks, leaving the company with considerable influence over mobile communications licensing. “What this is about is, people don’t like that Qualcomm has such a big share of the [IP] stack,” Mr Moorhead said.The company is also facing antitrust investigations in the US and Europe.
280;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm: debt collectors;Battered US chipmaker in need of new contracts and paying customers;Relying on sales to the world’s most populous country and the world’s most valuable company has its drawbacks. Qualcomm is heavily dependent on Chinese demand for its intellectual property in smartphones. It also supplies modems to Apple’s iPhone and circuits to Samsung. If these customers manage without it, or use the patents and refuse to pay, it is in trouble.In quarterly results this week, Qualcomm disclosed that its revenues in China had surpassed 50 per cent for the first time. Unfortunately, it also disclosed that not all its Chinese customers were bothering to pay. Cue a 15 per cent plunge in the stock price and $19bn wiped from its market capitalisation.Qualcomm’s problems in China were supposed to have been resolved earlier this year. It agreed to pay a $975m fine to settle “anti-monopoly charges” and signed agreements on how it would be paid for licences. But not all of China’s device manufacturers are playing ball, leading to lower revenue guidance.It would be nice if financial engineering could provide the solution. In April, Jana Partners, an activist investor that is Qualcomm’s fifth-biggest shareholder, recommended an accelerated share buyback and a strategic review to assess breaking up the company into a licensing company and a chip set business. Qualcomm has upped its buyback, taking on $10bn of debt to do so, and the review is under way. But there are few in the industry or on Wall Street who believe that the two businesses can prosper on their own, particularly given the current difficulties in the supposedly more desirable and more profitable licensing business.It feels like hand-to-hand combat is the only way out. There is room for optimism. Samsung is about to launch its next handset, the Galaxy S7, and could reintroduce Qualcomm’s circuits after shunning them in favour of its homegrown products in the S6. Maintaining its supply to Apple for the iPhone 7 would be a relief. Together the two companies and their suppliers account for 45 per cent of revenues. Most important of all is collecting cash in China. The most welcome four words on the earnings call came from Qualcomm’s president: “We will get paid.” Investors are showing little faith in that statement, but for those left in the stock, it is still the best chance of rescue.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
281;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-10-22T03:14:55Z;Samsung looks to rake in the chips;Heightened focus on expanding its foundry business puts pressure on industry leader TSMC;"TSMC is facing a battle to defend its market share as rival Samsung Electronics encroaches on the world’s largest contract chipmaker by revenue by stealing a march in technology leadership.Taiwan-based TSMC dominates the production of mobile chips based on others’ designs, controlling more than half of the global foundry market. However, it is increasingly under pressure as its South Korean rival snatches away key customers such as Apple and Qualcomm, thanks to a faster shift to more advanced technology.Samsung is the world’s biggest memory chipmaker by revenue but is a late-comer to the foundry business, with a 5 per cent market share according to Gartner. It is keen to expand that, given the limited growth potential for memory chips as PC demand stagnates. Last year, Samsung unveiled plans to invest $14.7bn in a new facility in South Korea to begin mass production of advanced chips in the first half of 2017.Gartner forecasts that the foundry market, driven by the smartphone boom, will expand from $47bn last year to $62bn in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6 per cent, outpacing 3.3 per cent annual growth in the semiconductor market over the same period.Samsung has leapfrogged TSMC in the technological race to cram more power into smaller chips in search of speed and cost savings. In February it started mass production of the most intricate chips using transistors as tiny as 14nm, or billionths of a metre, several months ahead of TSMC's move to 16nm.The South Korean company last year suffered an estimated $1bn loss in its logic chips division — the computing “brains” of smartphones and other mobile gadgets — as TSMC secured orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, driving revenue at the Taiwanese group to a record high.But analysts forecast a $1bn profit this year for Samsung as it steals even more logic chip business from major customers, in the process adding to pressure on TSMC as clients play it off against Samsung on pricing.This year Samsung won a lucrative contract from Apple to make the processor chips for its latest iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.“This is the first time since 2003 that someone has actually come up with a viable alternative” to TSMC's most advanced technology, says Warren Lau, analyst at Maybank Kim Eng. “A lot of traditional TSMC’s major customers are trying to go to Samsung . . . because you always want to have alternative solution providers to maximise pricing power.”TSMC last week cut its investment budget for the year by 30 per cent to $8bn as it reported its first quarterly earnings decline in three years, and it expects fourth-quarter revenue to fall for the first time in four years.“TSMC now has real competition with Samsung threatening the leading edge of the foundry business,"" says Peter Yu at BNP Paribas. “Their margins will come under further pressure amid slowing growth for smartphones.""Mr Yu expects Samsung to expand its foundry business — which remains just a tenth the size of TSMC’s — over the next two years, building on its technological head-start. “On 14-nano, Samsung is more advanced than TSMC’s 16-nano. This will present a golden opportunity for Samsung to steal TSMC’s customers,” he says.But while some analysts say slow momentum will persist through the first half of 2016, others anticipate that TSMC will regain iPhone orders from Apple next year, given Samsung’s probable capacity constraints as client numbers and demand balloon. With both Samsung and TSMC expected to migrate to 10nm and beyond almost simultaneously, analysts say high-end customers could favour TSMC due to the absence of any tricky “frenemy” issues.“Samsung’s unique business model — making both components and sets — brings an inherent conflict of interest, forcing it to compete with its foundry clients in some product areas,” says CW Chung at Nomura. “Customers would prefer TSMC to Samsung if their technologies are similar,” in which case “Samsung will have to cut prices to lure customers, which will eat into their margins.”"
282;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-10-15T10:38:41Z;TSMC to cut $3bn from capex amid smartphone slowdown;Chipmaker sees first quarterly earnings decline since 2012 amid slowing smartphone growth;TSMC has cut $3bn from its annual capital spending budget, as the chipmaker reported its first quarterly earnings decline for three years amid slowing growth in the smartphone market.TSMC is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry — making bespoke logic chips for companies that provide their own designs — and it has benefited from the smartphone boom, manufacturing mobile chips for designers such as Qualcomm and Broadcom of the US.But amid a marked slowdown in the smartphone industry this year, the Taiwanese company’s third-quarter net income fell 1.3 per cent year-on-year to NT$75.3bn ($2.3bn), it said on Thursday. This was the first such decline since 2012, although it was ahead of average analyst forecasts and the shares closed 2.6 per cent higher.Analysts at Nomura say the pain of the smartphone slowdown has been exacerbated for TSMC over the past year as key customers including Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia have shifted more business to Samsung, which recently leapfrogged TSMC in the race to develop ever smaller chips in search of speed and power efficiency gains.Lora Ho, chief financial officer, said that the company expected its capital expenditure this year to be $8bn — down from its April estimate of $10.5bn-$11bn — but sought to play down any link with the company’s relatively weak recent performance. Half the cut was attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements or currency fluctuations, she said.But the decision appeared linked to lower growth in smartphones and other consumer electronic devices than the company had anticipated, according to Carlos Peng, an analyst at Fubon Securities. Analysts at IDC in August lowered their estimate of smartphone shipment growth this year to 10 per cent — against 28 per cent last year — citing an end to rapid growth in China, the world’s biggest market for the devices.“If the growth in consumer products were good, I don’t believe TSMC would cut capex,” Mr Peng said. He added that the cut to capital expenditure would probably be focused on the 16 nanometre node, where TSMC has lost some business to Samsung’s smaller 14nm process.But TSMC is poised to roll out a still smaller manufacturing technology, the 10nm node, in 2017, which will help it win back high-end business from Samsung and could return sales growth to levels of up to 15 per cent, Nomura analysts wrote this week. Revenue rose only 1.7 per cent in the third quarter year-on-year.Mark Liu, co-chief executive, said that TSMC’s plans for the 10nm remained on track and that demand for expensive cutting-edge smartphones would drive future profits.“Unit growth in high-end smartphones this year will be about flat, but the silicon content of the high-end smartphones will still have mid-teen percentage growth,” he said. “Smartphones will continue to provide growth momentum for TSMC in the next two to three years.”

This is a huge strength of democracy,” he said.However, Facebook’s effort to provide free access to its services and other apps through the Internet.org programme have met with a backlash, with some Indian media companies walking away from the project this year because of concerns over net neutrality.On Saturday night, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, an Indian-born engineer, announced the broadband plan at a dinner in Mr Modi’s honour.Google, in tandem with Indian Railways, said it would bring the first stations online within months, with the network expanding to cover 100 of India’s busiest stations before the end of 2016.“This will rank it as the largest public WiFi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users”, said Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai, another Indian-born executive at the top of the US tech industry, in a blog post.Qualcomm, the US chipmaker, said it would ”invest up to $150m in Indian start-up companies across all stages as part of its commitment to India”.I do believe that as [Modi] keeps reducing red tape, there is huge opportunity there for US companies and US start-upsMembers of the Indian diaspora play a vital role in San Francisco’s tech community, and many welcomed Mr Modi’s visit, the first time an India prime minister has been there in three decades.“For the first time there is a feeling that this is a man who wants to make a change, wants to make a difference and has the integrity to pull it off,” said Amit Shah, an Gujarat-born entrepreneur who is now a partner at Artiman Ventures.However, he cautioned that there were still many obstacles for start-ups and entrepreneurs in India.“For most start-ups the Indian market itself is still mythical,” he said. “It is very hard to penetrate, it is very difficult to do business. But I do believe that as he keeps reducing red tape, there is huge opportunity there for US companies and US start-ups.”Mr Modi has also encouraged US tech companies to move factories to India, and invited Apple to manufacture there during a meeting with chief executive Tim Cook. However, Apple did not announce any such plans.Additional reporting by David Keohane
284;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-09-24T22:25:27Z;"Share buybacks: don’t panic; worry";After three years of vigorous growth buyback are going sideways;"There are a lot of silly theories about what moves the stock market. One thinks of “psychologically important levels”; of “money on the sidelines”; of the venerable Fed Model. Among the dreck, though, there are a few that make good sense. Here’s one: in the short term, buybacks support stocks. Last year, for example, companies in the S&P 500 bought back nearly 3 per cent of the index’s equity (netting out the companies’ equity issuance). That is a lot of incremental demand and, indeed, corporations have been one of the few consistent net buyers of US equities in recent years.The possibility that this source of (short-term) support might dissolve is alarming. In the second quarter, S&P companies bought back a net $104bn in shares, 7 per cent more than in last years’ second quarter, on S&P Capital IQ data. No need to panic.Zoom out a little, however, and complacency fades. First off, one-quarter aside, the trend is heading in the wrong direction: over two years, buybacks are going sideways, after three years of vigorous growth. Further, the buying is concentrated. Four companies — Apple, Oracle, Qualcomm, and AbbVie — contributed more than a fifth of the total buying last quarter. Other former buyback stalwarts — GE, Goldman Sachs, Chevron, Walmart, and Coca-Cola — are backing off.Looking at buybacks by sector raises another worry. The energy sector was buying more than $10bn a quarter a year ago; less than $2bn now. Materials has seen a similar collapse. Media’s buying is off by a third. These sectors have performed poorly this year. One wonders if, in a buyback driven market, operational weakness starts stocks falling. This makes boards shy of buybacks, taking a buyer out of the market and depressing prices. And fewer buybacks mean lower earnings per share growth — a third hit to the shares. A buyback driven market may, in other words, be a very volatile one. So don’t panic; but some worry is in order.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comShare buybacks are unlikely to move markets / From Dan Brocklebank"

Cloudflare hopes that Microsoft will help it sell to large companies.“We were very flattered and honoured that a number of very large investors were interested,” he said. Fidelity led the fundraising round.Cloudflare’s alliance with Baidu is designed to help speed web traffic across the so-called “Great Firewall”, which filters the internet into and out of China. An unusual structure called a virtual joint venture means Cloudflare does not operate within the country.Mr Prince said Cloudflare had been at break even to slightly profitable on a GAAP basis over the past 18 months, with 75 per cent gross margin. He would not comment on Cloudflare’s valuation.“We continue to grow revenue at a rate that mirrors some of the best software-as-a-service companies like Workday and Salesforce,” he said.Investment from venture capitalists and larger funds has been pouring into cyber security companies in the hope that they will sell more products to those increasingly worried about cyber attacks.Devastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fightback against the hackersAfter high-profile data breaches at companies such as Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, cyber security groups say boards are becoming more worried about the possibility of being crippled by an attack, and are prepared to spend more on security.However, some cyber security experts have warned that not every security technology company has an answer to the complex problem and some may be overvalued.Orion Hindawi, co-founder of Tanium, which raised $120m at a $3.5bn valuation this month, said at the time that venture capitalists were becoming “more disciplined” about who they were funding, recognising that some start-ups “didn’t do anything but spend a lot of money on sales and marketing”.Mr Prince said the company had always taken a valuation lower than “the most aggressive” so that it could partner with the right investors and build a “healthy, sustainable business”.
286;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-09-16T05:30:07Z;The power of prizes to encourage innovation;The power of prize money is rediscovered to spur innovation;"In 1906, Lord Northcliffe, the proprietor of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper, offered a £10,000 prize to the first aviators to cross the Atlantic Ocean, just three years after the Wright Brothers ascended into the sky at Kitty Hawk. The notion that anyone could get across a 2,000-mile stretch of water was so preposterous that it prompted the satirical magazine Punch to offer prizes of its own: £10,000 apiece to anyone who could swim the Atlantic, travel to Mars and back, or journey to the centre of the earth.Lord Northcliffe got the last laugh, of course. With his money and his mouthpiece at the Daily Mail, and his political connections, few people were able to champion the possibilities of air travel — for scientific progress, for business and for warfare — so effectively. His newspaper offered a string of smaller prizes for smaller aeronautical feats before the big one was finally won on June 15, 1919, when John Alcock and Arthur Brown inelegantly landed their modified Vickers Vimy nose first in an Irish bog after a 16-hour flight from Newfoundland.A century later, the power of prizes to spur innovation has been rediscovered by a new generation of wealthy individuals. Exploring space or finding extraterrestrial life? Cleaning the oceans or clearing the atmosphere? Curing disease or looking for the key to immortality? For anyone with ambitious goals, offering a prize can get you a bigger bang for your buck than traditional giving. Think of it like leveraging your investment portfolio: a carefully crafted challenge spurs spending by competing teams that can add up to many times the value of the prize purse.“It is something like the opposite of the traditional model of philanthropy,” says Paul Jacobs, who is executive chairman of Qualcomm, the semiconductor giant founded by his father in 1985, and whose charitable arm is going to give $10m to anyone who can make the Tricorder from Star Trek a reality (of which more in a moment).“People are always sceptical about charitable organisations and about how many of their dollars actually get to the cause that needs funding,” Jacobs says. “In the traditional model, you put in money and somewhat less of it than you put in gets there. In prizes, somehow more money gets there than gets put in.”Today’s prizologists take their inspiration from another figure in aviation history, Raymond Orteig, a Franco-American hotelier who, just weeks before Alcock and Brown’s voyage, offered $25,000 for the first person from any Allied country to fly between New York and Paris. By the time an obscure air mail pilot from St Louis, Missouri, called Charles Lindbergh pipped better-funded and better-known teams to the prize in 1927, the nation had become obsessed with the feats of engineering and design, and daring, of the competitors.Peter Diamandis, a young scientist and entrepreneur who had been trying to build companies launching satellites into space, read Lindbergh’s account of his transatlantic flight in 1994 and resolved to bring the spirit of the Orteig prize to the commercial space race. Two years later, he travelled to St Louis to launch a competition to build a reusable craft for suborbital space travel. The XPrize was born.The ship that won that first prize, a $10m cheque from the Ansari family, whose wealth was built in the telecoms equipment industry, is now part of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic venture.XPrize is the biggest and best known of the private organisations running such challenges, with some $100m of prizes either awarded or still up for grabs, seeking a dizzyingly diverse range of breakthroughs including stamping out adult illiteracy, radically improving the clean-up of oil spills and landing robots on the moon. The organisation is closely allied with Google — or Alphabet as we shall soon have to start calling it — to reflect its ambitions to move beyond search engines into technologies such as drones, self-driving cars and internet-enabled thermostats.A $30m lunar lander prize is sponsored by Google. Larry Page, the company’s founder, is a trustee and Wendy Schmidt, wife of Google chairman Eric Schmidt, has twice dipped into her family’s fortune to fund environmental challenges through XPrize — something she says she would love to do again.“When Eric and I do anything, we are trying to look at transformational change and trying to look at systems change,” Schmidt says.“This is an urgent problem. We are looking at the outcome of a century of maladaptive behaviour, when it comes to the human interface with the natural world. We’re depleting things, we’re using reckless technologies in the oceans, we’re doing things that maybe create a better standard of living for people in the short term, but in the long term they’re simply not sustainable.”Schmidt’s first foray into prizology came after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, when it became painfully clear that clean-up technology had not advanced in the two decades since the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled gallons of crude oil in the Gulf of Alaska in 1989. The winning design, using spinning plastic disks that attract the oil, proved it could skim oil from the surface of the water at more than four times the industry standard rate.In July, Schmidt awarded her second XPrize to a company called Sunburst Sensors, which won a competition to develop a device to accurately track the acidification of the world’s oceans, a problem with potential dire consequences for marine life.Prizes allow for the possibility that innovation could spring from somewhere unexpected, anywhere in the world, she says, citing the Las Vegas tattoo artist who sketched his oil clean-up idea on the back of a casino napkin and ended up among the semi-finalists.Star Trek wasn’t a TV series; it was a business planThe list of illustrious prizologists grows longer seemingly by the week. Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder who now runs both SpaceX, the rocket company, and Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, is funding a Global Learning XPrize for software that can teach children anywhere in the world the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic.Barbara Bush, the former US first lady, is sponsoring an adult literacy prize. The Methuselah Foundation, whose backers include Peter Thiel, the billionaire libertarian, and Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, will reward breakthroughs in growing new human tissue and new organs.A Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation challenge prize spurred the university Caltech to invent a self-cleaning, solar-powered toilet that turns human waste into hydrogen and fertiliser.Following the examples of these modern-day Northcliffes and Orteigs, governments are also again getting back into the prizes game.In the US, the website Challenge.gov has centralised and encouraged prize competitions across 75 government agencies, from Nasa to the US Mint, awarding more than 400 payouts totalling more than $120m in four years, and Darpa, the US Defence department’s research arm, has launched multimillion-dollar prizes for self-driving tanks and maintenance droids.Things have come full circle. As early as the 16th century, the Spanish royal family was offering money to anyone who could solve the accursed problem of accurately pinpointing a ship’s longitude while at sea. The British government’s Longitude Act of 1714 offered rewards for improvements in naval navigation and gave the world the marine chronometer.Last year, the independent UK charity Nesta — originally funded by an endowment from the National Lottery as the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts — established a new Longitude Prize, which will hand out £10m for a “cost-effective, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections” to help combat the rise of drug-resistant bacteria.Designing a good prize is an art and a science. The challenge must be sufficiently ambitious but conceivably attainable. The prize money has to be the right amount to attract the broadest range of participants and it has to be calculated to capture the public’s imagination, too. PR is part of the game. Hence all the Star Trek.Next year, Trekkies worldwide will be marking the 50th anniversary of the start of the original series, while the Trekkies at XPrize will be awarding the Qualcomm Foundation’s $10m to the developer of a real-life Tricorder, the handheld scanner used by Dr McCoy for sensing, computing and recording medical data from patients.The Tricorder XPrize is down to seven finalists now, including teams from India and Taiwan as well as north America. While wearable fitness trackers and healthcare apps are becoming ubiquitous, the competition aims to show they can be combined with accurate medical diagnostics, made easy enough to use to genuinely “put healthcare in the palm of your hand”. The device and any attachments must weigh less than 5lb, monitor five vital signs and detect 15 medical conditions, according to the rules.Even before it has been awarded, the leverage on that $10m is being felt. One of the teams, Canadian company CloudDX, is already taking pre-orders for its Vitaliti, a necklace that can track vital signs and fitness.Scanadu, a medical device venture headquartered out of a Nasa research centre in Silicon Valley, has re-engineered its business in the hope of winning the prize for its grab-bag of medical kits, including a blood pressure monitor called the Scout, which users press against their forehead, all of which connect wirelessly to a smartphone app.Star Trek “wasn’t a TV show”, says Walter De Brouwer, Scanadu’s wild-haired founder. “It was a business plan.”The Tricorders are undergoing testing with real volunteers in San Diego over the next few months, before a winner is crowned in time for the publicity around the golden anniversary.Qualcomm’s Jacobs says Diamandis had him sold on the Tricorder prize within moments of starting his pitch for sponsorship. “We all grew up watching Star Trek; it’s why every engineer is trying to work on Star Trek things.”If Punch magazine were still publishing, it would no doubt be offering a satirical “Warp Drive XPrize” and ribbing today’s prizologists as mercilessly as it did Lord Northcliffe. But who really will have the last laugh?"

The company credits the users’ accounts with enough data for the app and one more after they use it for more than a week.Nathan Eagle, co-founder and chief executive, said increasing numbers of poor people have smartphones as the prices of such devices have fallen but the cost of data can eat up to an average of 10 per cent of an emerging market subscriber’s daily wage. Telecoms companies struggle to get more money from these users, while the subscribers suffer because their internet access is restricted.“Ultimately the value proposition is free connectivity and that is universally appealing. Across cultures and across continents, people want to spend less money on their phone bill,” he said.Jana, which has raised $40m from Spark Capital, the venture capital firm, and advertising group Publicis, takes a different tack to Internet.org, the Facebook-led initiative which includes participation from companies such as Samsung and Qualcomm.Internet.org is known for its plans to build drones and develop lasers that can beam down internet access from the sky to the most remote corners of the world. A full-scale version of Aquila, the high-altitude, long-endurance aircraft designed by a UK-based team and acquired by Facebook, is ready for flight testing.Project Loon, Google’s stratospheric internet access project, has signed its first national agreement with the government of Sri Lanka, making the small tropical island nation a frontrunner in the race to offer countrywide WiFi access from giant helium-filled balloons.Launched in 2013, Project Loon is an ambitious plan to encircle the Earth with a chain of balloons floating high in the atmosphere which link together to form a network that gives internet access to remote and rural areas.Continue readingBut the majority of its efforts to connect people are focused on those who live within reach of the internet and cannot afford it. Internet.org has developed free-to-use apps across 18 countries which offer Facebook, alongside other sites including Google and the BBC, depending on the app. The offering will also provide access to information about basic government and healthcare services.The Internet.org apps are launched in conjunction with telecoms operators, which receive no money for the data used but see it as a way to encourage people to understand the benefits of the internet and access data-rich services outside of the app.Mr Eagle said Internet.org’s “walled garden” approach made it an “inferior product” to mCent, on which people can use the data they earn by trying sponsored apps to go anywhere online. “I don’t see how they are going to scale unless they figure out a way to cover the cost,” he said, adding that Jana had sent tens of millions of dollars to operators.He hit upon the idea for mCent when on sabbatical from his job as a visiting assistant professor at Massachusets Institute of Technology, studying telecoms data. Looking at how to encourage nurses to send text messages when their blood banks were running low, he realised that asking them to do so was effectively forcing them to take a pay cut. So he introduced a system that would allow the ministry of health to reimburse the cost of the SMS plus “a penny to say thank you”.Now, he is eager for a larger slice of the emerging market advertising market, which he estimates will be worth more than $300bn by 2019, citing research by eMarketer and ZenithOptimedia. He sees his competitors as “TV channels in Delhi, billboards in São Paulo and radio stations in Jaragar”, rather than alternative digital services.“Ultimately our mission is to get 1bn people free internet access and take a pretty substantial fraction of the $300bn spent on advertising in the developing world,” he said.Jana was Publicis’s first investment made outside its joint investing venture with France’s Orange.Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist at the French advertising group, said the company was benefiting from San Francisco-based start-ups rushing to recruit new users in emerging markets. He said companies such as ride-hailing app Uber, which is pouring money into India and China as it takes on local rivals, are “a particularly valuable subset of marketers”.But he added that consumer packaged goods companies such as Unilever, which has already lured people to buy shampoo packets with the promise of free data on the platform, are also potential advertisers.Mr Tobaccowala believes efforts to connect populations to the internet by big technology companies, which include Google’s Loon project to beam down the internet from balloons, could be sidelined by Jana. “Internet.org is a tenth the size of what Jana is, and as it goes into more and more markets — who needs Internet.org? Who needs Google Loon?”
288;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-08-21T16:52:25Z;China: unfavoured nation;People in glass global powerhouses shouldn’t throw stones;"People in glass houses might consider investing in stronger windows. China bears responsibility for much of the world’s current economic malaise. Despite reported growth of 7 per cent — the economy is slowing; it has become a drag. In contrast, the US’s second-quarter growth is estimated at a mere 2.3 per cent over the prior quarter — less appealing, but at least accelerating.China’s slowing growth is not a big surprise. Authorities are trying to rebalance the economy away from investment and exports to a more consumer-led model. Yet recent data has led to doubts about whether China can achieve its aims. On Friday, the Caixin purchasing managers’ index fell for the third month in a row to 47.1, contracting more than expected. Factory output, new orders and inventories all showed trends worsening at an even faster rate than July’s two-year low. Also worrisome, smartphone sales into China fell for the first time on record, says Gartner.Furthermore, state attempts to reboot retail investor enthusiasm with stock-market-supporting measures have undermined belief in the central government’s competence. The knock-on effects have spread beyond China’s plummeting stock markets (among only a handful of major indices still in the black for the year). This week, waves of selling rolled round the emerging markets. Even the US was eventually caught in the wake.This US sell-off may, in fact, be just. Many American companies, such as Yum Brands and Qualcomm have relied too heavily on China driving revenues while skimping on investment. Even at Apple, growth in China has helped the company increase dividends by 18 per cent in the 12 months to January; capital expenditure only rose by single-digits. According to Factset, S&P 500 companies spent nearly $1tn on share buybacks and dividends in the same period. Meanwhile, capital expenditure — to strengthen those glass houses — is expected to fall by 3 per cent this year.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
289;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-08-21T11:13:04Z;Avanti boldly goes further in satellite race;Bond placing will help realise ambition to complete high-speed internet coverage;We are led to believe that the race to use space to bring high-speed internet to the 4bn or so people around the world who do not have access is a battle between billionaires.On the one hand there is Elon Musk of Tesla fame, who announced last autumn that his SpaceX venture was in the early stages of a plan to launch a swarm of micro-satellites that would operate in “large formations” to provide cheap communications around the globe.More recently, we had news that Richard Branson’s Virgin Group was linking up with Qualcomm and OneWeb to create their own “constellation” of satellites to bring the web to the world’s poor.Both plans envisage the use of so-called low-orbit satellites positioned about 700 miles from the surface. Delivery dates for both plans are yet to be confirmed.Back on Planet Earth — and so far lacking the glitzy publicity accompanying the Musk/Branson ventures — there was evidence this week of tangible progress towards true, cheap satellite comms covering all of Africa, the Middle East and Europe. And it is being financed through the London market.Avanti Communications, which launched its first satellite five years ago, announced the completion of a $125m bond placing that will finance its HYLAS 4 space hardware, which is due to be in place by 2017. Joining Avanti’s four existing satellites, this is projected to complete the company’s coverage of the full Emea region.Avanti’s kit is known as a “high throughput” system and uses a frequency band known as “Ka”, which is said to offer narrower communication beams and therefore smaller, cheaper kit for the end user, greater capacity for the telecoms operator, and much greater communications speed overall.While this is a UK-led venture, the actual money has come from across the pond: the bonds were placed with MAST Capital Management, a Boston-based fixed-income investor, and private equity specialists KKR. MAST has also upped its equity stake in Avanti to a little over 10 per cent.The financing has not come cheaply, with the new notes carrying a coupon of 10 per cent. But getting HYLAS 4 built and in place will go some way towards silencing those critics in the London market who have long questioned whether Avanti had the wherewithal to fund its heavenly ambitions.It is understandable that Europe’s financial migration crisis does not get quite the same media coverage as the human version. But the resultant pain and anguish is real enough.We are talking here, of course, about the EU financial passporting system — the arrangements under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive whereby a company with regulatory clearance in one European jurisdiction is automatically able to operate across all European countries without further regulatory to-do.The system does not work, or rather it works too well in the interests of those who want to fleece gullible investors across the continent.And it is a special problem for London, for a simple reason: fraudulent operators are able to pose as pukka City of London-based entities while taking advantage of lax supervisory oversight elsewhere in the EU.Like others in the City, they rent offices in prestigious locations for their fiercely competitive trade. Unlike the rest, these companies target “suckers’ lists” of vulnerable people for investment scams from wine to oil wells before vanishing. Continue readingIn a little noticed move this week, the Danish financial regulator, the Finanstilsynet, finally closed a market platform called GXG Markets, which had been presenting itself as “the premier stock exchange and growth market for SMEs in the European Union”.What it was doing in reality was offering a seemingly legitimate front to a whole range of carbon credit fraudsters and rare earth speculators, who were able to obtain market listings for their suspect vehicles through GXG without any due diligence checks.When the Danish regulator paid a visit to the GXG offices it found that at least 70 corporate listings broke GXG’s own listing rules, conceding along the way that investors had almost certainly been defrauded.How much damage has been done here is unknown, but it is clear that many of those taking advantage of GXG’s lax standards were London-based operators using the Mifid passporting system to float businesses in Copenhagen, while fleecing investors across Europe.City of London Police have been making much of their recent efforts to crack down on scam operators based in and around the Square Mile, using a City address to confer respectability. To date most of the efforts here seem to be aimed at fake gemstone merchants and exotic investment salesmen, peddling forestry, bamboo and the like.But there is a higher grade of crook using the pan-European rules to serious advantage. And regulators really do not seem to be on the case.paul.murphy@ft.com
290;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-08-20T11:59:05Z;Lacklustre Xiaomi launch reflects unease atop smartphone market;Uncharacteristic wobble from leading group comes amid increasingly saturated Chinese market;Fans of upstart Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi have come to expect bold vision and swashbuckling steps from founder Lei Jun. But the launch last week of its latest Android-based software update produced disappointment in the community of effusive and usually full-of-praise “Mi-fans”.Flanked by gigantic digital displays of Xiaomi phones, Mr Lei, clad in his trademark jeans, dark shirt and trainers, played up the details: a new larger font, video caller ID, and a speed test versus rival models that notably excluded Apple’s iPhone.Mr Lei’s previous performances had set the bar high, and this one fell short. Chat boards and Weibo feeds immediately lit up with disapproval: Miui 7 is “deeply lacking in innovation”, blared tech website ikanchai.com. “Mi crisis! Core product being marginalised,” shrieked Sohu.com. QQ Tech opined that Mr Lei looked “tired” with a “forced smile” at the launch.The company’s response was a brief statement on its web forum admitting that while some Xiaomi faithful may have been “in for disappointment”, the explanation was simple: “there are no real problems that need to be fixed.”The wobble was uncharacteristic for a company that has rarely put a foot wrong since launching its software in 2010 and producing its first phone, the Mi1, a year later.“The smartphone market has become like the film industry. How easy is it for any single company to keep churning out hit after hit?” says Christopher Thomas, a Beijing-based partner at McKinsey.Xiaomi has shot to the pinnacle of China’s smartphone industry in just over five years since its launch. Less than a year ago a venture capital funding round valued it at $45bn, making it at the time the world’s most valuable tech start-up.34mNumber of phones sold by Xiaomi in the first half, off the pace of its goal to sell 80m in 2015With sales still growing at a 38 per cent clip year-over-year and its smartphones the top-selling brand in China in the second quarter, according to IDC, Xiaomi’s future looks bright.But analysts question whether Xiaomi can continue to wow an increasingly saturated market. Its attempts to build an “ecosystem” of interconnected devices and services seem unfocused, featuring a battery recharger, a smart TV, a fitness band and an air purifier.“A meaningful ecosystem is not the same as selling a lot of products with the same brand,” says Nick Arnold, an independent strategy adviser and Apple’s former head of marketing for China and Asia. “They seem to be moving towards offering low-cost products as an ecommerce platform, possibly at the expense of building meaningful product relevance.”In response, Xiaomi insists it has a “solid plan to create a connected lifestyle” for its users.Nevertheless, success has painted a bullseye on Xiaomi, with legions of imitators following the Chinese start-up’s game plan: cultivating brand loyalty with “fan” groups, online flash sales, glitzy Apple-style launch events and high-specification products sold at low prices.Internet companies Letv and Qihoo 360 recently launched their own low-price devices while handset maker Oppo has jumped into China’s top five with its phone — a product remarkably similar to Xiaomi’s Mi4, as the accompanying marketing and webpage.Even rank outsiders such as Sany Heavy, a maker of construction machinery, and Cui Jian, a rock star, are getting in on the smartphone action.Crucially, many of the encroaching devices contain the same commercial, off-the-shelf chipsets as Xiaomi’s and use similar Android-based operating systems, meaning they are easy to copy. Xiaomi got its start with its Miui version of Android that could be tweaked to replace software accompanying other manufacturers’ phones.In what may be an effort to design its own chipset, Xiaomi has partnered with Leadcore Technologies, which competes with Qualcomm in producing cheap chips for smartphones.“Vertical integration into semiconductors is a way to fend off copycats,” says Mr Thomas.Xiaomi has been hit by the flood of competition combined with a 4 per cent year-on-year contraction in China’s smartphone market — the world’s largest — in the first quarter of 2015. First-half numbers were disappointing, with sales of 34m phones suggesting the company will struggle to hit its full-year target of 100m or even a revised goal of 80m.“It will be a stretch to meet that target,” says Bryan Ma of IDC.Xiaomi says, however, that the second half of the year has traditionally been stronger than the first.The rise of imitators is particularly ironic given that Xiaomi got its start cultivating a reputation as the “Apple of China”.The US group may have the last laugh, with many customers who bought Xiaomi devices now trading up to iPhones — briefly propelling Apple to top spot in China in the first quarter.Xiaomi is also facing a squeeze in the mid-price range, which it has set out to dominate. Domestic competitor Huawei has shot up the rankings this year, with its 15.8 per cent slice of China’s market in the second quarter just shy of Xiaomi, according to IDC.In a bid to boost sales, Xiaomi has turned to exports, selling to Brazil, India, Malaysia and Singapore.“They always had ambitions to go overseas,” says Mr Ma, “but the sense of urgency to do so is significantly heightened now that the home market is slowing.”This article has been amended since initial publication to remove an incorrect product name.
291;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-07-27T10:55:17Z;Qualcomm: high water mark for activists?;Hedge funds may need to switch focus from Silicon Valley to traditional roots;"Qualcomm’s capitulation last week to the demands of an activist hedge fund may go down as a high water mark for activism.Jana Partners, the hedge fund run by Barry Rosenstein, got pretty much everything it had demanded of Qualcomm, a $96bn tech giant that is the world’s largest maker of microchips for smartphones. The company accepted two Jana nominees to the board, it agreed to tie executive compensation more closely to returns on investment, and it has promised another review of whether the company should be split in two.The presence of Jana on the shareholder register also no doubt stiffened management’s resolve when it came to cutting costs in response to weak demand and customer losses; the company said it would cut 15 per cent of its workforce.For several reasons — the size of the target, the sector in which it operates, and the board’s openness to the activist’s ideas — the Qualcomm situation is emblematic of activism’s extraordinary reach and apparent success.Investors in activist hedge funds, however, ought to worry that their managers are hunting for targets in the wrong places. It is not obvious that activists add value at large companies, tech sector share prices may be overheating, and there is a gathering backlash against the activists’ playbook.Activism may once again have been among the best performing segments of the hedge fund industry in the first half of 2015, but the going will get tougher from here without a course correction.The activists have discovered the tech sector and have been targeting established Silicon Valley companies with alacrity. Elliott Management, whose activism practice is run by 34-year-old wunderkind Jesse Cohn, has been a pioneer, but even the septuagenarian Carl Icahn has thrown his weight around in Apple, Dell and Netflix in recent years, and in a host of smaller tech companies.In mature tech industries such as manufacturing, there are certainly arguments for bringing a little Wall Street discipline and tech should not be spared the hard questions on return on investment that other sectors face.But activists are riding a wider wave. According to HFR, which collates industry returns, activist funds were up 5.6 per cent in the first half of the year. The preponderance of tech and healthcare companies in their portfolios explains more of the outperformance than does the value specifically added by the activists through their cajoling of corporate boards.The only segment of the hedge fund industry that beat activism in the first six months, on HFR’s data, was specialist tech and healthcare funds.Investors in activist hedge funds should therefore be cognisant of elevated valuations in the tech sector, which could weigh on fund performance in the futureInvestors in activist hedge funds should therefore be cognisant of elevated valuations in the tech sector, which could weigh on fund performance in the future. Price-earnings multiples in the sector are now nudging 20 times.Unlike most stockpickers, activist hedge funds are not likely to drop their tech investments at the sight of a market downturn, since it can take several years for their shareholder-friendly policies to be implemented and to prove out. The percentage of new targets that are in the tech sector has dropped moderately over the past year, but tech and healthcare together still account for more than a quarter of new situations.With $100bn now invested in activist funds, managers have been driven to larger and larger targets, but their value-add at blue-chip companies is more modest. Partly this is the result of their own success: companies with expensive advisers often now “activist proof” themselves in numerous ways, not least by implementing much of the activists’ shareholder-friendly playbill, including using super-cheap debt financing to buy back shares. The chasm that used to exist between clubby boards and shareholders is not so wide now, especially at the biggest companies.Meanwhile, large shareholders such as BlackRock, Capital Group and Vanguard are increasingly expressing concern that activism can lead to short-termism by companies. Nelson Peltz lost a bid to get on the DuPont board this summer, in a signal that activists will not have it all their own way.Activism may be best served by a return to its roots. One of the newer kids on the block, Marcato Capital, founded by Bill Ackman protégé Mick McGuire, who spent the past year demanding change at Sotheby’s and Bank of New York Mellon, is currently raising new funds to target not larger companies, but smaller ones. The idea is that, in the $1bn market cap range and away from tech, there are more regional businesses ripe for corporate governance reform, new strategic thinking, and for consolidation.That implies a very different kind of target to the Qualcomms of the current wave of activism.stephen.foley@ft.com"
292;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-07-22T20:47:34Z;Qualcomm eyes break-up and up to 4,500 job losses;Chipmaker valued at $105bn looks to overhaul business under pressure from activist investor;Qualcomm, the $105bn chipmaker under pressure from an activist investor, said it would slash its workforce, shift activity to low-cost countries and consider a break-up, amid a slowdown in chip demand.The company also announced that it would add three new directors to its board and shake up executive compensation, agreeing to a slate of demands from the activist hedge fund Jana Partners.Qualcomm has been under pressure since Jana took a $2bn stake in the company in April, demanding cost cuts and the possible separation of the patent licensing arm that accounts for two-thirds of earnings.Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, the part of the company that produces and sells chips, has suffered from being largely shut out of the most profitable part of the mobile market. Besides losing a key Samsung contract, it has almost no foothold in the iPhone, putting it at a disadvantage as Apple has grown its market share and Apple and Samsung between them have accounted for a bigger overall share of the mobile industry.The company, which employs 31,000 workers worldwide, said it would cut $1.1bn a year from its $7.3bn in annual costs by reducing full-time and temporary workers. The cuts could result in up to 4,500 job losses before the end of 2016.Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive, insisted the company was “not sacrificing the future for the present” and would still spend more than $4bn annually on research and development, including in 5G mobile and in-car technology.“We have been through industry transformations before and Qualcomm has always thrived coming out of them,” he said.Qualcomm shares fell 2.7 per cent in after-market trading to $62.50 after a lowering of its revenue estimates for the year.I think it’s an overreaction, they’re kowtowing to Wall StreetIt cited lower sales of high-end mobile devices in China as well as the recent decision by Samsung to use an in-house chip in the latest version of its Galaxy phone.Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, criticised the scale of the cost cuts. “I think it’s an overreaction, they’re kowtowing to Wall Street,” he said.The company has been caught in a “short-term squeeze” because of its failure to anticipate demand from Chinese customers for a 64-bit chip set, Mr Moorhead added.Qualcomm posted net income of $1.2bn for the quarter ended June 30, down from $2.2bn in the same period last year, on revenues that were down 14 per cent to $5.8bn. Chip shipments were flat, year over year, while licensing income reflected declining chip prices, it said.Qualcomm has studied whether to break up the company on several occasions, most recently in connection with the Chinese antitrust investigation into the company that was resolved earlier this year, according to a person familiar with its thinking.Those reviews have always concluded that the company benefits from extensive synergies in areas such as research and development, as well as tax advantages, that would be lost in a break-up.Jana proposed two directors who will be joining the board immediately, Mark McLaughlin, chief executive of Palo Alto Networks and Tony Vinciquerra, who was previously chief executive of News Corp-owned Fox Networks. Mr Vinciquerra was a director at Motorola when that company decided to split its mobile phones and telecoms equipment businesses.The hedge fund will also be involved in the selection of a third new director in the coming months. Barry Rosenstein, Jana’s founder, praised the “bold steps” Qualcomm was taking.
293;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm faces EU scrutiny over antitrust allegations;Competition chief adds US chipmaker to tech companies under scrutiny over pricing and markets;Qualcomm is to be the subject of an EU antitrust investigation after Brussels said it would probe whether the semiconductor company had abused its dominant market position and engaged in “predatory pricing”.The European Commission will determine whether the California-based chipmaker, the world’s largest by market share, broke EU law by offering customers “financial incentives” in exchange for only buying Qualcomm products.It will also look at whether the group — whose customers include smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung — was selling chipsets used in mobile phones at below cost, in an attempt to stifle competition.Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, said: “We are launching these investigations because we want to be sure that high-tech suppliers can compete on the merits of their products.”The investigation by the commission does not amount to formal charges. If the EU’s executive arm does pursue charges, it has the power to fine a company up to 10 per cent of global revenues if it finds wrongdoing.The move is another ambitious step by the commission, which has taken on high-profile competition cases involving some of US’s biggest companies.Google faces a long-running antitrust investigation, while Apple and Amazon are both being questioned over tax deals involving Ireland and Luxembourg.The commission also has ongoing probes into other US groups, including MasterCard and Starbucks, whose tax arrangements with the Netherlands have come into question.Qualcomm said the claims were “without merit”.It added: “This step allows investigators to gather additional facts, but it represents neither an expression by the commission on the merits of the case nor an accusation against the company.”The company said it was “disappointed” about the investigation. It added that it had “been co-operating and will continue to co-operate with the commission, and we continue to believe that any concerns are without merit”.In the past year, Qualcomm — which has revenues of $27.5bn — has also faced scrutiny over competition from regulators in the US and China. In 2014, the company accounted for about two-thirds of the market for “baseband processors”, which allow phones to make calls.Demonstrating “predatory pricing” in products that require lots of research and development — such as semiconductors — is often difficult as the true costs are sometimes blurred, according to antitrust experts.

Airbus will manufacture the satellites.Other backers include Hughes Network Systems, the broadband satellite company, Coca-Cola and Totalplay.The funding will allow OneWeb to develop technology to enable the network to operate. As well as providing consumer voice and data communications, it will be able to connect ships, planes, trains and oil platforms, and will work with existing mobile service providers.Rival plans are being developed by technology groups such as Google and Facebook to connect people in developing markets.Google has two projects to provide mobile connections: Project Loon, which will involve large hot air balloons that will create a mesh of floating cell towers; and Project Titan, which will provide mobile signals to rural areas via solar-powered gliders.Facebook is working with existing telecoms groups to provide low-cost connectivity to developing countries in Africa and Asia.“The dream of fully bridging the digital divide is on track to be a reality in 2019,” said Greg Wyler, founder of OneWeb. “We have the key elements in place: regulatory, technology, launches, satellites, as well as commercial operators in over 50 countries and territories. We are committed to solving one of the world’s biggest problems — enabling affordable broadband internet access for everyone.”Satellite communications is one of the best ways of reaching remote parts of the world where it is difficult and costly to build traditional cellular towers, although satellite internet services are usually much slower than those provided by terrestrial cellular masts.“Our vision is to make the Internet affordable for everyone, connecting remote areas to rest of the world and helping to raise living standards and prosperity in some of the poorest regions today,” said Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group.Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti, which will use the satellite services across its operations, added: “Access to affordable high-speed Internet is a powerful tool for economic development and empowerment of populations, particularly, in emerging economies.”This article has been amended to reflect the fact that this is not Virgin’s first major investment since an accident involving Virgin Galactic"
295;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Battle over IP rights could hold back next-generation technology;Changes to patent policy could lead to battle over intellectual property rights;A bitter dispute over billions of dollars of compensation for intellectual property rights threatens to hold back the development of 5G telephony and other wireless technologies, industry insiders say, after divisions emerged between bodies that rule on standards in the telecommunications sector.The split reflects divergent views in the industry. Some leading companies warn that royalties from key patents could be slashed, discouraging investment and innovation. Others insist consumers will benefit from lower prices.The dispute comes after the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), one of the leading organisations that decides industry standards for WiFi and other advanced technologies, revised its patents policy.Instead of royalties being calculated as a percentage of the price of the finished product, fees for IEEE approved patents would be based on the price of the components to which they contribute. Moreover, patent holders would be obliged to offer licences to all applicants and discouraged from taking licensees to court over royalty levels.“This disturbs the balance of power between the licenser and licensee,” says Dirk Weiler, head of standards management at Nokia Networks, the Finnish telecoms equipment group.Mr Weiler says that lowering the incentives for innovators to make intellectual property available to competitors creates the risk that technologies essential to raising the performance of a product across an industry will not be shared.“We fear this may lead to a situation in which standards are no longer the best technologies, while companies try to keep back their high-quality intellectual property for themselves,” he says. “This is a danger we clearly see for 5G.”What is an inventor’s greatest challenge? How do you protect ideas and turn them into money?Join the chat using #FTinvent on Thursday 11 June 5-6pm London time (6-7pm Paris)Gustav Brismark, vice-president for patent strategy at Ericsson, the Swedish telephone equipment maker, says: “This new policy shifts the balance much more in favour of the users of the standard, so that it will facilitate companies who choose to hold out and refrain from negotiating in a fair manner to get the rights [to patented technology].”InterDigital, the San Diego-based intellectual property group, and Qualcomm, the US mobile chip company, have also complained.“In a nutshell, they don’t want developers to be paid much, and they’ve also made it as hard as possible for them to get paid at all,” wrote Bill Merritt, chief executive of InterDigital, in March this year. But other companies, including Cisco, Dell, Intel and Hewlett-Packard have backed the IEEE or are neutral. Cisco, the US networking company, has called the shift “a significant victory for consumers” that would help ensure patent holders could not “obtain unreasonable royalties”.Owning a patent for an industry-standard technology is highly lucrative — Qualcomm made some $50bn in global licensing revenue from its 3G technologies, the European Patent Office (EPO) says.In Europe, so-called “standard essential patents” — those relevant to technology adopted across an industry so that its products work in different countries and with other devices — are supposedly licensed by patent holders at “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” rates.But the IEEE objects that there is no clear definition of a “reasonable” compensation rate, leading to costly disputes and fuelling litigation, while creating disincentives to innovation.“If there is no hint what ‘reasonable’ is, then there is no guidance, which means the policy is totally vague,” says Konstantinos Karachalios, managing director of the IEEE Standards Association. “A totally vague policy is worse than no policy at all.”The IEEE was “company agnostic” in deciding to change its policy, he says: “The essence is that the value created by the standard should not be appropriated by any single player.”Standard setting bodies are seeing the first patents that are trying to define the foundations of 5G.

Mr Wang is joining Xiaomi, the mainland’s top-selling smartphone brand, as senior vice-president of strategic co-operation.Qualcomm clients in China, an important market for the US company, include Xiaomi, Lenovo and Huawei.“Frank’s extensive industry experience and leadership will drive continued business growth and further strengthen our collaboration across the Chinese mobile ecosystem and semiconductor sector,” said Derek Aberle, group president.In February Qualcomm settled the largest antitrust case in Chinese history after regulators ruled that it had abused its dominant market position to overcharge domestic manufacturers for using its technology. The chipmaker is heavily dependent on revenue from licensing patents, and China accounted for half its $26bn in sales last year.Qualcomm has been pushing to renew its business since the fine and the hit to its Chinese royalties.“One of the lessons that we learnt was that we probably weren’t engaging as much as we should’ve been,” Mr Aberle told the Financial Times at the Boao Economic Forum, China’s answer to the World Economic Forum at Davos, in March.But Qualcomm also faces broader challenges. It downgraded its revenue outlook for this year by $1bn after missing a spot in Samsung’s latest Galaxy smartphones and because of the sales strength of Apple’s iPhone, whose main processor is not a Qualcomm product.It is under investigation by competition authorities in South Korea, where smartphone producers Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Pantech rely heavily on its semiconductors. In 2009 South Korea’s antitrust agency fined Qualcomm $200m for abusing its dominant market position.Qualcomm shares were up 1 per cent at midday in New York.
297;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-05-19T14:49:18Z;The lessons of China’s noodle cartel;Foreign companies should take careful note of how Beijing dealt with domestic collusion;In the annals of anti-monopoly case law, Chinese rice noodle and tableware cartels do not rank up there with the Standard Oil trust, the petroleum cartel that was famously prosecuted in 1911 under the US Sherman Antitrust Act.But in time these two much lesser known cartels, targeted by Beijing regulators shortly after the implementation of China’s 2010 Anti-Monopoly Law, may become famous in their own right. They were among the first cases in an enforcement campaign that has since ensnared the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Qualcomm. It could also soon have implications for multinationals’ ability to safeguard their intellectual property in the world’s most coveted market.In both instances, the National Development and Reform Commission imposed small penalties for price collusion on more than a dozen rice noodle makers and service providers that wash, sterilise and wrap tableware in plastic for restaurants. Stephen Harris, a competition attorney with Winston & Strawn in Washington DC, says both cases were a signal to Chinese companies by NDRC that “new laws exist and there’s a cop on the beat”.The NDRC’s investigations into allegedly anti-competitive behaviour by domestic firms culminated with an Rmb200m ($32.2m) fine for China’s largest liquor maker, Wuliangye, two years ago.But it takes rather more money to get the attention of multinationals, and the NDRC achieved just that in 2013 with the first in a series of investigations against foreign manufacturers of milk powder, auto parts, premium cars and semiconductors.Foreign firms accused of anti-competitive behaviour by the NDRC have generally been hit with much higher fines than their domestic counterparts. Qualcomm agreed to pay a Rmb6.1bn penalty in February, while Mercedes and Audi were fined Rmb350m and Rmb250m respectively.In all three instances, the fact that the penalties could have been much worse has blunted some of the criticism that the NDRC has been deliberately targeting foreign companies — a charge the regulator has consistently denied.Qualcomm’s penalty could have required much more costly changes to its business model. The San Diego company’s shares actually rose on the news. Mercedes and Audi, meanwhile, were penalised for infractions in just one province each. In theory, they could have had to pay much more had NDRC’s investigators ferreted out wrongdoing in all of China’s 32 provinces, autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities.China’s biggest antitrust case landed Qualcomm with a record Rmb6.1bn ($977m) fine and forced the US chipmaker to sharply lower the royalties it charges Chinese companies, but the outcome could have been much worse.Continue readingThat suggests the NDRC’s investigations of multinationals, like the ones into domestic firms before them, were to a large degree motivated by the desire to send a wake-up call to the foreign investment community rather than secure maximum fines.So what next now that the NDRC has so effectively got its intended message across? Only one previously disclosed investigation has yet to be resolved — that involving Microsoft and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, which also polices aspects of the 2010 Anti-Monopoly Law.Mr Harris and his colleagues at Winston & Strawn — who represent both Qualcomm and Microsoft but said they could not comment on either case — are warning multinationals about a new set of SAIC guidelines that could force them to share intellectual property with their Chinese competitors. The rules, officially designed to “prohibit abuse of intellectual property rights to eliminate or restrict competition”, were promulgated early last month and take effect on August 1.Just as western regulators have occasionally forced operators of telecom networks and electricity grids to share their “essential facilities” with competitors, the SAIC could compel “dominant” companies to share intellectual property when it constitutes “an essential facility of manufacturing and business operations”.The EU has only forced companies to share intellectual property in a very small number of exceptional circumstances, while the US has refused to do soIf it were to do so, the SAIC would be following the EU in applying the essential facilities doctrine to intellectual property. But the EU has only forced companies to share intellectual property in a very small number of exceptional circumstances, while the US has refused to do so.In a rare public comment on the new rules, one SAIC official has said the regulator will be “cautious” in applying them.For multinationals wary of being forced to transfer technology in China, the uncertainty is a worrying but useful reminder that the country’s anti-monopoly law is very much a work in progress.Very few if any of them took note of the implications for their own industries of the NDRC’s prosecutions of the domestic rice noodle and tableware cartels. It is a mistake that they should not make twice.tom.mitchell@ft.com
298;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-05-14T11:55:35Z;Sharp warns on ability to stay afloat after $1.9bn loss;Japanese supplier of screens to Apple reports $1.9bn annual loss;Sharp, a century-old stalwart of corporate Japan, has unveiled an annual loss of $1.9bn and warned of “material uncertainty” about its ability to stay in business, less than three years after facing a similar crisis of survival.Undeterred, banks are once again pumping money into Sharp, a process analysts have criticised as hindering underperforming companies from implementing bold turnround steps.The maker of display screens for Apple on Thursday reported a net loss of Y222.35bn ($1.9bn) for the financial year that ended in March. That compares with a profit the previous year of Y11.6bn and an earlier target of a Y30bn loss.Excluding group companies, liabilities totalling Y1.57tn were more than total assets of Y1.56tn, the company reported.“There exist events or conditions that may cast a material uncertainty about Sharp’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in its earnings statement.Founded in 1912, Sharp started out making mechanical pencils, but the later success of its TVs, refrigerators and air purifiers made it a household name, alongside Sony and Panasonic. The $4bn TV display factory it launched in 2009 was once touted as a model of Japan’s advanced production techniques.But in hindsight, its heavy investment in liquid crystal display turned out to be mistimed and it was later overwhelmed by the stronger yen and the rise of cheaper Taiwanese and South Korean producers.While many of its erstwhile struggling peers have since taken a more aggressive approach to axing laggard business lines, the modest and tardy restructuring pursued by Sharp has failed to stem losses.Sharp blamed its fall further into the red on heightened price competition from Chinese rivals for smartphone LCD panels, as well as restructuring charges.The electronics maker’s latest woes follow a previous brush with financial oblivion in 2012, which it averted with the help of bank loans and a restructuring that included job and wage cuts, along with the sale of overseas plants.At the time, Sharp shifted its focus from television and solar panels to small and medium-sized LCD displays, after its first warning of “material doubt” that it could survive.The turnround plan that Sharp unveiled on Thursday resembled its previous restructuring measures: axing 10 per cent of its global workforce, including 3,500 jobs in Japan, and the sale of its head office in the west of the country.Mizuho and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sharp’s main lenders, have agreed to inject a total of Y200bn in a debt-for-equity swap. Sharp will receive an additional assistance of Y25bn from a Japanese fund backed by the banks.“We aim to create a stable profit structure with drastic structural reforms. We hope to mark a new start for our revival,” said Kozo Takahashi, Sharp’s president.We aim to create a stable profit structure with drastic structural reforms. We hope to mark a new start for our revivalFor the fiscal year to the end of March 2016, Sharp is aiming to return to the black with an operating profit of Y80bn, compared with a loss of Y48.1bn in the financial year just ended. It expects to return to net profit in the financial year ending March 2017.Sharp’s difficulties represent a sore spot in Japan’s consumer electronics industry, which has shown signs of recovery after companies including Panasonic and Sony have sold off businesses to focus on their more profitable products and services.Corporate governance experts also say Sharp is symbolic of the hurdles that Japan faces, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushes for a corporate governance overhaul aimed at ending a culture of complacent managers and low returns.In spite of the fresh restructuring measures, analysts say Sharp should take more radical steps — including the sale of businesses — to ensure its survival.During its previous crisis, the company received equity investments from Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, which already owns a stake in Sharp’s TV panel plant, has long expressed interest in helping to rescue the Japanese company.However, government officials oppose selling off businesses to foreign players due to concerns over the loss of Japanese technology.“A lot of people will wonder if Sharp should have sold itself earlier,” said Nicholas Benes, a Tokyo-based corporate governance and M&A expert who took a lead role in proposing Japan’s corporate governance code.“Four years ago, management should have got Sharp in the hands of a parent that can take better care of the company than the banks,” he added.

For many, that was true even when oil was at $100 per barrel.“Depletion gets ignored because it is not a cash item, and capex gets ignored because it is funding future growth,” he argued. “When someone doesn’t want you to look at traditional metrics, it is a good time to look at traditional metrics.”As well as Pioneer, the companies singled out in the presentation on Monday were EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum, Continental Resources and Concho Resources.Mr Einhorn — who made his reputation shorting Allied Capital, a mid-cap lender in the US, from 2002 — likened the companies to St Joe, a Florida landowner that could not develop its land profitably even at the peak of the housing bubble.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

300;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm cuts $1bn off revenue outlook;Chipmaker blames missing out on Samsung’s latest Galaxy phones;Qualcomm was forced to downgrade its revenue outlook by $1bn for the year after missing out on a spot in Samsung’s latest Galaxy smartphones and because of the strength of Apple’s iPhone sales, the mobile chipmaker said on Wednesday.Its shares fell by 2.7 per cent in after-hours trading following its second move to lower market expectations in as many quarters, even after settling an antitrust probe in China and beating forecasts in the most recent quarter.As activist investor Jana Partners agitates for a break-up, Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive, told analysts in a call that there were “significant synergies in the ability to deliver products to market” between its chip business and its patent licensing arm.“It is something that we actively evaluate and is obviously something that is on the minds of investors and something that we talk to them about, to get their perspective,” he added.Qualcomm revenues increased 8 per cent to $6.9bn in its fiscal second quarter but net income almost halved to $1.1bn over the previous year. Earnings were 45 per cent lower at $0.63.“While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half, we are guiding our second half lower,” Mr Mollenkopf said. This was because of “concentration at the premium tier” of smartphone sales, price competition in mid-range mobiles and the “impact of share loss” from its chips being omitted from Samsung’s latest flagship Galaxy S6 and Note 4 devices.Qualcomm now expects revenues of $25bn-$27bn for the full year, with earnings of between $4.60 and $5.00.“We do not believe these product cycle issues represent a long-term change in QCT’s competitive positioning,” he said, referring to the chip business, but warned that the problem may continue into next year. As a result, Qualcomm is working with an “outside expert” to review its cost structure.Exacerbating the problem is the strength of iPhone sales, Qualcomm indicated, without mentioning Apple directly.“This year is probably characterised a bit by the fact the first calendar quarter for 2015 was probably a bit stronger for a US-based flagship company,” Mr Mollenkopf said, in what analysts took as a reference to Apple which is due to report its results for the period next week.The concentration of the high-end smartphone market to Samsung and Apple devices, neither of whose latest devices use Qualcomm products as their main processor, is hurting sales of other handset makers which do use its products.“It would help us a lot if the industry structure was to be different,” Mr Mollenkopf admitted. “We don’t have a lot of control over that.”Like rival Intel, Qualcomm is looking beyond smartphones to the next generation of connected devices, from cars to the “internet of things”. Sales into these kinds of products now contribute more than 10 per cent of this year’s estimated revenues for Qualcomm’s chips business, Mr Mollenkopf said.In February, Qualcomm paid a record $975m fine to settle allegations by China’s National Development and Reform Commission that its licensing business violated anti-monopoly laws. The settlement leaves Qualcomm “better positioned” to benefit from booming sales of 3G and 4G chips in China, it said.However, Qualcomm now faces a competition investigation in South Korea. The company says it is co-operating with authorities there.
301;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-04-19T13:30:06Z;Qualcomm: chips off the block;Tech group should not split off its chipset business;"For a mature tech company, the trick of the trade is to choose what to exit, and when. Qualcomm, founded 30 years ago, has made some smart exits, such as selling its handset business in 1999 and its infrastructure business that same year. Is it now time for the company to bow out of its chipset business, too?Qualcomm has openly considered this idea in the past, and recently investors have started clamouring for it as well. The most valuable part of Qualcomm is considered by analysts to be its licensing business, which supplies most of the IP for 3G and 4G wireless in smartphones. These licensing royalties account for just a quarter of revenue, but two-thirds of profits. Meanwhile Qualcomm’s chipset business brings in the bulk of revenue but less than half of profits. The businesses can complement each other when a new wireless communication standard is being introduced: for example Qualcomm can develop the IP behind a new standard like LTE (Long Term Evolution), and then simultaneously develop chipsets that incorporate LTE to prove how the technology works. But this synergy matters less at a time like the present, when Qualcomm already licenses a large majority of global handset, Credit Suisse points out.Breaking up a company can make sense if one part of the company is weighing the other down, or if different segments have different growth trajectories. But in this case, both of Qualcomm’s business are facing similar headwinds, which has helped drive its share price down 17 per cent in the past 12 months. The licensing business has suffered declining revenues and profits, due to falling prices for smartphones (royalties are paid on the price of the phone) and to smaller royalty rates (such as the recent settlement in China). The chipset business has also seen growth slow, and is under pressure from increased competition from companies like MediaTek. Nevertheless chipsets are Qualcomm’s only source of profit growth.Sure, the company might want to consider selling if a willing buyer for the chipset business came along at the right price (CS puts the enterprise value of the chipset business at $43bn). And Qualcomm’s shares do look cheap right now; its enterprise value is 15 times 2014 free cash flow, near five-year lows. But splitting up would not help fix the challenges, or the valuation, of either the chipset or the licensing business. In times of trial, Qualcomm’s businesses may in fact be better together.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
302;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-04-14T08:58:06Z;US companies unleash share buyback binge;Shareholders on track for $1tn in cash returns this year;An ageing US equity bull run retains one major source of buyers these days — the large companies that dominate the share market including Apple, Intel, IBM and now General Electric.No matter the muted interest on the part of US investors, companies are increasingly upping their purchasing power, helping maintain a bull market run that over the past six years has left equities looking richly priced.Buybacks have been a popular way to boost shareholder value for several decades and help companies offset equity options granted to employees. But in the current environment of sluggish economic growth, the rising tide of buybacks and dividends being paid out worries some observers, as it suggests corporations are less optimistic about future prospects and see a paucity of long-term investment opportunities.Strategists have debated the degree to which buybacks have accelerated the current bull run, with several noting the downturn in Europe would have probably pushed sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and other institutional investors into US stocks.“It’s not a zero sum game and it doesn’t have to be,” says David Lefkowitz, an equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. “The flows are not necessarily indicative of how much support corporate buybacks are lending to the bull market. If that goes away, I wouldn’t necessarily be concerned about a downside in equities.”With investors expecting a big reduction in quarterly earnings growth compared with a year ago, the return of cash shows no sign of abating, with GE announcing last week it would return a massive $90bn over the next three years.Now the market stands on the cusp of seeing a record of more than $1tn returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases this year — with this activity supporting equity prices and valuations as the benchmark index hovers less than 1 per cent from a record high.Qualcomm, Lowes, General Motors and Simon Property have initiated or authorised multibillion-dollar increases to share buyback programmes in the past two months, while the financial sector cleared a key hurdle in early March when the Federal Reserve gave a green light to dividend increases and repurchase plans from the country’s largest banks. Citigroup, American Express and JPMorgan led a group of nearly two dozen financials that committed as much as $50bn to buybacks over the next five quarters.Attention has now shifted to Apple, the exemplar of share repurchases, which is expected to announce changes to its multiyear $130bn programme in late April. Those repurchases are “crucial” to valuations and earnings growth, Orrin Sharp-Pierson of BNP Paribas says, a point echoed by Goldman Sachs.“There is still a very clear preference to receive buybacks as an investor. You get this sense of perpetual synthetic growth, which investors appreciate in the presence of little underlying growth,” he says. “And you get a boost to secondary demand — the stock effect creating the additional bid for equities has been really quite important.”Retail investors have been absent from buying US equities, joining institutions looking to Europe and Asia for growth opportunities. Investors have pulled $18bn from exchange traded funds invested in US stocks since the year began, compared with $11bn that has flowed to ETFs investing in European and Asian equities, according to data provider Markit.Tobias Levkovich, a strategist with Citi, notes that over the past decade, S&P 500 companies have repurchased $4tn worth of shares — in part to offset stock options offered to employees — while domestic investors have added less than $100bn to the mix.“The lack of US retail investor interest in stocks has been stunning and equity market tops usually consist of overly aggressive individual investor interest in the asset class,” says Mr Levkovich.The pace of companies buying back their own shares now accounts for more than 2 per cent of overall equity volumes in the US and contributed 2.3 per cent to earnings growth for the S&P 500 last year, according to strategists with JPMorgan. That figure, the brokerage says, will probably accelerate this year as a slide in the dollar and oil cut into earnings gains from underlying operations.The returns have made valuations more palatable for the S&P 500 — the index trades at 17.8 times 2015 expected earnings, above its 10-year average — as analysts ready for two quarters of earnings declines. Companies on the US blue-chip index offer a dividend yield of 2 per cent, just above the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury.US multinationals steadily increasing returns to shareholders have in turn found stronger buyer interest. Both the S&P 500 buyback and S&P 500 dividend aristocrats indices have outperformed their namesake over the past 12 months, with the former outpacing the broader blue-chip index by nearly 650 basis points.“With rates expected to remain low, search for yield to continue, and a cautious investor base, shareholder-friendly companies with attractive total yields and strong cash flow generation should benefit from the current market environment,” says Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, a strategist with JPMorgan.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
303;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-04-13T18:19:50Z;Qualcomm plays down activist call to break itself up;Chipmaker promises to look at ways to boost its share price;Qualcomm has signalled it is likely to reject a call for its break-up, adding to Wall Street doubts that there would be a quick resolution to the latest assault by an activist investor on the leading technology company.An early 4 per cent share price rally in Qualcomm on Monday had fizzled by midday, as investors weighed a push by hedge fund Jana Partners that the chipmaker take action to boost shareholder value.Qualcomm indicated it was unlikely to consider a significant corporate restructuring. “Prior reviews have concluded that the synergies provided by our business model create more value for stockholders than could be created through alternative corporate structures,” it said, though it promised to look at ways to boost its share price.Jana, which said it had taken a $2bn stake in the company, had argued that steps the company should consider included separating its chip business from the patent licensing arm that accounts for two-thirds of earnings.In a letter to its investors released on Monday, it added that a break-up would make it easier for Qualcomm to become involved in the spate of mergers and acquisitions in the chip sector, perhaps even involving a deal with rival Intel.Reviews have concluded that the synergies provided by our business model create more value for stockholders than could be created through alternative corporate structuresBut Barry Rosenstein, a founder of Jana, speaking at the Active Passive Investor Summit in New York, stopped short of demanding the company split in two. Instead, he challenged Qualcomm to explain why it would not do so.“We think there are a lot of levers to pull,” he said. “The value attributed to the chip business should not be negative.”Qualcomm has appeased investors with the recent announcement of a $15bn stock buyback, adding to the substantial amounts of cash it has already returned to investors in previous years. Jana applauded the buyback as a “great start”, though it also argued that the cash return should be accelerated.Derek Aberle, Qualcomm’s president, told the Financial Times last month that the company would have acted sooner to return more cash to shareholders if it had not been for the uncertainty caused by an antitrust investigation in China. The investigation was settled two months ago after Qualcomm agreed to reduced royalties for licensing its technology in China and pay a $975m fine.Mr Rosenstein and Steven Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief executive, have met twice since the Jana began building its take last autumn, according to a person familiar with the talks.The activist’s menu of proposals include a new cost cutting programme, changes to management’s compensation scheme to emphasise earnings per share over revenue growth, and the introduction of new board members.Other tech companies that have been under pressure from activists with proposals for break-ups, include security company Symantec, which is currently considering a sale of its Veritas division, and eBay, which announced a spin-off of PayPal after initially rejecting the idea when it was promoted by Carl Icahn.Qualcomm pursued a spin-off of its chip set division soon after the peak of the tech bubble in 2000, but called it off a year later after concluding that it would not do anything to help either of its two businesses perform better.With $11bn in assets under management, Jana is one of the largest and most vigorous activist funds, and Qualcomm is the biggest position it has ever taken.Additional reporting by Leslie Hook
304;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-04-07T13:37:16Z;Patent case could shift power balance in tech industry;Ruling could change the way royalties are set for intellectual property;A US appeals court is set to hear a landmark patent case on Wednesday that could change the way royalty rates are set for commonly used intellectual property in the tech industry.The case, pitting Microsoft against Google, has already involved a lower court in setting patent rates for the first time, in a move that critics warn will upend the balance of power between leading tech companies.Microsoft brought the case in 2010 against Motorola Mobility, the handset maker later acquired by Google. The search company sold Motorola’s operating business to Lenovo last year but kept its patents and has now taken the case to the court of appeals.The dispute centres on so-called standard-essential patents, which cover technology that is included in industry-wide technology standards. Since others have to use the technology if they want their own products to meet an industry standard, the companies that submit their patents for approval by standards bodies are required to license them out on “reasonable and non-discriminatory”, or RAND, terms.Microsoft sued Motorola after the handset maker asked for 2.25 per cent of the final product price for use of several of its patents that are included in standards for WiFi and video compression technology. Microsoft said the demand would have cost it $4bn a year. Judge James Robart, in a federal court in Seattle, laid out a different method for calculating the royalties that would instead cost Microsoft less than $2m a year.If upheld, Judge Robart’s approach could tilt the balance of power in negotiations away from companies that own large portfolios of commonly used patents and instead favour those — like Microsoft or Apple— whose businesses are based more on implementing technology standards in their products.“It’s going to be very significant indeed. Nobody quite understands what the term [RAND] means,” said Alexander Poltorak, chief executive of General Patent Corp, a US intellectual property firm.In its appeal brought in Motorola’s name, Google has argued that the judge was wrong to take up Microsoft’s complaint in the first place, since the Motorola royalty demand was only the opening shot in a negotiation that should have been left to run its course. The court could have ruled on Microsoft’s breach of contract complaint without getting involved in the thorny issue of rate-setting, it claims.The litigation set bad policy by encouraging parties to run to court rather than negotiate“The litigation set bad policy by encouraging parties to run to court rather than negotiate,” said David Balto, a former chief of competition policy at the Federal Trade Commission.Some in the tech industry also argue that, if the ruling stands, companies will not be as willing to allow their technology to be included in industry standards, since it would rob them of much of their negotiating leverage.The calculation method that Judge Robarts came up with “would conceivably apply to lower the reasonable royalty available to every single [standard-essential patent]”, the American Intellectual Property Law Association wrote in an amicus brief to the court.Companies who have joined the opposition to the ruling include Qualcomm, many of whose patents cover mobile communications technologies that have been adopted in industry standards. The calculation method is a “one-sided directive that advances only implementers’ interests in obtaining licences at the lowest possible cost,” it said in a court filing supporting Motorola’s position.
305;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-04-01T07:25:46Z;Chipmaker Qualcomm sets out China designs;US company is on a mission to move past antitrust sanctions;Qualcomm is on a mission to minimise fallout after losing the largest antitrust case in China, a verdict that forced the US chipmaker to cut the royalties it charges and slapped it with a record Rmb6.1bn ($975m) fine.Now the company is at pains to convince Beijing it is indispensable to China — a market that accounted for half of its $26bn in revenues last year — and the global ambitions of national champions such as Xiaomi, the smartphone maker, PC manufacturer Lenovo and Huawei, the telecoms group. Each of these companies is a Qualcomm client.A key concern for Derek Aberle, the company’s president, is that its message is not being heard.“One of the lessons that we learned [as a result of the antitrust case] was that we probably weren’t engaging as much as we should’ve been,” he told the Financial Times at the Boao Economic Forum on China’s Hainan island.So it is perhaps unsurprising that Mr Aberle made his first trip to Boao, China’s answer to the World Economic Forum at Davos and a favoured destination among foreign companies eager to curry favour with Beijing, this year. Qualcomm was a sponsor of the event for the first time, too.The company has also broken ground on a new semiconductor plant in Fujian province, adding to one opened last year, as part of efforts to help China develop its own semiconductor industry.Such moves are all part of Qualcomm’s efforts to get back to business as usual after the February ruling by the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s competition regulator, declared that the company had abused its dominant market position and overcharged for its patents.We probably weren’t engaging [with China] as much as we should’ve been“We are disappointed with certain aspects of the ultimate result. I wouldn’t really comment on the process itself,” says Mr Aberle.One of the first things on Qualcomm’s agenda is to begin collecting royalties in the country again, after a number of manufacturers delayed paying amid the uncertainty generated by the case. The chipmaker has told analysts that some 200m phones in China this year are “missing from compliance”, with royalties worth hundreds of millions of dollars yet to be agreed and paid.“Now the investigation is behind us I think we’re in an environment to do things we otherwise would’ve been doing — enforcing our agreements and driving compliance,” says Mr Aberle.He is also keen to prevent a domino-effect response from other foreign regulators in the wake of the NDRC case, after it emerged last month that South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission is also investigating Qualcomm over claims that it abused its dominant market position in wireless chips.“It wasn’t particularly surprising to us that [the KFTC] and potentially other competition authorities might want to ask questions and look into what happened in China, just given how high-profile the investigation was,” says Mr Aberle. “So we’re in that stage of engaging with them on what their questions are.”Analysts say the high royalties Qualcomm charges for its 3G CDMA and 4G LTE technology — the most expensive in the industry, at up to 5 per cent of the wholesale price of a handset — make the company a target.Stacy Rasgon, semiconductor industry analyst at Sanford Bernstein, says Qualcomm can command such high royalties due to a “good technology position and good lawyers, and the fact that they were able to put these agreements in place 20 years ago”.“It is unlikely that they could replicate this business model today,” he adds.Duncan Clark, head of BDA, a Beijing-based telecoms consultancy, says: “There was always the danger that China would leverage the size of its market to crack open Qualcomm’s [intellectual property] armour.”The company’s opponents insist it got off lightly. “They were not hurt badly by the ruling,” says Wang Yanhui, the head of the Mobile Phone China Alliance, an industry lobbying group among those that filed complaints to the NDRC. Changes to Qualcomm’s business model were “quite minor”, he adds, and the fine a mere dent to the chipmaker’s $30bn cash pile.Meanwhile, the proportion of revenue Qualcomm makes in China is likely to grow. One new source is China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, which is switching to a wireless standard based on Qualcomm technology.China Mobile added more than 100m of the new 4G LTE devices last year and plans to add more than 200m in 2015.But there are also opportunities for Qualcomm beyond China’s borders. As Xiaomi, Lenovo and Huawei broaden their reach internationally, Qualcomm’s patents could protect them from lawsuits outside their favourable home market. When Xiaomi was sued in India by Ericsson last year, for instance, the lawsuit excluded phones using chipsets from Qualcomm, which has a licence to use the Swedish company’s patents.“That’ll be a big focus of ours — helping Chinese [manufacturers] build their export business,” Mr Aberle says.The risks of over-reliance on China are obvious. US tech companies have faced a series of setbacks in the past year. Microsoft was hit by a similar anti-monopoly case, while a pending government cyber security law may eventually require foreign IT companies to install back doors in their hardware.Nevertheless, Mr Aberle is upbeat: “For us, now that the investigation is behind us, we’re in a position to expand co-operation”.Qualcomm is realising that the best strategy is not to get in the way of China’s rise, but to tag along and be as useful as possible.“The irony now is, of course, that hurting Qualcomm too much means hurting national champions,” says BDA’s Mr Clark.
306;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-03-27T16:40:04Z;Silicon Valley: Space race;Tech companies are sending their cash into orbit;"When they are feeling flush, tech companies are overcome by the urge to put stuff up into space. During the late 90s, companies such as Teledesic, Iridium and GlobalStar had big plans for low-earth orbiting satellites (which are cheaper than the traditional geostationary ones). Of these three, the first is no longer operating and the other two have spent time in bankruptcy. Space is a brutal place.This sad history has not dented the enthusiasm of today’s tech giants. There are four heavy-hitting groups building low-earth orbit devices that will broadcast data to earth. Facebook has solar-powered drones beaming data through laser signals. Google’s fittingly named Project Loon is a fleet of weather balloons that will ride the stratospheric winds and send out LTE cellular signals. Qualcomm and Virgin Group recently backed OneWeb, a network of more than 600 low-orbit, low-cost satellites. And SpaceX, Elon Musk’s satellite launching firm, is planning its own low-orbit satellite constellation, costing about $10bn. Google has invested $900m in SpaceX.This is Silicon Valley, so the projects are touted as helping humanity — particularly the half of the species lacking an internet connection. But they also create new customers. Facebook and Google will have more eyeballs to which to sell ads; Qualcomm can sell more hardware; and SpaceX will handle more launches. Today’s space race also reflects that costs to get into space have fallen dramatically. Launches and equipment are cheaper, and telecom technology is vastly improved.It may seem nifty when companies awash with cash (Google has $63bn lying around; Facebook, $11bn; Qualcomm, $18bn) decide to invest in infrastructure. But there is only room in the sky for so many constellations. When the markets come back down to earth, spending billions on satellites (or drones, or balloons) will no longer look so starry.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
307;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-03-18T14:47:48Z;Qualcomm: cashing in its chips;Smartphone chipmaker has an unhappy history with buybacks;The first commandment of the New Reform Church of Corporate Finance: thou shalt give cash to investors. Qualcomm has found religion. The company, which designs and makes smartphone chips, has committed to spending the equivalent of a fifth of its market cap on dividends and buybacks in the next two years.Buybacks alone are targeted at $15bn and the company vows to return 75 per cent of free cash flow to shareholders in the long term.Before shouting Amen, recall that Qualcomm has an unhappy history with buybacks. It has spent $15bn on gross share repurchases in the past five years. This has not been enough to lower the share count. Stock options and grants of restricted stock units have mopped up much of the buyback. There is more to come. The company had 28m RSUs outstanding and 41m stock options exercisable at the end of the past fiscal year (September 2014). Lumped together, that is 4 per cent of shares outstanding.Still, UBS thinks Qualcomm’s programme may cut the share count by 8 per cent by fiscal 2016. Very nice, but buybacks do not resolve the concerns that have pressed the valuation of the stock (at 14 times forward earnings) below historical averages. Contract enforcement in China, where under-reporting of the use of Qualcomm’s intellectual property has been problematic, remains a worry. Then there is the fact that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor did not make it into Samsung’s new S6 phone.Qualcomm has targeted sales growth in the high single-digits in the medium term, boosted by the adoption of 4G technology (in which the company specialises) in China, among other things. But this year’s sales will grow in the low single-digits. Sending cash out the door will not help the company hit its goals. Only investment can do that.The best reason to own Qualcomm is that it is one of the purest ways to bet on high-end smartphones. If it cannot grow with that market, buybacks are not going to answer investors’ prayers.Email the Lex team atlex@ft.com
308;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-03-10T09:23:29Z;Buybacks sustain US bull run;Apple alone bought $45bn of its own stock last year;The fatigued US bull-run has one piston that continues to fire.S&P 500 companies spent more than $900bn on share buybacks and dividends over the past 12 months, more than twice the level recorded five years ago as the US began to emerge from the financial crisis, and a key driver in the stock market’s ageing six-year rally.The consistent buying by US corporates, often prompted by shareholder activism, has supported the stock market rally into 2015, offsetting wide selling by investors who see more opportunity in European equities. Investors have pulled roughly $28.5bn from mutual funds and exchange traded funds invested in the S&P 500 since the year began, data from fund tracker Lipper shows.Flush with cash, US multinationals spent $553.2bn on buybacks and $350.4bn on dividends in 2014, choosing shareholder returns over investment in research and development and capital expenditures given the bumpy global economic backdrop, according to preliminary data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.“Cash in the fourth quarter set another all-time record in the index,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It’s what they chose to do. In this case [companies] are being pushed by outside people to give back more. It does not mean they are being generous at all.”The practice, while appeasing shareholders, has been cause for criticism as analysts wait for a meaningful rise in sales — the missing link in the current recovery. S&P 500 corporates are not expected to move the needle this year, with bottom-up consensus forecasts projecting a meagre increase in revenues, largely the result of a slump in oil prices.Investors expect cash to continue to funnel to buybacks and dividends. Despite the record levels of returns, dividend payouts stood at 38 per cent of earnings last year — below historic levels, Mr Silverblatt noted.Orrin Sharp-Pierson, a strategist at BNP Paribas, added that buybacks have been “very important” to the S&P 500’s gains and that slower earnings growth “will generally not impact the flow”.He added: “The ‘stock effect’ is that companies have bought back around 20 per cent of market capitalisation since Lehman’s collapse, or around $3.8tn using today’s equity prices.“Compare that to the $4.5tn Fed balance sheet or a very similar expansion of $3.5tn.”Apple has become the exemplar for share buybacks, purchasing $45bn-worth of its stock last year, more than the combined value of shares bought by ExxonMobil, Intel, IBM and Wells Fargo, the SPDJI data show. Analysts on Wall Street expect the iPhone maker to increase its programme this April, with those at Credit Suisse forecasting $165bn-worth of buybacks to be completed over the next two and a half years.The Cupertino-based group is not alone, as companies increase buyback schemes to negate expiring employee options. On Monday, Qualcomm lifted its buyback authorisation to $15bn and the management team said they intended to complete two-thirds of the purchases within the next 12 months. Home Depot, Gilead Sciences and PepsiCo have also authorised $10bn plus buybacks since the year began.Two-thirds of companies in the S&P 500 have reduced their share count in the past year, including more than a fifth who have done so by more than 4 per cent. Those reductions signal capital discipline, investors say, particularly amid the frenetic pace of dealmaking at the start of the year.“Once you use cash to buy back stock, it can’t be used to overpay for an acquisition or invest in an underperforming division,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said. “That’s a constructive message to shareholders in what remains a very sluggish global growth environment.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
309;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm faces South Korea antitrust probe;Smartphone industry may see knock-on effect from $977m settlement in China;"South Korean competition authorities are investigating Qualcomm in the wake of the US chip designer’s record Rmb6.1bn ($977m) settlement in China over claims it abused its dominant market position in wireless chips.South Korea’s three smartphone producers – Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Pantech – rely heavily on Qualcomm’s semiconductors to provide their higher-end handsets with processing power and fast data connections on 3G and 4G networks.But the smartphone makers have been unhappy with the level of the royalties they have had to pay to Qualcomm, and voiced these concerns to South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, according to a person with knowledge of the complaints. The FTC has now launched a probe into Qualcomm, another person familiar with the situation said on Thursday.News of the investigation will bolster suggestions that Qualcomm’s settlement with China’s National Development and Reform Commission this week could have ramifications elsewhere.Monday’s deal, as well as being the biggest fine levied by the NDRC, obliges Qualcomm to reduce the royalties that Chinese handset makers pay by more than a third. The manufacturer of a 4G-capable smartphone, for example, will now pay Qualcomm no more than 2.28 per cent of the handset’s wholesale price, down from the 3.5 per cent rate Qualcomm previously demanded.Shares in Qualcomm have risen 6 per cent this week as investors have welcomed the greater clarity on the outlook for its business in China, which accounts for about half the company’s revenue. But the settlement could strengthen the hand of device makers in South Korea and elsewhere who argue the higher rates that they continue to pay are excessive.South Korea’s antitrust agency has taken action against Qualcomm before, fining the company more than $200m in 2009 for abusing its dominant market position.Mid-sized smartphone manufacturers such as LG Electronics “don’t have much other choice” than to use Qualcomm chipsets in their high-end devices, said Peter Yu, an analyst at BNP Paribas. He noted that competition in the wireless modem market had been damaged by the exit of once important players such as Sweden’s ST Ericsson, which said it would stop making the chips last year.Qualcomm has made the most of its leadership in modems – needed to connect to mobile data networks – by “bundling” them with its mobile application processors in a single product, said Mark Newman, an analyst at Bernstein. This has boosted Qualcomm’s market share in processors, which function as the “brain” of mobile devices.Yet Qualcomm appears to have lost business in this vital segment from Samsung, by far South Korea’s biggest smartphone producer. Samsung has its own logic chip business, but last year it sourced most of the processors in its high-end chips from Qualcomm after the US company pulled ahead in technology, according to Mr Yu.Settlement with Chinese regulators is the thin end of the wedge
Read moreHowever, analysts believe that Samsung’s new flagship Galaxy S6 phone, expected to be revealed on March 1, will use only Samsung processors, after reported overheating problems with Qualcomm’s newest processor design. The device is still likely to include a stand-alone Qualcomm modem, in an unusual deviation from the US company’s “bundling” policy, Mr Newman said.As in its dealings with Apple, Samsung’s relations with Qualcomm are complicated by the fact that it also counts the US chipmaker as a customer. Qualcomm designs but does not manufacture its chips, instead outsourcing that work to foundries."

Analysts expect that this will allow the company to repurpose capital that would have been invested in the business to buy back shares.“The spin-off of the Vacation Ownership business has long been on the cards, but we still expect today’s news to be taken well by the market,” said Ian Rennardson, an analyst at Jefferies.The announcement accompanied better than expected fourth-quarter earnings. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company reported profits of $245m, or $1.40 a share, on sales of $1.49bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 76 cents a share, on sales of $1.52bn.With the earnings beat and news of the spin-off investors overlooked guidance that missed Wall Street estimates. Starwood now expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.87-$2.97 a share, short of forecasts for $3.13 a share, and first-quarter earnings outlook in the range of 53-57 cents a share, below forecasts for 63 cents a share.Analysts added that Starwood’s $609m in share buybacks in the fourth quarter, also helped reverse the recent slide in the stock price. Starwood Hotels’ shares climbed 7 per cent to $75.89.Qualcomm agreed to pay $975m to resolve allegations by Chinese authorities that it had violated the nation’s anti-monopoly law, pushing shares of the US chipmaker higher on Tuesday.The company said it would “implement a rectification plan” that would modify some of its business practices in China to satisfy requirements from the NDRC’s order. It also agreed to new licensing terms as part of the settlement.“We believe the settlement removes a key overhang for the stock,” said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The San Diego, California-based company raised the lower end of its 2015 sales and earnings guidance. Qualcomm shares, which have declined nearly 6 per cent in the past year, gained 5 per cent to $70.24.Shares of Urban Outfitters gained more than 2 per cent to $37.25, after the company which owns the Anthropologie and Free People brands, said same-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 6 per cent across the company’s labels. The Philadelphia-based company said comparable sales climbed 18 per cent at Free People and 4 per cent at its eponymous brand.Aéropostale shares popped after the teen retailer said it was poised to report a fourth-quarter loss of between 1 and 6 cents a share, narrower than its earlier guidance for a loss of 31 cents per share. The updated guidance came alongside changes to the company’s executive team.Coca-Cola shares advanced 3 per cent to $42.40, after the beverage maker reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street expectations.US stocks rallied on unconfirmed reports that Greece was nearing a deal with international creditors over its debts.The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 per cent to 2,068.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 per cent to 17,868.63.

311;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-02-10T17:09:41Z;Qualcomm chipped but not broken;Record $975m fine in China antitrust case but ‘our business and licensing model is intact’;"China’s biggest antitrust case landed Qualcomm with a record RMB6.1bn ($977m) fine and forced the US chipmaker to sharply lower the royalties it charges Chinese companies, but the outcome could have been much worse.“We’ve obviously had to make changes to some practices,” said Derek Aberle, president of Qualcomm, which earns half of its revenues in China. “But the result is that our business model and licensing model is intact, and actually more certain than it was before the investigation.”Investors seemed to agree. The US group’s share price rose more than 2 per cent in early morning trading on Tuesday on news that the 15-month government investigation had been resolved.China’s National Development and Reform Commission had accused Qualcomm in November 2013 of abusing its dominant market position in the country and unfair licensing practices. Analysts said the company accounted for about 60 per cent of the market in mobile phone chipsets and charged the highest royalty rate in the smartphone industry — up to 5 per cent of the wholesale price of a handset.The case came to symbolise the new barriers faced by US technology companies in China following revelations by Edward Snowden, the contractor for the US National Security Agency who lifted the lid on the complicity of many western technology companies in surveillance.Qualcomm said the NDRC judgment had already been priced in to its share price by most analysts.According to the terms agreed between Qualcomm and the NDRC, the headline royalty rates of 5 per cent for 3G devices and 3.5 per cent for 4G devices remain roughly unchanged. However, the royalty base on which they are charged fell from 100 per cent of the net sale price to 65 per cent.“Basically, we ended up with an agreement covering a subset of our Chinese patents and sales for use in China,” Mr Aberle said.Some believed the investigation into Qualcomm was inspired by anti-Americanism, but Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s anti-monopoly and pricing department, told the China News Agency on Tuesday that it was prompted by complaints from two unnamed US companies. The NDRC could not be reached for comment.Microsoft was charged with an anti-monopoly investigation similar to Qualcomm’s last year, and there have been reports in Chinese media that state officials have been trying to ban the use of IBM, Apple and Cisco by government agencies.But some analysts questioned what this meant for Qualcomm’s long-term prospects.“What bothers me is that they’re now explicitly taking a royalty on something that is lower than the wholesale price of the phone,” said Stacy Rasgon, semiconductor analyst for Sanford Bernstein. He said that this change might prompt demands for similar treatment by other Qualcomm customers.“It’s like opening Pandora’s box. If 65 per cent is right for China, what’s to stop that from being right everywhere?” he said.Chinese smartphone makers expressed disappointment that the NDRC’s decision did not force greater changes to Qualcomm’s licensing procedures.“The fine will hardly make a dent in Qualcomm’s profits; no groundbreaking changes have been made,” said Wang Yanhui, head of the Mobile Phone China Alliance, an industry lobbying organisation. “Some people might be disappointed as there is a disparity between the actual ruling and the public’s expectations.”Qualcomm said other countries’ regulators did not attempt to influence pricing, and rejected the idea that it would put pressure on its royalty agreements elsewhere.The resolution has also removed a roadblock to normal collection of royalties from Chinese manufacturers. Many smartphone makers had been delaying payment until the investigation was resolved.“Qualcomm has not taken the initiative to collect and the manufacturers have not taken the initiative to pay,” said Mr Wang.Cross-licensing changesAs part of its deal with the NDRC, Qualcomm also agreed to change the way it handled cross licensing, whereby customers surrendered their patents to the chipmaker in exchange for its technology.This has penalised Chinese smartphone makers with large patent portfolios such as telecoms equipment group Huawei and benefited those with fewer patents, such as Xiaomi, the four-year-old smartphone maker.Mr Aberle said Qualcomm had agreed to provide “fair value” in cross-licensing deals — allowing companies with larger patent portfolios to offset those against Qualcomm’s charges.“Cross licensing is part of the agreement and we’ve agreed to negotiate and provide fair value, though we believe we have done that historically. That was one of the issues that was raised by the NDRC,” he said.The NDRC said in its decision that cross-licensing deals were no longer required by Qualcomm.Lawyers said this could potentially change the competitive landscape.“For Chinese companies that own a lot of patents, like Huawei and ZTE, it is really good news, because they can now charge competitors like Xiaomi, Meizu and Oppo royalties,” said You Yunting, a property rights lawyer at Shanghai Debund. “For these companies without many patents, it means that the protection bubble has popped.”The NDRC’s decision is the latest investigation into Qualcomm. In 2009, South Korea’s antitrust agency fined it $208m for abusing its dominant position.The company also faced an antitrust investigation in Japan and a five-year investigation in the EU, although this was subsequently dropped. Two antitrust cases are ongoing, in the US and Europe respectively."
312;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm: Pyrrhic victory;Settlement with Chinese regulators is the thin end of the wedge;"Qualcomm is in the enviable position of owning intellectual property used in, effectively, every mobile phone. That envy may soon make itself felt anew.On Tuesday, the company — which makes chips for phones, too — settled its pricing dispute with Chinese regulators after more than a year of haggling. It will pay a fine of $975m, and has agreed to new royalty rates for its patents in China. Phonemakers using its 3G technology will pay 5 per cent; those using 4G will pay 3.5 per cent. This looks rosy. The fine is modest next to the company’s $30bn cash pile, and the royalties are in line with estimates of the company’s average rates, at something over 3 per cent. After market, the stock bounced 3 per cent.Consider the fine print, though. Elsewhere in the world, Qualcomm customers pay licensing levies on 100 per cent of the net selling price of a handset. In China, they will pay it on 65 per cent, cutting the realised fee to 2.28 per cent for its 4G technology.This sets a worrying precedent. Qualcomm insists that there will be no spillover into its other markets. It says that regulators in the US and the EU, where it is under investigation for monopolistic practices, do not interfere with pricing. Maybe so, but customers worldwide will question why they are paying more than those in China.Qualcomm’s revenues are under pressure already. Phone prices are falling. International Data Corporation thinks average handset prices will fall from $297 in 2014 to $241 by 2018. Competition, on the other hand, is rising. Also on Tuesday, Taiwanese semiconductor designer MediaTek disclosed rising costs, including spending on research for its next generation of chips. Qualcomm has said that a large customer has decided not to use its next-generation chips, favouring an in-house alternative.Qualcomm’s settlement could resolve royalty collection issues in China, providing a near-term fillip.

313;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm in $975m record China fine;US chipmaker faced allegations that it violated anti-monopoly law;Qualcomm on Monday agreed to pay a record $975m fine to settle allegations by Chinese authorities that it violated the country’s anti-monopoly law, ending a two-year patents fight and helping send its shares up 3 per cent in after-market trading.The deal allowed the US chipmaker to raise its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2015 to at least $26.3bn, up from $26bn, partly because it will make it easier to collect royalties from some Chinese manufacturers that had been underreporting their use of Qualcomm patents.Under the terms Qualcomm will cut the amount it charges Chinese manufacturers to license some of its patented technologies.Analysts said the settlement with China’s National Development and Reform Commission was not as harsh as it could have been. Qualcomm depends heavily on revenue from licensing its patents and counts China as a key market given the number of fast-growing Chinese electronics manufacturers.“It was expected that it [the settlement] was not going to be good,” said Daniel Matte, an analyst with research group Canalys.The Qualcomm patents at the heart of the case, which address how phones connect to 3G and 4G networks, will now cost less to license in China than in other markets, though the discount will cover phones to be sold in China and not made for export.The case highlights the increasing problems that foreign companies, particular tech groups, have been having in China. Officials have been encouraging state companies and government agencies to buy locally made goods, often citing concerns about cyber security and the possibility of foreign intelligence agencies gathering data from US and European-made devices.Qualcomm, whose chips are found in most of the world’s smartphones, said the fine would cut 58 cents from its earnings per share for fiscal year 2015, reducing a forecast $4.04 to $4.34, to $3.56 to $3.76.The settlement comes after Qualcomm took the unusual decision to fight back against the NDRC’s proposed fine.Derek Aberle, Qualcomm president, said that because the Chinese government had sanctioned the royalty rate the company was charging, it would be easier to stop companies underreporting or failing to report their use of Qualcomm’s patented technology.Qualcomm has had a difficult start to 2015. It said late last month that its top-of-the-line Snapdragon chip was not expected to be used by a major customer in its new flagship device, a reference to Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S6 phone.In spite of that, said Mr Matte, the sophistication of its technology still positioned it to outrun its competition. “They’re still going to maintain the quality advantage,” he said.

Several brokerages cut their price target on the stock.Qualcomm reported a 5 per cent rise in profits to $1.97bn or $1.17 a share and a 7 per cent gain in sales to $7.1bn, ahead of estimates.Shares of Qualcomm, which have declined nearly 11 per cent in the past year, lagged behind the US benchmark falling 10.3 per cent to $63.69.Royal Caribbean Cruises reported profits of $109.8m or 49 cents a share in the three months to December 31, as sales slipped 2 per cent to $1.82bn. Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 37 cents a share, on sales of $1.87bn.The Miami, Florida-based company’s first-quarter outlook for adjusted earnings in the range of 10-15 cents a share, missed analyst estimates. Full-year earnings guidance of $4.65-$4.85 a share also fell short of Wall Street estimates for $4.89 a share.While shares of Royal Caribbean slipped 5.5 per cent to $77.29, Steven Wieczynski, analyst at Stifel said: “Although management’s guidance is likely to be viewed negatively, we would remind investors it still implies EPS growth of 40 per cent on top of 2014’s 40 per cent growth rate.”Shares of Colgate-Palmolive gained 6 per cent to $69.03, after the maker of consumer products reported an 11 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits to $628m from the same period a year ago, though the figure missed analysts estimates. Adjusted earnings of 76 cents a share, however, topped expectations.While the company said sales were affected by a strong dollar and declined 3 per cent from the same time last year, organic sales, which exclude foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments, gained 6 per cent in the three months to December 31.Alibaba shares fell nearly 9 per cent to $89.81, after the ecommerce company’s third-quarter revenues missed forecasts, even as adjusted earnings topped estimates.Stocks staged a late rally to finish the session higher, as the price of US oil rebounded from a near six-year low.The S&P 500 rose 1.0 per cent to 2,021.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,416.85, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.0 per cent to 4,683.41.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Biogen will draw on Google’s powers of data analysis as well as sensor technology to monitor patients with the disease.The project adds to Google’s existing partnership with Novartis to develop a “smart” contact lens that measures glucose levels in the tear fluid of diabetics.Google has also set up a biotech company called Calico that is researching age-related diseases together with AbbVie, the US pharmaceuticals group.The deals highlight the growing potential to use digital technology to monitor human health. This is causing a proliferation of clinical data that can be used to help prevent and manage diseases — both at an individual patient level and across wider populations.Consumer electronics manufacturers are going clinicalHealthcare has been slower than other industries to feel the full force of digital disruption. But Steven Wardell, analyst at Leerink, the healthcare-focused investment bank, said this was starting to change. “The same digital revolution that re-ordered the media sector has now arrived at the healthcare sector.”Health companies and governments hope that technology can help to improve patient outcomes while at the same time reining in the rising cost of caring for an ageing population.Roche said its collaboration with Qualcomm announced on Thursday would allow “relevant health information between chronic disease patients and their care team” to be exchanged and therefore “enable reduced therapy complications and total cost of care”.Jeremy Moss, of Roche’s professional diagnostics division, said the deal would “enable healthcare professionals to stay in touch remotely with patients, whenever and wherever they are”.Consumer technology companies such as Samsung and Apple are also showing increasing interest in healthcare as a widening range of wearable devices are developed to help people monitor everything from blood pressure and heart rate to brain activity and stress.“Consumer electronics manufacturers are going clinical,” said Mr Wardell.
316;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-01-28T22:57:02Z;Chipmaker Qualcomm hit by Apple surge;Company cuts outlook as sales of other smartphone makers are dented;Qualcomm on Wednesday cut its outlook for the year, as the rise of Apple’s iPhone dents sales of leading smartphone makers that the chipmaker counts as its key customers, notably Samsung.Its shares were off nearly 7 per cent in after-market trading as the company forecast fiscal year 2015 sales of $26bn-$28bn, a decrease from its previous forecast of up to $28.8bn in sales.In a further setback, Qualcomm said that its top-of-the-line Snapdragon chip was not expected to be included in “a large customer’s flagship device” — a reference to Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S6 phone. Samsung is reportedly using a chip it made itself for that model.Qualcomm’s Snapdragon line is used by companies including Samsung, but not Apple.Apple on Tuesday reported its strongest quarter ever with sales of 74.5m iPhones. That global growth is coming at the expense of companies including Samsung, whose flagship Galaxy S5 has received middling reviews since its launch last April.“A shift in share . . . at the premium tier . . . has reduced our near-term opportunity for sales of our integrated Snapdragon processors,” Qualcomm said.It is also still dealing with the overhang of an antitrust investigation by China’s National Development and Reform Commission. Analysts say resolution of the probe could lead to Qualcomm lowering its prices in China.Qualcomm claims some companies in the country are not fully reporting sales involving Qualcomm devices, or are seeking to delay agreeing new licences while the investigation continues.China is also becoming a more competitive market. Xiaomi, the fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker, recently took a stake in chip company Leadcore Technologies that competes with Qualcomm on supplying cheap chips for 4G smartphones, say analysts with Barclays.Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue of $7.1bn, up 7 per cent year on year and towards the high end of its guidance. Diluted earnings per share were $1.34, up 6 per cent and above expectations of $1.25 per share.
317;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-01-25T20:48:41Z;China: Monopoly position;Architect of Beijing’s antitrust laws says they are being used in a turf war between regulators;"When US chipmaker Qualcomm was threatened with a fine of $1bn for violating China’s antitrust law in 2013, it took a novel approach: it decided to defend itself. This was considered an unusual move in a country where foreign companies often simply fold in the face of the Beijing bureaucracy.“Most just want to pay the fines and move on,” says a Beijing-based lawyer. “Technically they could appeal but, hey, why make things worse for yourself?”A year later, it is unclear whether the strategy has been a success. With a decision imminent, the closed door proceedings have been the subject of international diplomacy and veiled threats. At one stage the case briefly entered the public arena with state media attacking the company’s star expert. But much is at stake: the case has the potential to reshape the global smartphone patent system.Qualcomm is being investigated by the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s powerful state central planning body, with a fearsome reputation and a win rate “which if it is not 100 per cent, it’s pretty close,” says another lawyer.It is a case Qualcomm cannot afford to lose . The possible fine — up to 10 per cent of its China-sourced revenues — would be onerous but the real risk is that Beijing could force Qualcomm to charge less for its 3G and 4G smartphone patents, at present the most expensive in the industry, potentially opening up the chipmaker to similar demands in other markets.“That would be devastating for their business model,” says Stacy Rasgon, senior semiconductor analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Los Angeles.The Qualcomm case comes after several US tech companies have fallen foul of the Chinese authorities and amid a growing sense among foreign companies that they are being treated unfairly.Officials in Beijing have been counselling, cajoling and sometimes banning state companies and government agencies from buying US high-tech goods from the likes of Apple and IBM. In July Microsoft had its offices raided by a second anti-monopoly regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. In the past two years the NDRC has also been involved in high-profile price-fixing cases against overseas companies in sectors ranging from baby formula manufacturers, including Danone and Fonterra, to the car industry.The inside manIn February 2014 Xu Kunlin, the then head of the NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau, publicly accused the company of being a “patent troll”, adding that “such companies receive profits through discriminatory pricing or high royalty fees”. Facing a full-blown crisis, Qualcomm executed an aggressive defence strategy which included hiring Zhang Xinzhu, the economist who drafted China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law, in an effort to prove the company had not violated it.Mr Zhang is reputed to be the best — and at $800 an hour, he concedes, the most expensive — legal consultant in the business of antitrust law violations in China. An economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, he earned a PhD at the University of Toulouse under Jean Tirole, who won the 2014 Nobel Prize for his work on regulation. On his return to China in the late 1990s, Mr Zhang drafted or helped draft many of the rules that now govern China’s market driven economy — from antitrust to electricity market reform.He was also a member of an elite commission advising the government on antitrust policy, a position that sat slightly at odds with a lucrative sideline as a consultant to private companies accused of violating it.One foreign lawyer in Beijing says Qualcomm’s decision to hire Mr Zhang was a “risky confrontational approach”, particularly because he had a history of antagonising Beijing. He has previously criticised the government for inconsistently applying the laws he helped draft.The NDRC had already taken umbrage at a particularly wounding 2011 Zhang critique of its methods. So when Mr Zhang and two American co-authors submitted a paper arguing Qualcomm’s defence in August, he was immediately accused of having a conflict of interest — “eating from the east and lodging in the west”.An editorial on Xinhua, the official news agency, said: “More often than not, the ‘Zhang Xinzhus’ in our society will pose a direct threat to national security.” He was stripped of his position as an adviser to the government.“According to the discipline of [the] State Council consulting boards, he had severely breached the rules and, on the most basic level, this was inappropriate,” Mr Xu said in September.Mr Zhang says his family has suffered unspecified “consequences”, but he agreed to speak to the Financial Times to set the record straight.“Most of my friends say this is not a good idea and I should keep quiet,” he says, sitting in a Starbucks café near his home in Beijing. “[But] I had no conflict of interest as I only worked for Qualcomm,” he says. He adds that his duties on the committee did not involve advising the NDRC on cases and that all members of the committee work as private consultants, which one other member confirmed.Qualcomm has denied any direct financial connection with Mr Zhang, who was hired by Global Economics, a Chicago-based consultancy.“Hiring economists to provide such economic analysis to antitrust authorities is routine practice in government investigations in China and around the world,” said Qualcomm at the time.Mr Zhang believes he was dismissed for his criticism of the government.Frankenstein momentInstead he has seen his creation become a weapon in bureaucratic turf wars. “These agencies have misunderstood these reforms on purpose, as an excuse to increase rather than decrease regulation,” says Mr Zhang.The US Chamber of Commerce in Beijing argues that rather than letting the free market function, this has only reinforced the state sector. “China seeks to strengthen such [state] companies through the anti-monopoly law and, in apparent disregard of the AML, encourages them to consolidate market power, though this is contrary to the normal purpose of competition law,” it said in a report last year.Mr Zhang now regards his anti-monopoly law with the same mix of paternal admiration and nervous anxiety that Dr Frankenstein likely had for his creation after it turned on him. “Ten to 15 years ago the government wanted to do real experiments,” he says. Today, he argues, they have taken an elaborately constructed system of checks and balances and converted it into an administrative cudgel designed to ensure a desired result.“People are scared to put up a serious defence. Qualcomm is the first company to do this and that is what made them [the NDRC] so annoyed,” he adds.The NDRC rejects criticism that it is biased, arguing it is too busy to organise a conspiracy against foreign companies and only investigates when there are “well-grounded complaints”.Mr Zhang says he does not believe the NDRC is “inherently biased” against foreign companies or that it is driven by nationalism. Instead he believes the investigations were inspired by the growing competition between Chinese companies and foreign rivals.The uptick in cases seems to support that view. The US-China Business Council calculated last year that while the NDRC launched 20 pricing investigations between 2008 and 2012, it undertook 80 in 2013 alone. And, according to publicly available data, foreign companies or their joint ventures have paid 76 per cent of the more than Rmb3bn ($480m) in anti-monopoly penalties handed down by the NDRC since 2011.The agency vigorously defends itself from charges that it misuses confidential information or that it uses intimidation, though the treatment of Mr Zhang appears to contradict that. Companies say they have routinely been told not to bring foreign lawyers to meetings and have been pressured to confess violations or face more severe sanctions.“This is rule by peoplerather than rule by law,” says Mr Zhang, adding that as a result of its own missteps, “antitrust law in China is now on trial as well.”The NDRC calls accusations of intimidation a “distortion” and “an insult to our department”.A Chinese government official speaking on condition of anonymity says: “When enforcing the law, naturally we do not plaster fake smiles on our faces, we may be more serious. It could just be that we appeared very severe or serious when we said that they must be aware of the legal consequences.“We have an obligation to warn them [companies] of what consequences they will have to bear if they don’t provide truthful evidence, we have a duty to remind them of possible liabilities, it’s not intimidation,” he adds.Qualcomm declined to answer questions about the case, citing the continuing legal proceedings. “We will continue to co-operate with the NDRC,” it says.The NDRC, however, is not the first regulator to take a close look at Qualcomm. In 2009, South Korea’s antitrust agency fined it $208m for abusing its dominant position. The company has also faced an antitrust investigation in Japan and a five-year probe in the EU although this was dropped. It faces two new antitrust cases, one in the US and a second in Europe.Qualcomm’s high royalties — according to Mr Rasgon the result of “a good technology position and good lawyers” — have hit Chinese smartphone makers just as their margins are under pressure from a maturing industry.Wang Yanhui, head of the Mobile Phone China Alliance, an industry lobby group, says his organisation filed a complaint to the NDRC alleging several questionable practices — apparently the trigger for the Qualcomm probe.A lot to loseHe argues that US smartphone companies are treated differently by Qualcomm than Chinese counterparts. Apple for instance, he says, does not pay royalties directly to Qualcomm; instead the chipmaker is paid by Apple’s China-based manufacturers, such as Foxconn, and charged against the price of raw materials and manufacturing costs rather than the wholesale price of the phone, resulting in a lower overall cost.Another complaint surrounds a practice known as cross licensing, where Qualcomm’s customers must surrender their patents to the chipmaker in exchange for its technology. Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment group, has publicly labelled this practice “unfair”.Qualcomm says it does not comment on relationships with specific companies but You Yunting, a property rights lawyer at Shanghai Debund Law Offices, says that proving violation of monopoly law is complicated.“Monopolistic behaviour is the abuse of a dominant market position. The antitrust law does not apply unless the government finds evidence that Qualcomm raised royalties for clients who buy from its competitors or used its large number of standard patents to force unreasonable agreements,” says Mr You.“Even if the fine was $2bn, it could pay that,” says Mr Rasgon. “Qualcomm has deep pockets. But the worry is that China could force changes in its business model, and the bigger the change, the harder it is going to be to keep it confined to China. Other manufacturers are going to be saying: ‘These guys are paying that and I want to pay that too’.”For all the legal intrigues, events may have intervened. Since the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing in November, when Barack Obama, US president, met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, lawyers say they have detected a new attitude at the NDRC. “No one is being told to come to meetings and not to bring their lawyers,” says one lawyer. “I think the voice of the US government has been heard.”Mr Zhang says he has no regrets about taking on the case. The problem with Chinese government officials, he says, is that they “have two incentives: to do nothing or to do too much”. Lately, he says, they have been doing too much.Additional reporting by Ma Fangjing***Regulators battle for the top spot
When China’s economy was dominated by five-year plans, the NDRC, China’s central planning agency, was an all-powerful state within a state.Today, while functions have been steadily whittled down “the NDRC is still perceived to be like a little cabinet of ministers”, says Jörg Wuttke, head of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. “Although it is not as dominating as it once was, it still retains control over the prices for everything from oil to parking tickets.”Still trading on its old reputation, the NDRC is also exercising what one European businessman in Beijing calls “bureaucratic entrepreneurship”, or a knack for finding new ways to stay relevant. One of these new missions is enforcing anti-monopoly policy. Because of its experience setting prices under socialism, the NDRC was given the task of enforcing the pricing aspects of anti-monopoly policy.Technically, enforcement of the law is split between three agencies: the NDRC, which is confined to price probes, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce which handles non-price related cases of abuse, and the commerce ministry, which approves mergers and acquisitions.In practice, this division has led to a “turf war” between the agencies, in the words of one US lawyer in Beijing. After the NDRC launched its Qualcomm investigation, the SAIC a few months later raided the offices of Microsoft, starting a probe into violations of the anti-monopoly law for a company whose huge market share in China is mainly the result of software piracy.“The NDRC has a bit of what one might call a ‘super ministry’ attitude problem,” says Mr Wuttke. “Even other ministries find it difficult to deal with.”Becky Koblitz, a former federal prosecutor with the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division, who works in Beijing with the law firm Sheppard Mullin, says some of the missteps by Chinese regulators stem from inexperience with a new law.“The US has had the Sherman Act for over 120 years, while the European competition framework goes back almost 60 years. China’s AML is six years old and, naturally, there is a certain learning curve.”"
318;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Richard Branson’s Virgin and Qualcomm back satellite venture;Investment is first major public initiative since Virgin Galactic crash;Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and Qualcomm, the US chipmaker, have taken equity stakes in a satellite venture that would be launched by Virgin Galactic, which hopes to offer flights for space tourists.Sir Richard said OneWeb was designing a group of low-earth-orbit satellites which would provide internet and telephone access to people in areas with no previous connections.“Imagine the possibilities for the three billion people in hard-to-reach areas who are currently not connected,” Sir Richard said. “We’re excited for the opportunity for Virgin Galactic’s LauncherOne programme to help make it possible through low-cost, reliable and frequent satellite launches.”The announcement marks the first major public initiative by Virgin Galactic since the fatal crash in October of its SpaceShipTwo, which killed one pilot and seriously injured another. The company has been criticised for its safety controls, although Virgin Galactic has vigorously defended itself.Sir Richard is one of several billionaire entrepreneurs investing in space. Earlier this month, Space X, the private space flight company founded by Elon Musk, the wealthy tech entrepreneur, launched an unmanned rocket to deliver a cargo capsule to the International Space Station, after being forced to abort an earlier lift-off.Sir Richard and Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s executive chairman, will join the board of OneWeb. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but additional investors will be needed to fund the construction, launch and operation of the satellites.Sir Richard’s Virgin Group has been paying for its ambitious Virgin Galactic space tourism venture out of its own pocket since launch delays exhausted funds put up to establish the business. Sir Richard stepped back from day-to-day running of the group’s holding company in 2005 to to focus on his charitable activities and space tourism.Greg Wyler, founder of OneWeb, said the satellite project, which was at the design stage, would use groups of satellites and priority spectrum rights to provide coverage to areas of the world where there was previously no access to phone or internet connections.“This is not just about an investment in a company,” Mr Wyler said. “We are looking to solve a problem that the world faces, where almost half of its citizens have limited to no access to the world’s information.”Mr Wyler said Sir Richard “shared the vision” and was — in addition — “fun”.Sir Richard wrote on his blog: “We have the biggest order ever for putting satellites into space. By the time our second constellation [satellite group] is developed, the company will have launched more satellites than there currently are in the sky.”
319;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Tech groups race to grab carmakers’ attention at CES;Auto groups warily negotiating with innovators about adopting chips and gadgets into vehicles;"Kanwalinder Singh hopes to turn some heads when he rolls up with a souped-up Maserati and a new Cadillac to the largest tech industry convention of the year.Mr Singh is a senior executive at chipmaker Qualcomm, whose chips are found in most of the world’s smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone. The luxury vehicles, which Mr Singh and his team are showing at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, are meant to get the attention of new customers: carmakers.“What we invented for smartphones is becoming very applicable to cars,” said Mr Singh. His team modified the cars to show different entertainment and communications systems that could be built with their chips. “We want to show the automakers . . . what is possible.”Technologists are eyeing the car industry eagerly but any enthusiasm from the auto industry is tempered with caution.However, the convention floor is testament to the burgeoning partnerships between the sectors. More than 10 of the world’s biggest carmakers are at CES with new models and concept cars, and hundreds of tech groups are showing everything from chips that let users unlock vehicles with their smartphones to navigation tools that enable cars to share information with other vehicles on the road.Yet the auto industry is also struggling to figure out how to retain control over the process. Groups such as Apple, Google and others are developing software that controls important parts of how drivers interact with their dashboards. In the past year, two of the biggest technology groups have released in-car software — Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — that controls how drivers can link their phones to their cars.Car companies, executives say, are racing to satisfy customer interest in getting access to their smartphones’ capabilities while driving, without sacrificing their own ability to define what it means to drive their brand of car and to control valuable data about their customers.“The car has to adapt to what Apple is doing, to what Google is doing, and that’s an uncomfortable situation and not one [automakers] have been in the past,” said Richard Barrett, an executive in chipmaker Broadcom’s wireless systems group. “When you look at some of the latest generation of technology, the car is part of the mobile phone ecosystem, not the other way around.”Many car companies have been hiring software engineers and building new research teams, said Sean Fernback, president of Nokia’s maps business. But the learning curve is steep. Brands such as Ford have been criticised for the clunkiness of their early generation connected car software.News, commentary and analysis from this year’s event — the world’s biggest convention for gadgets, home electronics and other consumer tech

Further reading“If it’s about the direct driving experience or brand perception, it’s ‘Please stay away’,” said Tim Evavold, director of connected car at Covisint, a Detroit-based software company that supplies many carmakers. “If it’s more about infotainment, they’re looking in the other direction and saying ‘OK, what can you help me do?’”That can differ, said Mr Barrett, depending on the type of car. For cheaper cars, the availability of Silicon Valley software has been a boon, as car companies can effectively outsource to Google and other tech groups the complex task of software development. But higher-end brands want more control over the functionality and design of the user interface.“I definitely sense that there will be a point in time, a cross over point, where the [automakers] will be developing and running a lot of their own services,” said Mr Fernback. Nokia, he says, sees its own future as “the Switzerland of maps”, which allows car companies to integrate its maps into their own independent services which they design and whose customer data they keep.The industry is less reticent about adopting other kinds of technology being rolled out at CES. Many of the car companies are adding new video cameras to eliminate cars’ blind spots or adopting autonomous driving technologies that can improve safety by helping a driver stay aware of their car’s surroundings.NXP, a chipmaker, says carmakers have also come to it asking for help developing systems that would let drivers unlock cars with their smartphones. That, said Drue Freeman who helps manage the company’s sales and marketing division for cars, would be useful for integrating their cars into car-sharing services such as Zipcar.While that emerging business model might be contributing to reduced car ownership among young people and city dwellers, many car companies want their cars included as part of the shared fleets, so potential buyers get exposure to them. “There’s an evolution taking place in the auto industry where the vast majority of the innovation today is related to electronics,” said Mr Freeman."
320;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2015-01-04T19:49:04Z;Virtual and augmented reality look to sharpen the picture at CES;CES event expected to showcase advances in virtual reality technology;Several start-ups and many of the biggest names in technology are lining up to show off their virtual reality headsets at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.All hope to make the sort of impression that Oculus did last year. Inside a private room on the fringes of the event, hidden away from the crowds, a prototype of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset wowed with its immersive 3D representations of demonic dungeons and Star Wars-style space battles. Its ascent from the back rooms to the main stage of the technology world culminated in March’s $2bn acquisition by Facebook.“There’s been a huge amount of dollars invested in what’s next that goes on your head,” said Jay Wright, vice-president of product management for connected experiences at Qualcomm, the chipmaker, who leads Vuforia, the company’s platform for “digital eyewear”.“It’s not just that people believe this has the potential to disrupt the smartphone,” he added. “It has the potential to disrupt anything with a screen.”CES this year is expected to see the technology move from prototypes towards finished consumer product, with backing from the likes of Samsung, Sony and Intel.They will all be searching for a “killer app” that takes virtual reality beyond its early foothold in video gaming and makes the unwieldy-looking headsets appeal to a wider audience.“The emotional experience of communicating in VR is going to be really powerful,” said Eric Romo, chief executive of Altspace VR. At CES, the start-up will be demonstrating its virtual spaces where friends can feel as if they are chatting together in the same “room”, even if they are on different sides of the country.Others see entertainment as the first mass-market VR application. Jaunt, which raised $28m in funding in August from backers including British Sky Broadcasting, has released VR apps ranging from an onstage view of a Paul McCartney concert to a walk around the Shire with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit.“It’s a really different experience to watching it on the screen,” said Jens Christensen, Jaunt’s chief executive. “When you put on the headset and the headphones, you feel like you are right there next to [McCartney’s] piano.”Not everyone is so excited by VR’s near-term prospects. Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capitalist and an early investor in Twitter and Tumblr, predicted in a blog post on Thursday that VR “will hit some headwinds” as Oculus and its rivals “underwhelm”.“The virtual reality will eventually catch up to the virtual hype, but not in 2015,” he said.Some are instead backing a related but different kind of headset technology: “augmented reality”.While Oculus-style headsets immerse the wearer completely in a virtual environment, augmented reality glasses, such as Google Glass, overlay digital graphics and information on top of the real world.In October, Google led a $500m investment in Magic Leap, whose work is focused on developing a headset that can show realistic digital images that appear to hover over the real world. While the company is seen as unlikely to release a consumer product this year others, including Epson and Osterhout Design Group, are unveiling “smart glasses” at CES that boast high-fidelity digital graphics.Privately-held ODG has invested some $60m over the past six years into its range of smart glasses. The products began as devices aimed at military applications but are now broadening out into other industrial applications, such as providing hands-free instructions or messages for people working in hazardous environments.At CES, ODG will unveil its first consumer smart glasses, likely to cost less than $1,000, featuring high-definition stereoscopic displays and a 5 megapixel camera all running on Google’s Android operating system.Some in Silicon Valley predict that Facebook’s long-term plan for Oculus also involves augmented reality, as well as VR.For those hoping to win over more converts to these devices, CES provides a key opportunity to give people a first-hand demonstration.“You need to experience it in order to understand why this is so amazing,” says Altspace’s Mr Romo.
321;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Xiaomi fundraising values group at $45bn;Chinese smartphone maker gains $1.1bn and hints at strategy shift;China’s top-selling smartphone maker Xiaomi has raised $1.1bn in a venture capital funding round valuing it at $45bn, in a big vote of confidence in the fast-growing company.The valuation makes Xiaomi the world’s most highly valued technology start-up, with the four-year-old business surpassing Uber’s $40bn valuation after the ride-hailing app closed a $1.2bn fundraising round earlier this month. It also values the company at more than three times that of Hong Kong-listed Lenovo, which is running neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for leadership in the Chinese smartphone market.Lei Jun, chief executive, said on his blog on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, that the valuation was a “watershed” marking the beginning of a new stage in development.The valuation of the company, which has previously said it will not launch an initial public offering before 2018, is more than four times the $10bn value it was given after its last funding round in August 2013.The new round has been in negotiation since November. Investors include All-Stars Investment, DST, GIC, Hopu Fund and Yunfeng Capital among others, according to a Facebook announcement by Lin Bin, Xiaomi’s president.Xiaomi has said it would use part of the investment to improve the entertainment options available to users of its phones. Last month it announced investment deals with online video providers Youku Tudou and Iqiyi, the two largest video hosting sites in China, to make their content part of a Xiaomi-branded “ecosystem”. The size of the investment in Youku Tudou was not published while Iqiyi said Xiaomi had invested $300m, though the size of the stake was not disclosed.Xiaomi has used a viral marketing campaign to sell its high-spec, low-cost smartphones and vault over more established manufacturers to become the market leader in China. By the end of September, the company had 15 per cent of the market, ahead of Lenovo which had 13 per cent in the third quarter, according to IDC, the technology research company.This year Xiaomi will easily meet its goal of selling 60m phones, and has announced an ambition to sell 100m next year as it plans to export to up to 10 countries, including India, Malaysia and the Philippines.According to a tweet by Hugo Barra, Xiaomi’s chief of international operations, the company has sold more than 1m phones in India since launching there five months ago.But its ambitions in the country were put on hold this month following a lawsuit by Ericsson alleging patent infringement, and the Delhi High Court blocked the sale of Xiaomi phones on December 11.The ruling was partly reversed when the court ruled that the sales ban did not apply to Xiaomi phones with chips made by Qualcomm, the US chipmaker. Of the two Xiaomi models marketed in India so far, the Redmi 1S uses Qualcomm chips while the Redmi Note 3G contains a chip set from Mediatech, which is still banned under the Ericsson ruling. On December 30, Xiaomi will launch the Redmi Note 4G, which contains a Qualcomm chip set.In his Weibo posting, Mr Lei alluded to a modification of strategic direction, saying that “Xiaomi will embark with a mindset of ‘returning to square one’ ” and that the company plans to announce a “heavyweight project” in January 2015.In the past few months the smartphone maker has branched out into higher-margin electronic goods, launching an air purifier and a fitness-tracking band.Xiaomi was briefly the third largest smartphone seller in the world, according to third quarter rankings by Strategy Analytics. However Lenovo’s acquisition of Motorola, which was finalised in October, enabled it to regain that slot.

Microsoft is the latest to make headlines with a tale of woe, in the form of a $140m tax fee paid to Chinese authorities. (Microsoft prefers to call it a $140m “bilateral advanced pricing agreement”.) This comes on top of an antitrust investigation launched in July and this week’s news that one of China’s largest companies is switching its email service away from Microsoft.But Microsoft may be better off in China than many other US tech companies. Due to rampant piracy, Microsoft’s revenues in China have never been very big (about the same as those in the Netherlands). Its revenues rose 25 per cent last quarter, year on year, despite a “more challenging environment” in China and Russia.Instead, hardware companies – the likes of Cisco, IBM and Qualcomm – are worse off in China. Cisco’s sales there have halved in the past two years, driven by a backlash after the Snowden revelations and by the increasing capabilities of Chinese equipment manufacturers such as Huawei. IBM’s China revenues are falling, too, the company said last quarter – on top of a 22 per cent year-on-year drop in the comparable quarter last year. IBM said a tough hardware market was to blame.Then there is Qualcomm, which partners with Chinese manufacturers who produce its chips; the company says one-fifth of its licensed 3G/4G devices are going unreported (which means no licence fees). The company is having trouble resolving these disputes because it is simultaneously the subject of a Chinese antitrust investigation.The Chinese tech market is alluring. IT spend in China may grow at 5.7 per cent next year, says IDC, to the US’s 3.7 per cent, but given the size of their respective markets – the US is three times as big as China – that is still more dollars being spent at home.

Sales climbed nearly 4 per cent to $2.4bn.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 16 cents a share, on sales of $2.38bn.Adjusting for certain items, the company reported a loss of 64 cents a share, short of expectations for a profit of 21 cents a share.“While we do not foresee an equity raise, we believe that Genworth has limited capital flexibility and might need to reinsure [or] sell blocks of business to meet US mortgage insurance capital standards or avert a downgrade by rating agencies, which would further pressure future profits,” said Jimmy Bhullar, an analyst at JPMorgan.Genworth Financial shares slumped 38 per cent to $8.67 and are down nearly 44 per cent so far this year.Qualcomm was another poor performer on the S&P 500 after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that missed Wall Street’s expectations and warned that “underreporting” of sales by some Chinese customers had impacted its outlook.Qualcomm’s sales climbed 3 per cent to $6.7bn, short of estimates for $7bn.Earnings per share, adjusting for certain items, were $1.26 per share, just below analysts’ expectations.The wireless chip developer said it expected $26.8bn to $28.8bn in revenues in fiscal 2015, below forecasts for $29.12bn.Shares slipped nearly 9 per cent to $70.58.Shares of Whole Foods advanced 12 per cent to $44.65 as same-store sales at the retailer accelerated at the start of its fiscal first quarter, eclipsing Wall Street expectations.The company said like-for-like sales rose 4.6 per cent in the first five weeks of its current quarter, up from the 3.1 per cent gain in the three months to the end of September, which was in line with Wall Street forecasts.Profits climbed 5.8 per cent to $128m, or 35 cents per share. Net sales climbed 9.4 per cent to $3.26bn. Analysts on Wall Street had projected earnings of 32 cents a share on sales of $3.26bn.Tesla shares climbed nearly 4 per cent to $239.72 even though the carmaker reported third-quarter deliveries and fourth-quarter guidance that were below expectations.But management expects Model S orders and deliveries to rise 50 per cent in 2015.“A wobbly third quarter but the market takes the long-term view for now,” said Patrick Archambault, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.US stocks closed on record highs as the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,031.19, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 17.530.69.

324;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm: licence to bill?;There is more to the stock fall than widgets;Widget counting has become a rarefied art. Analysts canvas customers and suppliers for clues about the next quarter’s results. So when a tech company misses expectations despite this, markets get jumpy. On Wednesday, when Qualcomm announced fourth-quarter earnings per share that, at $1.26, missed by a mere nickel, the stock fell 6 per cent in the after-market session. There is more to this than widgets, though.The numbers were weak. But one came in above expectations: antitrust investigations. The company revealed that since September, the US Federal Trade Commission has been looking into its intellectual property licensing business. And the European Commission joined the fray last month.Qualcomm’s patents are essential to the CDMA and LTE wireless standards. In the US, companies whose IP contributes to an industry standard must license it on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. This prevents, among other things, price gouging or giving preferential treatment of some customers to limit competition. Europe is similarly worried about price-fixing and market manipulation. And Qualcomm’s licensing practices have been under investigation in China for a year.Qualcomm’s licences are hugely valuable. The licensing arm, QTL, contributed $8bn in revenues, nearly a third of the total, in 2014. The QTL pre-tax margin is 87 per cent. The margin on Qualcomm’s wireless chip business is 20 per cent. But the chip business is growing, while licensing revenues were flat for the year. These grew by nearly 20 per cent in 2013 (The company attributes the slowdown to licensees under-reporting sales and unlicensed product sales in China).If Qualcomm is found to have abused its market position in China, the fine could be 10 per cent of the prior year’s revenues earned there. This year, China accounted for half of total revenues, or $13.2bn. One-tenth of that would wipe out 15 per cent of earnings. That is a lot of widgets.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
325;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Qualcomm faces two new antitrust probes;US and EU authorities examine chip developer’s behaviour;Qualcomm faces three investigations into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour, as it revealed new probes in the US and EU on top of the antitrust inquiry it already faces in China.Reporting earnings on Wednesday, the wireless chip developer warned that the probe in China, which began last year, presented “significant challenges” in forecasting the year ahead.Its annual report disclosed two new investigations had begun in the last month, one into its patent licensing business by the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the other into its baseband chip set business in Europe.Qualcomm said the two new inquiries were “very preliminary” and in the “information gathering stages”. Analysts had previously seen the Chinese probe as part of a wider backlash against foreign companies there, in the wake of revelations by Edward Snowden about the US technology industry’s alleged role in American spying.“We are fully co-operating with these agencies and believe our practices comply with the laws of their countries,” said Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive.Qualcomm supplies cellular chips to many of the world’s mobile device makers, including Apple and Samsung, and holds intellectual property central to how 3G and 4G networks operate.Shares in Qualcomm fell around 6 per cent in after-hours trading, after it reported revenues and earnings below Wall Street’s expectations and warned that its outlook was muddied further by “underreporting” of sales by some Chinese customers, who it said may be waiting for the conclusion of the regulatory inquiry there before striking new licensing agreements.“Bringing this matter to closure remains a top priority for the management team,” said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm’s president, referring to the Chinese antitrust investigation. He warned that a “wide range of outcomes” was possible, leading to potentially greater fluctuation in quarterly performance.While the three investigations are separate and relate to different parts of Qualcomm’s business, Mr Aberle noted that regulatory enquiries in one region could prompt questions in other parts of the world.China’s National Development and Reform Commission began an investigation into Qualcomm in November 2013 related to its intellectual-property licensing business. If found guilty, Qualcomm could be fined up to 10 per cent of its prior year’s revenues, potentially exceeding $1bn, and be forced to change how it does business in China.“We also believe that certain licensees in China currently are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us,” Qualcomm added, “and that unlicensed companies may seek to delay execution of new licenses while the [Chinese antitrust] investigation is ongoing.”As a result, Qualcomm said it expected $26.8bn to $28.8bn in revenues in fiscal 2015, just below Wall Street’s forecasts. Qualcomm said the low end of its guidance assumed no resolution in the various investigations.Half of Qualcomm’s revenues last year came from customers and licensees based in China, where most of the world’s smartphones are manufactured. Chinese sales grew by 7.4 per cent to $13.2bn last year, a considerable slowdown over the prior year’s 54.2 per cent rise.The FTC is examining Qualcomm’s patent licensing business, which the regulator said may have breached requirements to give other companies access to certain kinds of its technology on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis.The EU is looking into antitrust concerns related to the sale or marketing of its baseband chipsets, “including alleged conditions relating to the provision by us of rebates and/or other financial incentives”.Qualcomm said it would “vigorously defend” itself in these investigations.Reporting results from its fiscal fourth quarter, Qualcomm’s sales of $6.7bn, up 3 per cent, fell short of analysts’ forecasts of $7bn, while net income rose 26 per cent to $1.89bn. Earnings per share, adjusting for certain items, were $1.26 per share, just below analysts’ expectations.
326;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-10-16T06:12:55Z;FT-BC Index: US companies miss top slots;A striking feature of FT-Bowen Craggs Index is best performers are almost all European;A striking feature of the FT-Bowen Craggs Index is that the top performers are almost all European. The highest-ranked US company, Google, just scrapes into the top 20. The bottom of the index, meanwhile, is occupied largely by Chinese companies.So does the fault lie with our methodology, or with US and Chinese web estates?The fact is that websites reflect both the companies that own them and the cultures that breed them. Even among this group, the world’s biggest multinationals, and this medium – the world wide web – national and regional differences shout out.The Chinese companies are easiest to explain. They put little effort into websites as a communication medium. Banks have lively, customer-focused sites, and everyone uses social media channels such as Weibo. But the country’s corporate websites tend to focus only on investors, which seems to reflect a general attitude to communication, as well as different approach to recruitment (a key use for websites in the west).If Chinese companies want to be seen as increasingly global, upgrading their websites would be good start – and that may be happening. China Shenhua, the energy and mining company, has just given its site a fresh look. Just as Russian sites started to stir five years ago so that some, such as Sberbank, are now among the best, we may finally be seeing an awakening in China. Watch this space.To understand why US companies do not reach the top of the index, we need to look at the metric-by-metric breakdown. Thirteen of the bottom 20 scores on “construction” (which measures how easy it is to find one’s way around the web estate) are from US companies – only two of the bottom 20 are European. There is similar, though less extreme, bias in the “message” (or branding) metrics, but for the ones related to content (serving customers, jobseekers, investors etc), there is no discernible difference.Both construction and message scores are linked closely to the way the overall web estates work. Are they easy to use and move around, and do they give off consistent and coherent messages?European companies tend to run their web estates from the centre and they are managed as one entity, whereas most US estates are fragmented. Even within head office, departments down the corridor from each other may well do their own thing – a centrifugal effect enhanced by a propensity to outsource to agencies.Contrast Shell, which has extraordinary uniformity and co-ordination even between its Chile, Pakistan and US sites, with Apple, which has quite different approaches from its press, investor relations and human resources departments.A US manager suggests this may reflect American federalism against European statism. Possibly. However, there are European companies with a strongly decentralised philosophy – such as Nestlé – that have gradually brought their websites under central control.Is the European approach actually better, or does it simply fulfil our index measurements more successfully? It is better because, like our methodology, it concentrates on the visitors’ experience, not internal divisions within a company.Think of people looking for jobs. They will look not only at the careers area, but also at information about the group, its sustainability, its products. They do not want to shift between separate structures, and the company should not want them to get the feeling that it is not really “together”.The same is true of customers, journalists, investors, anyone – a fragmented website speaks of a fragmented organisation, and who wants to give that impression?But if US companies do start to get their act (and websites) together, expect great things. Companies such as General Electric, Google, IBM and Qualcomm have some of the best corporate content – they use words, images, video with real style, bringing to life what could be deathly dull material about the groups or their products.It is a similar story with social media, where US companies are often far more active than their European counterparts, but again suffer from a lack of co-ordination. Combine their content skills with a little organisation, and Americans could yet rule the index and, more importantly, give their target audiences a much better service.The writer is senior consultant at Bowen Craggs & Co.

327;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm / CSR: rival perspectives;The chipmaker’s acquisition of CSR could be a simple bolt-on – or a sign of nerves;Here is the simple interpretation. Qualcomm’s purchase of CSR is a small bolt-on acquisition, adding one more arrow to a formidable quiver of wireless technologies. CSR is strong in Bluetooth low-energy technology. Bluetooth chips send data between devices. The low-energy version is designed for smaller amounts of data and shorter distances.The chips are small, cheap and efficient, ideal for letting household, motor or industrial appliances communicate. So Qualcomm, the leading maker of integrated chips for smartphones, can now combine low and high-power communications. This could go way beyond turning up your thermostat from your iPhone. And at $1.6bn in cash, the deal is well less than a quarter’s free cash flow for Qualcomm.There is another interpretation, though. Start with a naive question. What would Qualcomm, with its commanding position in mobile, want with a technology whose primary applications are immobile – confined to a factory or a household? And the competition in “internet of things” chips is brutal anyway.Qualcomm may be worried that making integrated processor/communications chips (“systems on a chip”) for smartphones is about to become a much tougher business. As Berenberg research – a rare bear on Qualcomm’s shares – argues, Qualcomm had almost the entire market for 4G integrated chips until recently.This may change soon. MediaTek, an old Qualcomm rival at the low end of the market, is rolling out a 4G system on a chip now. Perhaps more worrying still, another rival, Tsinghua Unigroup (which last year absorbed another low-end competitor, Spreadtrum) recently received a $1.5bn investment from Intel. Intel is prepared to put a lot of financial muscle behind mobile. In its most recent quarter it reported $1m in sales in its mobile division and $1bn in losses, as it subsidises adoption of its mobile chips. Bluetooth looks better and better.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
328;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-10-15T17:00:26Z;Intel slips despite record revenues;Analysts at Morgan Stanley think this is ‘as good as it gets’ for Intel;Much has been said about the struggles of the PC industry but Intel surprised markets by beating third-quarter earnings expectations and shipping more than 100m chips.Intel reported third-quarter net income of $3.3bn or 66 cents a share, compared with $2.9bn or 58 cents a share in the same period a year ago.The company reported record revenue of $14.6bn, up 8 per cent from the previous year. This beat Wall Street forecasts for 65 cents a share on revenue of $14.5bn.The company’s fourth quarter sales guidance of $14.5bn-$15.2bn beat expectations for $14.5bn. The company also repurchased $4.2bn of stock in the quarter.Analysts at Morgan Stanley think this is “as good as it gets” for Intel. They downgraded the stock to “underweight” while maintaining their $30 price target.“From here we see unit growth decelerating, with continued declines in average selling prices, pressure in gross margins as construction in progress gets drawn down, and continued limited progress in building profitable foundry and tablet businesses,” said Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.The chipmaking industry was recently given a jolt after Microchip warned that the industry as a whole was on the verge of a correction.Intel shares slipped 3 per cent to $31.27.KeyCorp led the S&P 500 lower after the Ohio-based lender missed third-quarter earnings expectations.The company reported net income of $197m or 23 cents a share, compared with $229m or 25 cents a share in the year ago period. Revenue of $998m was down from $1.04bn the previous year.Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share on revenue of $1.03bn.Shares of KeyCorp slipped 6 per cent to $12.16.UK based CSR jumped 31 per cent to $54.74 in New York after Qualcomm agreed to buy the chipmaker for $2.5bn in cash.Shares of Qualcomm were flat, following losses earlier in the trading session, as analysts believe this is a good move for the California-based company.“In general, this seems like a wise diversification away from handsets and into various ‘Internet of Things’ end markets, which will drive wireless connectivity growth for the next decade or more as smartphones, tablets, and PCs mature.”Shares of Time Warner advanced 2 per cent to $72.21 after HBO, the channel that brings much-watched shows such as Game of Thrones and such original programming as True Detective, said it would launch a standalone online streaming service.Statoil shares slipped 2 per cent to $23.42 after chief executive Helge Lund unexpectedly stepped down to take the helm at BG Group, another oil and gas company next year.Statoil appointed the head of the marketing, processing and renewable energy division, Eldar Saetre, as acting CEO.US stocks followed global markets lower on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,862.49, wiping out its gains for the year.

329;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-10-15T16:48:16Z;CSR valued at £1.56bn after Qualcomm agrees to buy it;Deal values equity of UK chipmaker at £1.56bn;Qualcomm has agreed to buy CSR, in a deal that values the equity of the UK chipmaker at £1.56bn.The recommended all-cash offer at 900p a share by the US company, the world’s largest maker of mobile chips, was announced on Wednesday just hours before a deadline imposed by the UK Takeover Panel for US rival Microchip Technology to mount a fresh bid for CSR.The Cambridge-based chipmaker, formerly known as Cambridge Silicon Radio, designs but does not build chips and components, used in mobile phones and satellite navigation systems. It is best known for designing components used within hands-free driving headsets and other Bluetooth wireless technology.People familiar with the matter suggested that Qualcomm approached CSR about a deal when news of Microchip’s talks with the UK chip designer leaked last month.The UK company rejected an initial approach by Microchip in late August in what analysts said would be a proposed tax inversion deal. The White House has cracked down on attempts by US companies to move their domiciles to Europe to avert such moves. On Tuesday AbbVie, the US pharmaceutical group, said it was reconsidering its $54bn takeover of UK drugmaker Shire.Qualcomm has 400 employees in the UK, including a hub in Cambridge, and it is expected to maintain CSR’s base in the city. However, full integration plans and any potential job cuts at CSR, which employs 2,130 people in 11 countries, will be finalised in the months before the deal closes.Joep van Beurden, CSR’s chief executive, said the deal would give his company, which will now become a significant division within Qualcomm, the resources to compete with bigger rivals.“This deal is a ringing endorsement of CSR’s product, technology and our team,” he said. “If you look at the overall lay of the land in the semiconductor industry, it is very important to have scale, and with this transaction we’ve achieved that.“I think it’s a compliment to the British tech scene. Qualcomm is the global leader . . . it’s a very good to be part of that, and it will allow us to continue to grow our business over the next couple of years.”Qualcomm said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the so-called internet of everything, where everyday objects, from watches to fridges, are able to interact with each other and connect to the web.“The addition of CSR’s technology leadership in Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart and audio processing will strengthen Qualcomm’s position in providing critical solutions that drive the rapid growth of the internet of everything, including the business areas such as portable audio, automotive and wearable devices,” said Steven Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive.Analysts said the deal looked like a good fit for Qualcomm but did not rule out a possible counterbid.“With a firm price now out in the open, we can’t rule out other bidders, but only a handful of semis [semiconductor] companies could compete with Qualcomm on this, in our view,” Robert Lamb and Lee Simpson of Jefferies wrote in a note.Shares in CSR, which have performed strongly since the initial approach from Microchip, jumped 35 per cent in early trading in London to 875p.The Qualcomm offer represents a 57 per cent premium to CSR’s share price before Microchip’s initial approach became public in August. It represents a multiple of three times enterprise value to sales.Microchip had until Wednesday evening to return with an improved offer. The US chipmaker issued a profit warning this month.There has been a wave of consolidation between semiconductor groups in recent times. In September, German chipmaker Infineon Technologies acquired the US group International Rectifier for about $3bn. In April, Cirrus Logic, based in Texas, bought the Scottish chip designer Wolfson Electronics for £278m.
330;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-10-12T23:38:05Z;FT-BC Index: Treasures and grumbles;Some companies get their websites very right in some areas, but very wrong in others;It is interesting to see what puts companies right at the top of the index, but also to highlight hidden nuggets elsewhere. Some companies get it very right in some areas, but very wrong in others.Top fiveShell: A highly coherent web estate, with country and business sites sharing content and functionality. It is this exceptional management that pushes it to the top. However, it also has terrific content. Look at the Major Projects section in About Shell, or the slick Inside Energy iPad app.ENI: Good looking and well managed, it serves all its audiences with thoroughness and panache. The quality of corporate information, including areas such as corporate governance that could be sensitive ones, are particularly well handled.Nestlé: The site buzzes with interesting ideas that have pushed it steadily up the index. Many relate to reputation management (a huge issue for the company): an unmatched Contact us page that shrieks “We are not such a closed company”, and the terrific Ask Nestlé section stand out.Unilever: This is a highly co-ordinated global web estate that is used with great effect to transmit the chief executive’s vision on sustainability. If a corporate website’s job is to tell the world what the company’s management is thinking, then Unilever’s is hard to beat.Siemens: The specially commissioned videos are long established, but still effective. They were an early example of the “stories” – magazine-style features, but they may also include video – that are now so fashionable, but were originally an example of Siemens’ preparedness to go against the trend. Its attitude to mobile – with separate sites for phones, tablets and computers – is another. A company that is always worth watching.Buried treasuresBayer: A model for those needing to hold a complex web estate together. A set of tools at the top of each page allows quick navigation to different areas, while a (rare) effective search engine gives quick access to specifics.GSK: A relaunched site is notable for the way it is actively managed – recently for its prominent links to coverage of its China crisis, as well as Ebola.SABMiller: A newcomer to the index with a slick new site that puts stories at the centre. Unlike so many sites, where “stories” is no more than a label, this is a really engaging magazine that concentrates on its specialist subject. It could well become a valued destination for anyone interested in the brewing industry.SAP: Last year’s number one has slipped on a number of detail issues, but its approach to navigation is still remarkable – it is not conventional, but it works. A rare achievement.General Electric: A mass of strong magazine-style material, some with an understanding that old-fashioned editorial skills still count. For GEreports.com, a magazine/blog, includes the teaser headlines “A journey to the center of the brain” and “Honey, I shrunk the world”. Also a battery of social media channels, including even the looping videos of Vine.Coca-Cola Company: The group claims to have reinvented the corporate website, and it is certainly blurring the line between marketing and communications, with an emphasis on magazine-style features and bold images. Interesting to see it has dropped the fashionable “stories” tag in favour of topics such as food and music. Corporate information is in there too, although the relationship is at times awkward.Qualcomm: A striking new site that manages to bring often-obscure products to life with a mix of video and graphics. It works best on touch screens, although its approach to navigation almost works on desktops and laptops too. The key word is “almost” – it falls down in so many areas of implementation that it cannot get near the top of the index.Sberbank: A most unusual jobs site, Sberbank Talents, does not follow the dull conventions of most of “application engines”. It looks good and works well. The problem is that many people will not find it because signposts on this new site are weak.Wells Fargo: The bank has an excellent storytelling site, and a strong set of social media channels that respond to negative criticism well. But there are no linkages to either from wellsfargo.com. An extreme example of the fragmentation that characterises so many US sites.Goldman Sachs: It knows what it needs to do: boost its reputation and continue to get the best staff. It has some brilliant content and functionality, but is let down by a navigation structure that puts form way ahead of function.Google: The About Google area is a fragmented set of microsites that does, however, include the most potent mechanisms for attracting recruits that we know, including – perhaps unsurprisingly – formidable use of the often derided Google+ platform.For more details, including the full ranking by different metrics and details on the full database, visit www.bowencraggs.com/FT-Bowen-Craggs-Index.Our main grumble over the past two years persists with this year’s index. Too many companies have been swept along by fashion, sacrificing ease of use for navigation that owes much to social media or news sites, but is quite unsuitable for complex and deep corporate sites.ExxonMobil’s new site is the most egregious example. The main devices for moving around are drop-down menus that open on click and scrolling down the page to find links. Visitors have to work hard – why not put links in view, so people can click and get directly where they want? Add in oversized headings that force unnecessary scrolling and unexplained numbers in parentheses (see the Careers landing page), and we have a site that is not so much unconventional as plain odd.More surprisingly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which was previously a model of usability, has gone down a similar route – click, scroll, click, scroll. Why? A respected web agency man said that he ‘liked scrolling’. He may, but why force everyone else to do it? (For more on this, see our recent column “Why is usability collapsing”.)The other problem goes back much further – to the first corporate “web estate” probably. It is that of poor management. When visitors come to a website, they might reasonably expect to move around easily, and feel as though they are in the same town as they explore different corners. The company that owns it might be expected to want this too, and also to encourage visitors to see things they would otherwise miss. This happens in the best web estates, but not in those where the company’s own internal structure (and often philosophy) is put first.The worst offenders are IT companies (though US banks feature too). Click around the web estates of Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Intel or Apple, and you can easily find yourself in unfamiliar territory cut off from your starting point. Cobblers’ shoes come to mind here, although it is at least in part the flipside of an attribute that IT groups value: extreme decentralisation.Looking at these sites, you can see departments not talking to each other. Add to this is an overweening dominance of the marketing department – Apple.com is brilliant for customers, pretty hopeless for anyone else – and we have internal mentality overwhelming common sense in alarming ways.It need not be like this. SAP, which has slipped from its number one spot but is still impressive, manages to use the same (unconventional) navigation system to provide an equal service to many different types of customers as well as other groups. Qualcomm, previously a mess, has been reborn as a beautiful multimedia site that brings its obscure products to life. There are no problems that senior managers cannot fix by insisting that, in online communications at least, strong central management is a must.
331;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-10-12T23:31:38Z;FT-Bowen Craggs Index 2014: Overview;This year’s ranking of just how effective corporations are at managing their online presence;"The world’s largest companies own “magic devices” that allow them to talk to half of humanity at a trivial cost – and few of them know what to do with them. This year’s Financial Times-Bowen Craggs Index of corporate online effectiveness shows that, far from coming to a consensus about how they should be using their websites and social media channels, there is more variety than ever among the world’s biggest companies.The FT BC Index has been running since 2007. The underlying database is updated constantly, but we publish a fresh set of numbers once a year to show the current trends. It judges corporate websites and other channels, but this is about much more than corporate communications – it is about the way huge companies speak to the world.They may be speaking to customers, jobseekers, journalists, critics, neighbours, governments – but for each of them, the internet has become an increasingly vital channel. Call it “group level marketing” – marketing/promotion/messaging for the group as a whole – and it suddenly seems more important.One conundrum is that, even though the speed of change seems phenomenal, few senior managers understand the internet’s importance except as a pure selling tool. The companies from which the list below is drawn are the 80 biggest in the world – only a handful come close to using it as they might.Furthermore, the gap between those who “get it” and those who do not is widening. Some companies renowned for their tight management seem to lose all sense when it comes to online communications. ExxonMobil has just launched a corporate site that falls into the biggest current bear trap – mimicking sites such as Tumblr or Huffington Post, without thinking that its needs are quite different. The current trend for endless scrolling – with minimal navigation to guide visitors – just does not work for a complex, multi-audience website.At the same time, other companies are getting increasingly slick. These are marked out by:• A refusal to go along with trends – they do things because they are appropriate. BP and Total have relaunched their sites with profoundly unfashionable left menu navigation. But they work. Nestlé, GSK and (again) Total have created mobile-friendly sites, but they have not put mobile usability first, as some others have. This is sensible, as fewer than 10 per cent of their visitors look at their sites on small screens.• A belief that – if they want to get their messages across – they must not be boring. General Electric has some terrific magazine-style material, exploiting broadband-powered multimedia with verve. Siemens’ commissioned short films still shine. Shell’s videos of beasties under the sea are gripping, while Apple’s multimedia essays are rather beautiful (especially on tablets). This is, however in danger of being undermined by another fashion, for “stories” that are simply rather boring words labelled as stories. High-quality editorial control is still too rare.• An understanding that the internet is the most flexible medium invented, and that to use a corporate site for only one purpose is to abuse it. Apple.com is fantastic at serving consumers; pretty useless for other groups.• Notwithstanding the above, a realisation that online channels should also support specific needs of a company. Much-abused Nestlé crackles with clues that it wants to be seen as open. BP is still trying to repair its reputation post Gulf of Mexico. Goldman Sachs needs to continue attracting the brightest recruits.To be right at the top of the index, you need to do all these and more. Apple, GE and Goldman score highly in some ways, but their usability is way off. Pfizer works well, but is dull. Use the table (more on our website) to pick out those that shine and fade in different areas.Another common factor for the high performers is that they have all been polishing away at established sites. It is difficult for a good site to be relaunched and increase its score – glitches always get in the way. But let them settle and they will rise: BP, GSK and Qualcomm are relaunched sites to watch.Top performers also see that “social media” are really a set of individual channels that do different things.LinkedIn is often best for communicating the company’s attractions for jobseekers, Facebook for corporate social responsibility messaging for customers, jobseekers and the general public. Slideshare is useful for posting content for investors and analysts.YouTube and Flickr are often used as extensions of the corporate website – essentially integrated channels for publishing further information about the company, rather than truly “social” media, inviting interaction. Real social media channels – Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter – need careful, active management.The most interesting development has been the use of Facebook as a reputation management tool. After struggling to understand it for years, a small number of companies are now using it well to respond to their critics.

For the full ranking by different metrics, visit www.bowencraggs.com/FT-Bowen-Craggs-IndexThe FT-Bowen Craggs Index examines how the biggest companies in the world are using the internet – through their websites, social media channels and apps. It is about group-level communication and marketing – not brand level or ecommerce.Companies included are taken from the FT Global 500, ranked by market capitalisation. We started with the top 25 from each of the US, Europe, and the rest of the world, and added in best performers from previous years that would no longer qualify. We look at the entire presence, covering non-English content where relevant. This year there are four new entrants: SABMiller, Bayer, Comcast, and Westpac.It is the most detailed mass study of online channels, and has three aims. First, to help organisations know where to look for ideas. Second, to pick out trends in online communications. Finally, to allow the largest quoted companies in the world to see how they are performing against their peers.The index is unlike other rankings for three reasons:* First, it is far more detailed than any other ranking of corporate websites – the score for each company in the index is based on up to 60 hours of analysis of the corporate website and social media channels.* Second, the index takes a broader approach than other rankings. It evaluates all of the jobs that a corporate website and its social media channels are expected to do, rather than focusing on one particular element. This means our analysts measure how effectively the entire online presence is communicating with its multiple audiences, whether customers, jobseekers, media, corporate and social responsibility analysts or investors.* Third, our scores are based on expert analysis, rather than a quick “check box” approach to measurement. For each metric, our analysts – experienced in both business and the web – make judgments about a website’s effectiveness for a particular audience. Rather than simply confirming that a website provides, for example, easy access to quarterly reports for investors, our analysts consider the depth of material available, visual impact and other qualities to evaluate whether it is communicating in an appropriate way.Bowen Craggs & Co advises companies and other organisations on their online presence. It does not build sites, but helps improve effectiveness with strategy, measurement and continuous improvement. We have worked for a number of companies in the index, though we use different analysts for consulting and reviewing. These projects have not affected the scoring: we have no interest in marking companies either up or down. Our reviews are open for examination by subscribers to our database.For the full ranking by different metrics, and details on the full database, visit www.bowencraggs.com/FT-Bowen-Craggs-Index"
332;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Why my front door is not web-ready;The internet of things needs two things to work: error-free code and an agreed set of standards;Last month in The Economist I read a scenario of a future home in which all manner of objects, connected to each other in the internet of things, would communicate and work together. In the case of a fire, for example: “Connected smoke alarms could enlist nearby lightbulbs to flash and speakers to sound an alert. A warning about the smoke’s location could appear on a television. And door locks could be automatically opened.”I nearly choked on my cornflakes. In reality, what would happen is that the television would display an inexplicable “error, code not found” message and – as the flames began to close in and the room filled with smoke – the door locks would tell you that they wouldn’t open until they had finished installing the latest software update.This is what happens now when I grab my smartphone to take a picture of something my four-year-old is doing. By the time I’ve clicked through all the update requests, the “cute” moment has passed. I imagine an app update is going to be even more annoying when I am on fire.There is an old joke about Microsoft and General Motors which went along the lines that if GM developed cars like Microsoft various things would happen, for example: “Occasionally, executing a manoeuvre such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, and you would have to reinstall the engine.”It was a funny-list entry back in 1999, but it seems less funny now that the internet of things and self-driving cars are becoming a reality. I’m still not completely reassured that a left-hand turn isn’t going to suddenly cause an error message.Working with programmers day-to-day, I can see how often a tiny bit of mistyped code results in software not working at all or doing something bizarre.I also see how many frustrating hours go into trying to ensure any new software can actually talk to the decades-old legacy systems most of our homes are filled with: 10-year-old televisions and laptops with operating systems Microsoft no longer supports and old iPhones long since passed on to pre-teen children.If the internet of things is going to work, two things need to happen. Programmers need to start writing error-free code, which is pretty unlikely (the industry standard is for about 15-50 errors per 1,000 lines of code).Testing gets rid of many mistakes, but the reason cyber security issues such as Heartbleed and Shellshock arise is because not all bugs are discovered. Some of them, as in the case of Shellshock, can lie festering for 20 years.The technology sector is also going to have to come to some agreement on standards, which is not going to be easy. There are dozens of alliances, each trying to create the definitive standard.The biggest of these is the AllSeen Alliance, whose core technology is based on Qualcomm software. It includes Electrolux, Haier, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Qualcomm, Sharp, Silicon Image, Sony, Technicolor, and TP-Link – a fairly powerful list of companies.But wait – Intel has its own rival alliance, the Open Internet Consortium, which includes Samsung and Dell. Meanwhile, AT&T, General Electric and IBM are in the Industrial Internet Consortium. Not forgetting Google and chipmakers ARM, Freescale and Silicon Labs, which have teamed with Samsung to create Thread Group, and are developing the Thread wireless networking protocol.Then there is Apple, which has its own HomeKit, which is going to provide the communication between all Apple devices.In previous standards battles, its has taken a good 10-15 years for a de facto standard to establish itself, and for the groups to come to some kind of agreement. In the meantime, my front door will remain disconnected from the internet of things.

While the companies involved all accepted the NDRC’s findings, privately many foreign executives and lawyers argue that high prices in China are often a function of market demand, high import tariffs and other factors.The NDRC struck again last month when it raided the Shanghai offices of Daimler, the German company that manufactures Mercedes-Benz sedans, and said it would punish Audi for allegedly overcharging dealers and repair shops for spare parts. US technology companies such as Qualcomm and Microsoft have also confirmed that they are the subject of competition investigations by Chinese authorities.NDRC officials could not be immediately reached for comment. They have previously insisted that their investigations have snared both domestic and foreign companies, and denies targeting the latter group.Daimler, Audi and BMW, which together account for about 80 per cent of luxury car sales in the world’s largest automotive market, have since said they would cut spare parts prices in China.All three companies produce cars in China with local partners – in accordance with local laws that prohibit foreign car companies from holding majority stakes in manufacturing operations.In its statement on Wednesday, the European Chamber expressed concern that “in some cases that involve joint ventures, it has only been the foreign partner that has been named as being a party to the investigations”. It also noted that in some industries, domestic companies had apparently been spared official scrutiny.Earlier this week, Audi’s China division said it would respect any administrative punishments handed down by the NDRC, while General Motors of the US confirmed that it was assisting Chinese authorities in their investigation of the Chinese auto sector.Jaguar Land Rover, which is preparing to begin manufacturing operations in China this year, has also moved to cut the prices of its imported luxury SUVs.
334;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-08-11T00:01:54Z;Guest post: has doing business in China just got too risky?;;By Roy Williams of VendigitalThe latest wave of anti-trust investigations in China – first Qualcomm and now Microsoft and the ongoing criminal investigations involving GSK – is having an unsettling effect on global supply chains across a variety of industry sectors.But instead of planning an exodus, Western businesses should avoid over reacting and focus on finding new, appropriate strategies that will allow them to stay and profit from doing business in the world’s fastest-growing consumer market.Of course, any business thinking about shifting operations to China in order to gain access to its developing marketplace should do so with its eyes fully open. Businesses that go there simply seeking to profit from their exposure to the market will be unlikely to find that things run smoothly.The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the agency responsible for administrative control of the Chinese economy, will be more inclined to spot corrupt or anti-competitive working practices in businesses that are only interested in profiting from China rather than those that are bringing something valuable to the country that will enable its economy to grow in the future.Simply put, if China doesn’t feel it is learning from a business, or a business is just exploiting an advantage it has, it will gently or abruptly stop it (for example with import tariffs or corruption investigations, or more subtly with changes to joint venture ownerships, ease of doing business, or taxation).Businesses that are providing Chinese people with an opportunity to learn how to manufacture premium parts for the automotive or aerospace industries, for example, or gain knowledge of innovative technologies, will be more welcome and accommodated.Once this degree of market control is understood, Western businesses will realise that any business opportunity in China comes with strings and a time window attached – it may last five or ten years, or possibly longer, but it will be finite without evolution. If businesses become too big, they tend to be brought firmly under state control, or managed so as not to get too powerful or influential.From an outsider’s viewpoint, it may seem that Western companies have become less welcome in China lately, but this has never been further from the truth. The Chinese Government is desperate for its industries to move up the value chain so they can pay higher salaries and give Chinese people the job prospects and increased buying power they demand. They need Western businesses to help them to achieve this and scaring companies away is definitely not what they want.Despite this, the NDRC’s latest swoop on Western businesses could seem arbitrary (even though it’s not) and it is certainly politically motivated. However, we should realise that Western approaches to inbound trading are not that dissimilar. In Europe and the US, governments would probably seek to slap a tariff on any goods entering the marketplace if they faced little or no domestic competition (duties can also be added on to protect local competition). Is the NDRC’s action really that different?While pulling out of China would be an over-reaction, some Western companies that are already operating there or those thinking about entering the marketplace, may need to find new strategies to minimise the associated risks.A business will not be successful unless it recognises the need to provide a service in educating the local market, and is happy in doing so, in addition to selling its product or technology. By going in to business with a local partner, a planned strategy is put in place. The local partner will usually receive significant capital or taxation incentives, on top of the benefit gained by working with and learning from an incoming company.That said, a decent window of opportunity in a large market as well as working with a partner who the government is supporting and intending to make successful, can deliver a compelling business case and unique competitive advantage.They should start by making sure their own corruption and anti-bribery policies are robust and, where necessary, to make sure that local expertise is employed to guide them on the correct protocols. In this way, businesses will be doing what they can to manage their risks from the start. If they later find themselves the focus of an anti-trust probe, the worst they could be accused of would be ‘monopolistic pricing’, which from a rest-of-the-world perspective at least, would be less an indication of corruption and more of a company that was the victim of its own success.Another way to minimise risk would be to avoid over exposure to the marketplace in the first place. As tempting as it may seem given the size of the Chinese marketplace, rather than going full throttle to maximise sales there, it may be sensible to spread risk and seek entry to some other fast-developing Asian countries at the same time – and there are plenty to go for.It may also be possible to hedge against the risk of facing an anti-trust investigation by making sure your business interests in the country are firmly tied up in a joint venture, which is in fact a statutory requirement. This will ensure that Chinese people can learn from the services and knowledge you are bringing with you and can develop this commercially in the future.Finally, when it comes to reputational risk, businesses should take a balanced view. It would be easy to let such risks make their decision-making too risk averse, particularly when they see the headlines that anti-trust probes in China generate. It is important to remember that the rest of the world understands that China is a strictly-controlled marketplace and will remain that way.Roy Williams is managing director at Vendigital, a firm of procurement and supply chain specialists, operating globally and across industry sectors.

335;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-08-07T07:14:43Z;China’s anti-trust storm is set to intensify;;By Christian ShepherdThe spate of high-profile anti-trust investigations announced in recent weeks may be the tip of the iceberg in China’s growing enforcement of its six-year-old anti-monopoly law.The last eighteen months has seen more anti-trust activity by China’s regulatory bodies than in the previous four years since anti-monopoly laws were introduced in August 2008.In 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), responsible for ensuring fair pricing, levied record fines against a Japanese and Korean LCD cartel (Rmb353m), six international baby-formula producers (Rmb668.73m), and two Chinese white spirit producers (Rmb469m). The largest fine imposed in 2012, on a Chinese chemical company, was Rmb10.12m.“Last year was a milestone in the development of anti-monopoly law,” says Zhou Zhaofeng, a counsellor specialising in anti-monopoly law at Taylor Wessing. “But this year will be even greater.”Ongoing rumblings of anti-trust activity exploded this summer with recent dawn raids of Mercedes-Benz’s Shanghai office by the NDRC and a coordinated four-city search of Microsoft offices by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which is responsible for non price-related violations.These raids are “just the start,” according to Zhou. “In order to carry-out these sorts of investigations you need to be very skilled and have the staff on the ground. NDRC used to have two or three anti-monopoly staff, now they have more than forty.”On Wednesday, the NDRC announced fines against Audi, Chrysler, and a dozen Japanese car companies. Though the amount is yet uncertain, it is thought to be significant. Experts predict an ongoing investigation of US chipmaker Qualcomm to end with another record-breaking result, potentially above $1bn.“There’s a growing storm,” says Mark Jephcott, head of Asian competition practice at Herbert Smith Freehills. “Investigations are often ongoing, but they tend to hit the zeitgeist around the anniversary [of China's anti-monopoly law].”As the size, coordination, and publicity of anti-trust probes mounts, there are increasing concerns about regulatory bodies’ selection of cases and their underlying motivations.“The macro-economic objective of the regulators is to improve the efficiency the Chinese economy and the efficiency with which the CCP can manage the economy,” explains David Stallibass, co-editor of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law: The First Five Years and a director at Fingleton Associates.Despite these lofty goals, the current high-profile investigations into resale price maintenance, or price fixing practices, may be better at raising the profile of anti-trust investigations rather than improving overall efficiency.“They make good headlines,” says Stallibass. “They are relatively simple cases to make and intuitively they help Chinese consumers but they might not. Often all they do is move the costs elsewhere.”The decision to prioritise headline-grabbing cases may be tied to internal competition between the three regulatory bodies, all of which are currently vying for attention to secure a place within what has become an uncertain political environment since Xi Jinping took office in 2012.“Rule of Law” was announced last week as the theme for a key political meeting in October, the Fourth Plenum of the 18th Standing Committee. In a list of areas up for specialized attention, the official Xinhua news agency included “opening up monopolised sectors to competition”.For bodies like the NDRC, whose previous mandate was to manage the planned economy, high-profile anti-monopoly enforcement provides them a raison d’être within the reform agenda.Back to beyondbrics
336;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-08-07T03:03:59Z;Pantech calls for help as big South Korean rivals dominate;;For a company seeking to restore confidence in its prospects, the message to mobile operators this week from Pantech, the struggling South Korean smartphone maker, was curiously worded.“Please help us,” the company begged the nation’s three telecoms companies, as it urged them to commit to large-scale purchases of its unpopular mobile phones. “Without your support, Pantech has no option but to declare bankruptcy.”Smartphones have proved a totemic success for the powerful manufacturing sector that has driven South Korea’s economic growth. Samsung Electronics was the world’s biggest producer of the devices by market share in the second quarter of this year, with LG Electronics ranking fifth, according to IDC, the consultancy.Yet Pantech’s woes reflect widespread concerns in South Korea about the nation’s excessive reliance on a small number of globally successful companies, with smaller rivals all too often proving uncompetitive.Founded in 1991, privately owned Pantech survived a previous flirtation with bankruptcy in 2006, when its creditors agreed to a debt restructuring. Its move into smartphones had some success, with the company vying with LG for second place in the domestic market as recently as 2012.But its market share has since fallen, and the company is in danger of insolvency in spite of major investments last year from its suppliers Samsung and Qualcomm. In 2013, Pantech reported a net loss of Won620bn ($599m) on sales of Won1.4tn.Creditors including three South Korean banks and the country’s mobile phone networks have agreed in recent weeks to delay repayment of about Won450bn in debt for two years, but there is speculation that the company may still struggle to repay Won20bn of bonds coming due this month.One key challenge for Pantech, as with other midsized South Korean companies, has been the huge diversification and vertical integration of the chaebol business groups with which it competes.“Chaebols such as Samsung and LG have a perfect business system, with so many affiliates and dedicated subcontractors,” says Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Seoul’s Hansung University. “Pantech has to do everything by itself.”This pushed up the development costs of Pantech’s new flagship mobile phone, the Vega Iron 2, launched in May. The Vega series has enjoyed favourable reviews for its attractive design and sharp display.But the three South Korean mobile networks showed limited interest in stocking and promoting the new phone. This was a devastating blow in a country where, unlike in other markets such as China, the vast majority of handsets are sold by network operators, says Daniel Kim, an analyst at Macquarie.“If you are SK Telecom,” says Mr Kim, referring to the country’s biggest mobile operator, “the choice is simple. You want to work with the most popular handsets first.”Coupled with South Korean consumers’ demand for a large after-sales service network, this has helped to stymie sales of foreign smartphones in South Korea: Apple is the only foreign brand with meaningful market share, and others such as Taiwan’s HTC have pulled out altogether.Pantech and its suppliers are refusing to go quietly amid the fierce competition, calling on creditors and the government to intervene to save the jobs that depend on the ailing manufacturer.This week a group of Pantech suppliers wrote a letter to the telecoms operators and to President Park Geun-hye, warning that hundreds of small companies could face insolvency unless the mobile networks buy Pantech’s new phones.Yet such pleas appear to have met a cold reception. “Device demand should exist first,” says SK Telecom, warning it already has excessive stock of Pantech phones.“While Pantech’s situation is unfortunate, warping the market situation by providing financial support via over-purchasing of devices . . . would be difficult for mobile carriers.”Additional reporting by Tae-jun Kang
337;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Multinationals fret as China’s antimonopoly probes intensify;;A growing number of the world’s most powerful brands, from Microsoft to Mercedes, are being targeted in antimonopoly investigations in China, leaving all multinationals wondering if their Chinese investments could be next.The campaign is being led by China’s powerful state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, which has focused on alleged anti-competitive behaviour in pharmaceuticals, milk powder, technology and the car sector. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has also been involved.In several dramatic and heavily-publicised raids in recent days, investigators have visited the China offices of Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz to interrogate executives and confiscate computers.On Wednesday, the NDRC said it will impose hefty fines for “monopolistic behaviour” on Audi, Chrysler and 12 Japanese car and auto-parts makers.The agency is also investigating US chipmakerQualcomm for what it says are anti-competitive practices in China and has banned government and Communist Party procurement of products from Apple, Microsoft and antivirus software companies Symantec and Kaspersky Labs.The response from most of the companies that have been targeted - as well as other mulinationals operating in China - has been stunned silence.Executives at global companies with extensive operations in China say they are trying to work out whether this is part of a broader protectionist push by Beijing and how far the current campaign is likely to go. Those that have not yet been picked on are also hoping they can stay under the radar.“In previous [antimonopoly] cases it has been clear what laws they have violated but this time it’s not that clear,” said Zhaofeng Zhou, counsel at the law firm Taylor Wessing, referring to the antimonopoly investigations into foreign carmakers. “Some companies in this sector really don’t know what they’ve done wrong.”Some Chinese analysts believe the humbling of selected foreign companies is part of a broader nationalist and protectionist swing in the country ushered in by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took power in late 2012.The start of the antimonopoly investigations led by the NDRC can be traced almost exactly to Mr Xi’s inauguration, when he promised to realise the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.Jiang Liyong, a former diplomat and Commerce Ministry official with China’s WTO mission in Geneva and now a partner at Gaopeng Law Firm, says the use of antimonopoly legislation to punish foreign companies is intentional because such actions are not expressly forbidden under WTO or other international trade and investment rules.“That is why China is using these laws and why foreign companies have no recourse,” Mr Jiang said.He said there is currently a fierce debate within the Chinese government between “leftists” who think foreign companies should be squeezed out of the country in favour of domestic competitors and “rightists” who believe antimonopoly and other legislation should be applied equally to Chinese companies.For those who believe the wave of NDRC cases are part of a broader protectionist tilt, a series of other public attacks on the cybersecurity and food safety of global brands like Apple, Google, Walmart, KFC, Starbucks and McDonald’s appear to fit the pattern.But some analysts argue the NDRC-led campaign has more to do with institutional infighting and internal political turf wars than a master plan to exclude foreign investors from the country.One of the biggest institutional losers in the administrative reforms introduced by Mr Xi when he took office has been the NDRC, which was previously regarded as the most powerful of all China’s bureaucracies.The agency’s licensing, planning and approval powers have been significantly curtailed since Mr Xi took power and its standing within the government has plummeted, along with its ability to seek rents and procure bribes.“As the current administrative reforms deepen, the NDRC fears it might lose the power to carry out anti-monopoly investigations so it is pushing these high-profile investigations of foreign companies,” says Liu Xu, a researcher at the intellectual property and competition law research centre of Tongji University in Shanghai.Mr Liu points out that the NDRC has also investigated quite a few domestic companies but does not publicise those cases, which are often resolved by negotiation between the NDRC and agencies or powerful party leaders with close ties to the targeted companies.In this context, foreign companies are easier and more effective scapegoats since they usually do not have Communist Party elders to protect them and punishing them can have a powerful deterrent effect on entire sectors.Whatever the underlying motivation for the current campaign, there is no question that it has been highly popular among ordinary Chinese consumers, who often pay significantly more than in other markets for what are sometimes inferior products.Global carmakers, milk powder producers, pharmaceutical companies and some technology companies have all reduced prices for their products over the past year in response to the investigations.With results like that, it is unlikely the NDRC will be taking a break any time soon.Additional Reporting by Gu Yu and Christian Shepherd
338;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-08-03T15:47:33Z;US tech in China: pawns of villains?;Beijing’s moves seem to be part retribution and part opportunism;"Being labelled a “pawn of the villain” who must be “severely punished” is not a good sign. These were the words of the People’s Daily, a Chinese Communist party mouthpiece, in a recent article about US tech companies. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Cisco and Apple all came in for a scolding.China has already closed its doors to online media groups such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google. But recently a wider range of tech companies have been scrutinised by authorities. Last week four Microsoft offices in China were raided as part of an unexpected antimonopoly investigation. This follows a ban on Windows 8 for Chinese government use in May. US semiconductor designer Qualcomm has cut revenue projections this year and next due to Chinese licensees underreporting royalties; the company is also facing an antimonopoly investigation that could result in a fine of up to $1bn. Meanwhile, Cisco’s China sales slumped 4 per cent last quarter, and 5 per cent last year.The impact on the companies varies. If Microsoft were to lose its entire China business tomorrow, it would survive: its China sales are small (roughly the same as the Netherlands), due to rampant piracy. For Qualcomm, a hypothetical $1bn fine would be an eighth of operating income. Its problems with licensees, though, are more profound: the company forecasts 15 per cent of shipments of 3G and 4G devices will not be reported this year, which will translate into lost revenue. Licensing accounts for two-thirds of its profits.Beijing’s moves seem to be part Snowden backlash; part retribution for US hacking indictments; and part opportunism. It is hard to guess where they will end. The worst case scenario – being in effect shut out of China – will be easier for some than others. In any case, China’s 1.4bn customers are getting harder and harder to reach.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this article:The Chinese consumer is not the only loser / From Mr Willem Thorbecke"
339;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Microsoft targeted in China antitrust probe;;Microsoft has become the latest US company to be targeted by an antitrust investigation in China, as officials from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce visited some of its local offices on Monday.The move came days after it emerged that a separate investigation of Qualcomm was moving closer to a conclusion, after another competition body, the National Development and Reform Commission, determined that the US mobile chip company had used monopoly power in setting its licensing fees.Microsoft’s offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu were all the subject of unannounced visits from the SAIC, one of three Chinese antitrust bodies, Chinese media reported on Monday.In a statement, the US software company said: “We aim to build products that deliver the features, security and reliability customers expect, and we will address any concerns the government may have.”The investigation is the latest setback for Microsoft in China, following a ban on central government purchases of its Windows 8 PC software, which was imposed in May over alleged concerns about security.Pressure on US tech companies has intensified following the revelations of widespread US internet surveillance made by former intelligence consultant Edward Snowden over the past year. However, some US tech executives claim privately that the moves in China are part of a concerted attempt to favour local technology suppliers at the expense of American companies that dominate large parts of the sector.Many of the stepped-up Chinese antitrust measures predate the Snowden revelations and have hit foreign companies in sectors beyond technology. In Qualcomm’s case, the investigation of its royalties on wireless chips has been seen as an attempt to pressure it to lower its rates as China launches 4G networks.Last week, Qualcomm said the antitrust case had led local handset makers to hold back from signing licences for its products, hitting its revenues.Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsAn investigation into another US wireless licensing concern whose technology is used in 4G mobile networks, Interdigital, was dropped in May after the company bowed to demands to revise its licensing terms.The increased use of antitrust measures against foreign companies has brought accusations of protectionism from trade bodies including the US Chamber of Commerce.This year the business lobby group urged Washington to raise the issue in trade discussions with China. “It has become increasingly clear that the Chinese government has seized on using the [anti-monopoly law] to promote Chinese producer welfare, and to advance industrial policies that nurture domestic enterprises, rather than the internationally accepted norm of using competition law to protect consumer welfare and competition,” it said.
340;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-07-24T16:45:29Z;China a step closer to sanctioning Qualcomm;;Chinese regulators are a step closer to sanctioning US mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm, which puts chips in most of China’s 4G smartphones, a state newspaper said Thursday.As Qualcomm’s chief executive Steven Mollenkopf arrived in Beijing this week for more talks with the government, the Securities Times said an investigation into Qualcomm has determined that the company constitutes a monopoly, although no punishment has been decided. The Securities Times newspaper is published by the People’s Daily, the Communist party mouthpiece.In February China’s anti-monopoly regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), announced an investigation into Qualcomm’s pricing after it said that the chipmaker was suspected of abusing its market position in mobile phone chips. Qualcomm could face a fine of more than $1bn.“It appears that the antitrust investigation is close to being finished” said Roger Sheng, an analyst at Gartner, the high-tech consulting firm, “The next step is to decide the scope and level of the violation”.Zhanling Zhao, a lawyer at the Beijing Huicheng law firm, said the Securities Times story appeared to be aimed at pressuring not only Qualcomm, but also the NDRC, should the agency suffer “a failure of nerve”.“This will put NDRC on the spot as they will soon have to respond to the story’s claims” he said.Most analysts believe the investigation into Qualcomm is an effort to pressure the company into lowering its licensing fees amid the introduction of 4G networks in China, which started last year.Qualcomm chips are used in almost all the high end phones using China’s new 4G standards, said one person familiar with the industry.Qualcomm asks for royalties of approximately 3-4 per cent of the price of the phone, which is higher than other chipmakers, according to the expert.While in theory Qualcomm insists it has the right to collect all the royalties it is owed, in practice, according to another industry source, Qualcomm is not actively seeking to collect royalties for some 4G smartphones, which might be part of an effort to mollify the Chinese government.The person said the outlines of a deal between the Chinese government and Qualcomm were already clear: Qualcomm’s punishment will depend “on whether it seeks to collect the royalties from TD LTE vendors”. TD LTE is a 4G standard used by China Mobile, the state wireless monopoly.Qualcomm describes a different version of this, telling analysts on Wednesday that the NDRC investigation was creating uncertainty and hampering its efforts to collect licensing fees from vendors. It forecast it would miss out on licensing fees on 170m-260m handsets made in China this year, which caused Qualcomm’s share price to fall 5 per cent in after-hours trading. Qualcomm did not respond on Thursday to requests for comment.Recently Qualcomm has been making overtures to Beijing. On Thursday Mr Mollenkopf unveiled a $150m “strategic venture fund” to invest in technology start-ups there.Also this month, Chinese contract chip manufacturer SMIC announced it would be working with Qualcomm to manufacture advanced Snapdragon computer chips domestically, a step widely interpreted as an effort by Qualcomm to create goodwill.
341;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-07-23T23:24:14Z;Qualcomm latest US tech company to reverse in China;Shares slide after warning of lost fees on new mobile devices;"Qualcomm became the latest US technology company to suffer a reversal in China, as it warned on Wednesday that a government investigation there had added to its difficulties in collecting licensing fees on new mobile devices.The mobile chipmaker’s shares slid by as much as 5 per cent in after-market trading after it forecast that it would miss out on licensing fees on as many as a quarter of a billion smartphones and tablets made in China this year.The warning follows a dent to Chinese revenues at other US IT companies such as Cisco and IBM, which have been hit by falling demand amid reports of official Chinese moves to discourage purchases of US technology in the wake of the intelligence revelations by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden.Apple’s iPhone was also the subject of a critical report by the government-controlled CCTV this month over alleged privacy weaknesses. The company disclosed on Tuesday that robust sales in China had underpinned its results for the quarter ending in June.Qualcomm said that an official antitrust investigation in China, launched early this year, had caused some hardware companies to hold back from signing new licences to use its technology, which is included in all chipsets used in 3G and 4G devices.January 2014: FT San Francisco correspondent Tim Bradshaw reports on his interview at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive-elect of Qualcomm“It’s clear to us that the investigation, among other things, is creating an increased level of uncertainty with the licensing base in China right now,” George Davis, chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts on Wednesday.Qualcomm said that other factors behind the lost Chinese licence fees included a contract dispute with an unidentified large handset maker; an underreporting by some companies of the number of handsets they ship; and the time it would take to reach agreements with makers of low-priced tablets that had never held licences from the company before.A failure to correctly forecast the timing of new LTE network launches in China had also contributed to a failure to license the many handset makers who produce LTE-only devices in time, the company said. In all, it predicted that it would miss out on fees on 170m-260m handsets made in China this year."
342;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-06-12T22:26:52Z;Taxing time ahead as offshore rules come under more scrutiny;;The OECD called it “ the golden age” of tax planning: a period in which multinational companies pushed ever more of their profits offshore and pushed their effective tax rates down.In the past eight years, this simple strategy has enabled some of the largest US corporations – including Oracle, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson – to cut their tax bills by a quarter, on average – while boosting their annual earnings by up to 24 per cent.But there are signs that both politicians and investors are increasingly questioning the merits of a tax regime that has made such savings possible.Earlier this week, the joint committee on taxation, which advises the US Congress, warned that American companies were incurring extra costs from keeping their profits outside the US. It cited research showing a “ballooning” of company balance sheets, as multinationals chose to borrow more for spending purposes, rather than repatriate their offshore cash and pay US tax on it.Investors are also starting to worry that the positive effect of tax-cutting strategies on companies’ earnings could go into reverse. Earlier this month, Luca Paolini, chief strategist of Pictet Asset Management, warned investors against complacency by pointing out that a quarter of international companies’ improvement in net margins had been achieved only by reducing their tax bills.Many technology and pharmaceuticals companies have been at the forefront of a 15-year push by US multinationals to earn more of their profits in tax havens and in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Singapore.To measure this, the Financial Times reviewed the accounts of 14 cash-rich tech and pharmaceuticals companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Amgen, EMC, eBay, Eli Lilly and Medtronic.Between them, the 14 held $479bn-worth of cash and similar assets offshore – a little more than half of the $947bn of total offshore cash that Moody’s estimated was held by US non-financial companies at the end of 2013.By doing so, the 14 companies surveyed cut their tax rates by an average of 7.7 percentage points between 2004-06 and 2011-13. In the most recent period, they were, on average, taxed at a rate of just 10 per cent, down from 11 per cent in 2004-06. By comparison, average OECD corporate tax rates fell 3.4 points to 25.15 per cent over that timescale.A little more than 85 per cent of this average tax reduction could be attributed to the companies’ fast expanding foreign operations.Many of the companies point out that these apparently low foreign tax rates are not the full story. Investors, they say, are fully aware that they owe extra tax to the US – at a rate of up to 35 per cent – on any foreign earnings when they are brought back to the US.They are exempt only from reporting the “deferred” tax charge – reflecting the money they will ultimately have to pay the US – in their accounts for as long as they can prove the profits are being indefinitely reinvested abroad. And a company’s decision to indefinitely reinvest its cash overseas can be reversed, resulting in big increases in the reported tax rates. For example, eBay recently surprised the market by reporting a $2.3bn loss after recording a $3bn deferred tax liability, saying that it needed the “flexibility” to use foreign cash for US dealmaking.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals company, also bucked the trend of falling tax rates, after a 2011 change in its accounting treatment. It has provided for $6.6bn of deferred tax – nearly two-thirds of its total tax bill over the past three years. It was the only company surveyed by the FT to report a tax rate above 25 per cent for 2011-13, except for Apple, which also reports “deferred” tax on some of its offshore earnings.Regulators are now pushing some cash-rich companies to disclose more details of their offshore cash. Google recently had to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to spend up to $30bn on foreign acquisitions and technology rights, after it was challenged to describe its “specific plans” for reinvesting undistributed earnings.In addition, the SEC has called on some companies to explain why their foreign profits are “disproportionate” to their foreign sales. On average, the companies surveyed by the FT reported two-thirds of their profits outside the US but only half their sales. This followed an eight-year period in which foreign profits grew at nearly three times the pace of foreign sales – a trend similar to one identified by Harry Grubert, senior economist at the US Treasury. He warned that “profits, not sales, are being globalised” after discovering a 14 percentage-point increase in foreign profits at multinationals, as a proportion of the total, between 1996 and 2004.Last year, the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, warned that the process was continuing as US companies moved more profits out of high tax countries, including the US, into “tax preferred” countries, such as Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.Some companies argue that relatively higher profit margins outside the US are to be expected, given the heavy research and development costs they incur in their home country, the cost of servicing US debt, the cost of their corporate headquarters and, in some cases, US litigation costs.David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes and assistant treasurer of Eli Lilly, says that it is “unremarkable” that the company’s reinvested earnings had more than doubled in a period when sales growth had only nearly doubled. “This doubling should be expected of a company that is growing throughout the world, especially in non-US markets,” he argues.Oracle, Johnson & Johnson and EMC declined to comment. Pfizer, Cisco, Qualcomm, Merck, Amgen and Medtronic did not respond to request for comment. Google made no formal comment and eBay said that it complied with all international tax rules. Microsoft and Apple referred to past statements in which they said that they abided by US and foreign tax laws – but believed they should be improved.‘Book tax’ more important than cash kindUS companies invest about 55 per cent of their near $2tn of foreign earnings in productive assets, such as factories and offices, according to academic research. But some of them have told researchers that they would bring more of this cash back to the US if they were not deterred by the prospect of high tax bills.Companies also say that the accounting rules create an incentive for them to designate their offshore earnings as “permanently reinvested” abroad, as this spares them from the need to earmark money in their accounts to pay future US tax bills.Academic studies have even found that so called “book tax” – the tax bill that is reported in a company’s accounts, but may vary from the “cash tax” amount that is actually paid – can influence share prices, executive bonuses and competitor analysis.Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California says: “Book tax is extremely important. It is the filter through which we see companies. It dominates corporate behaviour much more than cash taxes do.”Michelle Hanlon, a professor at MIT, says that her research shows that moving offshore and retaining cash there is at least in part driven by “the accounting for taxes that shows up on the financial accounting statements”, in addition to the real financial impact.

344;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-06-02T18:44:46Z;Broadcom eyes options for mobile chip unit;;Chip designer Broadcom said on Monday that it was looking to sell or wind down one of its phone-related divisions, another sign of consolidation in the mobile chip industry as the growth in smartphone sales slows.The California-based company said it was exploring options for its cellular baseband division, which makes the chips that help phones connect to mobile networks. Divestiture would save Broadcom around $700m a year, some of which it will reinvest in research, it said.Other US chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and Freescale have quit the mobile chip business. Broadcom said it had hired JPMorgan as an adviser but cautioned that the work was not guaranteed to lead to a sale.“It remains to be seen whether Broadcom will find a buyer for its baseband business as historically Freescale, ST-Ericsson, TI and Renesas Mobile all struggled to sell their baseband businesses,” said Stuart Robinson at Strategy Analytics.The market for baseband chips is highly competitive and led by Qualcomm, another California-based group that has aggressively invested in developing new products and gaining market share.Qualcomm’s market share is 58 per cent, while Broadcom now has 4 per cent, according to researcher Forward Concepts.Phonemakers have also moved away from having a specialised chip for each function – running applications, connecting to cellular and wifi networks, and for bluetooth connections – and instead towards having only one integrated chip that performs all those functions. This has hurt Broadcom, which remained a specialist in chips that provide connectivity functions only even as Qualcomm and MediaTek increasingly provided integrated chips.Broadcom also raised its guidance for the upcoming quarter, saying it expected gross product margin to be near or above the high end of the forecasted range.
345;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-05-19T21:15:19Z;Google buys New York start-up Divide;;Investment bankers addicted to Candy Crush, take heart. Google has bought Divide, a New York-based start-up that lets users securely separate their work and personal data on smartphones and tablets, effectively turning one device into two.The idea is to help Google attract business customers dealing with a generation of “ bring your own device” workers – people who reject the clunky hardware favoured by many big companies, and instead use their own smartphones for work documents and emails.This self-service approach poses a problem for companies which cannot control security on those devices, and which risk losing their sensitive data and intellectual property if an employee misplaces their personal phone in the back of a taxi.The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Divide had previously raised $25m from investors including the venture arms of Google, Qualcomm and Comcast.Divide, formerly known as Enterproid, was founded in 2010 by three mobile executives who met at Morgan Stanley in New York – “a software house masquerading as an investment bank”, said co-founder and chief operating officer Alexander Trewby. He was referring to the bank’s innovations in areas such as high-frequency trading and mobile technology.“Back in early 2000s, we were one of the only firms on Wall Street to have a mobile engineering team,” Mr Trewby said.Divide will join Google’s Android operating system team and shut its office in London to work alongside Google. It also has offices in Hong Kong and headquarters in New York.The software allows users to flick seamlessly between personal and secured work applications, and lets employers wipe data remotely in the event the device is lost.The move should help Google extend Android’s reach as a tool for businesses. Google’s open-source model and the fact it has a relatively permissive approach to who can sell apps in its store, has made Android more vulnerable than Apple’s operating system to malware. It has also provoked some concern among potential enterprise customers.Apple, by contrast, adopts a more restrictive stance towards developers in its store. The company is reported to be working on introducing a split-screen function for the next generation of iOS, which currently only allows one app to be displayed at a time.Managing security on workers’ devices is particularly important in regulated industries like banking, where data breaches can attract hefty fines. In 2009, HSBC was fined over £3m when customer data were lost in the post.Research group Gartner estimates that by 2016, one in five “bring your own device” programs put in place by enterprises will not work, because they will be too restrictive and employees will work around them.For younger generations, the line between work and play is blurry, said Gordon Graylish, vice-president of sales and marketing at Intel.“Millennials want access to both personal and work content on their business devices and there is a desire by companies to have the ability to separate [the two],” he said. Big companies are concerned about being able to attract and retain a younger workforce and need products that cater to that need, he added.Mr Trewby said Divide had noticed a spike in activity around Thanksgiving, because people appear to be taking the opportunity of time away from the office to go through work emails.

Other investors are expected to join the Formula E board.Formula E has secured 10 city-centre destinations for its first season, including Beijing, Miami, Los Angeles, London and Berlin.Ten teams will each field two drivers driving cars capable of speeds greater than 225kph during hour-long races. Qualcomm is attracted to Formula E as a showcase for its wireless charging technology, a feature likely to be introduced in the second season.Because the cars will have limited battery life in the first season, drivers will have to stop midway through the race and switch to a second car.Engines will be in power-saving modes for most of the races, but cars can accelerate using a set number of power boosts, some of which will be determined by fans voting for their favourite drivers.Steve Pazol of Qualcomm said: “Formula E is the perfect way to demonstrate the leading edge of technology of this next generation of environmentally responsible transportation.”Formula E has raised over €70m from rights deals with broadcasters such as Fox Sports in the US, Asahi of Japan and ITV in the UK, and sponsors including Qualcomm, DHL, Michelin and Renault. The promoter expects to break even towards the end of the first season.Team backers include Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who is backing Monaco-based Venturi Automobiles, and entrepreneur Richard Branson, who is funding a Virgin Racing team. Team budgets are expected to be up to €3.5m.Among the team principals is four-times Formula One world champion Alain Prost, who is co-founder of the Le Mans-based e.dams team.Car manufacturers will be following the inaugural season closely before deciding whether to participate by developing their own cars.Cars for the inaugural season have been manufactured by a consortium including Renault, Spark Racing Technology, Italian chassis maker Dallara and the technology arms of Formula One teams McLaren and Williams.All the teams will test the cars at new facilities built at Donington Park in Leicestershire which opens on Thursday.roger.blitz@ft.comTwitter: @rogerblitz

In recent years, these toxic asset dumps have been an add-on for European banks as aspirational as conservatories for suburban homeowners.By splitting out the results of weak “non-core” units, a bank presents the better numbers of its “core” divisions as the message investors should focus on. Barclays, whose profits have been disappointing, must envy Lloyds, whose two-bucket approach has won City favour.Non-core assets are designated as belonging to the cosmic-sounding “Exit Quadrant” at Barclays, but are not split out as a division. There is some truth in the quip that at Barclays the acronym “NC” for “non-core” really means “North Colonnade”, the address of its UK investment bank. Most of the $54bn of risk-weighted assets consist of such sulphurous spawn of the credit crunch as collateralised loan obligations.Banishing these and billions more of encumbrances to a bad bank could play well with investors at next week’s strategy day. But recategorising a problem does not eliminate it. Prospective bad bank boss Eric Bommensath must use the heft his new role gives him to shrink assets fast. Lloyds and RBS started with toxic trash piles of more than £200bn each and reduced them to £63bn and £38bn respectively.Nor should chief executive Antony “AJ” Jenkins use the rebadging of the Exit Quadrant as a diversionary tactic to duck tough decisions over the investment bank. Bernstein’s Chirantan Barua argues tougher regulation has eliminated 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the income once generated in the fixed-interest segment, where Barclays is strong. The consequences for employment are clear.Wolfson wolfedIt is better to travel than to arrive, unless you dawdle for as long as Wolfson Microelectronics, writes Kate Burgess.The niche audio chipmaker promised much when it was spun out of Edinburgh University in 1984. In the early days it was lauded as a template for capitalising on the clever ideas of dons and creating high-tech giants to rival Microsoft.Today, though, Wolfson is defined less by potential realised than by customers lost, notably Apple in 2008 when US rival Cirrus Logic won the contract to supply audio chips for iPhone 3GS. On Tuesday, Wolfson blamed a $20m fall in first-quarter revenues on losing out to Qualcomm.Now, a much bigger Cirrus is offering to take on the Edinburgh business for 235p a share. That is a 75 per cent premium to the undisturbed price and over 20 times 2015 earnings forecasts, which are based tentatively on Wolfson finally making money from the growing demand for voice recognition technology. Cirrus has its eye on Wolfson’s intellectual property and its customers, such as Samsung. But the US group also intends to slash $12m in costs. Many will moan about British jobs lost and the end to dreams for university spin-offs in general and of Wolfson as a British high-tech hub in particular. But given the Scottish group’s patchy record, it is hardly surprising the board is prepared to hand over the keys. Odey Asset Management was the first to pledge its 6 per cent stake. The rest should follow.Bulldog bossHe will schmooze them in the restaurants. He will schmooze them in the boardrooms. He will never surrender. Rupert Soames, whose status as Winston Churchill’s grandson is remarked by the press and his physiognomy, has to revive Serco, whose shares fell 15 per cent on Tuesday.The outsourcer, a key contractor to the UK government, issued a profits warning after markets closed on Monday and said an equity issue was on the way. The drop in the stock anticipated a smaller dividend spread over more shares. Futile for Serco to complain that only a placing, not a £500m rights, loomed. As a rule of thumb, that signals an issue of less than 10 per cent of outstanding shares, worth £160m at Tuesday morning’s market capitalisation.The City thinks more will be needed later. Serco has net debt of about £725m, which lenders require to remain below 3.5 times underlying earnings. Analysts expect the latter figure to fall to about £240m this year, leaving headroom perilously low.Mr Soames, ex-chief executive of Aggreko, may thus get his own bite at the equity-raising cherry after he starts on Thursday. Writedowns and disposals may also ensue. In a modest echo of Grandpa’s role, his job is to rally a demoralised audience. Some customers are withholding discretionary spending. Loosening their purse strings will require all Mr Soames cask-aged charm. He has a fair chance of succeeding, thereby stabilising the shares and the government’s battered outsourcing programme.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com

The company said it flew 11.2m passengers in February, a 1 per cent rise from a year earlier.Wall Street analysts expect Delta to report first-quarter profits of $247m on sales of $8.9bn, 5 per cent higher than one year ago.The figures were considerably better than those reported by United Airlines days ago, which showed 22,500 cancellations in the same period.That, coupled with a late Easter and spring holiday for many schools, will crimp United passenger revenues per available seat mile between 0.5 and 2.5 per cent in the quarter.Nonetheless, airlines have been one of the bright spots for US equity markets since the year began with carriers making up four of the five best performing members of the Dow Jones Transportation Index.Delta shares advanced 5.7 per cent on Tuesday to $34.45.JC Penney shares jumped 4.1 per cent to $8.29 after rating agency Standard & Poor’s raised its outlook on the company from neutral to stable, indicating the possibility of a downgrade in the coming months has receded.Standard & Poor’s said the retailer, which has struggled since its failed turnround by former chief executive Ron Johnson, had made progress and “stabilised” its business.The rating agency noted the company’s liquidity position was “adequate” to service its debts this year.Last Wednesday, JC Penney said it expected to finish 2014 with $2bn in cash and cash equivalents, roughly the same as at the end of last year, and grow same-store sales 3 to 5 per cent in the first quarter.The company has $5.5bn in debt outstanding, including $2.5bn due in 2018.“However, we believe the company’s capital structure is unsustainable in the longer term but it does not have any meaningful maturities over the next 12 months and so we do not see a clear path to default,” analyst David Kuntz said.The rating agency affirmed JC Penney’s ‘CCC+’ rated debt.Qualcomm, the maker of chips used in mobile phones, sweetened its returns for shareholders ahead of its annual meeting today, sending its shares 3.4 per cent higher to $76.11.The San Diego-based company announced a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend from 35 to 42 cents, as well as a $5bn boost to its share buyback programme.The new scheme lifts the outstanding buyback authorisation to $7.8bn as Qualcomm purchased $2bn in shares over the past five months.“Our business continues to generate strong operating cash flows driven by the global adoption of our advanced technologies, including 3G and 4G, enabling us to continue to invest in our strategic growth opportunities,” chief executive Paul Jacobs said.Bond insurer MBIA jumped 11.4 per cent to $14.84 after it said it reduced its exposure to soured loans in the fourth quarter. Profits in the period fell 79 per cent from a year earlier to $132m.Overall, US equity markets rose sharply on Tuesday as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to step back from a threat to push further into Ukraine.The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,873.91, a new record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.4 per cent to 16,395.88.

Lenovo recently agreed to acquire Google’s Motorola smartphone unit.On the eve of the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, Microsoft also unveiled its support for Qualcomm design and the US chipmaker’s Snapdragon 200 and 400 chipsets. Analysts view Qualcomm support as crucial if Microsoft is to get Windows Phone on to cheaper phones and compete more effectively with Android- based handsets, particularly in emerging markets.Microsoft also announced minor updates to Windows Phone 8 and its desktop and tablet Windows 8.1 operating system.

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The revenue gap should not be five times.”MediaTek still makes chips mainly for Asian handset makers such as Lenovo, ZTE, Coolpad and Xiaomi, which are growing fast as emerging markets embrace cheaper smartphones as a primary means of internet access.However, the Taiwanese company now wants to become more established in western markets, and recently opened an office in San Diego, California, that will employ 150 people. Qualcomm is also based in the city.“We are looking for more revenue outside China,” Mr Ku said. “Before we were business to business, and not a household name . . . but we need to go global and outside the emerging markets.”It is not just about iPhones. It’s about providing for everybody. Not just innovation for features but making it accessible. The top end of the market is moving down and the bottom moving upMediaTek wants to make smartphones more affordable with its range of technologically advanced chips that are cheaper than those produced by rivals such as Qualcomm. Mr Ku said that MediaTek was “monitoring” opportunities to develop for Windows phones but had no plans for any components suitable for Apple’s iOS.“This is rebranding of the company in what we call the ‘super-mid market’ for smartphones, which makes up the majority of the world’s devices,” added Johan Lodenius, chief marketing officer for MediaTek. “We are going after the 4G market in a big way.“It is not just about iPhones. It’s about providing for everybody. Not just innovation for features but making it accessible. The top end of the market is moving down and the bottom moving up.”Mr Lodenius added that the move for cheaper components would not affect margins however, which has been a worry for analysts.
352;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-01-21T19:03:28Z;Mounting cash piles an embarrassment of riches for tech companies;;A growing number of big US technology companies are heeding the call from Wall Street to hand more of their excess cash back to shareholders. But that does not look likely to stop a huge build-up of liquid reserves that has already left the sector with a cash mountain of historic proportions.By the middle of last year, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few tech winners had left just six companies – Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Oracle and Qualcomm – with more than a quarter of the $1.5tn held by US non-financial corporations, according to rating agency Moody’s.With nearly $150bn in its coffers, Apple alone was sitting on close to 10 per cent of corporate America’s cash.Behind this build-up lies a boom in profits in an industry that often displays winner-takes-all characteristics and where capital needs are usually low. Apple’s spending on plant, equipment and acquisitions has used up just 10-15 per cent of its operating cash flow in recent years. Even Google, at the peak of a spending surge three years ago that unnerved Wall Street, was investing little more than a third of its cash flow on building out its network.Alongside the strong cash generation has been a habit of hoarding, caused partly by an innate conservatism in a sector where fortunes can reverse quickly. Steve Jobs, who had his own brush with bankruptcy, paid out nothing at all in dividends and buybacks, even though Apple generated $55bn in free cash flow in his final three years at the helm.But as the cash mountains have grown, a second factor has assumed even greater significance. Due largely to tax avoidance strategies that have made it possible to book profits in low-tax countries, much of the tech cash is held offshore. Rather than return it to the US to pay dividends or fund buybacks and incurring an extra tax charge, most tech companies have preferred to wait – and lobby in Washington – for a tax holiday.Some, such as Cisco, have purposely set out on a series of foreign acquisitions to use the cash in a tax-efficient way, though the scarcity of potential targets has limited its effectiveness.This has left the tech companies looking increasingly constrained. Apple paid out $33bn to shareholders last year – and had the proportion of its cash sitting offshore jumped 8 percentage points, to 76 per cent. Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm have also had big increases: some 94 per cent of Microsoft’s $81bn is now outside the US.Of non-financial companies in the S&P Global 1200 index, just 8.4 per cent hold 50 per cent of the cashExplore graphic“Given many are cash rich, the attraction of cash proceeds from a sale of an asset is less attractive than a few years ago, as attractive alternative use of proceeds is increasingly an issue for the recipient,” says Mervyn Metcalf, of boutique investment bank Dean Street Advisors.The embarrassment of riches has become a contentious issue on Wall Street. Applying a normal earnings multiple to the after-tax returns on cash produces much less in stock market value than the face value of the cash holdings, says Stuart Francis, head of technology banking at Barclays. As a result, he adds: “Excess cash can be a boat anchor on valuation.”Even Apple has not been immune from the growing pressure, though activist Carl Icahn has reduced his call for the amount of cash to be returned to shareholders by two-thirds, to $50bn.Even without direct pressure, more tech concerns have started to show a greater readiness to earmark their future profits for dividends or buybacks. In November, Qualcomm pledged that it would return three-quarters of its free cash flow to shareholders. Fellow chipmaker Texas Instruments went one better, saying earlier in the year that it hoped to distribute all of its free cash flow.Caught between Wall Street pressure to distribute more of their money and the realities of the tax code, some have turned to borrowing to fund their cash needs. Last month, Microsoft led the way, adding to its existing $14bn of debt as it turned to the capital markets to borrow $8bn more.With activist shareholders increasing their pressure on the most vulnerable, low-growth tech companies, there is likely to be considerably more debt coming, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody’s.One result is likely to be a weakening of balance sheets across the industry. Chip company Altera was among the first to confront this, announcing last year that it would issue $1bn of debt – and promptly had two notches taken off its credit rating.Yet for the biggest tech companies, there is still plenty of room for manoeuvre. Apple could raise another $20bn-$50bn in debt before its ratings come under pressure, according to Moody’s. That makes it likely that 2014 will be a year when both cash and debt levels soar in the tech world.
353;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-01-09T17:15:01Z;Sony smartwatch that thinks its time has come;Has the technology been developed to turn this smartphone accessory into something more?;"Wearable technology including smartwatches – wristworn miniscreens linked to your smartphone – is one of the most talked-about trends at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. The show presented an excellent opportunity to put the new version of Sony’s smartwatch through its paces.Sony SmartWatch 2 (Rating: 4/5)
This week I have been threading my way through the crowds at the annual CES technofest wearing a Sony SmartWatch 2, one of the many new wearable technology devices on display here.Among the smartwatches on show or launched here this week were new models from Pebble (Pebble 2.0), Qualcomm (Toq Smartwatch), Magellan (Echo), Ezio and E Fun (Nextone). They join Samsung’s Galaxy Gear and Sony’s SmartWatch 2. Most smartwatches function as smartphone accessories or extensions to deliver email, message alerts and other smartphone services to your wrist.As one of the first smartwatch makers, Sony’s experience shows. The SmartWatch 2, launched late last year, fuses high tech with high fashion. It would look perfectly at home on a fashion show walkway or in a boardroom with its black metallic case, single stainless steel on/off button and square glass display.The SmartWatch 2 links by Bluetooth wireless connection to any Android-based smartphone running one of the latest versions of Google’s operating system.Pairing my SmartWatch 2 with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone took less than a minute, before downloading Sony’s Smart Connect software to the handset. Next, I downloaded a selection of apps. My selection from the 300 or so available so far included apps that display my Gmail messages, calendar and appointments, SMS messages, a weather app, and a pedometer app – my daily average at CES was more than 18,000 steps.All these apps are also available on smartphones, but the SmartWatch 2 does provide a handy way to check on information, such as the time or the weather forecast, without having to dig around in a bag or pocket for the smartphone.The email and SMS message alerts were particularly useful. I could sneak a peek at who was calling while in a meeting without pulling out my smartphone. I skimmed emails quickly but found apps that involve touching the screen – including the phone number dialler – more awkward. At that point it was easier to pull out my smartphone than struggle with the tiny virtual keypad.Overall the SmartWatch 2 proved very useful at CES, especially since I have given up wearing a wristwatch.That said, smartwatches are not in fact that smart. Most, including the SmartWatch 2, function simply as wrist-based mini-screens relaying information from a host smartphone. Nice to have, but until they do more I’m not sure they are worth the $200 that most currently cost, including the SmartWatch 2.Sony also introduced a tiny wearable sensor device called the Core at CES. The Core, about the size of a USB thumbstick and with no screen, can be clipped on to clothing or fitted inside a special wristband and measures activities such as movement and sleep.Working with your smartphone, the Core can also track the music you listen to, photos you take and social networking interaction with friends and colleagues. This information is aggregated and displayed in Sony’s Lifelog smartphone app that shows you how you have spent your time.Planet of the AppsPaul Taylor picks his favourite from the apps on show at CESWhat it is: FileThis, web-based app, free to try while in trial mode.Why you should try it: FileThis automatically fetches all your paperless statements, documents and bills, sorts and indexes them then files them on your PC, or in cloud-based storage services including Dropbox, Google Drive and Evernote. However, at present the service can only retrieve statements from about 300 US financial institutions, utilities and other companies."
354;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2014-01-07T09:06:46Z;CES 2014: Intel throws weight behind wearable tech and ‘internet of things’;;Intel’s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, threw the chipmaker’s weight behind wearable technology and the “internet of things” in his opening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday night.In his first appearance at the technology event since being appointed chief five months ago, Mr Krzanich unveiled several products and initiatives aimed at leapfrogging the smartphone and tablet world, where Intel has struggled against Arm Holdings, into buzzy but unproved new markets.He also announced that after a four-year environmental initiative, all the chips that Intel shipped in 2014 would be free of “ conflict minerals”, obtained from regions with poor human rights records such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.“For most of my career, computing has been something you hold in your hand, maybe have in your pocket or that sits on your desk,” Mr Krzanich said. “That idea is about to be transformed.”While evangelising on the subject of wearable technology such as smart watches, and the ability to connect new kinds of household objects to the internet, Mr Krzanich admitted that so far most innovations were “not solving real problems”.Leading Intel’s bid to change that is its tiny PC-on-a-chip, Edison, intended to ape the success of the Raspberry Pi, which is popular with hardware developers and tinkerers – and a $1.3m competition for the best ideas in wearable technology.It showed off its own designs for a smart watch, which unlike most on the market does not require a tethered smartphone. The device also offers the ability to track its wearer, which Intel said could be useful for parents of young children.A pair of “smart” earbuds can track the heartbeat of the person wearing them, while playing music, a device Intel hopes will appeal to runners – including Mr Krzanich himself. Another piece of “smart” headgear is an earpiece that lets the wearer chat to a virtual assistant on a smartphone, using voice commands rather than touching the screen.Another prototype that will go on sale this year is a bowl that allows devices placed in it to be charged wirelesslyYet another prototype – Mr Krzanich said all would go on sale this year – is a bowl that allows the devices placed in it to be charged wirelessly. In an attempt to improve the apprearance of wearable technologies that use its chips, Intel announced a partnership with fashion brands and organisations including Barney’s and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.Although he unveiled many products, Mr Krzanich did not provide any forecasts for the size of the market or the speed of its development. Intel has suffered from the decline in PC sales and missed opportunities in mobile devices.Earlier in the day, another Intel executive predicted that at the current rate of progress in the capacity of chip technology, known as Moore’s law, there would be as many transistors on a processor as neurons in a human brain within 12 years. This feat would enable more natural kinds of human-computer interaction, according to senior vice-president for perceptual computing, Mooly Eden.Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsDespite its newfound enthusiasm for wearable technology, Intel has not given up on new ideas for PCs. Another product unveiled on Monday will allow PCs to run both Windows and Google’s Android operating systems, switching between secure business software and cheap consumer apps at the touch of a button.Intel’s push into wearable technology and the internet of things follows a similar drive by Qualcomm, a rival that has been more successful in smartphones and tablets.Last year Qualcomm released the Toq watch using its own wireless charging and display technology, a move intended to galvanise manufacturers into making similar products at larger scale.Qualcomm’s Paul Jacobs led the opening keynote at CES last year, and was replaced as chief executive last month.
355;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Apple, Google and Facebook are latter-day Scrooges;Why are the most successful companies on the planet acting like misers in a Balzac novel?;All across the world companies have in recent years been hoarding cash, nowhere more so than in the US. For at least a decade and a half, cash has progressively increased its share of the American corporate balance sheet, to the point where US quoted companies have turned into the Scrooges of the global economy. According to research by Juan Sánchez and Emircan Yurdagul of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, their cash hoard had reached almost $5tn by the end of 2011.Such is the scale of this cash pile that the US corporate sector must have been partly responsible for the surge in demand for safe assets and the decline in interest rates that fuelled the US housing bubble. Yet American business has been spared the opprobrium heaped on excess savers such as China, whose official reserves top $3.5tn. There is nonetheless something fundamentally different about the US corporate cash pile compared with those of, say, China and Japan, where burgeoning corporate sector savings have increasingly fuelled global imbalances.Corporate savings consist of depreciation and retained earnings. For much of the past 20 years the Chinese government has urged state-owned companies not to distribute profits, which would help push up retentions. In the absence of developed financial markets, companies are more reliant, too, on internal financing. For its part, Japan is a mature economy in which investment opportunities are insufficient to absorb the country’s domestic savings.In contrast, corporate miserliness in the US is driven by the technology sector. I calculate that the combined cash and liquid investments of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Oracle, Qualcomm and Facebook now top $340bn, a near-fivefold increase since the start of the millennium. What differentiates these tech companies from most of the other businesses that contributed to the American corporate cash nest egg is that they have little or no borrowings. In the case of Apple, the build-up of liquidity from $24.5bn five years ago to $129.8bn today would have done credit to the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.This extraordinary penchant for saving has been antisocial in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when the world was suffering from deficient demand. With many billions of corporate dollars pouring exclusively into money market funds and bonds, the existing fiscal and regulatory bias against equity investment in the US will be given a new twist. Such behaviour also leaves us with a paradox. Why are the most successful and innovative companies on the planet acting like misers in a Balzac novel during a dramatic technological revolution that is leading to the digitisation of virtually everything? How can there be inadequate investment opportunities to absorb all this money, much of which earns a negative real return?In fact we have been here before. In the 1930s John Maynard Keynes worried that the economy was hostage to the volatile instincts of businessmen. Money’s function as a store of value appeared problematic to him because it allowed entrepreneurs to retreat from investing when confronting uncertainty. And he railed at the capitalist system’s reliance on “the love of money” as he put it, to drive economic growth.Today it is not individual entrepreneurs who are gloating over their cash. It is more a kind of corporate narcissism. Yet fear and uncertainty have undoubtedly played a part in causing a conspicuous acceleration in saving since the financial crisis. And in a fast-moving globalised market the flexibility that cash affords in the ultra-competitive technology sector matters.The precautionary motive is not the only spur to cash consciousness. Corporate governance may be a factor. Apple, Microsoft and Google are immune from the discipline of hostile takeover. Many technology companies have a two-tier voting structure that allows founding entrepreneurs to enjoy voting control with a minority of the capital, so they are under little pressure to raise payouts – although the shareholder activist Carl Icahn hopes to squeeze more out of Apple, where he recently bought a stake.Some argue that because a majority of the cash is held outside the US, taxation is at the root of it. Certainly, tough US tax rules on bringing money home provides an explanation of why cash is not repatriated, but surely not why it goes uninvested. The world’s investment opportunities are not, after all, confined to the US.The most plausible reason for this corporate thriftiness is surely that information technology, social networks and the rest are driven by human, not financial, capital. Those such as Google or LinkedIn are the very opposite of capital-intensive and the parts of the industrial process that are capital-intensive at Apple or Microsoft are substantially outsourced. This chimes with the fact that the biggest cash hoarders are large research and development spenders.Such companies resort to the equity market chiefly to provide an exit for venture capitalists or to acquire a currency for takeovers. And they can reasonably argue that it is inappropriate for the owners of financial capital, which is especially abundant in a world of excess savings, to have all the control rights in the corporation when human capital drives growth.With recovery, the precautionary motive is set to wane, but in this brave new world America’s technology wizards will still be condemned to spew out cash that they cannot absorb in business investment. It is a novel quirk in the workings of late capitalism.john.plender@ft.com
356;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;China arrest threat for staff of US patent group;;China’s antitrust authorities have threatened to arrest representatives of a US patent licensing company that is embroiled in a legal dispute with telecoms equipment maker Huawei, the US group has said.The claim comes as China’s National Development and Reform Commission, its powerful central planning agency, has taken a more assertive stance on enforcing the country’s monopoly laws against foreign companies. Wireless technology has become a recent focus as China prepares for the launch of new high-speed 4G networks.Interdigital, a San Diego-based intellectual property group that holds a portfolio of patents in high-speed wireless communications, said it had been warned by the NDRC that any executives or legal representatives who attends a meeting that is due to take place in Beijing on Wednesday might be detained or arrested.“It’s highly unusual and, we think highly improper,” said William Merritt, chief executive officer of Interdigital. In a letter to the NDRC, Mr Merritt said that, “in the light of the threat to detain my executives,” he would not send anyone to China to attend the meeting.The claim comes ahead of a deadline on Thursday in a legal battle that Interdigital has waged against Huawei in both the US and China. It has brought two cases against the Chinese equipment maker before the US International Trade Commission. Huawei has countered with a suit of its own in China accusing Interdigital of anti-competitive behaviour, which it won in October when the Guangdong High Court awarded Huawei Rmb20m ($3.3m) in damages.The ITC has become a favourite forum for patent cases, since its power to block the import of products found to have infringed on US intellectual property rights puts pressure on tech companies to settle rather than face disruption to their business.Interdigital is one of the most prominent among a group of patent licensing companies that have been accused of using aggressive legal tactics to force rich tech companies into paying large settlements, earning them the name “trolls”.The New York-listed company rejected that charge, arguing instead that the 200 people it employed in research and development and a long history in developing wireless technologies made it more than a legal opportunist. It said that it had spent five years trying to negotiate a licence with Huawei, but that it had not been able to reach deals with any Chinese companies to pay for its technology.The Chinese antitrust interest in Interdigital began soon after it launched its legal challenges to Huawei in the US, Mr Merritt said. He added: “We don’t know if the government is playing a role – you can draw your own conclusions about whether they are trying to protect Huawei.”The NRDC has recently also begun an inquiry into Qualcomm, the US wireless technology company that has extensive patents in high-speed communications.
357;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-12-13T18:09:39Z;Mollenkopf to take Qualcomm chief post;Promotion heads off possibility of Microsoft poaching;Paul Jacobs will step back to become Qualcomm chairman, as the wireless chipmaker’s board on Friday hastily promoted president Steve Mollenkopf as its next chief executive heading off a potential attempt by Microsoft to poach him.Mr Mollenkopf, a 20-year veteran of Qualcomm who also served as its chief operating officer, emerged this week as a leading candidate to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft’s chief executive.“This transition is part of a succession plan that we’ve been working on for a while,” Mr Jacobs said in an interview with the Financial Times.“It’s a little bit accelerated relative to what we were originally planning . . . Obviously we have very talented executives and our people are very sought-after. What we really wanted to do was ensure the continuity of the management team.”Mr Mollenkopf said he would not comment on succession plans at Microsoft or anywhere else – “particularly a company that is a very good partner of ours, that we work a lot with”.He said that Qualcomm’s “unique culture” and “fantastic run in terms of helping to define big transitions in the industry” ensured its continuing appeal for his career.“We see a lot of things on the horizon that we can use to drive growth for our shareholders as well as for the industry,” Mr Mollenkopf said, referring to wearable technology and the expansion of 4G LTE networks in China.Mr Jacobs added that his new role was “an opportunity for me to focus on the things I’m passionate about” in developing new technology.“As CEO he will make the priority calls and resourcing calls,” Mr Jacobs said. “My role will be to drive some of these technology areas and help set the table for Steve to build the company on.”Microsoft’s board has been considering candidates from both the technology industry and beyond in its months-long hunt for a new chief, including Ford’s Alan Mulally, former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, former Skype head Tony Bates and Microsoft’s cloud networks chief Satya Nadella.Microsoft did not comment on Friday but in a recent presentation to analysts, Mr Ballmer praised Qualcomm’s central position in the smartphone boom – an industry where Microsoft has trailed rivals such as Apple and Google.Mr Mollenkopf is the latest in a line of engineers to lead Qualcomm but the first outside the Jacobs family. “I think that a company where the leadership has a visceral understanding of technology and likes technology is a key reason why they are successful,” he said.Since Mr Jacobs took over from his father, a Qualcomm co-founder, in 2005, the San Diego-based company has grown to become the world’s largest chipmaker by market capitalisation.While rival Intel remains larger by sales, Qualcomm has been more adept at riding the rapid growth of mobile devices in recent years, thanks to its leadership in 4G LTE wireless technologies and Snapdragon processors.“[Mr Jacobs’] innovations have helped define the smartphone world that we live in today,” said Sherry Lansing, presiding director of Qualcomm’s board. “He has guided Qualcomm through extraordinary growth where the company’s market cap more than doubled, revenues more than quadrupled and [earnings] more than tripled during his tenure as CEO.”Mr Mollenkopf, an electrical engineer who studied at Virginia Tech and the University of Michigan, has headed Qualcomm’s chip set business since 2008. He led the $3.1bn acquisition of Atheros in 2011, Qualcomm’s largest deal to date, which brought in new wireless semiconductor capabilities beyond cellular connections.The 44-year-old inherits Qualcomm’s leadership at a time when its dominance of the mobile market faces fresh challenges in Asia. Analysts say MediaTek, a Taiwanese rival, poses a growing threat to Qualcomm in the smartphone processor market as consumers in emerging markets look to cheaper devices.In November, regulators in China, Qualcomm’s largest market, began an antitrust probe against the company, believed to be centre on its pricing. Qualcomm said at the time it was “not aware of any charge” by Chinese antitrust authorities that it had broken the law.“On some of the regulatory issues, it’s too early to tell. We are still in the process of collecting information,” Mr Mollenkopf said.“In terms of the China market, I would consider Qualcomm to be a big partner to the Chinese phone industry, both in the role of helping to deploy new [network] technologies and enabling a number of the domestic manufacturers to develop phones very easily. We look at the transition to LTE as an even further opportunity to be a good partner to our friends there.”Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall and Henry Foy in London
358;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;China launches antitrust probe into Qualcomm;;Chinese regulators have launched an antitrust probe into Qualcomm as the country gears up for the launch of high-speed LTE networks, a market where the US company has become an early leader and owns important patents.Qualcomm disclosed the investigation, by China’s National Development and Reform Commission, on Monday. It said the probe involved the country’s Anti-Monopoly Law, though it was “not aware of any charge” by the regulators that it had broken the law.The disclosure, which wiped nearly 2 per cent from Qualcomm’s shares in early trading, came as the Chinese authorities laid out more assertive plans for antitrust enforcement. State media reported on Monday that the NDRC will broaden price-related antitrust investigations launched earlier this year to include six new industries – aerospace, medicine, cars, household chemicals, telecommunications and household appliances. It was not clear if the Qualcomm case was part of this widening.China has become Qualcomm’s biggest market, accounting for 49 per cent of sales in its latest fiscal year, thanks to the number of manufacturers based there which build its chipsets into their products. China has also become an increasingly important end-market as the US company moves deeper into the lower-priced chips used in feature phones and smartphones sold there.Qualcomm’s control of intellectual property central to widely used wireless standards has drawn antitrust complaints in the past, though it was unclear if the latest investigation was prompted by similar concerns. European regulators spent four years looking into charges from manufacturers based in the EU that Qualcomm had refused to license its patents for use in 3G networks on reasonable terms. The case was dropped in 2009 after the companies had resolved their disputes with Qualcomm and dropped their complaints.“They are the [market] share leader in wireless IP [intellectual property],” said Patrick Moorhead, an independent chip industry analyst in the US. Such control of key technology often leads to charges of abuse, he added. “You can be a monopoly, but you can’t use that to block competition.”The US company has less dominance in the latest generation of 4G networks such as LTE, though it is still among the leading patent holders in the technology. Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, forecast earlier this month that his company’s fortunes were likely to be boosted in the second half of next year by the rollout of LTE in China, though licences for carriers to use the technology have yet to be issued.In the Chinese bureaucracy, the NDRC, the powerful central planning agency, only has the power to investigate monopolistic behaviour related to price-fixing and price manipulation. The agency has launched more than 50 price-related probes into domestic and foreign companies since China’s anti-monopoly law came into effect in 2008 and publicly issued fines and penalties in at least 20 of these cases.Earlier this year, the NDRC fined six liquid-crystal display manufacturers (two Korean companies and four Taiwanese companies) a total of about $57m for participating in an alleged price-fixing cartel agreement.The agency has also launched an industry-wide investigation into the pricing of medicine and in August it levied its biggest ever penalties for pricing violations, fining six international infant milk formula companies a combined $110m.
359;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-11-06T21:47:54Z;Smartphone race wears on Qualcomm;Mobile chipmaker chief confirms waning high-end demand;A slowdown in demand for the high-end smartphones made by Apple and Samsung is set to weigh on the earnings of Qualcomm in the first half of next year, Paul Jacobs, the US chipmaker’s chief executive, cautioned on Wednesday.However, Mr Jacobs added in an interview with the Financial Times that the launch of a high-speed LTE mobile network in China and new tablet launches would bringing a bounce later in the year, making up for the earlier weakness.The Qualcomm boss’s comments appeared to confirm concerns on Wall Street that the maturing market for the most expensive smartphones would start to eat into growth in what has been the tech industry’s most successful new market since the birth of the PC.Qualcomm’s latest quarterly earnings, released late on Wednesday, also fell short of forecasts, although Mr Jacobs put the disappointment down to a legal award against the company late in the period. Without that, revenues and earnings both comfortably beat expectations, he said.Investors have come to expect Qualcomm to outperform Wall Street’s official forecasts, adding to the disappointment when the latest figures were reported after the market close on Wednesday. The company’s shares slipped back 4 per cent in after-market trading on the news.The mobile chipmaker said that its revenues in the three months to September, the final period of its fiscal year, rose by 33 per cent to $6.48bn, compared with expectations of $6.24bn.However, net income, on the pro-forma basis that analysts judge the company, advanced by only 18 per cent, to $1.82bn, with earnings per share of $1.05, compared with expectations of $1.08. The legal judgment against the company had reduced earnings by about 10 cents a share, Mr Jacobs said.Based on standard accounting principles, Qualcomm said earnings per share had also risen 18 per cent, to 86 cents.Qualcomm’s forecast pointed to a marked slowdown in revenue growth next year, from 30 per cent in 2013 to between 5-11 per cent. Mr Jacobs also said that profits would be weaker than expected in the first half of next year, due to a build-up in costs that the company has already seen ahead of the increase in high-end smartphone demand that would not now materialise.The increasing maturity of the smartphone market has prompted concerns that Qualcomm will see declines in the average selling prices of its products.According to the Qualcomm boss, however, the company is now expecting the average selling prices of handsets to fall by only $3 next year, to $223, as higher-priced LTE phones in countries such as China take up the slack from more developed markets.

Before this funding round, it had raised $76.5m in total.John Hering, co-founder and chief executive, said the company wants to become the leading security firm for the “post-PC era” and hopes to work closely with Qualcomm to develop security software for the new wave of devices which are being connected to the internet.Earlier this year, Lookout researchers identified what they called a “significant security problem” in Google Glass which could have allowed hackers to attack the wearable. Google has sinced fixed the problem but as more and more devices get connected, the opportunities for hackers are expected to multiply.With 45m users worldwide, up from 10m in 2011, Lookout will also use the money to expand overseas, partnering with telecoms companies such as Deutsche Telekom to get its app preloaded on, or sold with, mobiles. It opened a European office in London this quarter and has plans for an Asian office soon.“We are continuing to grow very, very quickly in the consumer space but what is super interesting is enterprise, international expansion and security of the internet of things,” he said. “It is a whole other plane.”The company offers a basic security app for free and consumers can pay $3 a month for a service which includes more comprehensive back-up for their data and the ability to wipe information from a lost device. Businesses who have signed up for its paid-for beta enterprise service so far stretch from a 10 person hardware store in middle America to some of the largest multi-national corporations, Mr Hering said.Lookout had a headstart in the mobile security market because back when mobile phones were for sending text messages and playing snakes, Mr Hering and his two other co-founders Kevin Mahaffey and James Burgess were already worried about how hackers could attack mobile devices to steal personal data.After being ignored when they badgered handset makers to take the weaknesses they found in bluetooth-connected devices seriously, they mounted a stunt at the Academy Awards. Standing outside, the trio showed how they could access data from the mobile phones of celebrities on the red carpet. While they stopped short of hacking the phones, they finally got the attention of the device makers.Shortly afterwards, they started Lookout just before the iPhone and Android phones were launched and have grown since then with smartphone adoption.Mr Hering said the company is interested in going public in the “long term” but for now it is focused on using the new capital to expand.
361;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-09-18T13:00:15Z;Sharp: missing the point;Impressive backing, but that does not mean the future is assured;Everyone has friends cooler than them, and friends who aren’t. Basking in an A-list glow helps anyone’s image. So kudos to Sharp for taking investments in the past year from Qualcomm, Samsung and Hon Hai’s Terry Gou. The ailing electronics maker has also just announced investments from Denso, Lixil and Makita – good names, but less glittery. The best friends are not always the coolest. But when you are also looking for Y150bn in public funds, image matters.Sharp has lost a net Y582bn in the past decade and expects a small Y10bn loss in the first half of this financial year, albeit one half its prior forecast. So backing from six profitable companies is no mean feat. But anyone considering taking up shares in its forthcoming Y150bn public capital raising has to ask what those sums mean. For Samsung and Qualcomm, their combined Y20bn was less than 1 per cent of the net cash held by either. The Y17.5bn to be injected by these three – a car parts manufacturer, a building materials producer and a power tool maker – is about 3 per cent of their combined net cash too, though their risks obviously vary. Still, none is taking a big financial gamble in supporting the company.Sharp’s buddies have sound businesslike reasons to be friends: they are essentially buying low-risk alliances and insights into Sharp’s groundbreaking technology such as low-energy display screens (for phones and tablets). Maybe they have some claim to assets should Sharp fail. That rationale does not work for ordinary investors, however. Sharp’s shares have gained a quarter this year. But that underperforms the Topix’s two-fifths and pales next to Sony’s doubling or Panasonic’s 80 per cent jump.Denso, Makita and Lixil are not bad friends to have, but they are not taking the size of risk that could convince investors of Sharp’s future.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
362;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-09-18T08:24:20Z;Sharp to raise $1.7bn in fresh capital;;"Sharp is to raise as much as Y166.4bn ($1.7bn) through a share offering and tie-ups with fellow Japanese manufacturers as the embattled electronics group fights back against two years of multibillion dollar losses.The Osaka-based company also revised its earnings forecast, saying it now expects a net loss for the six months to September 30 to be Y10bn, smaller than the Y20bn loss it projected in May.The news is a ray of hope for a company whose reliance on television manufacturing has seen it lose out to cheaper South Korean and Taiwanese rivals.The century-old company, which started out making mechanical pencils, is the most troubled of Japan’s beleaguered big consumer groups. It reported a record net loss of Y545bn in the year through March, and last year warned there was “material doubt” about its ability to stay in business.Sharp will offer 450m shares to raise up to Y148.9bn, it said on Wednesday following a meeting of its board. Some of Japan’s biggest manufacturers will contribute a further Y17.5bn of capital.Denso, an automobile parts manufacturer; Makita, a tools manufacturer and Lixil, which makes building materials and household fittings, will each take a small equity stake in Sharp in exchange for their investments.In the past year Sharp also has received equity investments from Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics as it has sought to buttress its balance sheet.In December Qualcomm, a US technology group that makes microchips for smartphones, agreed to invest up to Y9.9bn while in March Samsung agreed to take an equity stake of 3 per cent and invest Y10.4bn.However, previous talks over a potential Y67bn rescue investment from Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, failed to produce an agreement. Sharp and Hon Hai already operate a joint subsidiary, Sharp Display Products Corporation, which manufactures liquid-crystal display panels. Each owns an equal stake of just under 38 per cent.Shares in Sharp, which had net debt of more than Y1.1tn at the end of March, closed up 1.6 per cent on Wednesday ahead of the announcement.The company’s high level of debt stems from significant capital investment as well as operating losses, and puts its ratio of net debt to ebitda at around 6.8, according to company data.Analysts disagree over whether a capital injection will be enough to resolve Sharp’s problems or whether its difficulties go beyond funding issues.“The company has good technology in LCD panels and will stay in business,” said Damian Thong, analyst at Macquarie. “It’s not a market that’s going to go away.”But he warned that measures to boost capital would likely be used to cut debt and that capital spending at the company would remain limited for some time.Sharp struck an upbeat tone last month as it saw its loss for the quarter to June fall to Y17.9bn from Y138.4bn the previous year and announced that it had more than doubled its net profit outlook for the year, spurred in part by the weaker yen. But the company has not been profitable for the past two years.Sharp has focused more heavily on TV manufacturing than Panasonic or Sony and thus has suffered amid rising competition from lower-cost manufacturers and falling prices for flatscreen televisions."

The materials sector was the worst performing area of the S&P, off 1 per cent.Cliffs Natural Resources and Newmont Mining each fell as copper and gold prices retreated. Cliffs was off 5.2 per cent to $22.42, and Newmont declined 4.2 per cent to $28.23.Gains from Qualcomm and Apple were not enough to put the Nasdaq Composite in positive territory. The tech benchmark lost 0.2 per cent to 3,715.97.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also off 0.2 at 15,300.64.Facebook hit a record intraday high of $45.62, but closed slightly lower, down 0.6 per cent at 44.75.However, JPMorgan Securities raised its price target on Facebook to $53 from $44.Upscale athletic apparel producer Lululemon dropped sharply after the company reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations, but cut its full-year forecast.Lululemon was off 5.4 per cent to $65.29 and is now down 14.4 per cent on the year to date.Retailer Men’s Wearhouse also fell after it reported a 28 per cent decline in second-quarter earnings and cut in its per-share earnings outlook. The company that endured a split in June with its high-profile founder and spokesman George Zimmer was off 12.1 per cent to $34.08.Despite the recent difficulties, Men’s Wearhouse remains up 9.4 per cent on the year.Internet music streaming service Pandora Media set a new closing high, up 12.1 per cent to $23.97, after the company named a new chief executive late on Wednesday.Brian McAndrew, who has worked in Microsoft’s advertising technology business as well as for Madrona Venture Group, will lead the company, which faces increasing competition from the likes of Apple’s iTunes, Google Music, and Spotify.Despite US indices hovering near record levels set in August, investors are showing that they believe equity prices have room to grow, said Tim Speiss, chairman of the personal wealth advisers group at accountancy EisnerAmper.“For the most part, our client investors are maintaining their long-term asset allocation levels. We haven’t had many of our clients, if any, make significant changes to their portfolios,” he said.Mr Speiss said that despite lukewarm job numbers, investors he dealt with were encouraged by the US consumer outlook and the forthcoming holiday shopping season.“Our investors continue to look at jobless claims and consumer spending, looking at the fact that consumer confidence seems to be stabilising,” he said. “We’re coming into the holiday season shortly and usually it’s a robust time of year.”

The US technology group is understood to have spurned approaches from two F1 teams to become a partner in order to team up with Formula E.DHL, which also sponsors Formula 1 and Manchester United, will be the logistics partner of the electric car series.Spark Racing Technology, constructors of the 42 cars being produced for the first season, will unveil the vehicle at the Frankfurt Motor Show.The Italian company Dallara is producing the monocoque chassis and Michelin is supplying the tyres. Others involved in its creation include the technology arms of F1 teams McLaren and Williams.The electric car series plans to use Qualcomm’s technology to charge the racing cars wirelessly, though not until the second season.The main drawback of Formula E is the limited battery life of the cars, which requires each driver to have to stop midway through the race to drive a second car. Formula E organisers expect Qualcomm to use the series as a testing ground to design cars that can be recharged as they run.Alejandro Agag, chief executive of Formula E Holdings, said: “New technologies in connectivity, wireless and mobile fit perfectly with a championship open to new technology, not only for the cars but for everything around the venue.”The wireless technology involves the use of magnetic induction transferring energy between the ground and the vehicle.Qualcomm will also help Formula E engage with spectators through live streaming, video games and social media.
365;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Only time will tell for Samsung smartwatch;;Samsung’s launch of its Galaxy Gear smartwatch was trailed as a new beginning for wearable technology after a decade of false starts.“Our time is a time for crossing boundaries,” gushed Pranav Mistry, head of Samsung’s “think tank”, as he showed off the device in Berlin on Wednesday. “Welcome to the future.”Sony has already launched a smartwatch, albeit to mixed reviews, and Apple, Google and LG are all working on devices of their own. Mobile chipmakers such as Qualcomm and Broadcom are championing the technology as the next big thing and venture capitalists are investing tens of millions of dollars in hardware start-ups.However, initial reaction to the Galaxy Gear from analysts and gadget reviewers on Wednesday was decidedly mixed, just as Google’s Glass headset has suffered a recent backlash from privacy campaigners and fashionistas alike.Despite all the wearables hype, consumers’ appetite for bulky, $300 devices that require frequent recharging and replicate many of their smartphones’ functions is still far from proven.Sarah Rotman Epps, analyst at Forrester Research, said the Gear improved on its predecessors – from 2003’s Microsoft Spot watch to last year’s Kickstarter-funded Pebble– but “still doesn’t give consumers a convincing reason to buy one”.“Samsung is pursuing a spaghetti-on-the-wall product strategy: Launch a smartwatch and maybe it will stick,” she wrote in a blogpost on Wednesday.“My bet is that smartwatches are sci-fi inventions that are already anachronisms in this modern world.”Chetan Sharma, a mobile industry consultant, said on Twitter that smartwatches were “the netbooks of 2013” – a reference to the shortlived popularity of cheap, low-powered laptops that were quickly superseded by tablets such as the iPad.Studies show that consumer awareness of wearable gadgets is high but purchase activity is low.A survey of over 1,500 smartphone owners in the US and UK by On Device Research for analyst firm CCS Insight found that 65 per cent of respondents had heard of smartwatches and almost half of Americans surveyed had heard about Google Glass. “This is very high for a product that isn’t even commercially available at the moment,” said Siim Teller, marketing manager at On Device Research.However, while 20 per cent said they would buy, give or receive a smartwatch by Christmas, fewer than 5 per cent own such a device today – and of those who do, more than a third were no longer using it.“There is an interaction issue that is very challenging” with wrist-based computing, said Robert Brunner, founder of San Francisco design agency Ammunition Group, which has worked on the popular Beats by Dr Dre headphones and 2011’s Wimm smartwatch, which was acquired by Google last year after underwhelming sales.“There’s a certain size of thing that people will put on their arm – it’s a small piece of real estate,” Mr Brunner said, limiting what the device can do.The Galaxy Gear offers touchscreen controls as well as inbuilt motion sensors for gesture controls, and the ability to issue voice commands to a Bluetooth-tethered smartphone. That usability, alongside a colour screen, makes it more sophisticated than most of its predecessors, but battery life of just 25 hours and relatively large size may limit its appeal.“It clearly puts the wearables business into second gear,” said Christian Lindholm, a former Nokia designer now developing wearable technology at his start-up, Koru. But he believes that curved screens will be the “tipping point” for smartwatches that touchscreens were for smartphones. Both Apple and Samsung have already filed patents for putative devices with curved displays.Strategy Analytics, a research group, predicts that 15m wearable devices will be sold globally in 2013, rising to 75m by 2017: a small fraction of the smartphone market, which already runs into hundreds of millions of units every year.Others are more optimistic.“My intuition is that this is going to be a very big market in the next five years,” said Broadcom’s chief executive, Scott McGregor, with many wearable-tech start-ups likely to flourish, in contrast to the handful of large companies that dominate smartphones. “The initial investment will be much lower, which will enable a huge growth of innovation like we haven’t seen in a while. Some will be cool, some will be left in a drawer.”Amit Daryanani, hardware analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimates that up to 30 per cent of today’s 850m smartphone owners might buy a connected device within 18 months, by which time the iWatch and others are expected to launch.“The potential of this is phenomenal,” he said. “If I had to predict the next breakthrough product, it’s absolutely wearable technology.”
366;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-07-30T15:56:10Z;Alcatel-Lucent buoyed by US operations;;Alcatel-Lucent posted a better than expected increase in second-quarter revenues based on buoyant US operations and confirmed the signing of a strategic partnership with Qualcomm as the first sign of the turnround strategy under its new management.The struggling French telecoms equipment maker said demand for next generation mobile services helped boost its US business and took overall group revenues higher by 1.9 per cent in the quarter to €3.6bn.The group’s gross margin of 31.9 per cent and operating income margin of 1.9 per cent also beat analyst expectations owing to greater profitability at its data traffic IP division, which will become a key pillar of the company’s future strategy.Michel Combes, who joined as chief executive in April, is streamlining the business to focus only on such profitable areas, and has promised €1bn of asset sales and the same again in cost cutting to grow the company for the first time since the ill-fated merger of Alcatel and Lucent in 2006.As part of the strategy, Alcatel-Lucent will team up with technology partners to augment its research and development of innovative products for its telecoms customers. The first such deal – which will develop small mobile transmitters with Qualcomm – was confirmed in the second quarter results. As part of the deal, Qualcomm will take a small stake in Alcatel-Lucent.However, the group also revealed a net loss of €871m in part owing to a writedown of its wireless business. Analysts said there was still a heavy cash burn in the business, with net debt of €794m, from €358m last quarter, owing to a negative operating cash flow, interest payments, restructuring and capital expenditure.Shares in Alcatel-Lucent rose 14.4 per cent to €1.83.
367;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-07-29T20:52:59Z;Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent in ‘small cell’ mobile tie-up;;Qualcomm is to acquire a stake in Alcatel-Lucent as part of a far-reaching partnership agreement to develop the next generation of smaller mobile cell transmitters capable of coping with the rapid increase in mobile data.The deal between the US chipmaker and the struggling French telecoms equipment group will be worth more than €100m in total research and development expenditure, according to a person familiar with the terms.Qualcomm would take a stake in Alcatel-Lucent as part of the deal in a move to show the alignment of interests of the two companies, the person said, although the exact share would not be revealed.The stake is to be added gradually and will be below the 5 per cent disclosure threshold, meaning the move is more symbolic of a wider partnership than financially motivated.The agreement to develop mobile “small cell” technology, which will be announced with Alcatel-Lucent’s second-quarter results on Tuesday, is the first partnership deal under the strategic plan devised by Michel Combes, chief executive, who joined the French technology group in April.An important part of the plan is to overhaul the research and development teams. One immediate worry of the new management was that resources had been focused on outdated technology. Mr Combes said the group would find “best in class” partners to work on new technology, in particular among US groups.The two companies will commit to a jointly funded R&D programme, with Qualcomm also providing chips and software.Analysts say small cells will become an important part of mobile networks. They allow operators to cover areas of high data use such as shopping malls or even households without having to erect a mobile mast. Small cells, which can be smaller than a shoebox, bring mobile coverage as close to the user as possible.Improved mobile networks are expected to be needed to meet the rapid rise in demand for mobile data on smartphones and tablets. Analysts forecast that, to meet the need for denser, higher-capacity coverage in urban areas, the small-cell hardware market will be worth more than $2bn by 2016.Operators such as AT&T, Vodafone, Telefónica, SoftBank and Sprint have emphasised the importance of small cells in supporting business and residential customers. SoftBank’s merger with Sprint is likely to accelerate small-cell adoption in the US. Alcatel-Lucent has already struck a deal with Orange to provide the equipment behind its small-cell strategy.Alcatel-Lucent and Qualcomm have been among the most active groups in developing technology for small cells, which means the deal brings together two well-established groups in the market.
368;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-07-24T23:07:16Z;Qualcomm rallies on strong chip demand from smartphone makers;;Demand for the chips that power high-end smartphones and tablets was stronger than expected in the second quarter of this year, lifting revenues at mobile chip company Qualcomm above Wall Street forecasts, according to figures released late on Wednesday.The news contributed to a rally of nearly 5 per cent in Qualcomm’s share price in after-market trading and brought some reassurance to investors who had become concerned about the level of demand for the most advanced smartphones from companies such as Apple and Samsung. It followed a 5 per cent bounce in Apple’s own shares following the news late the day before of an unexpected surge in iPhone sales.Qualcomm has become a bellwether for the smartphone market in much the way that Intel’s fortunes have moved in line with the PC market, making its quarterly earnings reports a measure of the industry’s health. The company raised its guidance for revenues for the full year to $24.3bn-$25bn, to reflect the stronger quarter.The average selling prices of the chips that go into phones for 3G and 4G networks “were stronger than expected” in the latest period, said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive. Chip shipments in the period, the third quarter of the company’s fiscal year, rose by 22 per cent to 172m.Although it did not disclose chip prices for the latest quarter, it said that average selling prices of devices had reached $230 in the first three months of the year, up from $217 in the preceding period.Qualcomm said that the firm chip prices and demand for its most advanced Snapdragon processors had lifted its revenue in the latest quarter by 35 per cent to $6.24bn, above the $6bn that Wall Street had been expecting. Net income rose 31 per cent to $1.58bn, or $1.03 a share on an adjusted basis, in line with estimates.Despite the advance, Qualcomm’s shares have missed out on this year’s Nasdaq rally as investors have looked ahead to the twin risks of a maturing smartphone market and growing competition.Intel, a perennial also-ran in mobile chips, has pulled off recent wins with contracts to supply the chips for a Lenovo smartphone and a Samsung tablet. The company has also promised to put renewed emphasis on its low-power range of Atom processors as it tries to accelerate its move away from the PC business, with many of its hopes riding on a new version of the chips due out late this year.Shipments of mobile devices that connect to 3G and 4G networks are likely to top 1bn this year, Qualcomm predicted, a rise of 12 per cent from 2012.
369;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-07-18T15:01:53Z;Slowing smartphone growth clouds TSMC’s future;;Strong demand for smartphones has helped contract chipmaker TSMC overcome the crash in computer sales that has tripped up Intel, its more PC-centric competitor.Yet with smartphone sales growth slowing as well, some analysts fear that TSMC, which just reported record sales, could start stumbling in the next few quarters.TSMC manufactures a wide variety of chips used in everything from industrial applications to gadgets, but among its big customers are Qualcomm and MediaTek, which design the chips that serve as the electronic brains in smartphones and tablets.Taiwan-based TSMC, which controls about half of the world’s contract chipmaking market, predicts quarterly growth will be 3 to 5 per cent in the third quarter, after notching 17 per cent sales growth between the first and second quarters.That is still stronger than Intel’s forecast on Wednesday of flat revenue for the year, and would put TSMC in line to hit a new sales record next quarter, but it is less ambitious than investors had been hoping for.“One or two months ago, people were forecasting TSMC in the third quarter to grow by double digits,” said one analyst in Taipei. The reduced expectations are due to “disappointing smartphone sales, particularly in the high end”.Morris Chang, chairman, said sales might decline in the fourth quarter as tech brands try to clear out their remaining inventories.TSMC has been in the spotlight lately on reports that Apple has begun buying chips from it. The company did not comment on the reports, but says it anticipates much bigger growth from low-end smartphones than in high-end models such as the iPhone.For chip manufacturers like TSMC, the rise of low-end phones could mean lower profits. TSMC earns $4 from the sale of a chip for a low-end phone, compared with $9 for the chips used in first-tier models, according to data from the company.“There is . . . growing concern on the long-term sustainability of smartphone semiconductor demand as more smartphone growth will come from the low-end segment in the future,” said Mark Li, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong.Yet Mr Chang hastened to remind analysts that the company was not strong on just the cutting edge of chipmaking.“I think everyone knows our . . . technology has allowed us to be very well positioned in the high end, but I want to particularly point out that we are very well positioned in the low-end,” he said.TSMC reported second-quarter revenue of NT$155.89bn ($5.2bn), up 17.4 per cent from the prior quarter. Communications chips, which includes smartphones, grew 22 per cent quarter-on-quarter and accounted for 57 per cent of TSMC’s total sales. Its shares are up 8.8 per cent year to date, but down 1 per cent in the past month.

Like Dell, Intel has been hit by concerns that the decline of PC sales will damage its core business. Shares in the chipmaker were down 3.6 per cent to $23.19 after downgrades from Evercore Partners and Citigroup.However, declining PC sales only tell part of the story. In the growing mobile chip market, it is far behind competitors.“They have almost no share in the 3G market, which is heavily dominated by Qualcomm, Samsung and some others,” said S&P Capital IQ analyst Christine Amracost. “They have some small wins, but on the 3G they really haven’t been there yet.”She added that Intel is preparing to release its new mobile chip in 2014 to directly compete with the industry leaders.“The game really starts in 2014,” she said.Apple’s struggles, along with Intel, meant the tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged behind the broader rally, up 0.2 to 3,484.83. Apple shares were off 0.6 per cent to $415.05.Sprint Nextel shares were down 1.1 per cent to $7.08 after the company said more than half of its investors chose to receive cash instead of stock in SoftBank as part of its acquisition deal, exceeding the money available for the scheme.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 15,225.15. American Express, up 1 per cent to $77.04, and Walmart, 2 per cent higher to $76.71, helped drive the blue-chip index.Utilities were among the strongest sectors, breaking a recent downward trend that has coincided with rising US Treasury rates and better performance from more cyclical sectors.The Southern Company rose 1.7 per cent to $43.85, Dominion Resources added 1.1 per cent to $56.88, and PPL gained 1.7 per cent to $29.85.For all the concerns about rising interest rates and the upcoming end of quantitative easing, the S&P 500 is only 2.7 per cent off its all-time highs hit in May.The Russell Small-cap index hit an all-time high on Monday, adding 0.3 per cent to 1,008.76, having passed the 1,000 mark for the first time on Friday.It has also performed noticeably well when compared with the other major indices since the market top in May. Up 18.8 per cent on the year to date, the Russell has since the beginning of June outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 2 percentage points.The earnings season began with Alcoa reporting earnings just after the bell on Monday. Yum Brands, which has become sensitive to Chinese consumer consumption, reports on Wednesday, and US banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday.One of the world’s largest aluminium producers, Alcoa was up 1.4 per cent to $7.87, and traded about 1.3 per cent higher in after-hours trading after reporting that it had beaten earnings per share and revenue estimates.
371;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-06-19T16:33:17Z;UK chipmaker Imagination tries to allay fears after profits fall;UK chip designer said it has not lost deals to competitors;"Imagination Technologies, the designer of microchips used in Apple’s iPhone, said that it had not lost a single licensing deal to a competitor as it tried to allay analysts’ concerns about falling profits.A lack of new licensing agreements triggered a 7 per cent fall in adjusted pre-tax profits last financial year, and analysts have suggested that the company, whose designs are used to make graphics-processing chips used in mobile devices, could be vulnerable to increased competition from US rivals Qualcomm and Nvidia.Imagination’s shares, which have halved since a peak last September, fell a further 5 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, following news that Nvidia would also start licensing out its own graphic processing technology.However, the shares recovered to trade up nearly 5 per cent, and Sir Hossein Yassaie, Imagination’s chief executive, dismissed the notion that Nvidia would pose a serious threat. “The real competitor is Qualcomm,” he said. Speaking about the mobile market, he said: “For us to maintain over 50 per cent market share is reasonable.”Imagination first signalled difficulties in a profit warning last monthLicensing revenues fell 15 per cent in £29.1m in the 12 months to April, although royalties rose by nearly half in 2012 to £95.1m.Sir Hossein pointed to an agreement with Toshiba, announced last week, as evidence that licensing deals were returning.“Japan as a semiconductor nation had gone into a bit of paralysis in the last year. Now things are moving in the right direction,” he said.Imagination expects to receive royalties on over 650m chips next year, up a fifth from last year.“The Samsung Galaxy S4 [phone] is in part going to ship on Imagination graphics, so that could provide some upside,” said James Goodman, an analyst at Investec.Sir Hossein said that Imagination would also benefit from a new range of devices. “[Google Glass] may not appeal to everyone, but it shows what is possible in terms of connected devices,” he said. “The internet of things and wearable devices are going to be a very big deal for us.”He also defended the company’s push into computing processors, through the acquisition of MIPS for $100m in February and subsequent research costs.“Today MIPS’s market share is 7-8 per cent. We’ve set a target of 25 per cent within five years,” he said, arguing that the company could erode Arm’s dominance.“No market likes a monopoly. Where there is a Coke, there is always a Pepsi.”FT comment: If only shareholders were as patient as Sir Hossein himself. A year ago, shares in Arm and Imagination were roughly the same price; now Arm’s are worth nearly three times more. But those unscathed by that experience may now be tempted by Imagination’s valuation: its forward price/earnings ratio is 26, compared to Arm’s 43."

Any bans ordered by the ITC are subject to a 60-day window, during which they are reviewed by the US president before they come into effect.If Barack Obama does not review the ban, Apple may appeal to the Federal Circuit and ask for an immediate stay.The devices caught by the import ban are the AT&T variants of the iPhone 4, 3GS and 3G, as well as the original iPad and iPad 2 which run on the second-largest American mobile network. They are assembled in China.Its latest devices, including the iPhone 5, are not affected but Apple said in its most recent earnings call that sales of its now-discounted iPhone remained surprisingly strong.Samsung accused Apple of infringing four of its patents around the fundamental technologies of wireless devices, known as standards-essential patents. Technology companies are required to license these patents on fair and reasonable terms.Although the ITC said that Samsung did not prove a violation of three of those patents, it overturned an administrative district judge’s ruling last autumn to find against Apple in the fourth, despite the iPhone maker attempting to show the patent was invalid.The patent at issue involves the UMTS technology that is used by AT&T’s 3G network. AT&T was the sole network operator for iPads and iPhones in the US until February 2011, when Verizon – which uses a different kind of 3G technology that is not caught by this ruling – started offering the device.In coming to its decision that the only “appropriate remedy” was to ban imports of the infringing devices to the US, the ITC heard evidence from many IT and mobile companies, including Google’s Motorola Mobility, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Qualcomm and BlackBerry – some of whom have also clashed with Apple in the courts.This is a big psychological win for Samsung, just like last summer’s $1bn verdict that Apple obtained against Samsung was for Apple. It puts President Obama’s statement on trolls today to the testLast summer, Apple was awarded $1bn in damages against Samsung by a Californian jury after it found the maker of the Galaxy family of devices infringed its patents. Almost half of that sum has since been vacated and a new trial ordered to determine the final damages.Samsung said after the ruling: “We believe the ITC’s Final Determination has confirmed Apple’s history of free-riding on Samsung’s technological innovations. Our decades of research and development in mobile technologies will continue, and we will continue to offer innovative products to consumers in the US.”Apple said: “Today’s decision has no impact on the availability of Apple products in the US.“Samsung is using a strategy which has been rejected by courts and regulators around the world. They’ve admitted that it’s against the interests of consumers in Europe and elsewhere, yet here in the US Samsung continues to try to block the sale of Apple products by using patents they agreed to license to anyone for a reasonable fee.”Michael Carrier, professor at Rutgers School of Law, Camden, New Jersey, said: “This is a big psychological win for Samsung, just like last summer’s $1bn verdict that Apple obtained against Samsung was for Apple.“It puts President Obama’s statement on trolls today to the test, as the ITC grants an exclusion order, while the courts would not.”The White House on Tuesday unveiled several measures designed to reform the US patent system and “protect innovators from frivolous litigation”.It hopes to stop what it called a “drain on the American economy” from patent assertion entities, who file or acquire intellectual property rights for use solely in litigation, rather than to create new product.As part of its legislative recommendations to restrain these “patent trolls”, the White House said that it should become harder to obtain an injunction at the International Trade Commission, to bring its rulings in line with district courts, where legal blocks on product sales are rarely granted to patent litigators.The White House also singled out the “smartphone patent wars” as an area where it hoped to see improvements, ensuring US companies spend more resources on R&D than legal fees.Executive actions also included moves by the Patent and Trademark Office to prevent patent trolls from using shell companies to hide their activities. Patent applicants and owners would have to inform the PTO when they are involved in litigation, to improve transparency of the “ultimate parent entity” behind any intellectual property offensive.US acts on patentshttp://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/patent_report.pdf
373;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
374;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-05-21T22:38:20Z;Intel’s chief reshapes management team;;Intel’s new chief executive is radically reshaping the company’s management structure in a shake-up designed to help the world’s biggest chipmaker expand faster in new markets beyond the smartphone and the tablet.Brian Krzanich, who took the helm at the Silicon Valley company’s annual meeting last week, has taken direct charge of Intel Architecture Group, whose engineers design processors for personal computers, servers and mobile devices.Mr Krzanich told shareholders last week that Intel had been too slow in moving into mobile, where companies such as Qualcomm have captured much of the market with chips based on designs of the UK’s Arm.In a memo to employees announcing the changes, he said: “I am committed to being bolder, moving faster and accepting that this means changes will be made knowing that we will listen, learn and then make adjustments in order to keep pace with a rapidly changing industry.”Mr Krzanich has also formed a New Devices group, headed by Mike Bell, a former Palm and Apple executive, who has led Intel’s push into smartphones.Chuck Mulloy, Intel spokesman, said the new group would not necessarily be focused on handsets and tablets. “If we are focused on the mobile market today, we are going to be behind. [The group] will find new business models around new devices,” he said.He said making Intel Architecture Group report directly to the chief executive was part of streamlining decision-making so the company could move faster.Mr Krzanich has also moved some of his responsibilities to Renee James, Intel president – a position that his predecessor Paul Otellini had combined with the CEO role.Ms James will now be in overall charge of the Technology Manufacturing Group, software, security, human resources and planning.Intel Media, a separate unit aiming to launch a set-top box later this year as part of a new national TV service in the US, will continue to report directly to the CEO. It will not form part of the New Devices group.Mr Krzanich, 52, is only the sixth chief executive of the 45-year-old company. He secured the role after the board gave serious consideration to outside candidates for the first time.In the end, the board appeared to play it safe by choosing a 30-year company veteran who had led the manufacturing group and was a former factory manager.But insiders say Mr Krzanich is known for moving quickly and decisively. His ability to make Intel more agile and responsive to a rapidly moving industry, where its core PC business is in decline, would have been seen as a major advantage in his candidacy.

Borrow money of course. Apple’s plan to do just that to fund its $100bn capital return programme is not as strange as it sounds with debt now dirt cheap. In other tech news, UK-based chip designer Arm topped sales forecasts for the 15th consecutive quarter while Qualcomm issued weak guidance sending its share price down sharply. In the telecoms sector, Verizon’s first-quarter results whipped those of rival AT&T, but both companies remain well ahead of smaller competitors, even if mooted M&A deals are completed. Netflix has nowhere near the same kind of scale as the phone operators, but it is expanding quickly after reporting its second quarter in a row of strong subscriber growth.Most of the other corporate news concerned companies that make things. In diversified industrials, recent results from GE, Honeywell and United Technologies gave few clues to the sector’s overall direction while Caterpillar cut its sales target to well below analysts’ estimates and was bizarrely rewarded with a share price rise. In Europe, first-quarter earnings from large German and French carmakers signalled that a sector trough may finally have been reached. UK drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have also been performing better recently, but the Netherlands’ Philips and Heineken suffered further setbacks, although the former’s results were generally respectable. One European manufacturer, engineering firm ABB, was taking the longer view with the $1bn acquisition of Power One in the unloved solar sector. The only other significant deal was in Asia, where convenience store operator CP All made a $6.6bn bid for cash & carry operator Siam Makro in Thailand’s biggest domestic deal to date.Finally, the banks. In Europe, the Co-operative Group pulled out of a deal to buy 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group while Santander’s attempt to sell its first-quarter results as “the beginning of a return to normality” was less than convincing.Wise investors have been in Swedish banks, a much safer bet since the financial crisis began. Like its European counterparts, Brazil’s Banco Bradesco has also been underperforming aa result of a stumbling economy. In the US boutique investment banks Greenhill and Evercore are on diverging paths with the former only giving deal advice while the latter has added a small asset management arm. But however banks are performing, all would be delighted to have the problem of what to do with a $145bn cash pile.John Casey, Lex Publisher
376;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm: victim of its own success;Its technology is already so ubiquitous that a slowdown in growth seems inevitable;Much is made of Apple’s valuation: a forward price-earnings multiple of 10 times for the recognised leader in mobile computing. But the most puzzling multiple in mobile is not Apple’s. It is Qualcomm’s, at 14 times. Qualcomm’s patents mean that every handset maker that uses the fastest wireless standard – “long-term evolution” – must pay it a royalty. Its modem chips, or its modem/processor chipsets, are in phones made by Apple, Samsung and many others. Qualcomm is increasing revenues at over 20 per cent (double Apple’s rate). Its margins are wide. Its balance sheet is heaped with cash. It pays a dividend and buys back shares. It looks too cheap.The simple explanation is that Qualcomm will soon fall victim to its own success. Its technology is already ubiquitous and its chips are in so many phones, so growth must slow. Wall Street consensus foresees revenue growth slowing to 6 per cent in 2015. This is not sufficient, though. Given the company’s market position and prodigious cash flows, doesn’t Qualcomm deserve a premium, even with modest growth?Perhaps. The smartphone market is growing fast, but, as Berenberg Bank points out, the high end of the market is slowing. The growth is in the emerging world. Qualcomm’s licence fees are set as a percentage of device prices. Cheaper phones mean less licence revenue. And as handset makers sell cheaper phones, they will look to squeeze their supply chain – and low-cost competitors like MediaTek will be eager to displace Qualcomm’s chips. So chip margins could be at risk, too. The company’s first-quarter results – which featured chip margins that were down year-over-year and sequentially – fed this fear, and shares fell 6 per cent on Thursday.Handset prices and margins will almost certainly decline. The question is whether these declines will outweigh the unit growth Qualcomm can achieve as mobile computing blossoms in the emerging world. Ignore the margin percentages and the phone prices. Keep an eye on the profit dollars.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
377;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-04-24T23:09:02Z;Qualcomm forecasts extra $600m in revenues;;Qualcomm, the world’s biggest mobile chipmaker by sales, said it expected an additional $600m in revenues this fiscal year than forecast, as smartphone sales increase.The San Diego-based company reported $6.12bn in revenues for its second quarter ended March, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $6.08bn. However, profits of $1.17 a share were in line with analysts’ consensus and its shares fell 6 per cent in extended trading in New York to $62.05.Qualcomm supplies processors and radio chips for smartphones, whose shipments are expected to grow at 20 per cent a year to 1.7bn in 2017, according to research firm Gartner.However, the company also cited strength in “emerging regions”, where third-generation devices have grown 34 per cent over the past year to 1.1bn. It sees potential for growth in China, where only a third of phones can achieve 3G speeds.These phones sell in volume but at cheaper prices, lowering Qualcomm’s figures for average selling prices of phones and suggesting this is the reason the revenue boost it received in its second quarter did not translate into the profits expected by Wall Street.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm president, said the company was predicting it would increase revenues and earnings per share this fiscal year and it was growing faster than the market as a whole.“There are two things happening. We are seeing volumes increase in emerging regions, but the bigger story is we are seeing strength at the high end as well,” he said.The company was experiencing a big take-up of its higher-margin Snapdragon 600 and 800 processors, he said. These are being used in the latest tablets and smartphones, many of which will appear in the second half of the year.The Qualcomm president said quarters were becoming “lumpier” than in the past – while emerging regions could dominate in one quarter, flagship devices being launched in mature markets could be a feature the next.Qualcomm raised its estimate of 3G and 4G device shipments by the mobile industry this calendar year by 15m units, from 1.035bn to 1.05bn.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call that the company was seeing strong demand for smartphones and strong semiconductor volumes. Qualcomm had grown to become the world’s third-largest chipmaker, up from sixth place last year, he said.Last November the company became more valuable than Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, although its market capitalisation recently slipped back below its rival’s.Net income for the second quarter was $2.07bn, up 17 per cent year-on-year, but down 6 per cent sequentially for the seasonally quieter quarter. Qualcomm raised its revenue guidance for the fiscal year from $23.4bn-$24.4bn, to $24bn-$25bn.Mr Jacobs said dividend payments to shareholders had been increased by 40 per cent and a $5bn share buyback had been authorised. Dividends of 25 cents per share, worth $431m, are being paid.
378;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-03-06T11:04:34Z;Samsung: Sharp move;What is Y10.4bn, or about $110m, between friends?;What is Y10bn, or $110m, between friends? It is not much to Samsung (net cash $21bn) and it is hardly a sufficient sum to save Sharp. But Wednesday’s announcement that Samsung will buy newly issued shares to the tune of 3 per cent of Sharp might give it a place in the pecking order should Sharp collapse.A circling of vultures is not how the deal is presented. But Samsung is the third tech giant to put money into Sharp in the past year, after Qualcomm’s similar-sized equity investment in December and Hon Hai’s taking of a half-share in the Japanese group’s market-leading and lossmaking Sakai plant producing liquid crystal display screens. The three are not direct competitors, but that is a lot of big tech ego hovering around a company that admitted to material doubt over its survival as recently as November. Surely these investments cannot all be down to love and respect for a one-time market giant? Votes of confidence the injections may be, but they are not very big ones: the cash comes to less than 1 per cent of either Samsung’s or Qualcomm’s net funds.The deals are also nowhere near enough to do more than briefly plug holes at Sharp. Qualcomm and Samsung’s combined Y20bn covers under half of Sharp’s cash burn in the first nine months of this financial year. And Hon Hai’s $800m came in the end without the equity stake that had been agreed. That in itself is a telling number – Hon Hai planned a year ago to pay Y70bn for 10 per cent of Sharp. Samsung and Qualcomm are in effect paying half of that amount.The irony is that Samsung made its start in electronics in the 1970s producing black-and-white TVs with Sanyo and NEC while Sharp was working at the cutting edge. Lucky for Sharp, its technology is still there – Samsung also agreed a deal to take more of Sharp’s display screens – even if its business is not. This deal is not big enough to change much at Sharp or Samsung. But should the worst happen, a $100m claim may be a small price for an entrée to Sharp’s technology and, crucially, to block rivals.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
379;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-03-06T08:50:53Z;Samsung/Sharp deal: sign of the times;;"Here’s a moment in Asian corporate history: Samsung Electronics is buying a stake in Sharp, in the first investment by a South Korean group in a big Japanese company in consumer electronics, one of Japan’s flagship industries.The deal announced on Wednesday is too small to revive the struggling Sharp: Samsung Electronics is investing only Y10.3bn and buying just 3 per cent. But it’s a sign that the South Koreans think Sharp has a future. At the very least, they want to secure a key source of LCD panels.Sharp said in a statement:The purpose of this Third Party Allotment Capital Increase is to bujild up mutual trust relationship toward increase in the corporate value of Sharp and Samsung Electronics in the field of liquid crystal display (hereafter ‘LCD’) business, and at the same time to enhance Sharp’s capital adequacy.Sharp said the deal would strengthen its alliance with Samsung in the supply of LCDs. The company would “continuously accelerate” its business restructuring.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones and TVs, said the investment would safeguard LCD panels supplies. It – wisely – won’t be getting involved in Sharp’s management: too small a deal and too many headaches.Samsung isn’t the first company to be putting money into Sharp to help it survive. Qualcomm, the US chip maker, last year paid Y10bn for a 2.6 per cent stake. Also last year, Sharp announced plans to sell a 9.9 per cent stake to Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, but the talks stalled.As Michiyo Nakamoto and Song Jong-a report for the FT, The deadline for the capital injection from Hon Hai is March 26 but there is no sign of an agreement in sight.Sharp, which forecasts a full-year loss of Y450bn, has said there is “material doubt” about it staying in business.No such concerns at Samsung, of course, which has overtaken Japanese rivals to establish itself as the world’s premier consumer electronics brand. But the deal should give the Koreans pause for thought. The Japanese consumer electronics industry was once as pre-eminent as Samsung is today. Nothing is for ever in business. And Chinese companies are convinced that their time is yet to come.Related reading

380;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-03-06T08:22:08Z;Samsung buys stake in Sharp;;Samsung Electronics has agreed to take an equity stake in troubled Japanese group Sharp, in the first capital tie-up between major consumer electronics makers in South Korea and Japan.Samsung, the world’s leading producer of liquid crystal displays by volume, will invest Y10.4bn ($107m) for a 3 per cent stake in Sharp, it said on Wednesday. This will make Samsung one of the largest shareholders in the Japanese group, a rival in the global LCD and television industries.The companies have also agreed that Sharp will provide Samsung with state-of-the-art, large-sized LCD panels for TVs and small and medium-sized panels for smartphones and notebook PCs. It already supplies Samsung with panels for 32-inch TVs.The South Korean company will become Sharp’s fifth-largest shareholder after major Japanese financial institutions such as Mizuho, which is one of Sharp’s main lenders.Sharp, which has forecast a record Y450bn loss in the fiscal year ending March 31, has been under pressure to find an investor and shore up its capital base. Its capital adequacy ratio was 9.6 per cent at the end of December.Lee Jae-hyuk, an analyst at Daiwa Securities, estimates that Samsung bought about 6 per cent of its TV panels from Sharp last year and is likely to increase the portion this year. “Sharp is the only company with a 10th-generation production line for large-sized panels above 60 inches. So it is more economical for Samsung to buy large-sized panels from Sharp rather than building its own factory,” he said.Mr Lee described the deal as “win-win”, noting that it “reduces some investment burden for Samsung at a time of slowing TV demand and overcapacity in the industry. Meanwhile, Sharp can secure a big customer …and prevent its finances from deteriorating.”Shares in Sharp surged 19 per cent in early trading before ending Wednesday with a gain of 14 per cent. Samsung’s shares rose 0.7 per cent.Last year Sharp announced plans to sell a 9.9 per cent stake to Hon Hai Precision Industry, the Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer that trades as Foxconn, but the talks stalled after the Japanese group suffered a plunge in its share price. The deadline for the capital injection from Hon Hai is March 26 but there is no sign of an agreement in sight.In December, Sharp received a Y10bn investment from Qualcomm, the US-based semiconductor maker, with which it agreed jointly to develop next-generation displays used in tablet PCs.Sharp’s main banks have continued to support the group, providing Y360bn in loans last October to tide it over. In return, Sharp has pledged to cut jobs and achieve an operating profit in the six months to the end of March. The group made a Y2.6bn operating profit in the three months to December, and staff numbers have fallen by 5,400 since March last year.The Japanese group, which once held a dominant share of the global LCD panel market, saw a big bet on high-tech panels sour in the face of a growing cost disadvantage due to falling demand and the yen’s strength over much of the past few years.Last year Sharp admitted there was “material doubt” about whether or not it could remain in business.
381;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm plans 40% dividend rise;;Qualcomm on Tuesday became the latest US technology company to pledge to use more of its swelling cash flow to reward its shareholders, as it announced a 40 per cent dividend rise and a big jump in its stock repurchase plans.Even with the larger payouts the US chipmaker looks set to keep adding to a cash mountain that already ranks among the biggest in the tech industry, after increasing by $6bn last year to reach $28.4bn.Qualcomm’s shares rose by $1.34, or 2 per cent, on the news to reach $67.97, their highest close since March last year.Other tech companies have also increased dividend payments and stock buyback plans in, though this has done little to cap the industry’s growing cash reserves and has left some investors agitating for more.The surfeit of cash has left Apple under pressure from hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital to pay out more.Dell has been criticised by some shareholders for its plans to use its own cash mountain to back a management buyout, rather than paying it out to shareholders directly.Qualcomm said at its annual meeting on Tuesday that it would raise its quarterly dividend payments from 25 cents to 35 cents, a move that is set to add about $700m to its annual payments and lift the dividend yield on its shares to 2.1 per cent.The mobile chipmaker, whose fortunes have boomed with the smartphone industry, said it also planned to repurchase $5bn of its own stock, up from a previous target of $2.5bn, though it did not announce a timeframe for the purchases.The target hinted at a big increase in its share repurchases, which reached $1.3bn in its last fiscal year, itself a large rise from $142m the year before.Many tech companies cut back on their share repurchases to conserve cash after the financial crisis but have ramped up the buybacks again as business conditions improved.Among other increased dividend payouts in the tech sector, Cisco raised its quarterly payments by 75 per cent last year, while Microsoft and IBM also announced increases of more than 10 per cent.Despite earmarking more of their free cash to reward shareholders, most of the big tech companies are limited by the fact that much of their money is held outside the US.This leaves them facing a tax charge if they repatriate the money to pay out in dividends or buybacks.Only $6.1bn of Qualcomm’s cash and investments was held in the US and free to be dispersed to investors at the end of last year.
382;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Tizen joins phone software contenders;Huawei takes up open-source operating system;The mobile industry’s push to develop competitors to the Google and Apple platforms continued with the Tizen Association giving a preview of its open-source operating system and Huawei announcing it would produce phones running the platform this year.Timo Jokiaho of Huawei joined representatives from Samsung, which has already announced it is developing Tizen devices, Intel, NTT Docomo and France Telecom on stage in Barcelona last night to demonstrate the operating system.Open platforms have been high on the agenda at Mobile World Congress. On Sunday night, Mozilla hosted a similar event to launch its Firefox operating system for mobile phones, sharing the stage with partners that included chipmaker Qualcomm and Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms group.Last night, the Tizen Association announced that Fujitsu had joined its ranks. Although Tizen and Firefox appear to have backing from two distinct groups of competitors, some companies back both.Tizen and Firefox are viewed as a play for emerging markets, where phones need to be cheaper and customers are less likely to pay for applications and content. Both use the HTML5 web standard, which allows programs to run in different environments without being re-written. But they will face competition for third place among mobile operating systems from Microsoft’s Windows 8 and the recently relaunched BlackBerry OS.“What we want is something creating value because it is different, and forcing diversity and forcing the others to be more open,” said Yves Maitre, head of handsets at France Telecom. His comments mirrored the thinly veiled attacks on the dominance of Apple and Google that featured at the Firefox OS launch on Sunday and the congress keynote speech on Monday.Despite this, both Orange and NTT Docomo said the first Tizen devices were likely to be upmarket models for sale in their home markets this year.“All Japanese smartphones are high end because Japanese customers want smooth videos and gaming, but of course there will be many areas in the broader market,” said Kiyohito Nagata, managing director of strategic marketing for NTT Docomo and chairman of the Tizen Association.Tizen itself appeared to follow conventions set by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, namely a grid of application icons with a store where more can be downloaded.

Nevertheless, over the past year Intel’s current generation of Atom mobile chips have found their way into about 10 Android-based smartphones, sold mostly in emerging markets, and a handful of Windows 8 powered tablets.While the company acknowledges it is still the “underdog” in the mobile market, it claims these wins have helped “dispel the myth” that its processors cannot compete with Arm-based chips in terms of performance, power consumption and battery life.Underscoring this, the company has recently announced phone deals with Acer, Lava, and Safaricom, and Asus, the Taiwanese electronics group, which will debut a new Android-powered tablet based on Intel’s Atom Z2420 processor at the MWC show today.Now Intel plans to build on this momentum with a range of second-generation chips that will “further accelerate the company’s presence in mobile”, and focus in particular on the market for Android-based tablets and smartphones targeted at emerging markets.The announcements include a new family of dual-core Atom-based processors called Clover Trail+, aimed at both the performance and mainstream smartphone market and Android tablet segments; an entirely new Atom chip called Merrifield that Intel claims will help deliver increased smartphone performance, power efficiency and battery life; and one of the world’s smallest and lowest-power LTE modems designed to run the 4G networks telecom operators are now rolling out.Intel will also announce Bay Trail, the most powerful Atom processor to date, that will double the computing performance of Intel’s current generation of tablet chips. The new chips will be available for use in tablets sold during the 2013 holiday season."
384;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Battle over wireless power standards;;Companies from carmakers to smartphone and consumer electronics manufacturers are locked in a standards battle over wireless power that threatens to slow the move to an unplugged world.Apple, BMW, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm and Samsung are among those registering patents, touting standards and forming rival industry groups around a future where batteries can be charged and devices operated without wired connection to electricity mains.The Wireless Power Consortium has the most momentum. More than 130 companies are members and its Qi technology is in 120 products, including 34 phones, notably Nokia’s Lumia 920 flagship smartphone.But the WPC lacks the support of major phone groups such as Qualcomm and Samsung, which are members of their own Alliance for Wireless Power.There are also different variations of the technology. The WPC’s Qi leads with magnetic induction, which requires precise positioning of a device on a plate to charge it.This is likely to be superseded by magnetic resonance that allows several devices to be charged at once and at a distance of metres from the source.“[We had the] Blu-ray/HD-DVD and VHS/Betamax standards battle, but there are even more organisations involved here,” said Jason dePreaux, an analyst at IMS Research.P&G’s Duracell with its Power Matters Alliance, a German carmaker consortium and companies grouped around the Consumer Electronics Association are other players. Apple is unattached, but has filed its own wireless power patents.“Everyone agrees there needs to be one standard for this to be viable – you don’t want to have multiple charging stations for different technologies at the airport, for example,” said Mr dePreaux. “So that has slowed the industry to some extent.”Eric Giler, chief executive of WiTricity, which has 300 patents around its magnetic resonance technology, sees it being absorbed by the Wireless Power Consortium in a combined standard. “The phone companies got themselves into a bind because they started supporting systems with Qi,” he says.Dave Baarman, Advanced Technologies director at WPC member Fulton Innovation, agrees that all versions of wireless power could be combined.“We want to provide additional solutions such as allowing spatial freedom that provides additional convenience for consumers. It’s all coil-to-coil power transfer no matter what technology you use,” he says.The technology is based on the magnetic fields of electrical coils of wire being able to create currents in conductors with their own coils placed close to them.To transfer power wirelessly, the transmitting and receiving coils in devices have to be within a few millimetres for magnetic induction, but they can be several centimetres or even metres away with the later, more advanced, magnetic resonance technology.Analysts say the different standards and alliances make it difficult to predict how quickly the market will grow. IMS says potentially 5bn devices a year could benefit from wireless power, but is predicting growth from just 5m devices in 2012 to about 100m by 2015.
385;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-02-24T19:06:22Z;Spats curb the charge of wireless power;;Electric cars driven without batteries, magazines and detergent boxes that light up, pans that boil on solid-granite kitchen surfaces – this apparent magic is made possible by the hard science of wireless power.But a wireless power struggle between competing industry groups and standards is inhibiting adoption of this liberating and revolutionary technology.Nokia brought wireless power to the fore with its announcement last September that its Lumia 920 flagship phone would incorporate the function. Instead of plugging their phones into the wall with mini-USB cables, users can just place them on charging plates or pillow accessories to top up their batteries.At the same time, Intel demonstrated a chip solution where an Ultrabook laptop could act as a phone charger without the need for plates or cradles – beaming electricity to a smartphone placed a short distance away from it. Apple filed a patent application in November for how an iMac could wirelessly power its keyboard and mouse, removing the need for batteries.At last month’s International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Qualcomm showed an electric-powered Rolls-Royce in its booth being wirelessly recharged by its Halo system. The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), whose “Qi” (pronounced Chee) technology is in Nokia’s 920, showed dozens of other implementations.Qi is now in 34 phones, 120 products in all, and more than 138 companies are members of the WPC, according to Dave Baarman, director of advanced technologies at Fulton Innovation, a WPC member.He says: “There are over 10m phones in the market now, so that’s starting to get us to a point where we’re getting a good uptake from the consumer.”Now that handset makers are building the technology into their devices, there is no need for the special wireless-charging cases for the phones, which previously had been the norm.They were the speciality of Powermat before it combined in a joint venture with the battery maker Duracell. The brands are now involved with 30 other companies in a wider-ranging consortium – the Power Matters Alliance.Also involved in standards and alliances: the Consumer Electronics Association, Consumer Electronics for Automotive (CE4A), led by carmakers, and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), featuring Qualcomm and Samsung, the leading mobile chip and handset players. Apple remains unaligned.“There’s fragmentation when it comes to standards, there are a lot of different alliances and stakeholders,” says Jason dePreaux, an analyst with IMS Research.“It’s been getting worse rather than getting better over the past six to 12 months – more and more companies have been putting their hat in the ring and bigger names as well.”The two main flavours of wireless charging are electromagnetic induction and resonance. Induction, as used in Nokia’s smartphone, was discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. He found an electrical circuit being carried by a conductor, with an alternating current and its associated fluctuating magnetic field, is able to induce a current in another conductor placed within it.Modern day end-products include induction cooking hobs and electric toothbrushes recharged by their contactless stands.Resonance is a more recent discovery. Marin Soljai, a professor of Physics at MIT, showed in 2007 how electricity could be transferred over greater distances using magnetic fields, turning on a 60-watt lightbulb wirelessly from a distance of two metres.“He came up with this while lying in bed listening to his wife’s cellphone beeping somewhere as it ran out of battery power,” says Eric Giler, chief executive of WiTricity – the MIT spin-off from his discovery.“He thought, with all the electricity running around the walls, why couldn’t he get some of it to go into the phone.”While induction-based devices generally have to be positioned on top of, and flat to, their electromagnetic chargers, resonance-based ones need only to be in fairly close proximity.However, a technology called inductively coupled power transfer (IPT) from PowerbyProxi, a University of Auckland spin-off, offers similar features.“We allow full spatial freedom, you can put the phones anywhere and have multiple devices charged at once,” says Tony Francesca, business development vice-president at PowerbyProxi.The company has more than 125 patents and sells a range of products. WiTricity has more than 300 patents and is focused on licensing its technology, providing developer kits and producing reference designs for manufacturers to follow.Mr Giler says the Qi alliance has a lead, but is “backed up into a corner” because of its reliance on inferior induction technology. “What I think is they’ll just end up adopting our technology, it’s all patented and we just want to get paid,” he says.But the WPC announced transmitter designs last April that incorporated magnetic resonance.“Qi will combine standards and technologies. We call it intelligent wireless power,” says Fulton Innovation’s Mr Baarman.Jason dePreaux, of IMS Research, says the growing number of organisations beyond the WPC makes this more complex than the Blu-ray versus HD-DVD and VHS versus Betamax standards wars of the past.“WiTricity sees all of magnetic resonance falling under its IP, so there also could be a patent litigation landscape in the future,” he adds.His projections are for wireless-power enabled devices to grow from 5m units in 2012 to almost 100m by 2015. But these could prove an under or overestimate, he admits, if a big player such as Apple enters the market or there is no agreement on standards.He says: “The more you talk to unaligned companies, it’s pretty clear that they want to see what happens with the standards before making big investments.“But once it takes off, adoption could be very rapid.”
386;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Phytopharm falls after drug test failure;;Drug developer Phytopharm was the week’s biggest small-cap faller after tests of its flagship drug for treating Parkinson’s disease showed it was no better than a placebo.Phytopharm plunged 81.5 per cent on news that the mid-stage trial involving more than 400 patients showed the drug had no beneficial effects in any tested dose.The comprehensive nature of the failure raised fundamental questions about the group’s strategy and the biotechnology sector, said house broker Peel Hunt. “Ultimately this outcome should have been reached at a lesser loss for shareholders,” said the broker.“Reaching this point sooner remains a key challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Until companies are better able to select specific genetically defined patients for targeted drugs, UK pre-revenue drug development companies will remain a lottery.”IQE, the chip wafer maker, dropped 20.7 per cent on fears of competition in a market that provides about four-fifths of its revenue. Qualcomm said it was making a radio frequency amplifier for mobile phones based around silicon rather than IQE’s epitaxy wafers, currently found in most chips.Nickel miner Toledo Mining rose 59.8 per cent after receiving a takeover offer from Philippines-based construction conglomerate DMCI, run by 91-year-old Philippines businessman David Consunji and his family.Iron ore miner African Minerals fell 12.1 per cent after Sierra Leone’s new minerals regulator said it would review contracts with the aim of collecting more tax.
387;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-31T18:33:21Z;Mixed economic data weigh on Wall St;;US stocks finished lower as investors took some profits on Thursday and weighed new economic data that continued to show mixed forecasts for important segments of the US economy.The S&P 500 lost 0.3 per cent to 1,498.11 in New York to fall back below the psychologically significant 1,500 mark.Despite the decline, the benchmark finished with a 5 per cent gain for the month, marking its best January since 1997.The day’s trading began to fresh labour market data that showed an unexpectedly large pick-up in the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week. Investors have been monitoring labour market data closely this week ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.The losses for stocks followed a similar slump on Wednesday after reports said the US economy shrunk 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,860.58. The Nasdaq Composite index closed marginally lower at 3,142.13.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said: “I’m not too worried about the recent data, we’re just experiencing a pause after a fairly big run for the first month of the year.”He added: “Unless payrolls on Friday come in much worse than forecast, I think we’ll see some consolidation and then continue to move higher.”Companies reporting fourth-quarter results on Thursday also were mixed.Dow Chemical lost 7 per cent to $32.20 as the US manufacturing group said net profits for 2012 fell by a quarter due to a slowdown in the world economy during the second half of last year. The company said its results were particularly set back by weakness in China, the world’s second-largest economy.Despite the poor results, Hassan Ahmed at Alembic Global Advisors said shares in the company were attractively valued as it was positioned to grow earnings in the medium-term.UPS declined 2.4 per cent to $79.29 after the US package delivery company said its quarterly results were hurt by a weaker-than-expected US holiday season.Blackstone shares rose 6.1 per cent to $18.50 as the asset manager said net profits rose 43 per cent in the fourth quarter.Shares in Facebook regained most of their losses after falling as much as 6 per cent. The social networking site reported late on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net profits topped analysts’ estimates. But investors tempered their views on the company’s performance for 2013, citing increased research and development spending. Facebook closed 0.9 per cent lower to $30.97.Information technology and telecom sector stocks were the only two industry groups on the S&P 500 trading in positive territory for the day.The gains for telecoms came as losses at BlackBerry dragged into a second consecutive session after the company, which changed its name from Research in Motion, unveiled its latest smartphone. BlackBerry shares lost 5.8 per cent to $12.98.Analysts at UBS said they did not expect the company’s new smartphone to win over many existing customers from Apple and Google. “The devices may appeal to some highly productive enterprise users and chief information officers, but we believe uptake will be measured,” they said.Qualcomm shares jumped 3.9 per cent to $66.03 as the world’s biggest chipmaker for handsets continued to profit from the increased adoption of smartphones among consumers.Time Warner Cable shares slumped 11.3 per cent to $89.34 after its 2013 earnings forecast was below estimates.JDS Uniphase climbed 17 per cent to $14.51 as the broadband equipment maker reported estimate-beating quarterly results.Bourse operator Nasdaq OMX reported stronger-than-expected net profits for its fourth-quarter early on Thursday, and shares in the company rose 1.6 per cent to $28.41.
388;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-30T21:45:00Z;Qualcomm profit up 35% on smartphone wave;;Qualcomm beat Wall Street expectations and raised its 2013 guidance as the world’s biggest chipmaker for handsets rode the smartphone wave to benefit from its leadership in 4G wireless technologies.The company reported record quarterly revenues of $6.02bn, up 29 per cent on a year ago and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $5.9bn.Net income of $1.91bn and earnings per share of $1.09 were up 35 per cent and beat an analyst consensus of 97 cents, according to Bloomberg data.Qualcomm shares rose 6.5 per cent to $67.65 in after-hours trading in New York.“The wireless business is booming and even if they don’t sell their own wireless chips, they get royalties from anybody licensing 2G, 3G and 4G technologies, so that’s a pretty good business to be in right now,” said Patrick Moorhead, semiconductor analyst at Moor Insights.The company predicted revenues for the current fiscal second quarter in a range where the midpoint would see a 22 per cent rise to about $6.05bn, with earnings per share of about $1.02. Analysts had expected profits of 94 cents a share on sales of $5.87bn. Qualcomm also raised its revenue guidance for the fiscal year by $400m.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm president, said demand for smartphones was not being affected by any macroeconomic uncertainty. “In many places around the world, people will forgo a lot of purchases before they forgo a smartphone,” he told the Financial Times.Analysts estimate Qualcomm has a lead of up to two years over the competition in its integration of the various wireless standards, including 4G LTE, in its chipsets.Mr Mollenkopf said shipments of these “multimode” chips that included LTE were up more than 90 per cent on the previous quarter.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said the company was making excellent progress in China and saw plenty of opportunity ahead – smartphone sales rose 115 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2012 there and Qualcomm chips are in 14 out of 31 devices selected for LTE trials in China.Over the holiday season, its chipsets featured in popular smartphones including the Samsung Galaxy S III, the Nexus 4, and Nokia Lumia.More than 600 devices have been announced featuring Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors and another 450 are in development, the company said.Qualcomm also announced the retirement of Bill Keitel, chief financial officer for the past 11 years. He will stay on until March, when George Davis, currently CFO of chip equipment maker Applied Materials, will take over the role.
389;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-22T23:10:14Z;Technology: Unplugged era changes the way we interact with gadgets;Hardware is losing its primacy to software and services as consumers engage with the user experience, writes Chris Nuttall;"Skimming down the ski slopes of Davos this year, wearing the latest gadgets from this month’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, digerati will be able to register their speed, altitude, position, distance, temperature, heart rate and even brain activity at any given second.With point-of-view action cams attached to ski poles and helmets, the whole experience could be captured in wide-angle UltraHD quality and streamed to a smartphone screen or out to watching friends on Facebook.From internal body readings to external telemetry and the sharing of this to an outside world, technology is turning personal experiences into universal ones.Beyond the social aspects, a proliferation of networked sensors attached to ourselves, our cars and the surrounding environment is producing huge amounts of data to be crunched and interpreted to predict traffic patterns, retail intentions, the likelihood of flu outbreaks and 1,001 other scenarios. They can also identify and lead you to that one bay still vacant in a parking lot.This “Internet of Things” – tiny, web-connected sensors communicating with one another – has been long talked about, but the network is expected to reach a new level of maturity this year with improved NFC, Bluetooth and WiFi wireless technologies and more than 1bn smartphones expected to be sold, according to Deloitte research.As well as this devolution of tasks to smaller, smart objects, we are seeing the beginning of consumer electronics becoming electronics made or financed by consumers themselves, rather than the usual manufacturing giants.A number of devices at CES, from smart watches to game consoles, were crowdfunded on sites such as Kickstarter, with users financing production runs of drawing board design concepts. We are also seeing more affordable 3D printers, costing as little as $500, that allow consumers to create their own objects, built up layer by layer in plastic and other materials, in a method similar to ink-jet printers.In the near term, though, individuals and small companies are more likely to outsource their needs to 3D print shops such as Sculpteo, running more sophisticated machines.Hardware is losing its primacy, anyway, to software and services. Apple announced this month the acceleration of the app economy– 40bn downloads from its App Store in its four-year history, but with nearly 20bn coming in just the last year.Hardware melts away if consumers are engaged by the user experience and with ever thinner smartphones, tablets and TVs stripping away frames and edges to just show a screen, the disappearing act is almost complete. Samsung and LG have produced vibrant, curved OLED big-screen TVs that are less than 5mm thick.Wires are disappearing too. Magnetic coils under carpeting and counters provide wireless power to compatible devices such as a lamp stand or a food mixer. Wireless charging is also becoming available for electric vehicles – just drive your car on to a special mat to have it begin powering up.Making the technology invisible and drawing us into what is displayed on a screen encourages natural interactions. Voice commands and gestures are becoming more sophisticated and webcams offer facial recognition and authentication. Leap Motion will launch a motion sensor the size of a pack of chewing gum early this year that can track finger movements with unprecedented precision, enabling users to mould virtual clay on screen or play “air” piano.In its annual forecast, IBM predicted computing will soon be able to replicate the five senses – touchscreens will allow you to feel the silkiness of bed sheets before you order them online, computers will be able to see an area of diseased tissue in an MRI and hear sound frequencies that detect a weakness in a bridge before it collapses.Taste comes with computing perfect meals by using an algorithmic recipe of favourite flavours and optimal nutrition. Sensors will soon be able to “smell” and distinguish odours, enabling analysis of soil conditions or sanitation systems.But don’t write off the power of the human brain. Wearing a Muse headband at CES that read my brainwaves, I was able to control a video game by concentrating on the screen.This was just one example in the growing category of wearable and embedded tech, which analysts see as the next wave of personal computing.Others include Google Glass, intelligent eyewear coming from the search company, and the Basis wristband, with sensors that can measure perspiration, skin temperature and heart-rate patterns, as well as motion.It is only a matter of time before this kind of monitoring is generally available inside the body. Qualcomm, the leading wireless chip company, is working with researchers on technology placed in the bloodstream that will send an alert to a smartphone giving a two-week warning of a heart attack.Qualcomm has also set a futuristic $10m challenge to revolutionise healthcare, inviting teams of engineers to create the tricorder, the diagnostic sensor-laden health tool in Star Trek.“I totally believe this is possible and I believe this is going to revolutionise healthcare,” says Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive. He is attending the forum in Davos, where he also plans to ski, check his sensors and his smartphone; probably all at the same time."
390;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-11T19:55:23Z;Paul Jacobs: smartphone king;The Qualcomm chief has played a key role in the rise of the device, writes Chris Nuttall;"Paul Jacobs commanded the stage in Las Vegas this week, delivering a speech on the future of mobile, introducing movie, music and sports stars. Even Sesame Street’s Big Bird showed up.Tall and affable, with a laid-back style, Mr Jacobs and his company Qualcomm took over the eve-of-show keynote slot long occupied by Microsoft’s Bill Gates at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, the biggest event in the technology calendar.Consumers themselves are barely aware that Qualcomm’s wireless chips are powering their everyday lives and that Mr Jacobs has probably done as much for the smartphone as the late Steve Jobs. But this week the San Diego company and its leader stepped confidently out of the shadows.His aim is to establish Qualcomm – which has grown by combining wireless, processing and graphics power on a single chip – in the public’s mind as the leader of the mobile era, in the same way Intel is identified with the fading personal computer one.Until Las Vegas, the company had been happy to hide its brand and products inside handsets. Now, mixing showbiz with chips seems fitting and, after all, Qualcomm’s success is founded on a technology created by Hedy Lamarr, both a movie star and inventor.In 1942, while a working Hollywood actress, she patented a frequency-switching radio system for guiding torpedoes, just as a sideline. Seventy years on, Qualcomm overtook the market capitalisation of Intel, still the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, as investors saw more growth in smartphones and other mobile devices than in PCs.Mr Jacobs had foreseen the usefulness of phones for activities other than voice calls much earlier – while sitting on a beach in Maui, Hawaii, in the 1990s. He says he had an epiphany when he typed in a search request for a nearby sushi restaurant on a primitively internet-enabled Qualcomm phone and saw the answer come back.“All of a sudden, the world was a different place for me with a mobile phone and I just knew the smartphone was going to happen,” he says. However, his first solution for such a handset would have horrified an Apple iPhone designer.“It was the era of Palm PDAs [personal digital assistants] and we were making our own cellphones and we were in a meeting with all of ours on the table,” recalls Peggy Johnson, a 23-year Qualcomm veteran and president of global market development.“Paul said: ‘This is what I want to do’ and he picked up a cellphone and a Palm and he duct-taped them together. We ended up making that and unfortunately it was about as thick as the one he demonstrated.”One look at the plaques on his office wall at Qualcomm’s headquarters confirms Mr Jacobs is a man of ideas – they describe the 40-plus patents he has registered as an engineer. “At heart, he’s kind of a nerd, a Star Trek fan that likes to play with gadgets – if you go in his office, they’re all over the place,” says Matt Grob, Qualcomm’s chief technology officer.The third of four sons, the 50-year-old Mr Jacobs studied electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, writing his doctorate thesis on robotics.He joined Qualcomm as an engineer in 1990 and rose through the ranks to succeed his father as chief executive in 2005. Dr Irwin Jacobs, co-founder of Qualcomm, is a 79-year-old dapper, professorial figure. His son, by contrast, attended his chief executive interview with the board wearing shorts. Yet his handling of the company has met with paternal approval: “I think he’s happy, he’s proud to see us build off the foundation and become a much bigger company,” the son says.A love of technology appears to run through the generations. One of Paul Jacobs’ three children has just started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; his youngest, a 13-year-old boy, is, he says, a keen gadget tester who delights in giving his father feedback.Any investor fears of nepotism in his appointment to the top job were not reflected within the company. “Internally, it was clear that he was an excellent choice and the company did look at alternatives, it wasn’t rubber stamped,” says Mr Grob, who describes Mr Jacobs as a charismatic yet “very demanding” boss. “He’s capable of very high intensity and he can go all day and night without eating or sleeping.” Relaxation comes in the form of skiing trips in the Colorado mountains.A fascination with new ideas has led Mr Jacobs to experiment and take risks – with mixed results. A foray into handset making in the 1990s was lossmaking and eventually sold. Later, as chief executive, he sank more than $1bn into creating MediaFLO, a multi-channel TV service for mobiles that was soon shut down due to lack of demand. Expansion into areas such as display technology, wireless charging for cars and mobile health technology has yet to bear any serious fruit.Yet he remains sanguine. “Sometimes, obviously, I’m too early, I don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen,” he acknowledges. “Like I used to go to cocktail parties and tell people how they would have the internet on their phone and they looked at me like I was nuts.”These days his party talk is likely to involve chatter about a “digital sixth sense” whereby our phones monitor our bodies, augmenting our vision with their sensors and cameras. Micro-technology in our blood streams will send alerts to our phones two weeks in advance of an impending heart attack, for example.The way to realise such visions is via the 150m chips Qualcomm ships each quarter. “The chip-set business to me is a distribution channel for ideas and that’s how I portray it to staff,” he says. “If you have an idea you can reach 150m people’s lives in three months.”While not all his visions have become reality, Mr Jacobs is, as his showmanship in Las Vegas demonstrated, a harbinger of a mobile future.The writer is the FT’s technology correspondent"
391;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-09T14:44:21Z;Qualcomm takes centre stage in Las Vegas;;"Qualcomm’s “Born Mobile” sign towers over other billboards; its booth is one of the biggest and its chief executive delivered the main keynote speech, with appearances by music and film celebrities and even Sesame Street’s Big Bird.For a company that has traditionally avoided the limelight and not emphasised its brand in its customers’ products, the world’s biggest maker of mobile chips by shipments appears to be using this year’s international Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as its coming-out party.Much as Intel came to prominence with the rise of PCs, Qualcomm’s influence is growing as smartphones and tablets become ever more popular. Investors have already started to take notice of this generational change – Qualcomm’s market value rose above Intel’s for the first time in November, even though Intel’s revenues are nearly three times larger.Qualcomm shipped 590m chipsets for smartphones and other devices last year, which means its ideas “can affect 150m people’s lives every three months”, Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told reporters on Tuesday.Its latest chipset, unveiled at CES and due to be launched this summer, represents a big improvement to the performance of mobile devices. The Snapdragon 800 platform has processing power that nearly rivals that of PC chips, and graphics processing that can handle “UltraHD” content that has four times the resolution of full HD.Qualcomm constructed a film theatre on its booth to show off the outsized powers of the mobile chip, demonstrating how it can deliver a stunning picture, even to an 84-inch TV screen, and 7.1 Dolby surround sound through speakers.The platform also extends Qualcomm’s advantage in providing the fastest wireless connectivity, featuring the 4G wireless communications standard LTE on the chip, and next-generation WiFi. More than 50 products have already been designed to use the Snapdragon 800.“We expect this will set the performance bar for a high-end smartphone and I believe it will be in a class of its own, with clearly tablets using it as well,” says Raj Talluri, Qualcomm’s head of product management.Qualcomm’s rise reflects the changing fortunes of the smartphone and PC industries. Some 567m smartphones shipped in 2012, according to NPD DisplaySearch estimates, while PC shipments likely fell from 353m to 349m, according to the IHS iSuppli research firm.Sterne, Agee and Leach research analysts predicted this week that the smartphone market would grow 38 per cent this year and 29 per cent in 2014.“We continue to believe that PCs face an uphill battle given high average selling prices, slow Windows 8 adoption and competition from tablets,” they said.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity this week named Qualcomm their top pick for 2013 among larger companies.“We believe Qualcomm is well positioned to post strong earnings growth in 2013 and beyond due to stable royalty rates, strong market share for integrated chipsets and growth of 3G devices in emerging markets,” it said.However, while Intel had long enjoyed a dominant market position in processor chips for PCs, with only AMD as a competitor, Qualcomm faces a much more fragmented market in smartphones. Samsung and Apple both use their own processor chips, while Nvidia and Intel both have rival products.In China, the world’s biggest smartphones market, Qualcomm must compete with Taiwanese and Chinese chipmakers such as MediaTek, Spreadtrum and MStar that often undercut it on price.But for now, Qualcomm is maintaining its technology lead over its many rivals and expanding beyond the phone. It has significant market share in home networks through its Atheros acquisition and last month it invested Y9.9bn ($121m) in Sharp, the struggling Japanese display maker.As part of that deal, the two companies will co-operate to develop energy-efficient next-generation displays for mobile phones and tablet computers.Qualcomm is also exploring health products and its Qualcomm Halo wireless charging system can charge electric cars as they enter a garage without the need to plug them in.An electric-powered Rolls-Royce is on Qualcomm’s stand to demonstrate the charging feature, another sign of the San Diego-based company’s new urge to impress.“We have an opportunity to build our brand and we’re going to be working at doing that,” said Mr Jacobs."
392;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-08T07:11:47Z;CES 2013 – Ballmer and Big Bird bolster Qualcomm’s coming-out party;;Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer made a surprise appearance at Qualcomm’s opening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday night alongside Qualcomm’s Paul Jacobs.With Microsoft a CES keynote staple for many years, the moment was choreographed as a symbolic passing of the torch to Qualcomm which – as the two chiefs chimed in unison – was “born mobile”.The chipmaker’s Snapdragon processors sit inside a majority of the mobile devices that have replaced PCs as the world’s dominant computing platform – and, increasingly, are absorbing many of the gadgets traditionally unveiled at CES.Mr Jacobs announced two new products, the Snapdragon 600 and 800, offering improved performance, 4G networking at up to 150Mbps and better power management.But beyond the launches, the keynote was really intended to position Qualcomm as the platform that underpins a new generation of innovation, from wireless charging for electric cars to augmented reality app platforms, via a starry series of entertainment industry appearances from director Guillermo del Toro, Maroon 5 and even Sesame Street’s Big Bird.Neatly underlining the shift from a PC- to mobile-centric tech industry, Qualcomm’s valuation overtook Intel’s market capitalisation last November and Mr Jacobs used his CES platform to set out a vision of mobile ubiquity.“This is the first time a mobile company has opened the Consumer Electronics Show,” he said to whoops and cheers usually reserved for the gadget makers themselves.“Of course, Qualcomm is not a traditional consumer electronics company. We don’t make TVs or stereos or games consoles but we are at the heart of mobile devices and a growing number of consumer electronics products that are at the centre of everything you do.”As well as smartphones and tablets – whose success is actually sucking much of the growth out of the rest of the electronics industry amid sluggish economy – Qualcomm processors can be found in games consoles, smart-home systems, automotive networks and connected TVs. Mr Jacobs enthused about body sensors that connect to smartphones to create a “digital sixth sense” and make “the real world clickable”.“All the objects around us will communicate with us,” he said. “Wireless is really expanding beyond what we traditionally think of as mobile.”
393;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-07T20:59:54Z;CES 2013 – Intel promises all-day power;;Intel has unveiled new Atom processors for tablets and smartphones at International CES as it tries to make inroads in a market dominated by its rivals’ ARM-based chips.The world’s biggest chipmaker also introduced its fourth-generation Core processor, codenamed Haswell, which it promises will finally deliver all-day battery life for laptops. New table PCs were also being featured (pictured) and advances in “perceptual” computing.We were at Intel’s news conference and our as-it-happened report is after the jump.12.52pm Pacific time I’ve managed to secure a good spot on the front row and the news conference will start at the top of the hour. Mooly Eden, the beret-wearing head of Intel Israel, is out front cracking jokes with journalists.1pm And we start with a video showing Intel’s new products, strangely comparing them with the “game-changing” game 100 years ago between Notre Dame and Army that had a forward pass innovation that changed American Football (??).1.03pm Mike Bell, general manager of the mobile and communications group, is now on stage to talk about smartphones with Intel inside. He shows a chart where the Motorola Droid Razr i with an Atom processor beats the iPhone 5 on performance. The Razr i has better battery life than the Razr M with a Qualcomm processor, he says.1.05pm The Atom platform codenamed Lexington is introduced, aimed at cheaper smartphones or it’s “the value smartphone for emerging markets” in Intel’s words.1.09pm The platform includes dual-SIMs, FM radio, a MicroSD card slot and Wireless Display for playing back on TVs – sounds pretty sophisticated for a basic smartphone. Handsets coming from Acer, Lava and SafariCom.1.11pm Moving on to tablets , Mike shows the Atom Z2760, 1.8ghz, dual core, 10 hours plus battery life. We already knew about this chip.1.13pm Now a sneak peek of Bay Trail – next-gen 22nm technology with a new Atom microarchitecture, quad core, with twice the performance of the current generation. We’re shown three tablets running on it from Asian manufacturers, but systems won’t be on sale till holiday 2013.1.15pm Kirk Skaugen, head of the PC Client group, is up next to talk about Ultrabooks and convertibles. He announces low-powered third-gen Core processors are shipping from today with a 7 watt power envelope and offering five times the performance of the rival Nvidia Tegra 3 product. He shows an Acer Iconia convertible featuring the processor that is 20 per cent thinner and will be available in the spring.1.20pm 140 Ultrabook models are now in the marketplace, prices are down to $599, says Kirk. About 40 touch designs will soon be in the market. He shows us an ultrathin 15in NEC notebook. Fourth-generation Intel Core processors are the first designed from the ground up for Ultrabooks. 4th-gen Ultrabooks will have to have a touch capability to be called an Ultrabook, he says, announcing a change in the specifications. The largest battery life increase generation-on-generation will be achieved with all-day battery life finally coming.1.27pm Finally, a reference design for an 11.6in tablet that can be attached to a keyboard, very light at 850g and running a low-power fourth-gen Core i5 processor. We think convertibles will come down in price to $799-$899, he says.1.30pm Kirk talks about the new table PC category and we see Lenovo’s new 27in all-in-one with a family playing Monopoly on it, followed by a Vegas card game on a larger touchscreen.1.33pm We’re shown more content developments, with Comcast launching an Xfinity home gateway box with Intel inside, delivering premium content from this glorified router, without the need for a set-top box.1.35pm Finally, perceptual computing – eyes, ears, voice, touch and emotional context being added to the PC with natural human interfaces. Kirk talks about Dell’s Nuance voice app. We see in a demo that progress has been made with logging in using facial recognition and ten-finger manipulations within games. We also see eye-tracking being used in Where’s Waldo? to pinpoint the character in an ebook game.1.48pm And that’s it, as we all dash off to Samsung’s presser.
394;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-06T15:50:24Z;Electronics show seeks to banish blues;;The 2013 International CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week will seek to banish the blues of 2012, where television shipments fell, a new generation of Windows 8 computers disappointed and the year ended with a 7 per cent fall in holiday-season sales.The annual setting-out of stalls for the industry has already set a record – 1.87m sq ft of exhibition space stretched across this city, up slightly from 1.86m in 2012, as manufacturers pin their hopes for the new year on thousands of products on display for the first time.“I think it’s going to be the most innovative and exciting we’ve had and will be a great upbeat show to start the year,” says Gary Shapiro, president of the US organisers – the Consumer Electronics Association. He expects more than 150,000 trade visitors, including 30,000 from abroad.But the show will reflect a shift away from traditionally dominant categories such as the PC, while new devices may no longer be the key to success with consumers, according to analysts.James McQuivey, analyst with Forrester Research, says users are less swayed by hardware features such as bigger screens and brighter pictures.“It’s a very bitter pill to swallow for manufacturers, but the device is no longer the centre of the digital universe,” he says.“Now consumers’ digital relationship is with the platform and content, whether it’s iTunes or Google Play or Amazon, and that relationship dictates the devices that interest them.”Microsoft has given up both its traditional eve-of-show keynote slot and its convention centre booth, with Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, now delivering the keynote speech and his company’s presence becoming larger than that of rival chipmaker Intel for the first time.Qualcomm has overtaken Intel in market capitalisation in recent months as investors have noted its leadership in smartphones, a faster growing category than PCs, where shipments declined in 2012.Apple has long ignored the show but reports that it will finally make a serious assault on the TV market in 2013 appear to be galvanising manufacturers into announcing improvements to the interfaces of their smart TV models and greater interaction with smartphones and tablets. UltraHD, a standard that offers four-times the resolution of the current Full HD standard, will be promoted on top-of-the-line TVs, although they are likely to be priced in the $20,000 range.Other technologies expected to be strongly represented at the show include wireless charging, gesture and voice controls, 3D printing, robotics, new in-car interfaces and wearable technology such as smartwatches and health and fitness aids.The NPD research firm reported this month that global TV shipments were expected to have declined 6 per cent in 2012 in tough economic conditions, while Windows US notebook holiday unit sales fell 11 per cent and overall US consumer electronics spending was down 7 per cent at $13.7bn.“The inability of the CE market to find substantial new pockets of revenue looms menacingly over the industry’s future,” NPD said.
395;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2013-01-02T18:28:49Z;RIM paid Nokia €50m to settle dispute;;Research In Motion, the struggling Canadian manufacturer of the BlackBerry family of smartphones, paid rival Nokia €50m ($65m) to settle a patent dispute between the two companies related primarily to WiFi networking, according to regulatory filings.Nokia stepped up its patent dispute with RIM in November, filing lawsuits in the UK, Canada and the US seeking to enforce a Swedish arbitration ruling against the Canadian company. If that ruling had been upheld, it could have forced RIM to stop selling its WiFi enabled handsets in those markets.The two companies first announced the settlement “of all patent litigation between the companies” and new patent license agreement on December 21 but did not initially reveal the terms of the settlement.Since then, however, RIM has disclosed details of the lump sum settlement in a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts estimate that in addition to the lump sum settlement RIM will pay Nokia a licence fee of between $2 and $5 for each handset it sells using Nokia’s technology.Both Nokia and RIM have suffered big setbacks in their smartphone businesses following the success of Apple’s iPhone and devices powered by Google’s Android operating system. Nokia, in particular, has sought to exploit its extensive intellectual property portfolios to offset declines in its core business operations.Nokia, which has formed a close partnership with Microsoft to develop smartphones based on the Windows Phone operating system, derives about $650m a year in revenues from its wireless patent portfolio, which experts say is one of the industry’s most extensive.The smartphone market has been rocked by patent disputes in recent years, including Apple’s successful suit against Samsung, which the Korean handset maker is challenging.Other big patent portfolio holders include Ericsson and Qualcomm, while Google bolstered its own patent portfolio through the acquisition earlier this year of Motorola Mobility.
396;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Letter from Lex – Christmas shopping;;Some companies have started their Christmas shopping early. Baxter spent $4bn buying Swedish dialysis-product maker Gambro, but it was the world’s second biggest copper producer that really splashed the cash. Freeport-McMoRan spent $20bn on two oil exploration & production companies as it diversified into a new industry. That was not the only big oil or mining story. Repsol filed a $10.5bn arbitration request at the World Bank over Argentina’s expropriation of YPF. In mining, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took a stake in Norilsk Nickel in an attempt to settle a long-running spat between two other Russian billionaires. In a separate dispute over commodities, Singapore threw its full weight behind trader Olam to fend off shortseller Muddy Waters.Others were also thinking about buying or selling. Cable & Wireless Communications could receive more than $1bn for its telecoms interests in eight islands from Bahrain’s Batelco while Singapore Airlines is looking to sell its 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic. US chipmaker Qualcomm decided to risk $120m by investing in struggling electronics maker Sharp while UK grocer Tesco made a long-overdue decision to withdraw from the US market. In the aerospace & defence sector three European nations raised their stakes in EADS while Rolls-Royce faced the possibility of prosecution over allegations of corruption and bribery in Indonesia and China. Meanwhile the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, Apple, experienced its worst share price decline in four years. Competitor Samsung elevated Jay Lee to vice-chairman in a further step towards one day taking overall control of the company.The banking sector was still preoccupied with fallout from the financial crisis and other scandals. Whistleblowers alleged that Deutsche Bank hid huge losses on derivatives during the height of the crisis to avoid a bailout while UBS was in talks with regulators about penalties for allegedly rigging the Libor benchmark. In the US, Citigroup cut 11,000 jobs while Bank of New York Mellon was drawn further into a dispute over Argentine bondholders. In the UK, banks are still at the mercy of populist politicians, who increased the levy on their balance sheets. At least one bank was looking elsewhere – Barclays agreed a deal to sell its African business to South Africa-based Absa.John Casey, Lex Publisher
397;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm agrees Y9.9bn Sharp investment;;Qualcomm, the US technology group that makes microchips for Apple’s iPhone and other mobile devices, has moved to expand its reach into new components by agreeing to invest up to Y9.9bn ($121m) in the struggling Japanese display maker Sharp.Qualcomm has committed to buy at least Y4.9bn of new Sharp shares this month, with possible increases in its investment to be decided from March. It would own roughly 5 per cent of Sharp if it invested the maximum amount allowed under the terms of the deal.The two companies will co-operate to develop energy-efficient next-generation displays for mobile phones and tablet computers, according to an announcement on Tuesday.Sharp is struggling financially and has been seeking new sources of capital since talks over a proposed Y67bn rescue investment from Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, stalled this summer.Mr Gou agreed in March to buy part of a Sharp display factory in western Japan, but Sharp’s plunging share price has soured his outlook on a proposed second element of the deal under which he would take a stake in the company itself.Qualcomm’s initial investment will be made at a significantly lower price than Mr Gou’s original proposal of Y550 a share. Sharp’s shares closed up 1.16 per cent to Y174 on Tuesday.Sharp is considered a global leader in display technology but it has suffered as a result of over-investment in production facilities in Japan, where costs are high.It expects to end the financial year to March with a net loss of Y450bn, worse than the Y396bn loss posted last year, owing to heavy restructuring charges and declining sales.The attraction for Qualcomm is Sharp’s latest display technology, known as Igzo, which boasts improved resolution and lower power consumption than existing mobile displays. A version is already used in some of the latest iPhones and iPads, but production problems have kept output lower than planned.Under Tuesday’s deal, Sharp will share knowhow with Pixtronix, a start-up display maker that Qualcomm acquired in January. Pixtronix is working on a next-generation microelectromechanical system (MEMS) display that Qualcomm believes would benefit from elements of Sharp’s Igzo technology.Displays are among the priciest components in smartphones and tablets, commanding 22 per cent of the estimated $199 production cost of a 16-gigabite iPhone 5, according to IHS iSuppli, the research group.Qualcomm has prospered as the market for mobile devices has boomed: its market value has overtaken that of Intel, the top supplier of chips for personal computers.
398;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-11-19T20:34:50Z;Intel – disquieting signs;New boss should explain how to avoid future profit fall;If Paul Otellini had announced his retirement six months ago, he could have bragged that Intel’s stock had out-returned the US market over one, three and five years. Instead, he announced it on Monday. Sadly for him, the company he has run since 2005 now trails the market during those periods. Intel shares have lost a quarter of their value in three months.The problem is that Intel’s mobile computing problem is getting worse. There are still few signs that it is getting traction in smartphones and tablets. In Intel’s core market, PC sales fell 8 per cent in the third quarter. Reviews for Windows 8, the operating system that PC buyers were all (in theory) waiting for, have been mixed, and the man who led the Windows 8 launch has left Microsoft. Apple is reportedly considering replacing Intel in its PCs in favour of chips that use the same Arm Holdings architecture as its mobile devices. And then there is the steady drone of news about Arm chips in server computers – where Intel generates 20 per cent of sales.Assume, however, that Intel manages to take a share of the mobile market. Why would it not take a nasty hit to margins in the process? In the third quarter, Intel’s operating margin was 29 per cent. Qualcomm has a 16 per cent margin in its chips division and has the advantage of selling integrated processor/radio chips containing Qualcomm’s solid-gold intellectual property in the radio. MediaTek, which supplies the processors for lower-end smartphones, especially in China, comes in at roughly the same level. Yes, Arm makes fat margins licensing its intellectual property but its profits are less than a 30th of Intel’s. The first job for Intel’s new boss is to explain exactly why even those investors who assume that Intel will ultimately win in mobile should not, all the same, pencil in a long-term decline in profits.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
399;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

401;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-11-08T19:59:10Z;Qualcomm vies with Intel as chip champion;;Intel, the chipmaker that was once a stock market champion for the technology sector, was overtaken briefly in market value by rival Qualcomm in a sign of the rapidly changing fortunes of the smartphone and personal computer industries.Shares in Qualcomm rose nearly 6 per cent to $61.99 in New York at midday on Thursday, giving the leading mobile chipmaker a market capitalisation of $105.5bn. This eclipsed the $104.6bn market capitalisation of Intel, a company that has led the development of the PC chip.The shares retreated later in the day to $60.74, putting the company back just below Intel.The gap between the two companies has been narrowing sharply. Shares in Intel, which hit a peak market capitalisation of $502bn in 2000 amid the dotcom bubble, have fallen 14.9 per cent during the past year and 14 per cent over the past decade.In contrast, Qualcomm shares have jumped 254 per cent during the past decade and 8.3 per cent this year. Qualcomm reported quarterly earnings and forecasts ahead of Wall Street expectations on Wednesday as its chips captured more market share in smartphones, tablets and new laptop/tablet convertible devices.Intel, whose processors are in four out of five PCs sold, reported a 5 per cent fall in revenues in its last quarter as PCs headed for their first annual decline in 11 years.Shipments of 349m units are expected by the IHS iSuppli research company, down from 353m in 2011, while NPD DisplaySearch predicts 567m smartphones will be shipped this year and the number will pass 1bn in 2016.“We saw that mobile was going to be the key market to be in some time ago and we invested in key technologies much earlier than everybody else,” Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s president, told the Financial Times.Qualcomm reported its processors were in 24 out of 27 smartphones launched by leading operators in Japan in October. They also featured in two hybrid laptop/tablets launched by Asus and Dell, running Windows RT, a new version of Microsoft’s operating system that will work with power-frugal processors based on the designs of the UK’s Arm.Intel has been fighting back, with its own lower-power chips beginning to feature in smartphones and tablets this year. It is still the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues – it recorded $54bn in 2011, compared with Qualcomm’s $19bn in its just completed fiscal year.“The semiconductor industry has been around for 60 or so years and Intel has successfully reinvented itself from a memory company to a microprocessor company and has had a fantastic last 25 years – really enabling the PC revolution with Microsoft,” said Warren East, Arm chief executive, at the Open Mobile Summit in San Francisco on Wednesday.While it would remain successful for several more years, “we can see Arm technology becoming very pervasive”, he said.As well as its processors, Qualcomm also holds a dominant position in wireless chipsets that connect users to networks.“Qualcomm still has a roughly 18-month lead on competitors in integrated 3G/4G modem technology,” said Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Walkley in a report on Thursday.
402;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-11-07T23:55:27Z;Qualcomm predicts good final quarter;;Qualcomm, the largest wireless chipmaker by revenues, predicted sales ahead of Wall Street expectations for the final three months of the year, with its chips featuring in the launch of high-profile mobile devices.The San Diego-based company’s latest S4 quad-core processor is inside Google’s Nexus 4 and LG’s Optimus G smartphones launched this month and powers convertible laptop/tablets from Dell and Asus using a new version of Windows.Qualcomm said 24 out of 27 smartphones launched by leading operators in Japan in October were powered by its processors.It is seeing strong sales globally for its multi-band, multi-mode modem chips that cover all flavours of wireless, including the latest 4G LTE standards, and feature in phones like the iPhone 5.For its fiscal year that began in October, the company predicted revenues of $23bn-$24bn, which would be up 20-26 per cent on the previous year.The company said it projects 20 to 30 per cent growth in first-quarter revenues, to $5.6bn-$6.1bn. Analysts expected sales of $5.33bn, according to Bloomberg data.Qualcomm shares rose 8 per cent on the news to $62.84 in after-hours trading in New York.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm president, told an analyst conference call that its 8960 Snapdragon dual-core processor had set a global standard for performance and battery life.It features in the best-selling Android phone – the Samsung Galaxy S III, as well as HTC’s 8X smartphone, Motorola’s Razr M and Nokia’s Lumia phones.Qualcomm has been the sole supplier of processors for Windows-powered smartphones.The company’s chips are based on the low-power designs of the UK’s Arm and are optimised for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.The growth of the categories has boosted Qualcomm’s fortunes, in contrast to its bigger rival Intel, which has been hit by declining PC demand.In an FT interview, Mr Mollenkopf said Qualcomm’s business was proving more resilient than that of other chipmakers, which were complaining of difficult economic conditions.Qualcomm predicts that its market will grow by around 14 per cent in 2013.“I don’t think there are others growing that reliably and fast. People will do without a lot of things but they won’t do without their smartphones,” he said.Qualcomm reported record revenues of $19.12bn for its fiscal year to the end of September – up 28 per cent year-on-year.Fourth-quarter revenues of $4.87bn and earnings per share of 89 cents beat Wall Street expectations of $4.68bn and 82 cents. Net income of $1.27bn was up 20 per cent year-on-year.“I am very pleased with our performance this year,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive. “We delivered record revenues, earnings and [modem] chip set shipments driven by increasing global consumption of wireless data across a diverse range of devices, particularly smartphones.”
403;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-09-26T22:34:00Z;Imagination hit by US partner’s retreat;;Shares in Imagination Technologies lost nearly a tenth of their value on Wednesday after one of the UK chipmaker’s long-term partners said it was backing away from the smartphone and tablet markets.The decision by Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by revenues, to refocus away from smartphone and tablet chips had a knock-on effect on Imagination, which counts the Dallas-based group as one of its biggest customers.At an investor conference in New York on Tuesday, Texas Instruments – thought to be one of Imagination’s top three royalty payers – said the emergence of a few large players and changing market trends had made its chips for smartphones and tablets “less attractive”.Analysts suggested that the move would knock an estimated £10m – about 12 per cent – from Imagination Technologies’ full-year revenues, and shares in the London-listed group closed down 9.62 per cent on Wednesday at 470p.The share price fall wiped out recent gains for Imagination, whose blueprints are in the core A6 processor chip used in the iPhone 5, following last Friday’s launch of Apple’s flagship smartphone.“This is clearly a material negative for Imagination,” said James Goodman at Investec. “This could affect up to 20 per cent of [pro forma] group profits over time.”Mr Goodman said that the £10m hit to Imagination’s top line “would not disappear immediately, and could potentially be won back through other accounts, but a significant proportion of devices could move to Qualcomm, Nvidia and others using their own graphics chips, or those who are partners of rival Arm Holdings”.Dan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investments Research, said the fall in Imagination’s shares highlighted how vulnerable the company was on a few key clients.Although Imagination has never confirmed it, the group is especially dependent on Apple contracts, with an estimated 40 per cent of its technology division’s revenue stemming from the US device manufacturer.This is in contrast to Arm Holdings, which is more dominant in its market segment.Imagination and Arm have traded on similar multiples, earlier this year, close to 40 times forward earnings estimates. However, recent share price falls have put Imagination on a discount to Arm, which Mr Ridsdale said was justified.“It shows that Arm Holdings is the higher quality business. Imagination is not dominant in its market the same way that Arm is. Imagination has a number of strong competitors including Arm and Qualcomm,” he said.Texas Instruments’ decision was sparked by it being superseded as the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for wireless devices, having been overtaken in recent years by its US rival Qualcomm.Device makers Apple and Samsung have been designing their own mobile chips, further eating into Texas Instruments’ markets. Texas Instruments has an estimated 10 customers and $900m in annual revenues for its smartphone and tablet chips.
404;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Texas Instruments retreats from smartphones;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by revenues, is beating a retreat from the smartphone and tablet markets as competition intensifies.Once the leading manufacturer of chips for wireless devices globally, TI has been overtaken in recent years by its US rival Qualcomm, while new entrants such as Nvidia and Intel have appeared and device makers Apple and Samsung have been designing their own mobile chips.The chipmaker, based in Dallas, Texas, told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that TI’s chips for smartphones and tablets were “less attractive” with the emergence of a few large players and changing market trends.It would be “reprofiling” its investment in those markets and concentrating on addressing the broader market of embedded processing, the company said. TI makes a wide range of chips for many different industries.“In effect, the company will stop investing in R&D for new products in those markets, and instead focus on a more horizontal approach,” said Sumit Dhanda, semiconductor analyst with the International Strategy and Investment group, in a note.ISI estimates TI has 10 customers and $900m in annual revenues for its smartphone and tablet chips. Its shares closed 3 per cent lower at $27.83 on the news.A TI processor features in the new Kindle Fire HD tablet, but its only input in the iPhone 5 is a touchscreen controller chip, according to the IHS iSuppli research firm.That showed Qualcomm provided the baseband wireless processor for the handset and Samsung manufactured Apple’s A6 microprocessor.
405;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Foxconn survives on thin slices of Apple;;Being a supplier to Apple is both a blessing and a curse. Assembling the world’s most high-profile gadgets has been the making of Hon Hai, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer also known as Foxconn. Apple is its largest customer, and the iPhone could make up a third of Foxconn’s profits for the second half of the year by some estimates.The company is the sole assembler for the iPhone 5 this year, with 80-85 per cent of shipments next year as well, according to analysts at Barclays. At an estimated $8 a phone, that workload brings in revenue, but has also put the company under strain. To handle Apple’s demands, Citi analysts estimate, Hon Hai must increase headcount at its Zhengzhou iPhone factory from 150,000 workers in June to 250,000 in October.Labour shortages have been a widespread complaint among Chinese factories recently, and factory owners, including Hon Hai, have raised wages to entice workers back to the shop floor. This is a delicate balancing act for Hon Hai, which survives on gleaning razor-thin profit margins from the vast scale of its operations.Even as its revenues have soared since the first iPhone was launched in 2007, Hon Hai’s operating profit margin has more than halved from 5.4 then, to 2.4 per cent in 2011.Making the iPhone has also put Hon Hai in the spotlight in a way it might not otherwise have experienced, with widespread reporting of a series of suicides among its factory workers in 2009 and 2010, and audits by the US-based Fair Labour Association. Although earlier this year Hon Hai showed progress in resolving a number of labour problems, recent reports suggest that as pressure has mounted ahead of the iPhone 5 launch, complaints about excessive overtime and exploitation of student interns as line workers are increasing again.Rioting at one of Hon Hai’s factories on Monday indicates this could be coming to a head. They also raise the possibility that Hon Hai, and Apple, would not be able to meet the vast demand for the iPhone 5.Yet for many of the other companies that supply components for the iPhone, being in Apple’s supply chain is still highly desirable.“Being in the iPhone is so important for chip companies. Apple suppliers make much higher margins than the rest of the industry, and because Apple only has one leading model of phone, the suppliers are in all of the 200m or so devices that Apple will sell. In contrast Samsung will have many more models and suppliers will be in some but not others of these,” said Dan Ridsdale, analyst at London-based Edison Investment Research.The components used to make the iPhone 5 are estimated to cost about $199 for the low-end, 16 gigabit model, according to IHS iSuppli, the research group. The bill of materials is higher than in previous models – although, with phones starting at a retail price of $650 each, that still leaves considerable profits for Apple.One of the most expensive components will be the display screen, estimated to cost about $44 a phone. It is pricier than the iPhone 4S screen partly due to the larger size of the screen and because, for the first time, the screen itself can sense touch – instead of a touch-sensitive layer placed on top of the screen.Earlier this summer there were fears that the panels would be in short supply, in part because one of the suppliers, Japan’s Sharp, was struggling with financial difficulties.Now analysts say they are more confident the manufacturers, which also include Japan Display and Korea’s LG Display, have increased their output sufficiently.Other iPhone beneficiaries include Qualcomm and Broadcom, which are key semiconductor suppliers to Apple. Analysts from Barclays believe that the iPhone 5 will have a communications chip from Qualcomm to allow the new 4G mobile phone connections and a WiFi chip from Broadcom. Both companies have seen their shares boosted over the past two months in the run-up to the launch.Investor expectation is also high for both Arm Holdings and Imagination Technologies, the UK chip designers whose blueprints are in the core A6 processor chip used in the iPhone 5. The relationship with Apple is partly why both companies’ shares trade at far higher multiples than the rest of their UK peers, about 32 times next year’s earnings estimates for Arm, for example, compared with mid-to-high teens for much of the rest of the sector.The fear of being designed out of a product haunts investors, however, given the dependency these companies have on a single client. Liberum Capital, the broker, estimates that 30 per cent of Imagination’s £128m annual revenues are attributable to Apple products.Wolfson Microelectronics and CSR, two UK chipmakers, saw large falls in their valuations after Apple several years ago decided it would no longer use their chips in later versions of the iPhone.Other losers include Taiwan’s TPK, which supplied the older screen technology to Apple. Although it was widely anticipated that Apple was moving to a touchscreen technology, TPK’s shares have still fallen 6 per cent since the iPhone 5 was unveiled on September 12.Apple is also thought to have phased out memory chips made by Samsung, which is locked in a number of bitter patents disputes with the US technology group. However, analysts say this might not be bad news for Samsung – the highly commoditised memory chips are a relatively low margin product for the company, and losing it could actually increase the South Korean group’s profitability. Samsung still makes the main A6 processor that powers the iPhone 5.
406;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-09-07T15:10:25Z;Apple win sends mixed signal for suppliers;;When a Californian jury handed down the landmark ruling that Samsung had infringed several Apple patents, the shockwaves from the courtroom were felt across the Atlantic.Apple’s victory against the South Korean electronics group was emphatic, with the court issuing a US sales ban on eight older-model Samsung smartphones, and awarding more than $1bn in damages.In the world of technology companies, such courtroom battles between electronics giants inevitably have ripple-down affects on the fortunes of UK chipmakers, such as Edinburgh-based Wolfson Microelectronics.The ramifications of the Californian court’s decision spooked some investors, who initially drove down shares in the Scottish chipmaker. Wolfson counts Samsung as one of its biggest customers, accounting for an estimated 30 per cent of its annual revenues.Although the ruling did not affect Samsung’s flagship S3 smartphone, which in some versions uses Wolfson’s audio hub technology, nervous investors in the lossmaking Scottish chipmaker feared that Apple’s attempts to have more Samsung devices banned could have negative implications in the future.The result was a 7.4 per cent fall in Wolfson’s share price on the first trading day following the US ruling. However, that initial reaction appears to have been overdone, with Wolfson recovering most of its losses since the August 25 decision.“Samsung comprised about 27 per cent of Wolfson’s sales in the first half of 2012 – so Wolfson would have the most to lose if Apple is successful in its new pursuit to have the S3 banned,” says Eoin Lambe at Liberum Capital.Apple’s initial legal challenge targeted the US sale of Samsung’s older generation smartphones – the S and S2 range – neither of which include Wolfson’s audio chips.Wolfson’s technology is found in some of the eight smartphones due to be banned in the US in December, however, and analysts have estimated the impact to the Scottish group’s full-year revenues could be several million dollars. By comparison, Wolfson’s 2011 turnover was $157m.“The version of the S3 sold in the US relies on a Qualcomm audio chip, while Wolfson’s technology is in the version shipped to the rest of the world, so in the unlikely event that Apple succeeds in blocking the S3, Wolfson would see limited impact,” says Mr Lambe.However, a potential problem for one UK chipmaker could provide a boost for another: Apple supplier Imagination Technologies.“For Imagination, the disputes are more relevant, since its technology is in Apple devices and many older Samsung devices, but not as yet in the Galaxy S3,” says James Goodman at Investec.Although Imagination has never confirmed it, the group is heavily reliant on Apple contracts, with an estimated 40 per cent of its technology division’s revenue stemming from the US device manufacturer.“Imagination Technologies is a key beneficiary from Apple’s potential market share gain, and those that have a potential negative are Wolfson and CSR, which both supply to Samsung,” says Alex Jarvis at Peel Hunt.Although likely to be affected by the ruling, CSR’s exposure to Samsung is relatively minor, with analysts estimating that less than 5 per cent of its revenues emanate from the South Korean group.“All of Apple’s products use Imagination’s graphic processing unit, so you could say that Imagination is in Apple’s camp, and Wolfson is in Samsung’s camp,” agrees Mr Lambe.The implications for intellectual property owners such as Arm Holdings and Imagination – whose business models involve receiving a royalty from each chip sold – appear to be positive.Should the withdrawal of Samsung’s lower-end smartphones from the market prompt consumers to trade up to a more expensive device – made by either Apple or Samsung – both Arm and Imagination would be beneficiaries, says Mr Goodman.“In Arm’s case, with a near-100 per cent market share of smartphone application processors, it would be almost unaffected by the ruling. Assuming customers purchase alternative phones, Arm will still benefit,” says Mr Goodman.Chipmakers are notoriously coy about discussing their customers, and Arm, CSR, Wolfson and Imagination Technologies all declined to comment.However, a bigger issue that could unfold following an acceleration of patent infringement rulings is increased industry consolidation, according to Peel Hunt’s Ms Jarvis.“The industry is already consolidating. Apple and Samsung are already taking control of more of the value chain – content, services, chip design, as well as device design,” says Ms Jarvis.“The intellectual property case may raise the financial risks for smaller players or leave them struggling to differentiate and therefore compete on anything but price, leading to more technology acquisitions by Apple and Samsung.”“If Imagination is selling primarily to Apple, then why wouldn’t Apple acquire Imagination if it deems that it has the best graphics out there?” she says.While Mr Lambe suggests that Wolfson is the more likely target. “If I were to look at which UK tech company that would be acquired, Wolfson is the one that would stand out,” he says.
407;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-09-05T22:34:48Z;Nokia and the long war to stay relevant;;There was big smartphone news in New York on Wednesday. Unfortunately for Nokia, which unveiled its latest make-or-break devices, there was just as much buzz around an invite sent by Apple for its iPhone launch next week.This highlights the fierce level of competition facing Nokia as it fights to remain relevant in a fast-moving smartphone race that has left the lossmaking Finnish group trailing badly.Nokia released details on Wednesday of the next generation of Windows phones, heralded as the first true products of a partnership deal with Microsoft that saw the Finnish group abandon its own struggling operating system last year.Dennis Woodside, Motorola Mobility’s chief executive, unveiled the first three handsets to emerge from the US phonemaker since it was acquired by Google this year.Nokia’s phones – the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 – will feature what the Finnish company claims is the best camera and mapping systems available, as well as technical innovations such as “tap and pay” technology and wireless charging.While no pricing or support details were released, the range is expected to be aggressively priced and heavily supported by advertising from both Nokia and Microsoft.“This is a very important milestone in our partnership with Nokia,” said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, who joined Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop on stage in New York to launch the new devices. The handsets, powered by a Qualcomm dual core processor, will go on sale this year in select markets, expected to include Europe and the US.However, the phones face intense competition not just from Apple but from launches by Asian rivals such as Samsung, HTC and Huawei as well as Google’s Motorola whose three new smartphones launched on Wednesday – the Droid Razr M, Droid Razr HD and Droid Razr Maxx HD – are all designed to work on the 4G LTE network operated by Verizon Wireless in the US.Mr Woodside, who took over at Motorola after the Google acquisition closed in last month, said the new handsets illustrate the company’s new strategy of focusing on innovative engineering and design and the ability for owners to upgrade them to the latest version of the Android operating system.In a separate interview after the event, Mr Woodside reiterated that Motorola will launch fewer new products, but emphasised that both the smartphones and tablets were central to Google’s mobility strategy. He declined to comment on the future of Motorola’s set-top box business that is believed to be up for sale.The new handsets received mixed reviews from analysts in New York who attended the two events. However Motorola’s handsets, particularly the Razr M and the Razr Maxx HD that feature extremely long battery life between charges, received generally positive comments.Analysts were more critical of Nokia’s Lumia models, which they said were not a big step forward from the last range. Canalys, the research group, said the lack of refreshed hardware design in the Lumia 920 would make it harder to communicate its innovative features, such as its location applications. Analysts at CSS Insight said it was “hard to see Lumia 920 beating [Samsung’s] Galaxy S III or expected iPhone 5”.“Success depends on keen prices, good channel support, clear differentiation and defections from iOS and Android, especially as new Lumias are unlikely to ship before the new iPhone,” they said.Some analysts fear Nokia has fallen too far behind to regain momentum, even with the backing of operators keen to see competition to the dominance of Apple and Samsung. This has caused the fortunes of the group to sour, with shares near a 15-year low given little expectation that the next quarter will see much improvement from widening operating losses and cash burn that has caused a junking of its debt rating.The Nokia phones are unlikely to be available until late October at the earliest, leaving time for rival products from Apple and others to soak up the record numbers of smart phone customers out of contract. But it does mean the phones will be available at the same time as Microsoft unveils its wider family of Windows 8 devices.Reflecting these concerns, shares in Nokia dropped more than 12 per cent after the phones were announced, ending the day at €1.99.Nevertheless, Mr Elop described the Lumia handsets as “another important step in the journey …We have come a long way in the 18 months since the partnership with Microsoft was announced,” he told the Financial Times. “My confidence is high that this takes us on the next step, but there will be many more. Each step has to take us forward, has to build.”Nokia executives have admitted that the company made “a number of mistakes” with the first Lumia range. “One was that we thought we were selling a phone to the consumer when actually we were selling an ecosystem. For sales people, given two alternatives, they would always push what they knew and could sell easily rather than something that took five times as long to explain.”Nokia is counting on Microsoft to help boost sales, in particular in the US, but the message from the Finnish company is this will be a long war rather than a battle. Management will hope markets give it the time it needs to win customers back.Joining Mr Elop on stage in New York, Microsoft’s Mr Ballmer said: “This is the year for Windows – phones, tablets, PCs. We’ve reimagined Windows from the ground up.”He said there would be close to 400m Windows devices available in a year across mobile phones, PCs and tablets. While Nokia has not confirmed that it also plans to launch tablet devices using Windows 8, Mr Elop hinted on Wednesday that this would be the case.
408;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-08-23T21:04:59Z;Tech stocks – weather alert;The summer rally made sense given the fundamentals;"It’s been a sunny summer rally – the S&P 500 has returned 11 per cent since June 1 – and technology companies have been at the front. The tech stocks in the S&P are a percentage point ahead of the index as a whole. And the outperformance remains even if you exclude Apple. Only the energy sector has done better.Tech’s outperformance is persistent: it has beaten the index solidly over the past five years. Given the dreary world economy, however, it is wise to keep an eye on the fundamentals. The 10 biggest tech companies by market cap after Apple – a group that includes US giants such as Cisco and EMC and international ones such as Samsung and SAP – continue to report solid numbers. All of them reported higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in their latest quarter against the previous year. Some are seeing decelerating revenue growth (IBM, Microsoft, Oracle) but the pattern is not pervasive. Valuations are sane: forward price to earnings multiples remain near or below the market average, with a few slightly pricier exceptions (Google, Qualcomm).The arguments for owning big tech companies remain. They sell globally; their biggest buyers are corporations, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers; and growth trends from cloud computing to mobile are going strong.Cautious comments by the most cyclical of the tech companies – the chipmakers – are worrisome, though. In its second-quarter report, Intel tempered its sales outlook and waved towards macroeconomic weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor’s management stated that the economic outlook is “deteriorating” and expects revenue to dip in the fourth quarter. The summer rally made sense given the fundamentals.

409;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-08-03T00:30:56Z;AT&T in three deals for spectrum;;AT&T is to acquire spectrum from three companies including NextWave Wireless, which it will acquire for $600m in cash.According to Federal Communications Commission filings, AT&T has applied for approval to acquire additional spectrum from Comcast, the US cable TV operator, and from Horizon Wi-Com, a small Miami-based mobile broadband company. AT&T declined to comment on the report.Like other mobile operators in the US, AT&T needs additional spectrum to accommodate the rapidly growing data requirements of its smartphone and tablet-owning customers. To meet these demands, AT&T, which operates the second-largest mobile network in the US by subscriber numbers, is building a new 4G network based on LTE technology.The acquisition price of NextWave, a wireless spectrum holding company, includes $25m for its shares and an additional $25m if certain conditions are met. The deal sent the shares, which trade over the counter, soaring from 25 cents at Wednesday’s close to $1.29.NextWave, which was spun out from Qualcomm in 1995 and at one stage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, holds licences in the Wireless Communication Services and Advanced Wireless Service bands.WCS spectrum was first auctioned in 1997, but has not been used for mobile data because of government restrictions designed to avoid possible interference with satellite radio transmissions in adjacent spectrum bands.In June, AT&T and Sirius XM, the US satellite radio operator, filed a joint proposal with the FCC that the two companies argue would enable the spectrum to be used for mobile internet services while protecting the adjacent satellite radio spectrum from interference. The FCC is reviewing that proposal.On Thursday AT&T said the proposed WCS rule changes and NextWave acquisition “represent an alternative approach to creating additional wireless network capacity to help support skyrocketing wireless data usage on smartphones and tablets”.If approved, the company said it would begin initial deployment of WCS spectrum for added 4G LTE capacity in approximately three years.Earlier this year, after its $39bn takeover bid for T-Mobile USA was blocked by regulators, AT&T acquired additional spectrum from Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile operator by subscribers, has also been trying to bolster its spectrum holdings and is seeking regulatory approval for the purchase of spectrum licences from a group of cable TV companies including Comcast.That deal has been held up because of concerns expressed by some rivals and members of Congress about an associated cross-marketing agreement between Verizon and the cable companies. Regulators are expected to rule on the deal this month.
410;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-07-25T11:22:06Z;Arm bucks trend among chipmakers;;A jump in shipments of higher margin chips for smartphones has buoyed Arm Holdings, driving the UK microchip design company’s first-half revenues beyond analyst expectations.Shares in Arm, which makes chips used in popular gadgets such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad, rose 7 per cent to 518.5p after the FTSE 100 chipmaker reported a 14 per cent year-on-year increase in interim sales, bolstered by solid demand for smartphones and tablets.Cambridge-based Arm on Wednesday said it had shipped 2bn chips in the second quarter to June 30, up 9 per cent year-on-year, and a big jump from 1.1bn in the previous quarter.Warren East, Arm chief executive, said that although first-half revenues had beaten analysts’ forecasts, the group held its full-year sales guidance on the expectation that fourth-quarter royalty payments could dip.“By implication we are anticipating the seasonal uptick that we usually experience in the fourth quarter to be a bit muted,” he said.The figures were in contrast to those from Apple on Tuesday, which missed Wall Street forecasts for its third-quarter revenues and earnings, blaming the shortfall on technology fans holding out in anticipation of the next version of the iPhone.Arm’s numbers also flew in the face of recent sluggish sentiment from chipmakers, following cautious outlooks from Intel and Qualcomm.The gloomy sentiments from some chipmakers “paint a picture that the technology industry is not immune to the wider economic environment”, said Mr East.However, Arm’s recent jump in demand appeared to placate some analysts, who had turned bearish on the silicon chip industry last year after orders slowed due to an inventory backlog.“Arm has had a strong second quarter, beating expectations for both processor division licences and royalties, but macroeconomic caution could limit full year upgrades,” said Paul Morland at Peel Hunt.First half pre-tax profit was £106.2m, up from £64.2m in the same period a year ago, as revenues rose from £233.9m to £268m.Diluted earnings per share rose from 3.51p to 5.53p, and an interim dividend of 1.67p per share was proposed, up 20 per cent from 1.39p last time.FT CommentAgainst a tough backdrop for the world’s chipmakers, Arm has put up an impressive set of first half numbers, albeit by taking market share at the expense of its competitors. However, potential investors in Arm should heed Warren East’s prudent warning that royalties could become “a bit muted” as the year goes on. Trading on a forward p/e of 35 – on a par with Imagination Technologies – the shares are on the expensive side, but not excessively so for a tech stock. Arm could still enjoy some gains in spite of the possible slowdown later in the year.
411;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-07-19T21:47:17Z;Wall Street stocks extend gains;;Shares in Walgreens rose sharply after the biggest US drug store by sales renewed its prescriptions partnership with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager.The news boosted the stock of Walgreens 11.8 per cent to $34.62 as analysts believed that the multiyear deal, which was unsettled over the past seven months, would improve the drug retailer’s revenues in the future starting in September.Walgreens shares have lost 17.9 per cent over the past year.Lawrence Marsh, analyst at Barclays, said: “It is our view that this agreement is in the best interest of both parties, [although] Walgreens ultimately had to make up its mind around pricing to remain a part of the broader network.”Shares in Express Scripts, which accounts for $5.3bn of Walgreens’ revenues, added 1.9 per cent to $58.76.CVS Caremark, the direct rival of Walgreens, declined 6.2 per cent to $45.43.The S&P 500 consumer staples index, which includes Walgreens and CVS, traded in negative territory. The subgroup decreased 0.2 per cent on Thursday after gaining 3.8 per cent over the past three months.Other defensive sectors, such as healthcare and telecommunications, were the worst performers at a time when investors are relatively bullish after seeing better than expected second-quarter earnings from some technology companies.The telecoms index dropped 1.8 per cent as Verizon lost 2.9 per cent to $44.54, in spite of the carrier’s higher margins helping to boost its second-quarter profit.“While we remain encouraged by wireless customer additions and segment profitability, we see some offsets in the second half from new smartphone launches and weaker wireline operations,” said Todd Rosenbluth, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, who downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from ‘hold’.Verizon’s direct rival AT&T also fell 2 per cent to $35.48.US equities rose for three consecutive sessions in spite of weak economic data including higher weekly US jobless claims and a decline in existing home sales.The S&P 500 added 0.3 per cent to 1,376.51 points, its highest level since early May. The benchmark index has gained 9.5 per cent in the year to date.Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said: “We do continue to carry a projection of 1,400 to 1,450 for the S&P 500 for year-end 2012. [But] summer trading volumes, as usual, have been low. Many international investors will [be on] vacation [for] the entire month of August.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,943.36 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index increased 0.8 per cent to 2,965.90.The S&P 500 information technology index led gains, rising 1.4 per cent. A string of tech companies such as Qualcomm, IBM and Ebay had reported that their earnings were stronger than estimated after the market closed on Wednesday.Shares in Google rose 3.7 per cent to $596.56 in after-hours trading as the company reported second-quarter earnings of $2.79bn, compared with $2.51bn in the same quarter of last year.Microsoft stock went up 1.7 per cent to $30.67 in after-hours trading. The company’s fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $492m, or 6 cents a share, was less than analysts estimated.Other tech stocks ticked up. Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq, gained 1.3 per cent to $614.32. But Facebook lost 0.4 per cent to $29.Ebay’s shares rallied 8.6 per cent to $43.95 after the company’s second-quarter earnings, announced after the market closed on Wednesday, beat analysts’ estimates.But Victor Anthony, analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, maintained the “hold” rating for Ebay as “one solid quarter does not make a trend and we are hesitant to call a successful turnaround at the core e-commerce business”.The financials index of the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent. Morgan Stanley sank 5.3 per cent to $13.25 – its largest one-day drop since last month – as the bank’s second-quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates due to the decline of trading activity.Kenneth Leon, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said: “Despite uncertainty and volatility in the global capital markets, we believe Morgan Stanley is well positioned to grow its private wealth, trading and investment banking units when markets recover. We see opportunities to gain market share going into 2013.”Other bank stocks were mixed. Bank of America dropped 3.6 per cent to $7.26 and Goldman Sachs edged down 1.6 per cent to $95. JPMorgan Chase lost 1.4 per cent to $34.46.American Express declined 3.5 per cent to $56.23, although the world’s largest credit card issuer by purchases posted quarterly results that beat analyst estimates on Wednesday.
412;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-07-19T18:34:13Z;Chipmakers – on the edge;Production cycles are getting shorter and more expensive;Everyone wants to be part of the next generation. It is always so much cooler. That is, unless they have to pay for it to happen. Chipmakers live permanently on the edge of the next product cycle and it is getting more expensive to do so. Thus, cautious sales outlooks from Intel and TSMC this week raise the question of how much more of Moore, and his pesky law, should investors put up with?Capital spending at TSMC, Intel and Samsung, for example, is at or near record levels. Between them, the three will spend about $28bn this year. Relative to sales, the spending will come in at about 50 per cent – well above long-term averages. Add in a couple of smaller rivals, and the top five will spend four times as much this year as they did in 2009, according to Bernstein. No wonder TSMC and Samsung are discussing joining Intel’s $4.1bn investment in ASML, a key supplier of chipmaking equipment.Sure, chipmakers are used to pressure. Gordon Moore’s blithe 1960s prediction about computing power doubling about every 18 months is famous because it still holds. That is all very well at the consumer end of things but cycles for those producing the chips that keep the law working are getting shorter as well as more expensive.A chunk of the funds earmarked this year will go into ramping up capacity to produce chips of just 28 billionths of a metre, where current shortages ( just ask Qualcomm) should keep demand and prices high for now. But another slug of the cash will go into the next next generation, which Intel is already pioneering. The danger has to be that after an earnings boost from 28 nanometre chips, investors are left with a hefty depreciation hit to earnings. Take TSMC, where charges will rise a quarter this year and a fifth in 2013, estimates Bernstein – the biggest jump in a decade.Pricing on current products and the explosion in 28nm capacity should mask the charges for now, but if this week’s cautious outlooks are borne out, next year’s bottom line is looking far weaker.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
413;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm anticipates holiday gifts;;Mobile phonemakers are planning to launch new versions of their high-end handsets during the December holiday season, setting the stage for strong revenue gains later this year, according to their main chip supplier Qualcomm.Qualcomm’s predictions for its quarter ending in December helped send its shares up 5.6 per cent to $59.17 in after-hours trading, on top of closing 3 per cent higher earlier on Wednesday.However, the biggest wireless chipmaker by revenues slightly lowered its forecast for 3G and 4G device shipments in 2012 – by 10m units to 905m – on predictions of slower economic growth.The San Diego-based company announced quarterly results just below Wall Street expectations, with net income of $1.49bn, or 85 cents a share, on revenues of $4.63bn. The analyst consensus called for profits of 86 cents a share on sales of $4.67bn.Qualcomm had lowered expectations the previous quarter, citing problems with the manufacturing by its foundry supplier of the latest chips with circuit widths of 28 billionths of a metre.Qualcomm’s limited supplies meant it could not meet demand and Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call on Wednesday that supply constraints continued to limit revenues for the fiscal year ending in September.The company said it now had four sources for the chips but supply and demand would not be in balance until “we exit the calendar year”.Qualcomm lowered its guidance for its fiscal year, predicting revenues would increase 25-28 per cent on 2011 to about $18.9bn, down from the previous midpoint guidance of $19.2bn. Profit expectations were lowered to a midpoint of $3.64 a share, from about $3.68.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm chief operating officer, said the September quarter “had been impacted by a number of factors, including a reduction in the 3G/4G inventory channel, which we believe reflects a pause and a reprofiling of demand prior to the launch of some key flagship devices for the holiday season.”His remarks suggested an iPhone 5 expected from Apple later this year would face competition from new Android and Windows-based smartphones.Intel had reported on Tuesday that PC makers were holding back from buying its chips as they await the release of the new Windows 8 PC operating system. Microsoft said it would go on sale on October 26.Qualcomm said momentum was building around a version of Windows 8 for PCs and tablets that supported processors like its own that were based on designs by the UK’s Arm.The company said it continued to co-operate with Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into alleged bribery of foreign officials, but said it believed sums of less than $250,000 in total may have been involved.
414;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-06-25T11:21:27Z;MediaTek / MStar: double trouble;New number four chipmaker could just pose a threat;Watch out Qualcomm, Broadcom and AMD. MediaTek’s bid for MStar vaults the Taiwanese chipmakers into fourth place by fabless (that is, designing and selling the chips, but not actually making them) sales. If they can redeploy their research and development overlap and use MediaTek’s market-creating savvy, they could just pose a threat.MediaTek’s reputation rests on its innovative packaging of full chip “solutions” to Chinese makers of cheap phones. After the early iPhone knock-offs, this spawned the legitimate low-cost smartphone industry that has overtaken the high-end market by sales globally. MStar competes (poorly) in phone chips but its strength lies in the television market.The financial rationale for the merger is simple: keeping up with the Americans is expensive. In its China-leading profits heyday in 2007, MediaTek generated $9 in sales for every $1 spent on R&D. Now it gets $4, in line with the biggies. Operating margins have tumbled from two-fifths to about 14 per cent – still double that of AMD, but only half of Qualcomm. MStar, meanwhile, is still getting an impressive $6 for every R&D dollar. The challenge for the new company will be retaining and refocusing more than 1,000 handset-focused engineers (Nomura estimates) on next-generation projects.New MediaTek (2011 sales of $4.2bn, compared with $6.6bn for AMD, number three) might not yet have the Americans quaking. After all, its squeezed margins are testament to the power of the biggest: its strong position with Shenzhen’s small phonemakers is being superseded by Qualcomm’s links with the emerging giants and its cut-throat pricing.Still, MediaTek chairman Tsai Ming-kai is known as a far-sighted thinker. The question is whether he can use his added resources to repeat his China mould-breaking move – and profit before the Americans put the squeeze on once more. After all, MediaTek knows to its cost that it is only as good as its last revolutionary product.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
415;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-06-22T15:17:51Z;MediaTek eyes merger with rival;;MediaTek, the world’s second biggest mobile chipset maker by revenues, is targeting a merger with rival Mstar in a deal that values the latter at almost $4bn, as both Taiwanese groups look to boost their competitiveness in chips that drive smartphones and challenge industry leader Qualcomm.MediaTek is widely recognised as the company behind the rise of China’s domestic mobile phone manufacturing industry, as for the past decade its low-cost chips have enabled a horde of manufacturers to enter the industry even though they had little technical expertise of their own.Many of those so-called ‘grey market’ phonemakers churned out knock-off copies of the iPhone but many others have since developed into sizeable domestic brands selling internationally.In recent years however MediaTek has struggled to replicate that success in smartphones, which require more complicated and powerful chips. Meanwhile Mstar and Spreadtrum Communications, a Chinese chip company, have been stealing market share away from MediaTek by undercutting on price.The deal comes as smartphones are increasingly becoming a mass market product, leading to the growing importance of the low-cost segment. More than 300m low-end smartphones are expected to be sold this year, according to Deloitte, which would be about one-third of the total market.Analysts expect low-cost smartphones will this year replace high-end – and higher-margin – handsets as the main growth engine for the industry. Both Qualcomm and Intel have been launching lower-end chips to compete in that area.Tsai Ming-kai, chairman of MediaTek, said in a statement that the companies together would be able to focus on developing new products and next generation technologies. “Facing intense worldwide competition and fast-changing market dynamics, we believe that the combined company will be in a strong position to compete and will further elevate MediaTek’s global competitiveness.”Hsieh Ching-jiang, MediaTek’s president, earlier told the Financial Times that his focus now is no longer on lowering costs but on “improvements that make an impact on the user’s experience”. A merger with Mstar will give more breathing room for MediaTek to achieve that goal by relieving immediate price competition pressures.MediaTek is offering 0.794 of its own shares and T$1 in cash for each share in Mstar, which is equivalent to T$218.56 per share at Friday’s closing price. This represents a near 20 per cent premium to Mstar’s closing share price on Friday of T$182.50 and values the group at $3.8bn, including debt. MediaTek aims to buy between 40 and 48 per cent of Mstar in the tender offer and then merge with its rival after both boards, shareholders and relevant authorities approve the deal.
416;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-06-08T09:28:09Z;Indonesia: mobile traffic jams ahead?;;"Young Indonesians’ enthusiasm for smartphones and social networking has helped boost economic development and has been good news for the likes of RIM, which sells millions of its Blackberry phones in the country each year, and Facebook.But, unless the government frees up more spectrum to meet surging demand for mobile data services, the mobile phone network could end up resembling the Jakarta traffic system – clogged up, unable to function properly and stymieing economic growth.That was the main message from Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile phone chipmaker by revenue, on a trip to Jakarta this week.“A country that doesn’t have sufficient spectrum is like a country with a sub-standard surface transportation network,” William Bold, senior vice president for government affairs, told beyondbrics after talks with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian president, on Thursday.The rise of the smartphone is driving exponential growth in mobile data traffic. By 2014, there is likely to be 14 times more global mobile data traffic in a single month then there was in the entire year of 2008, according to Qualcomm.With more mobile phone connections then there are people in Indonesia, a nation of 240m, and a growing number of them using mobile internet services, the network infrastructure is struggling to keep up.Dropped mobile phone calls are already an everyday inconvenience for everyone from motorbike taxi drivers to tycoons.Qualcomm, along with a number of local telecoms operators, is urging the government to get ahead of the problem by accelerating the licensing of new 3G spectrum and re-allocating existing spectrum from traditional users like TV broadcasters, the military and other government departments.Freeing up more spectrum for mobile internet data will support economic development, particularly in rural areas where there is no fixed-line access.But, accepts Bold, this requires “difficult choices”.Countries that have worked hard to ensure sufficient spectrum for mobile data services have reaped the economic rewards, he says, with email attachments easier to download to a mobile phone in parts of Kenya and Ghana than in downtown Paris or New York during rush hour.With its vast population spread out over thousands of islands, Indonesia certainly has much to gain from ensuring better access to mobile internet services, especially in remote areas.The worry is that, with the government under fire from investors over recently introduced curbs on the banking and mining sectors and restrictions on imports and exports, it is not getting the difficult economic choices right at the moment.Related reading:

417;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-05-24T16:52:25Z;Bharti heats up India’s 4G race with deal;;Bharti Airtel of India acquired a 49 per cent stake in US-chipmaker Qualcomm’s Indian broadband wireless business for $165m, as the country’s largest telecoms company by subscribers seeks to expand its fourth-generation high-speed network.The move by Bharti’s billionaire chief Sunil Mittal pits him directly against India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, whose Reliance Industries is the only company to have acquired nationwide high-speed 4G spectrum – though it has yet to begin commercial operations.“Think of them as being at the beginning of a medieval joust,” says one industry analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They are still quite far away from each other, but they are staring at each other, and it is pretty clear where they are headed.”Bharti will acquire the 26 per cent stake held by its Indian partners, Tulip Telecom and Global Holding Corp – sold for about $58m to comply with local partnership rules – with the remainder in the form of fresh equity. Bharti’s stock rose 5.6 per cent, outpacing a 1.7 per cent rise on India’s benchmark Sensex. The deal is slated for completion in 2014.Qualcomm acquired 4G spectrum in four of India’s 22 telecom zones for $1bn in the 2010 auction, but nearly lost those licenses– and its investment – over a dispute with the telecoms ministry. That issue was resolved last month when, nearly two years after the auction, the company was finally awarded its spectrum.Bharti recently launched commercial operations in two of its four zones, Calcutta and Karnataka, in the country’s south-west, but the Qualcomm deal allows them access to the nation’s two biggest markets, Delhi and Mumbai – crucial to any successful 4G business, says Deven Choksey, managing director of KR Choksey.Mumbai and Delhi “are going to be driving more than 50 per cent of the business in the initial year”, said Mr Choksey. “So obviously those who don’t have 4G in Delhi and Mumbai are losers on that front.”The news comes as a rare bright spot after months of sour telecoms news in India, beginning with the multibillion-dollar scandal over the allocation of second-generation licences in 2008. That scandal came to light early last year, and led to the cancellation of 122 2G spectrum licenses of 11 operators, though not Bharti.Last month, the country’s top telecoms regulator proposed base rates for a new 2G auction to be set at more than 10-fold those charged for licences allocated by the country’s former telecoms minister, Andimuthu Raja, in 2008. Mr Raja, who was detained over corruption charges, was recently granted bail.Additional reporting by James Crabtree
418;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-04-22T16:55:04Z;Intel-powered smartphone goes on sale;;The first smartphone powered by Intel-designed microprocessors is going on sale, just as the world’s biggest chipmaker launches a third generation of Core microprocessors that it intends will defend its PC territory from mobile competitors.The Xolo X900 from the little-known Lava handset maker is available in India from today for around Rs22,000 ($423). It represents Intel’s attempt at a breakthrough into a phone world dominated by chips based on designs of the UK’s Arm.At an event in San Francisco on Monday Intel is launching a new family of Core microprocessors, called Ivy Bridge, which shrink circuit widths from 32 to 22 billionths of a metre (nanometres), offering better performance.Ivy Bridge’s advances could help Intel fight off competition from Arm-based mobile-phone chipmakers who can see a route into the PC market through Microsoft releasing its Windows 8 software this year – the first Arm-compatible version of its operating system.Intel has launched its largest advertising campaign in a decade to promote its Ultrabook concept of thin-and-light laptop computers and aims to supply chips for tablets – another Arm-dominated category.Rob Enderle, technology analyst with the Enderle Group, says: “The ultrabooks and tablets are where Intel and Arm’s supporters are really going to be fighting for turf.“Whoever wins this middle ground is going to have a lot of momentum going into PCs or phones.”Intel has traditionally offered faster chips, but has not been able to match the battery-saving low power draw of Arm processors.As it shrinks its chips further, it will be in a better position to compete, according to Sumit Dhanda, semiconductor analyst at the ISI Group.“If you look at Intel’s roadmap over the next two years, they are really pushing the manufacturing technology transition faster than anyone else,” he says.“Sometime in late 2013, early 2014, they will be at 14-nanometre manufacturing for smartphones and have close to a one-generation lead.”Its Arm rivals generally rely on Asian foundries to make their chips and Qualcomm warned last week it was having trouble getting enough 28nm chips from its suppliers.While the Lava launch represents a small beginning for Intel, it has announced bigger names, including Motorola and Lenovo, also have Intel-based phones in the pipeline.The company produced its own Arm-based chips in the past under the XScale brand, with some featuring in BlackBerry phones. But it sold the business to the chipmaker Marvell in 2006.The new phone has a single-core 32nm Atom processor. A dual-core, 22nm successor is expected later this year.The Ivy Bridge launch should boost Intel in the current quarter, but analysts at Canaccord Genuity predicted last week that a PC recovery could stall in the third quarter as consumers delay purchases in the important back-to-school season – awaiting the arrival of Windows 8.
419;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-04-18T23:26:20Z;Qualcomm supply snags set to hit sales;;Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile phone chipmaker by revenue, warned on Wednesday it was losing sales of its latest high-end chips because of limited supplies, with some customers likely to turn to rivals.The shortages are also bad news for smartphone and tablet makers planning to offer Android and Windows 8 devices later this year to compete with Apple’s iPhone and iPad.Many are relying on Qualcomm’s affected S4 product range of multi-core processors to give them an edge.In a fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Qualcomm executives said they were trying to offer alternatives and spread supplies as best they could among customers, but they expected some would turn to non-Qualcomm chipsets.The company’s shares fell as much as 7 per cent to $62 on the news in after-hours trading before recovering to stand 3.5 per cent lower at $64.65. They are up 22 per cent this year.The San Diego-based company operates as a “fab-less” chipmaker – it relies on foundry chipmakers, such as Taiwan’s TSMC, for production of its designs.TSMC has not been able to produce enough of the latest chips at the more miniaturised circuit width of 28 billionths of a metre, according to reports, and Qualcomm has been seeking other suppliers.“There is a shortage of capacity and we cannot secure enough supply to meet the demand we are experiencing,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, said.He said the constraints were “limiting our potential revenue upside this fiscal year”, although he expected the situation to improve in the quarter to December.Barclays Capital analysts reported last week that supply-chain checks suggested Qualcomm was concerned about capacity while vendors, in particular Taiwan’s HTC, looked to launch devices ahead of an expected iPhone 5 this year.They said demand was very high for Qualcomm’s 8960 chipsets, which include 4G LTE broadband capabilities – a feature expected in the next Apple smartphone. Qualcomm said that while it dealt with the problem of approving new production lines, its operating expenses would increase. It predicted a 23 per cent rise this fiscal year, up from its 18 per cent forecast three months ago.Its forecast revenue range in the quarter to June had a midpoint of $4.65bn, below analyst expectations of $4.78bn, while earnings per share of about 86 cents were below analysts’ consensus of 89 cents.Qualcomm beat Wall Street expectations in reporting its latest quarterly figures.It reported record revenues and earnings per share of $4.94bn, up 28 per cent year-on-year, and $1.01 respectively.Analysts had expected $4.83bn revenues and profits worth 95 cents a share.
420;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-04-11T10:57:47Z;Bharti Airtel brings 4G to India;;Bharti Airtel got the jump on Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and other rivals by rolling out India’s first 4G telecoms network in Kolkata on Wednesday, as unconfirmed reports said it was close to buying other 4G licences in India from Qualcomm, the US chipmaker.Reliance Industries acquired 4G spectrum by buying Infotel in 2010 and later struck a content-sharing deal with Disney’s Indian business. Many had assumed RIL would be the first to launch its services.Analysts said Airtel would gain “first-mover” advantage but 4G maturity in India was four or five years away and other companies might have decided to see what they could learn from its experience.“When you’re launching something which is very new and not very significantly tested globally there are people who might also say let’s wait and watch, let’s see what these guys are doing – are there any mistakes we can improve on?” said Romal Shetty, head of telecoms at KPMG.Kapil Sibal, telecommunications minister, seemed to respond to concerns that the government should not focus solely on making money from the auction – which it was accused of doing with the sale of 3G licences, which netted the government around $15bn. Critics fear it will squander a great opportunity to bridge India’s massive digital divide.“I dare say that though 3G was launched, the benefits are not yet seen by the aam aadmi [common man]. Now we are launching the 4G,” he said at Airtel’s launch event, according to the DNA newspaper.“But a lot of work has to be done, because even for the 3G, the handsets are not yet affordable. What [Bharti Airtel head] Sunil [Mittal] has done is allowed a network to be established. But the rest of the industry must ensure that relevant devices which will connect with the network are low cost and affordable. It is only then that the true revolution will come about in India,” Sibal said.Airtel said it would start services in tech hub Bangalore in a month followed by Pune, near Mumbai, and Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, later this year. It purchased licenses for the four areas for nearly $650m at auction in 2010.Reports circulated on Wednesday that Airtel was in talks to purchase the troubled 4G license of US chipmaker Qualcomm for $1.2bn. However, Airtel refused to comment and a person familiar with the matter told beyondbrics the company was in talks with many operators but had not reached agreement with any.In February, Sibal said the government would hold a further auction of 4G spectrum this year. That will likely be pushed back to next year to coincide with the auction of 2G spectrum licenses revoked by the Supreme Court following India’s $39bn telecoms scandal.Sibal’s comments at the time suggested the 4G price would be high. If so, Airtel and Vodafone, India’s two biggest operators, may be the only two companies with enough money to bid.
421;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-03-15T16:51:20Z;China Mobile vice-president steps down;;One of the most senior executives at China Mobile has resigned after he became involved in a police inquiry over “financial-related issues”, the latest in the fallout from a bribery investigation under which a former deputy chairman was handed a suspended death penalty last year.Lu Xiangdong, a vice-president and executive director in charge of development strategy, planning, construction and procurement, stepped down because of his inability to perform his duties “under his current personal circumstances”, said the world’s largest mobile operator by subscribers in a statement on Thursday.Government and state-owned enterprises in China frequently refer to corruption as “financial-related issues”. The company had issued a statement on March 2 saying Mr Lu was assisting in an investigation by judicial authorities.Before Mr Lu’s resignation, at least 11 senior managers of China Mobile, which has close to 650m subscribers, had stepped down because of corruption charges following the 2009 arrest of Zhang Chunjiang, deputy chairman of the group. Mr Zhang was charged with accepting more than Rmb7.46m ($1.2m) in bribes and was given a suspended death sentence in July last year.Executives at Chinese state-owned enterprises are often implicated in corruption casesbecause they have large procurement budgets, the power to award huge contracts and many of their managers have close ties to the government, making them prime targets for bribery.Wang Jianzhou, chairman of China Mobile, admitted to the press that there had been numerous cases of senior officials violating law and regulations. “The company has paid a lot of attention to internal management and on improving procedures,” he said. He added that the company had tightened the management of its procurement processes.Mr Wang was replaced as Communist party chief of the company last year, a move that limited his power within the group. China Mobile said Mr Lu’s resignation would not affect operations. The company announced a 5.2 per cent increase in full-year net profit to Rmb125.9bn ($19.9bn) on sales of Rmb528bn, up 9 per cent from a year ago.China Mobile’s stock in Hong Kong has lagged local rivals China Unicom and China Telecom because its government-mandated use of China’s homegrown 3G standard has prevented a deal with Apple for the iPhone, buoying the performance of rivals using international 3G standards.China Unicom’s forward price-to-earnings multiple nearly doubled after it started selling iPhones, according to HSBC research. The group, due to report 2011 results next week, was last trading at a P/E ratio of 55 while China Mobile was trading at a multiple of 11, according to Bloomberg data.China Mobile’s share price was boosted by positive analyst reports recently and speculation that a Qualcomm chip would be launched, allowing the iPhone to be used on its 3G network. China Mobile is also expected to be the first to offer 4G services in China, although there is no firm timetable for when the first licences will be issued.Additional reporting by Zhou Ping in Hong Kong

With Apple alone now having 25bn of them, there must be. But the $500bn company is not content with its app hoard and is now seeking to dominate the increasingly crowded field of delivering media over the internet. Another tech company worth a mere $100bn, however, is a better bet for investors as Qualcomm returns more cash to shareholders and will grow at double-digit pace for the foreseeable future. Other companies dependent on more basic technology also featured this week. GM and Peugeot unveiled further details of their proposed partnership, the chief executive of EADS stepped down with the company at a high point and Air France-KLM continued to struggle at the start of its 3-year restructuring programme.Big pharma has little need for apps, but it could do with less competition from generic drugmakers, which are gearing up for what promises to be the biggest ever shift to generics. In consumer goods, both Adidas and Want Want – one Chinese answer to Kraft or Nestlé – are thriving with the latter having doubled its market capitalisation in two years to $13bn. In basic resources, Glencore offered no sweeteners in its latest results to the shareholders of miner Xstrata, Australian coal acquisitions appear to be getting costlier and the price of oil is causing worries as it creeps ever higher.Other companies may have been busy searching for apps to download heaps of cheap debt as dollar-denominated corporate bond rates hit record lows. And finally, some investors were eyeing the Japanese market, where bulls seem to be gaining momentum one year after the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami.

423;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Low-tech starts to drive smartphone growth;;"Nokia’s Lumia 610 smartphone, unveiled at last week’s Mobile World Congress, may seem rather mundane in terms of its technical specifications compared with the latest cutting-edge model from its rival HTC.But Nokia’s chief executive Stephen Elop is betting that it will be the mass-market 610 model that lures customers to the new Windows Mobile platform; not the company’s new high-end 910 model. Even though its processor has only a single core compared with four in HTC’s powerful One X model, Mr Elop is counting on the Lumia 610 to help revive the once-dominant Finnish telecoms company.Nokia’s focus on the 610 model underlines the rapid spread of low-cost smartphones, which analysts say will this year replace high-end – and higher-margin – handsets, as the main growth engine for the industry.“While Mobile World Congress has had its share of top devices, the greater story is a new generation of capable, compelling low-cost devices,” says Mark Newman, chief research officer of consultancy Informa.There will be 300m low-end smartphones sold this year, or one-third of all smartphone production, Deloitte predicts. Their high-end cousins typically have a faster processor that can handle more complicated or graphics-intensive applications, and usually also have a better camera and a more responsive touch-screen that displays sharper images.This shift to the low end is igniting fierce competition among chipmakers that design and sell the electronic brains that power smartphones. At MWC last week, Broadcom of the US and Taiwan’s Mediatek both showed off new chips for mass-market smartphones to challenge industry leader Qualcomm, whose chips power Nokia’s Lumia 610 phone.Intel recently launched a foray into the industry by focusing on providing processors, such as Atom, for low-priced smartphones. Orange of France said its “Santa Clara” Atom-powered smartphone will be “affordable” when it appears in Europe in the summer, and the Xolo X900 smartphone from India’s Lava will also use Atom for what is likely to be a low-priced smartphone.While the trend is global, it is most dramatic in China, which surpassed the US in the third quarter last year to become the world’s biggest smartphone market.The democratisation of the smartphone market has been the goal of many handset manufacturers, but the premium end of the market remains the most lucrative with constantly evolving features aiming to attract the army of tech-savvy early adopters in the developed markets, writes Daniel Thomas.At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week, sub-$100 smartphones were a major talking point in the industry.“Connecting the next billion” of the global population to the internet though smartphones is one of the strategic goals of Finland’s Nokia. Other handset makers at the trade fair were also aiming to drag the more basic “feature” phones still popular in emerging markets into this digital world.But it was the ranges of premium handsets that took the crowd’s attention, even with the obvious absence of any new iPhone, with updated gadgets and functions once again designed to snare high-spending customers away from Apple’s popular series.There were handsets from HTC, in particular, that clearly carried hopes of being the latest iPhone challenger, even if the current contender – Samsung’s Galaxy range – was without any major update at the event.Pierre Ferragu, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that the threat of handset commoditisation had been “around the corner” for 15 successive years.“[Last year] showed how strong brands with strong products get consumer traction, turning into high margins and market share gains. [This year] will be the same story and I come back from Barcelona with increased hopes [of] a comeback from HTC.”CK Cheng, analyst at equity broker CLSA, says the Chinese smartphone market will more than double to more than 150m units this year. Unlike in western markets, where high-end smartphones from Apple, HTC and Samsung dominate, in China those high-end models, which fetch around $600-$800, account for just one-fifth of total sales.The other four-fifths will be smartphones from domestic brands such as ZTE and Huawei that carry a retail price of under Rmb1,000 (US$150), and will be available for free for many consumers after operator subsidies.This gives an advantage to Mediatek, which is the biggest supplier of chips to Chinese phonemakers. The Taiwanese company was also the pioneer of selling a ‘total solution’ to manufacturers, which means that they only needed one chip package from Mediatek to power all the phone’s functions. It is a strategy that both Qualcomm and Broadcom have since also adopted, but that other chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and Marvell do not yet have the capability to do.Robert Rango, executive vice-president at Broadcom, said providing full chip packages is important because consumers “expect the full ‘smartphone experience’ even at that lower cost … if you can’t deliver all that, you can’t compete in this huge segment.”Hsieh Ching-jiang, Mediatek’s president, says competition in the low end, particularly in China, has gone beyond just a race to the bottom on price. It also reflects strong demand for better performance and additional features.“At the beginning it was all about bringing costs down so that smartphones can be made into a mass-market product, but now that has been achieved and the next step is to deliver improvements that make an impact on the user’s experience,” Mr Hsieh says.Mediatek’s latest MT6575 chip, for example, supports the use of multiple simcards, a popular feature in China but rarely seen in phones in western markets, as well as 3D displays and high-definition video. In terms of its processing power, the MT6575 is roughly equivalent to the processor found in the first iPad or in Samsung’s Galaxy S smartphone, both launched in spring 2010.Mr Hsieh said Mediatek, which sold 10m smartphone chips last year, expects to reach that amount in the current quarter alone on the back of its new chip and expects to sell 50m in 2012.For now, Qualcomm still has the lead in terms of technology and global market share, and Mr Hsieh admitted that it will be “very difficult” for Mediatek to catch up technologically in the short term. It still cannot make chips with dual-core processors, while Qualcomm last week announced its next chip will be quad-core.But the Taiwanese company still plays an important role because of the pricing pressure it puts on Qualcomm, with some analysts saying fierce competition has already forced Qualcomm to lower prices on some of its chips by around 20 per cent.And that pressure will only intensify as the focus on the mass market grows."

Qualcomm announced on Tuesday that it would raise its quarterly dividend 16 per cent and that it was initiating a new, $4bn buyback programme. The market rewarded the US mobile technology company with a condescending pat on the head: the stock fell a bit, staying just a per cent or so ahead of the indices.In the past year, its shares have moved in parallel with the Nasdaq. And its valuation (Qualcomm is now a $100bn company), at 16 times this year’s earnings, may not scream cheap when Apple is trading at 12 times. But Qualcomm is expected to deliver 30 per cent revenue growth this year and keep growth in the double digits for the foreseeable future. And unlike Apple, it returns cash to shareholders: over the past five years, almost two-thirds of free cash flow ($12bn worth) has gone to dividends and buybacks.Payouts do not alter the value of a company one bit. But many investors do like a regular cheque. Suppose Qualcomm’s dividend was doubled, to $2 a share annually. That would push the dividend yield to 3.2 per cent by sending about $3.5bn out the door each year, giving the company a payout ratio above 50 per cent. That would give Qualcomm, at the very centre of the mobile computing boom, a combination of growth and yield that is very rare among big capitalisation stocks.Qualcomm is well equipped to make such a commitment. Its intellectual property licensing business will continue to grow as more global telecom carriers adopt the fourth-generation LTE wireless standard. And its chip business is a vendor to both of the fastest-growing handset makers, Apple and Samsung. Qualcomm has $22bn of net cash on its balance sheet, $6bn of which is in the US, and no debt. It could borrow cheaply for acquisitions, if needed – and use the rest to buy respect.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
425;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
426;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;The great big Mobile World Congress Note;;If you think the 5.3in-screen Samsung Galaxy Note is a little too large to fit in a pocket, then you will have a real problem with the 10.1in version just unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Samsung has yet to make an official announcement about the phone, but a gargantuan poster to match the giant-sized device has appeared, and at this size, there seems no argument about whether it is a smartphone or a tablet this time.I have been trying the US version of the original Note, which went on sale with AT&T a week ago. There are a few differences from the European one I saw unveiled at IFA in Berlin in September and reviewed in December.The US Note is the first to have 4G LTE connectivity and, because a Qualcomm chipset is involved, Samsung has opted for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, rather than its own-brand 1.4GHz processor.The AT&T Note also has four touchscreen buttons along the bottom – home,menu, back and search – whereas the European version has three – a central physical home button and touchscreen menu and back buttons.The Note in the US comes with 16Gb of memory and a slot for up to 32Gb more to be added. It has the same 2,500mAh battery, which faces the extra drain of 4G LTE connectivity and I struggled to get through the day without having to charge it.Preloaded apps include AT&T Live TV and the carrier is promising an update from Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) in due course.Accessories include a desk dock, charging station and a series of cases. I liked a $29 one that replaced the back cover with one with a hinge and cover for the screen – minimising the extra space needed and giving the Note more a feel of an actual notebook that could be opened.The AT&T Note is available in Carbon Blue or Ceramic White for $299 with a two-year contract.Meanwhile, expect more than a smattering of smartphones to be unveiled at MWC over the next few days.Samsung has already announced the Beam, an Android phone with a built-in projector that can cast a 50in HD image. Sony has unveiled the Xperia P and U Android phones, the former having an NFC chip and the latter featuring “3D surround sound”.HTC is partnering with Nvidia for the first time – using its Tegra 3 quad-core processor in its One X smartphone (it also unveiled a slimmer dual-core One S and a cheaper One V).LG ’s Optimus 4X HD also features the quad-core Tegra, while Huawei has unveiled the Ascend D, featuring its own quad-core processor.
427;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-02-02T21:06:21Z;New tech stocks surge on Facebook’s IPO fizz;;Facebook’s $5bn IPO filing was a fillip for recently debuted internet businesses.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,859.68, handily outperforming other big US indices as stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon surged.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed as much as 20 per cent to hit an all-time high of $12.91 before closing at $12.39, a gain of 16.8 per cent.That came after Facebook’s filing revealed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. Zynga shares ended the day comfortably above their $10 IPO price, for the first time since the company’s own stock market debut in December.But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 8.2 per cent to $76.87, Groupon climbed 7.4 per cent to $23.08 and Renren was up 8.2 per cent to $5.42. SINA, a Chinese social-media company, which owns a Twitter-like service, climbed as much as 5 per cent before closing up 1.9 per cent to $75.30.“This rally is really all about sentiment,” said Herman Leung, a tech analyst at Susquehanna. “We’re seeing big share price moves for anything with a whiff of social about it on no real news, while old school internet companies underperform.”Yahoo slipped 0.1 per cent to $15.72 and Google climbed 0.7 per cent to $585.11.Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat with the S&P 500 inching up 0.1 per cent to 1,325.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,705.41, as Pfizer fell 0.9 per cent to $21.11 after the drug maker recalled 1m packets of birth control pills amid fears that faulty packaging could potentially lead to unwanted pregnancies.Merck shares also fell 0.5 per cent to $38.44 although Pfizer’s rival swung to a fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst expectations. The second-largest US drug maker by revenues predicted a relatively flat 2012, with profits expected to be hit by cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair.Retail stocks were volatile as clothing stores updated investors on fourth-quarter expectations.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 13.7 per cent to a 52-week low of $40.40, as the clothing store warned fourth-quarter profit will come in well below expectations.The company said sales growth of 16 per cent in the quarter ended January 28 was driven almost exclusively by new store openings, as same-store sales came in flat.Rival clothing company Gap jumped 10.6 per cent to $21.52, despite forecasting a fall in same-store sales across its brands of 4 per cent and a 2 per cent fall in overall sales. Analysts had been braced for much worse, but sales at Banana Republic stores surprised on the upside.However, Robert Drbul at Barclays Capital noted that apparel, footwear and textiles stores underperformed the S&P 500 in January, while, “exposure to Europe remains a concern given the soft macroeconomic environment”.Earnings were responsible for other big movers, with JDS Uniphase falling 7.2 per cent to $12.19 even though quarterly earnings came in better than expected as the fibre optics manufacturer recovered strongly from supply-chain disruption in Thailand.Nikos Theodosopoulos at UBS downgraded JDS to “neutral” from a “buy” recommendation, telling clients that, “while orders looked good we struggle to place a higher than 15 [times earnings] multiple on JDSU’s cyclical business.”Qualcomm shares climbed 2 per cent to $60.73 as strong sales of smartphones drove demand for its wireless networking products, helping deliver better than expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong guidance for 2012.“A healthy market, ongoing share gains and conservative guidance should yield further upside in the shares,” said Jeff Kvaal at Barclays Capital.CME Group rose 8.4 per cent to $257.13. The largest US exchange group by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter profit rose, with a tailwind from an Illinois tax benefit. Meanwhile NYSE Euronext rallied 1.9 per cent to $26.94 after retreating on Wednesday, as the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.Electronic Arts gained 6.1 per cent to $19.57 after the second-largest US video-game publisher reported a 70 per cent increase in third-quarter profit.MasterCard shares, which climbed 66 per cent in 2011, were on the move again, gaining 6.7 per cent to $381.57. The credit-card company delivered strong earnings, once a $495m after-tax charge against litigation was stripped out of fourth-quarter numbers.
428;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US launches probe into Qualcomm;;The US Justice department has launched an anti-corruption investigation into the activities of Qualcomm, the world’s biggest chipmaker for mobile phones.The company said on Wednesday it learned last week that the US attorney’s office in San Diego, California – the city where Qualcomm is based – had begun a preliminary inquiry regarding its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).The 1977 act made it unlawful to bribe foreign government officials to assist in obtaining business.“We believe we are in compliance with the requirements of the FCPA,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive, on an earnings call with analysts. “We will continue to cooperate with this investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.”In a regulatory filing reporting its fiscal first quarter earnings, Qualcomm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was also investigating the matter. In addition, it noted the SEC had begun a formal investigation of the company in 2010 over a “whistleblower’s allegations”.Qualcomm’s audit committee carried out its own inquiry into the allegations and related accounting practices and did not identify any errors in its financial statements, it said.Thanks to growth in demand for smartphones using its chips, Qualcomm on Wednesday reported $4.68bn in quarterly sales, up 40 per cent on a year earlier and ahead of analyst expectations of $4.58bn. It raised its revenue guidance for its fiscal year from $18bn-$19bn to $18.7bn-$19.7bn.The company’s shares rose 5 per cent in extended trading in New York to $62.54, a level not reached since 2000.
429;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-27T21:39:58Z;Wall Street retreats from bull market;;"Fourth-quarter earnings season gathered momentum this week but macroeconomic news moved the market; the S&P 500 closed in bull market territory on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve forecast prolonged low interest rates, but the index retreated on Friday as US growth figures came in beneath expectations.The S&P 500 ended the week up just 0.1 per cent to 1,316.32. It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.
431;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-24T18:01:43Z;Chipmakers’ results raise fears about Nokia;;Warnings about poor sales from two of Nokia’s key chipmaker suppliers have raised fears that the Finnish handset manufacturer has seen a slump in demand for its older mobile phones.Nokia shares dropped by 6.9 per cent to €4.10 on Tuesday on concerns that sales of its Symbian smartphones may have fallen by more than expected, in a worrying signal ahead of its full-year results on Thursday 26 January.ST Ericsson, which supplies wireless chips to Nokia’s handsets using its Symbian and Meego operating systems, reported widened losses of $841m for 2011 and warned of a “significant sequential decline” in sales the first quarter because of poor sales at Nokia, which accounts for around 30 per cent of the company’s business. Symbian accounts for the majority of Nokia’s smartphone sales.“The revenues from Nokia have collapsed and this is why revenues at ST Ericsson are not what we expected,” said Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of ST Microelectronics, which owns half of ST Ericsson.Didier Lamouche, chief executive of ST Ericsson, said: “It is clear that both sales and operating results will continue to be challenging over the coming quarters, due to the reduction in the short term of new product sales with one of our largest customers.”On Monday night, Texas Instruments, which supplies what are called baseband chips for older Nokia phones, also warned that revenue in that business would fall to $75m in the first quarter, from $279m in the fourth quarter.The warnings prompted Danske Bank to downgrade its recommendation for Nokia shares to “sell”. It estimates that a larger-than-expected decline in Symbian sales will result in operating losses for the fourth quarter of 2011 and for 2012.Nokia is abandoning its old Symbian operating system in favour of using Microsoft’s Windows phone platform in its smartphones, as it tries tries to compete with popular Apple and Google-based phones. Nokia is expected to sell around 1m to 2m of the new Windows-based phones, which use chips from Qualcomm rather than ST Ericsson and TI, in the fourth quarter.However, Windows-based smartphones still represent only a small fraction of Nokia’s total phone sales. Analysts had expected a slow decline in Symbian phone sales which they say are essential to help cushion the company in the early stages of the Windows phones roll-out.“Nokia is between a rock and a hard place,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. “Sentiment towards Symbian has fallen through the floor.”Analysts are expecting Nokia to announce earnings per share of €0.04, an 82 per cent decline from last year.
432;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-11T19:44:04Z;Intel: smartphone chips are down;Even if the products roll out as promised, there is still a long way to go;"About time. Intel’s chips will finally to be found in smartphones this year. The company announced on Tuesday that Lenovo would release a phone with an Intel processor in China in the second quarter, and that Motorola would ship Intel phones in the second half. But the real hurdles are gaining significant market share and making money.Even if the products roll out as promised, Intel will have a long way to go in a market where chips based on Arm Holdings’ designs have 100 per cent market share. Why would handset makers rush to Intel when Arm licensees from Qualcomm to Nvidia to Texas Instruments are already competing for their business, and their software is already a proved fit with Arm designs?Intel has a history of paying up for a foothold in a new business. The company invested $1.6bn in Clearwire in the hope of cultivating WiMax wireless technology, aimed at breaking up the iron grip of Qualcomm’s CDMA. Intel may be protecting Motorola and Lenovo from any downside on the new products. But as the failure of WiMax highlights, even Intel is not rich enough to buy its way in to an established market.Smartphone sales grew by more than 40 per cent in the third quarter, when 115m units were sold, according to Gartner. But smartphone processors are much cheaper than PC processors, at
$10-$15 a pop. So even if Intel can take an impressive 25 per cent share in a year or two – and sell a lot of chips into tablets, too – it might sell $2bn in mobile chips. That is a respectable number, but it is hardly huge in the context of Intel’s $55bn in sales this year. It is no wonder that Intel wants to reignite PC sales with high-end “ultrabooks”.An aggressive entry by Intel could hurt the margins of Arm or its licensees. Near term, they may have more to fear than Intel has to gain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
433;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-11T01:03:33Z;Intel and Qualcomm step up chip battle;;Qualcomm and Intel, respectively the world’s leading mobile phone and PC chipmaker, announced deep incursions into each other’s territory in duelling speeches at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.A range of devices will form the battleground for semiconductor superpowers that are now closer to matching each other on battery life and performance.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, said its latest S4 Snapdragon processor would find its way into laptops before the end of the year.Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, introduced the first smartphone to feature its Atom chips – a Lenovo device that will go on sale in China in the first half of the year.The growth of smartphones and tablets as alternatives to the PC is also producing new alliances. Qualcomm’s processors, based on designs of the UK’s Arm, have enjoyed exclusivity in Windows-based smartphones – a relationship that echoes the old “Wintel” PC partnership between Microsoft and Intel.Intel has established a partnership with Google, adapting its Android operating system to work on Intel’s “x86” designs as well as Arm’s.Mr Otellini and Sanjay Jha, chief executive of Motorola Mobility, the handset maker being bought by Google, announced a multiyear, multidevice strategic relationship, beginning with Motorola shipping smartphones using Atom processors with Android in the second half of the year.Lenovo’s K800 smartphone, available in China in the second quarter, will also run Android and use the Atom Z2460 processor, formerly codenamed Medfield.This is the first system-on-a-chip from Intel to be competitive with chipsets from established mobile phone chipmakers – it marks a dramatic reduction in size and power requirements.It still lacks the multicore capabilities of smartphone and tablet rivals – both Qualcomm and Nvidia are moving to quadcore chips – but Intel said the chips’ hyperthreading technology still enabled multitasking.On the sidelines of the show, Intel executives have been demonstrating a prototype smartphone with features such as its camera’s ability to take 15 8Mp pictures a second in a “burst” mode.The world’s largest consumer electronics show this year sees 2,700 exhibitors displaying their wares in Las Vegas between January 10 and 13They also claim that their work on software means many Android apps will be able to run faster on Intel chips than comparable Arm-based ones.Qualcomm will take advantage of Microsoft’s decision to bring Arm compatibility to its latest operating system – Windows 8 – when it is launched later this year. Mr Jacobs, who demonstrated a prototype Windows 8 tablet running on a Qualcomm S4 Snapdragon processor, said 20 manufacturers had more than 70 designs in the pipeline for Snapdragon devices that were not phones.“Your next PC will deliver an always-on, always-connected experience …something we in the mobile industry know something about,” he said, adding that Qualcomm was talking to PC makers about building thin and light computers with long battery life, based on its chips.These could challenge the new ultrabook category being pushed by Intel at the show, which has the same features.Mr Otellini said Intel would raise the bar on tablet experiences when Windows 8 was introduced. Its chips would ensure compatibility with the millions of existing applications and devices, as well as supporting Metro, the operating system’s touch-based interface for tablets that will be offered as an alternative to the standard Windows desktop.
434;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-09T20:22:16Z;‘Wintel’ aims for grip on portable PCs;;If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Intel and Microsoft, the twin powers that long dominated the personal computing world, are bidding to outdo each other in paying Apple the ultimate compliment.Nearly four years to the day after Steve Jobs first held aloft the MacBook Air, Intel on Monday sought to give a lift to a similar wave of extremely thin, lightweight PCs that it hopes will build a new moat around its core business.Though the machines were first unveiled six months ago, Intel has chosen to use this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as a “coming-out party” for the new machines, which it has dubbed Ultrabooks and has predicted will quickly come to account for 40 per cent of laptop PC sales. Along with their portability, Intel also claims that it has moved closer to the long battery life and “instant-on” capability that has made Apple’s iPad the current role model for convenient computing.Yet with tablets continuing to evolve and rival chip technologies making headway, this looks like a “desperate bid to stay relevant,” says Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Associates.Matching the technological edge that lies behind Apple’s recent product hits – let alone securing a sustainable advantage – will be hard, he and other analysts say.By next year, chipmakers like Qualcomm and Nvidia are likely to be boasting chips that can match most of the performance characteristics of Intel-based Ultrabooks, says Ian Thornton, head of investor relations at ARM, the UK-based chip design company. ARM’s designs are already used by these and other chipmakers to power most of the world’s smartphones and tablets, and performance advances are Intel’s worst nightmare.Apple could itself launch an ARM-powered notebook by the end of this year that sets new standards in thinness and portability, adds Mr Kay. Also, with hardware makers pitching most of the machines at close to the $999 base price that Apple sells the Air, it will be hard to win over the personal buyers who are coming to influence even how corporate IT departments make their buying decisions, he says.The Ultrabook push is just part of the bid by Intel and Microsoft to break into high-mobility devices that has become a persistent theme of the annual CES event, but which this year has assumed added urgency. At risk is the gravitational pull that Wintel – the name given to the combination of Microsoft’s operating system and Intel-designed chips – has long held over personal computing, thanks to their ability to attract the attention of other software developers. But with smartphones and tablets running on other company’s technology, time is starting to run out.“Microsoft always owned the ecosystem of developers, but on this new platform, Apple is in the catbird seat,” says Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Nomura.Also expected to feature prominently in Las Vegas this week are the latest attempts by Intel and Microsoft to break into smartphones, with Intel showing off a design running Google’s Android software and Microsoft aligning itself closely with Nokia.When it comes to tablets, it will not be until the expected launch of Windows 8 operating system later this year that the old Wintel powers will be able to boast a true rival.At stake will be whether machines using this software can trigger the enthusiasm of consumers, says Al Gillen, an analyst IDC.There is a high chance of this happening, say optimists like Mr Sherlund. With screens that swivel back or detach to make tablets, the coming Windows 8 machines will finally push the software company and the PC ecosystem it leads into the tablet era, he adds.Microsoft and Intel will certainly be hoping he is right.

Mango has support from manufacturers and operators, but is it sweet enough to tempt consumers?Nokia Lumia 710On sale in the US on Thursday and due in the UK shortly, this is one of the first products of the partnership between Microsoft and Nokia. It also marks the Finnish phone maker’s re-entry into the US market.The Lumia 710, which costs $50 with a T-Mobile USA contract (it will be available with Three in the UK) has been positioned as a low-cost, “entry level” smartphone and I have no hesitation in recommending it in this role. Microsoft has done a good job with its new operating system. Mango’s interface is immediately accessible and intuitive and provides quick access to core features such as social networking and music.Similarly, Nokia also deserves credit for building a new handset which, while retaining the best features of the company’s older devices, has a much more modern look and feel.The 3.7-inch touch screen features Nokia’s ClearBlack technology designed to make it easier to view in bright sunlight. In terms of performance, the Qualcomm 1.4Ghz snapdragon processor, quad-band 3G data capabilities and rear-facing five megapixel camera with high-definition video capabilities are adequate if not outstanding, and voice call quality and reception are both better than average for a smartphone.In terms of add-on software, Microsoft still lags way behind Apple’s App store or the Android Market in terms of volume, but the 45,000 apps that are available in Microsoft’s WindowsPhone Marketplace should satisfy most users.In the US, the Lumia also comes preloaded with Nokia Drive, an excellent free GPS navigation app, T-Mobile’s mobile TV app to stream Netflix movies, Slacker’s personalised internet music content and Microsoft’s Xbox Live for mobile video gaming. Altogether an impressive bundle on a handset that deserves to succeed.HTC TitanHTC’s Titan premium-priced smartphone also exploits the best and most advanced features of Microsoft’s new mobile operating system and does so with HTC’s distinctive design flair and a huge 4.7-inch touch screen.The problem
What is the best replacement for a much-loved Palm Tungsten? I use it almost entirely for extensive contacts, and notes – it is compact, easy to use, has a great battery life and does not need a phone contract.
J Ingleby, UKThe solution
Yes, it’s sad to see the traditional PDA more or less superseded by the smartphone. The obvious answer is the iPod touch. It has great battery life, no contract, but still has WiFi and Bluetooth for connectivity and the full range of apps to replace those on your Tungsten. Note-taking can be made even easier with a voice-recognition app.For an Android alternative, the new Samsung Galaxy Note reminded me very much of a traditional PDA, so a WiFi only unlocked version of this might do nicely.Send your technology and gadget questions to chris.nuttall@ft.comThis handset, which costs $149 (£499 as a pay-as-you-go handset in the UK) is a great staging platform for features such as Mango’s built-in People Hub, which provides one-touch access to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.A 1.5GHz Qualcomm processor keeps the Titan zipping along, while its eight megapixel camera and LED flash array take great pictures. Unlike Nokia’s Lumia 710, the Titan also has a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera for video chat, but somewhat surprisingly lacks a slot for expandable memory.As its name implies, the Titan really is a big handful, which can be both good and bad. I found the big screen great for watching video and displaying pictures, but its size and weight – the Titan weighs a hefty 5.6 ounces – make it awkward to hold in one hand.Samsung Focus SLike the HTC Titan, Samsung’s Focus S which costs $200 and €145 in Europe, is a premium priced Windows smartphone designed to compete directly with the iPhone 4S and provide an alternative to high-end Android-based smartphones.Measuring just 0.3 inches thick and weighing 3.9 ounces, the Focus S is one of the slimmest and lightest fully-sized smartphones around – despite featuring a brilliant 4.3-inch screen which delivers vibrant colour.Its slim design does, however, come at a cost – battery life at 4.5 hours talktime is relatively paltry – but if you are looking for the most stylish Windows-based smartphone available today, this is it."
436;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2012-01-03T17:17:16Z;Intense scramble for US mobile telecoms spectrum;Attention focuses on one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world;AT&T’s failed $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, coupled with a string of successful deals in recent months, has refocused attention on one of the most pressing issues facing the US mobile telecoms industry – the scramble for spectrum.When Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, announced the abandonment of the T-Mobile USA bid last month, he said: “The actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block this transaction do not change the realities of the US wireless industry.“It is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world, with a mounting need for more spectrum that has not diminished and must be addressed immediately. The AT&T and T-Mobile USA combination would have offered an interim solution to this spectrum shortage. In the absence of such steps, customers will be harmed and needed investment will be stifled.”Since then, AT&T has completed a separate deal to buy spectrum from Qualcomm for $1.93bn, increasing its total spectrum holdings to around 81.1 Megahertz, according to calculations by Bernstein Research. That transaction should help ease immediate concerns about spectrum shortages as AT&T rolls out its new LTE broadband wireless network. But industry insiders say the US mobile industry needs access to much more spectrum if it is to continue to innovate.“Spectrum is the backbone of the wireless industry – without it, the applications, speed, devices and other innovations of the wireless ecosystem could be in jeopardy,” says the CTIA, the US mobile industry trade group.As evidence, it points to reports from the wireless carriers themselves. For example, data usage on AT&T’s network – the first to host Apple’s popular iPhone handset – grew by more than 8,000 per cent from 2007 to 2010.Industry executives say this data growth will continue, fuelled by the increasing use of smartphones which consume on average 26 times the amount of bandwidth as an ordinary mobile phone, and other wireless data devices including PC tablets which are even more data hungry.“We estimate that in the first five to seven weeks of 2015, we will carry the same amount of mobile data traffic on our network that we carried in all of 2010, as customers continue to ‘mobilise’ everything,” AT&T says.While some argue that dire warnings about a looming spectrum crisis are overblown, the Federal Communications Commission, the main industry regulator, strongly disagrees. “The spectrum crunch is very real,” says an FCC official.Julius Genachoski, FCC chairman, has made the need to free up an additional 500 Megahertz of spectrum one of the policy centerpieces of his ambitious National Broadband Plan. As part of the plan, the FCC is seeking Congressional approval for one of its most hotly debated initiatives – the use of so-called “incentive auctions,” sharing the proceeds of the sale of up to 120 Megahertz of unused TV spectrum with the current owners.Mobile operators themselves are taking steps to secure additional spectrum. While AT&T was mulling over the future of its T-Mobile USA bid earlier this autumn, rival Verizon Wireless announced a $3.6bn deal to acquire unused airwaves from SpectrumCo, a coalition of US TV cable companies that includes Comcast and TimeWarnerCable. Then a few weeks later it unveiled a deal to buy additional spectrum from Cox Communications for $315m after Cox decided to abandon its own wireless phone initiative.As part of these deals, which Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research has described as, “in some ways the most important telecom transactions I have seen in 20 years,” the cable companies will also resell Verizon Wireless services.Mr Moffett describes Verizon’s cable spectrum purchases, which must still be approved by the FCC, as “a strategic masterstroke for Verizon in that it takes an enormous step towards a wireless duopoly, but does it with far less regulatory friction than AT&T’s [failed] transaction to buy T-Mobile USA.”If approved, Verizon will emerge with the best spectrum position in the industry and a very deep position in the 700 Megahertz band, considered “beachfront” property in the mobile industry because it is the most suitable spectrum for mobile broadband in dense urban areas.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers which recently renewed its wholesale agreement with Clearwire, has acknowledged that it will also need more spectrum as it pushes ahead with its 4G network rollout and its partnership with LightSquared looks increasingly uncertain.However, T-Mobile USA is in perhaps the most difficult position. Although the fourth-largest US mobile operator will receive some new spectrum as part of the break fee agreed between AT&T and Deutsche Telekom, the company has said it will need to acquire more spectrum before it can build the LTE network that it needs to compete with its three larger rivals. LTE is the next generation wireless broadband data standard which is supported by most leading telecoms operators in the world.Now that Verizon has tied up the cable companies’ spectrum, it is unclear where that spectrum might come from, and whether as a result, T-Mobile USA will be forced into another, perhaps less contentious merger or partnership.LightSquared, funded mainly by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, is struggling to overcome GPS interference issues before it can launch its planned nationwide wholesale LTE network. That leaves Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator which is awaiting regulatory approval for its purchase of 40 Megahertz of spectrum, as perhaps the most likely partner for one or other of the US mobile industry leaders – or perhaps a “tier two” regional operator – in their scramble for spectrum.
437;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-12-23T19:34:48Z;AT&T wins approval for spectrum deal;;Just days after AT&T withdrew its $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, the US telecommunications group has won regulatory approval for its $1.93bn purchase of wireless spectrum from Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker.The Federal Communications Commission announced late on Thursday that it had approved the deal – first announced a year ago – subject to certain minor conditions designed to preserve competition.The purchase was approved by a three-to-one vote by the FCC’s commissioners and means AT&T and Qualcomm should be able to close the deal by the end of this year. AT&T plans to use the spectrum to support its roll-out of a new 4G network based on LTE technology.Julius Genachowski, the FCC chairman, had signalled the likely approval of the Qualcomm deal last month at the same time as he indicated his serious concerns about the proposed T-Mobile USA purchase. AT&T, which also faced opposition to the T-Mobile USA deal from the Department of Justice which sued to block it on antitrust grounds, subsequently withdrew its bid.Like other US mobile operators, AT&T needs more spectrum because of the rapid growth in usage of data-hungry smartphones like Apple’s iPhone.While AT&T was still mulling over the future of the T-Mobile USA bid, Verizon Communications, its main rival, announced plans to acquire valuable spectrum from a group of cable TV companies in two deals valued together at almost $4bn. Those deals, which are designed to help Verizon Wireless accommodate users on its new LTE network, also require FCC approval.Qualcomm put its spectrum holdings up for auction after deciding to abandon its wireless FloTV mobile television operations. The spectrum which is in the so-called ‘beachfront’ 700 MHz band is particular valuable because it covers more than 300m people across the US and is in a band that is particularly suitable for downloading mobile content to smartphones, PC tablets and other mobile devices.While approving the deal, the FCC voiced some competitive concerns about the deal.“Post-transaction, AT&T would hold a significant proportion of the available spectrum suitable for the provision of mobile voice or broadband services, particularly below 1 GHz spectrum, that has technical attributes important for other competitors to meaningfully expand their provision of mobile broadband services or for new entrants to have a potentially significant impact on competition,” the commission said in its order.As a result, the FCC imposed several conditions including requiring that AT&T’s use of its new spectrum does not stop rivals from using neighbouring 700 MHz spectrum for broadband services and limiting AT&T’s ability to use the Qualcomm spectrum in a way that would deprive rivals of the benefits of the FCC’s roaming rules.In response, AT&T said it welcomed the deal’s approval and said expects to close the transaction in the coming days. “This spectrum will help AT&T continue to deliver a world-class mobile broadband experience to our customers,” Bob Quinn, senior vice-president of federal regulatory issues at AT&T, said in a statement. “We appreciate the FCC chairman, the commissioners and their staff for completing its review before the holidays.”
438;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Xiaomi Technology: looking smart;;"Xiaomi Technology, the Chinese start-up looking to break into the high-end smartphone market, is apparently getting lots of attention not just from consumers eager to put money down for its dual-core, 1.5GHz Mi 1 smartphone.Investors, too, are liking what they have seen so far from the two-year-old company. Xiaomi recently completed a fresh round of financing that values the company at a cool $1bn.Xiaomi has raised $90m from existing shareholders Morningside, Qiming and IDG, as well as new backers Temasek, the Singapore state-owned fund, and Qualcomm, the US chip company, Yu Mingto, its chief financial officer, said on Tuesday.As the FT’s Kathrin Hille noted, Xiaomi is garnering lots of attention in China because its handset features “specifications that rival the fastest mobile phones from international brands, but which sells for half the average price of devices with similar processing power”.Xiaomi also stands out for using its high-end handset – which it sells at cost – primarily as a platform to raise the company’s profile and to deliver its chat and other internet services.The $90m raised adds to $41m the company had raised earlier. It will be much needed as Xiaomi rushes to scale up production to handle a flood of orders. Xiaomi has already shipped 400,000 smartphones and is looking to add Foxconn as a second contract manufacturer to boost capacity, Lei Jun, founder and chief executive, told Chinese media.Competition in the smartphone industry is getting more intense by the day so there is still much for Xiaomi to prove. But Xiaomi does appear to be making impressive early progress. This is a company to watch.Related reading:

439;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-12-20T18:48:44Z;Fallout expected after failed AT&T bid;;The collapse of AT&T’s $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit will have important repercussions for all three companies as mobile data use continues to grow, say analysts and industry insiders.AT&T, the second-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, will be forced to re-examine its options for obtaining new wireless spectrum, they said on Tuesday. T-Mobile USA and its German parent meanwhile will need to develop a new strategy for competing in the US market which is in the middle of an expensive technology transformation to a 4G technology known as LTE.While AT&T did not elaborate on its statement announcing the end of a deal that would have changed the US mobile landscape, analysts suggested the company is now likely to focus on winning approval from US regulators for its separate $1.93bn bid for spectrum owned by Qualcomm, while building its own LTE network.In addition, they said AT&T might examine alternative purchases or partnerships with companies that hold unused spectrum including Dish Networks, the leading US satellite operator which is in the process of acquiring a 40 MHz tranche of spectrum. “Dish could very well be the next target for AT&T,” said analysts at Stifel Nicolaus.Others, including antitrust lawyers, noted that the failure of the bid represents an unusual setback for AT&T in Washington where it is estimated to have spent $40m on lobbying efforts since the deal was announced in March. At the very least, they said it suggests that the company’s senior management and advisers seriously misread the Washington political and regulatory landscape.The challenges facing T-Mobile USA and its German parent are perhaps more stark, though DT will receive $3bn in cash and spectrum with a book value of $1bn as part of the break fee.DT had admitted its US business risks being left stranded with outdated technology as its three larger rivals move to the next generation of high-speed mobile data services based on LTE technology.Ultimately, as DT officials have privately acknowledged, the spectrum could prove more valuable to T-Mobile USA than the cash because without it T-Mobile USA faces the prospect of being marginalised in the market without the bandwidth necessary to support next-generation mobile services such as mobile video conferencing, mobile HDTV and gaming.For the moment, T-Mobile USA says it will continue to rely on an alternative high-speed wireless data technology called HSPA+ and relatively low-cost voice and data plans in order to compete. But T-Mobile USA is the only major US network operator that does not offer Apple’s iPhone.But unless it is able to forge a new partnership that would bring spectrum and new investment capital to the business, some analysts believe T-Mobile USA could become a niche player focused on the less lucrative but equally competitive pre-paid market.DT accused the US authorities of failing to give the deal a proper hearing. “We never really got to a thorough inspection [of the merger],” René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom chief executive, said on Tuesday, adding that authorities never appeared interested in details of the initial deal and later concessions.As a result of the deal collapse, he admitted that T-Mobile USA has “no clear path to LTE on current spectrum” and pointed out the “disadvantages in spectrum in economies of scale”. He said that the company would work on solutions to improve its spectrum position, although he refused to comment on any other merger, sale or acquisition to bolster its business.“The full solution [offered by the AT&T deal] would have been much better and easier but we will use the proceeds to improve our position,” he said. “We will work very hard on a solution for LTE.” Mr Obermann said the break-up provisions would give T-Mobile USA vital extra spectrum and roaming capabilities, which would help it along for a while. “But this isn’t the whole solution for the long term,” he conceded.He refused to be drawn on what Deutsche Telekom was now planning to do with T-Mobile USA and how quickly. But he did say Deutsche Telekom would continue to invest in its US business, which was profitable.
440;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-12-19T17:03:21Z;China smartphone aims to rival big names;;Chinese consumers are getting a second run at what could be the world’s best smartphone deal, and their response will be closely watched as an indicator of Chinese companies’ prospects in the fast-growing market for mobile devices and services.Xiaomi Technology, a Beijing-based start-up, on Monday resumed online sales of a touchscreen handset featuring specifications that rival the fastest mobile phones from international brands, but which sells for half the average price of devices with similar processing power.Xiaomi’s smartphone stands out among domestic rivals as the first Chinese handset to use a dual-core processor, and with a 1.5GHz processor from Qualcomm. Samsung’s new Galaxy Nexus model runs off a 1.2GHz dual-core processor.In early September when the company first started offering the Mi 1, which sells for Rmb1,999 (US$315), it had to halt sales after its website was swamped with more than 300,000 pre-orders in less than two days.While ZTE and Huawei, China’s two largest telecoms gear makers by sales, are courting consumers with increasingly high-end smartphones and Lenovo, the world’s second-largest PC vendor by unit shipments, is seeking to expand its mobile device business, a handful of smaller Chinese handset makers are also trying to build brands both at home and abroad.Industry experts say they face many challenges.“It will be difficult for the smaller Chinese handset makers to capture significant market share because they [can] compete on hardware, but that is no longer the key. It is services and applications where you need to differentiate yourself,” says Dale Gai, an analyst at Barclays Capital.Recognising that dynamic, alongside their mobile devices Huawei and Lenovo have launched personal cloud services similar to Google’s. Global handset makers have followed Apple’s lead in creating revenues from services as handsets become increasingly commoditised.Xiaomi, a start-up less than two years old and with fewer than 500 employees, wants to play in this league.The company, whose name contains a reference to the acronym for “mobile internet” but also means “little grain of rice” in Chinese, received US$41m in funding from Morningside Capital, Qiming Ventures, IDG and its founders.Lei Jun, the serial entrepreneur and angel investor who is Xiaomi’s founder and chief executive, once joked that in order to take on Apple, he would have to combine Google, Microsoft and Motorola.In fact, the company’s seven founders include executives who once worked at those three companies, and in spite of being a start-up, Xiaomi is using the same parts and manufacturers as bigger competitors. The Mi 1 is assembled by Inventec, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that also works with Motorola.It is this combined expertise in software, internet and hardware that Xiaomi believes many larger rivals have failed to master.“Motorola, Huawei or Lenovo are fine hardware companies and they have deep pockets, but internet services are just not in their blood,” says Lin Bin, Xiaomi president. “When I was still at Microsoft, I thought our company was invincible. But after I joined Google I saw how they developed software in a completely different way because as an internet company they had grown up with the constant interaction with users.”Xiaomi’s first product was MIUI, an Android-based mobile user interface launched in August 2010 and which is already being used by half a million people.The company has since introduced Michat, a mobile messaging tool, and a series of other applications, all of which are free so far. Chinese consumers are not used to paying upfront for online music, games or movies, but Mr Lin says Xiaomi expects to make money once it has built up a large user base.It then hopes to expand revenues by selling handset accessories as well as value-added mobile services.That is where the handset comes in. Xiaomi does not expect to make a profit on the device but aims to use it to raise the profile of the company and operating system. The handset is being sold only via the company’s website, and with each order, an account for Xiaomi services is set up for the purchaser.China Unicom, the country’s second-largest mobile operator by subscribers, has committed to taking up a large batch of the handsets for subsidised distribution to subscribers. Mr Lin expects that to bring total shipments of the Mi 1 to at least 1m units.“But we could end up selling as many as 3m if things go well,” he says.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong in Taipei
441;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-12-18T21:37:46Z;Small businesses: State and big business decide to foster entrepreneurship;Political concerns over economic polarisation are bringing change, writes Daniel Tudor;For many, the term South Korean business is synonymous with chaebol, family-controlled conglomerates that dominate this former Tiger economy. Headlines in the business pages typically refer to the likes of Hyundai, LG, or Samsung – of which the latter alone accounts for 20 per cent of Korean exports.Since the 1960s, when Park Chung-hee, the president, encouraged chaebol to enter certain additional markets, the largest business groups have taken advantage of economies of scale by diversifying. Lotte, for instance, makes chocolate, sells insurance, builds apartments, and owns a baseball team.In April, the country’s top 30 business groups had a total of 1,069 affiliates between them.That the chaebol have made large contributions to South Korea’s economic development is beyond doubt. However, one unfortunate consequence of their size and diversification has been the discouragement of entrepreneurship and the hindrance of small- and medium-sized businesses.Because of Korea’s risk-averse culture and the power of the chaebol, the usual choices of bright graduates have been to join the civil service, one of the professions, or a chaebol.Times are changing, however, and the country is experiencing a start-up boom. In January, there were 24,800 registered venture companies, up from 19,100 a year earlier. This is far greater than the number in existence even during the late-1990s internet boom, which threw up such current Korean tech stalwarts as NHN, and NCSoft.This is partly the result of government intervention, just as chaebol growth was in the 1960s. Political concerns over economic polarisation are forcing both the state and the chaebol to invest in start-ups.Hanwha, for example, recently announced that it would pull out of seven markets in which it competed with small companies, and invest Won200bn in a venture fund. Hyundai is also to spend Won500bn on its Asan Sharing Foundation, which partly exists to support young entrepreneurs.However, pure venture capital is also growing. The 95 per cent broadband penetration, the world’s second-highest level of enrolment in higher education, and its well-known mania for any form of new technology should make this country fertile ground for internet and tech investment.Masayoshi Son, Japan’s richest man – and an ethnic Korean – has invested $200m in 120 small Korean businesses. Foreign multinationals such as Qualcomm, and BASF – which announced plans in August to invest between €1m-€5m each in a series of start-ups – are also getting involved.The interest of foreign investors, as well as Korean-Americans such as David Lee, a former Google executive now a partner at Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm XG Ventures, is having other effects.Start-up investments in Korea typically came with a double contract, in which the founder had to guarantee the investor’s capital in the event of the company failing. Better options from abroad are encouraging Korean venture capitalists to remove such stipulations, according to Mr Lee.One beneficiary of this is Richard Choi, a 27-year-old entrepreneur, who received funding for his company Spoqa without having to sign his life away. Spoqa operates a social-networking loyalty point system. When users visit a participating shop or restaurant, they can recommend it to their friends via a smartphone app. If that recommendation leads another person to make a purchase, both will receive points, which can later be redeemed at other establishments.He aims to create a “win-win” for buyer and seller, in contrast to what he sees as the flawed social commerce model of companies such as Groupon, which has been criticised for providing little benefit to participating businesses.According to Nielsen Korea, 58 per cent of the population now use smartphones. It is unsurprising then that there are already 1,000 companies developing apps for the Apple and Android operating systems. The majority of app-focused start-ups will fail, but there have been some notable successes. Chief among these is Kakao, the creator of KakaoTalk, a free mobile messaging app that has virtually replaced traditional SMS in the country.Pyo Chul-min, another 27-year-old, whose company Wizard Works provides the “widgets” that provide enhanced features on most Korean blogs, says his parents were disappointed when he started his first business. He jokes that the status of a start-up entrepreneur was “less than that of a peasant farmer”. Today, he is a regular guest lecturer at universities, and is cited as a role model for young people.For a country in which most brilliant young minds have typically elected to play it safe, this has to be a welcome change.

We are now talking about a market of 400m units [a year], and it’s going to rise to about 1.2bn by 2015.”The group’s technology is now used in 125 chips – up from 98 last year – and a further 54 are in production.Mr Yassaie said 123m chips containing Imagination’s technology were shipped by customers in the first half, up from 107m in the same period last year.Revenues from Imagination’s licensing division rose 65 per cent year on year to £19m, while growth was less pronounced at its royalties division, up 26 per cent to £23.6m.Turnover slipped back slightly to £13.7m at Imagination’s lossmaking Pure digital radio brand, which Mr Yassaie attributed to a “tough retail environment”.In the six months to October 31 pre-tax profit rose to £10.4m from £7.7m last time, while revenues were up to £56.3m from £44.1m. Diluted earnings per share fell from 4.5p to 2.8p as a result of a one-off tax benefit last year, and there was no dividend. The shares rose by 64p, or 15 per cent, to 501p.FT CommentImagination Technologies has done well to take advantage of the boom in demand for smartphones and tablets, which shows few signs of slowing. However, it is difficult to see how a company trading on a 2012 forward price/earnings ratio of 45 – assuming adjusted earnings per share of 11p – can be considered anything but overpriced, especially when compared with the 18 times p/e ratio of Qualcomm, the US mobile chipmaker. Although investors might feel reassured by Apple’s 10 per cent stake in Imagination, the potential to lose market share in a rapidly evolving sector should not be ignored. Unless investors are betting on a possible takeover, the lofty share price does not adequately reflect these concerns.
443;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;India may welcome Qualcomm after all;;"Foreign direct investment in Indian retail may be dead, but Asia’s third-largest economy may be about to prove, again, that FDI in the country remains possible (see the case of Mickey Mouse), at least to those who wait.Next week – more than 18 months after it initially bid for broadband wireless spectrum on the subcontinent – US mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm may finally receive the license for which it paid $1bn.On Friday, a tribunal convened by the Department of Telecoms is set do decide – after a week’s consideration, at Qualcomm’s request – whether one of the local companies in the consortium led by Qualcomm that bid for spectrum, 13 per cent shareholder Tulip Telecom, owes Rs146 crore ($28.2m) in dues demanded by the Department, as the Times of India reported last week.The newspaper reported:“We would verify if that is correct or not. If dues are there, then we would pay,” said senior advocate C A Sundaram appearing for Qualcomm.Meanwhile, the DoT informed the Tribunal that if the dues are verified and cleared by them, then the ISP licence would be given to Qualcomm within a day.DoT council Manisha Dheer submitted that after granting of ISP licence, Qualcomm would have to apply for spectrum and it would be given in two weeks. “There is no need for further litigation for this,” Dheer said.Confirming the receipt of the notice, Tulip in a statement said, “Tulip has received a routine provisional assessment and like every year the company intends to have a discussion with the DoT to resolve the demand in line with the true performance of the company.”It’s quite a reversal from September when, as the FT reported, Qualcomm was on the verge of losing its license – and the $1bn it had already paid for it – because of technical errors in its application.At the time, one senior analyst from a foreign bank told the FT: “The last thing India needs at this moment is the telecoms ministry turning down a company which has invested a billion dollars in the country; this is going to send the wrong message to other foreign investors.”As India’s economy falters, its growth story goes up in flames and its government dithers, that’s still very much the case today.And next week, that’s just what it might get.Related reading:

444;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;AT&T and T-Mobile merger doubts deepen;;AT&T’s proposed $39bn takeover of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA may have been dealt a knockout blow by the decision of the Federal Communications Commission’s chairman to seek an administrative review of the deal, some analysts suggested on Wednesday.The announcement of the planned review triggered a war of words between AT&T and FCC officials, highlighting the animosity between the two sides against the backdrop of a growing level of distrust between the government and US business.“Ever since the Department of Justice filed in August to block AT&T’s deal to acquire T-Mobile, the deal was on life support,” said Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research in a note to investors. “Yesterday, the FCC disconnected the respirator.”Mr Moffett, who had previously put the odds of the deal being completed at about 10 per cent, added: “We believe that it is now time for AT&T to concede defeat and withdraw the merger.”Christopher King and David Kaut of Stifel Nicolaus said the unusual move to subject the proposed transaction to further review “makes it even more unlikely the merger will close – including through a settlement – and puts particular pressure on T-Mobile to take a fresh look at its risks and choices”.Administrative reviews of such deals are highly unusual. The decision by FCC chairman Justin Genachowski to ask his three fellow commissioners to vote for such a move is widely seen as signalling a high level of opposition. FCC officials contend the deal is not in the public interest and would reduce competition.The last time the agency sought an administrative review was in 2002 on the proposed merger of EchoStar and DirectTV – a deal that the companies eventually abandoned before it went to court.In a conference call with reporters, FCC officials said the agency had concluded that the proposed deal would significantly diminish competition and result in an unprecedented concentration in the wireless industry in 99 out of the top 100 markets.They also dismissed AT&T’s arguments that the transaction would enable the company to expand its rollout of a new 4G wireless broadband network based on a technology called LTE services, or that it would create any new jobs in the US. Officials said the deal would probably result in significant job losses.In an unusually forthright public comment, a senior FCC official said: “The record clearly shows that – in no uncertain terms – this merger would result in a massive loss of US jobs and investment.”That statement came after AT&T had earlier described the FCC chairman’s action as disappointing. AT&T said it was “yet another example of a government agency acting to prevent billions in new investment and the creation of many thousands of new jobs at a time when the US economy desperately needs both”. The company added: “At this time, we are reviewing all options.”Jim Cicconi, AT&T senior executive vice-president of external and legislative affairs, later took further issue with the commission. “The FCC itself recently claimed that their $4.5bn broadband universal service fund will create 500,000 jobs over the next six years,” he said.“Yet, somehow in our merger, the FCC staff concluded that a far greater investment in broadband – $8bn – plus firm commitments on job preservation and enhancement, will instead result in ‘massive loss of US jobs and investment’. This notion, that when government spends money on broadband it creates jobs but when a private company spends money it doesn’t, is clearly wrong on its face and raises questions about the credibility of anyone at the FCC who would make such a claim.”The strident tone of the comments made by both AT&T and FCC officials surprised some analysts. They noted that, while neither AT&T nor T-Mobile USA appear ready to concede defeat, there are also genuine political costs of pursuing the case to the bitter end. “After all, AT&T will have to do business with the DoJ and the FCC in the future,” said Mr Moffett.On a related matter, the FCC officials said they would circulate a draft order that would approve, with conditions, AT&T’s purchase of valuable spectrum from Qualcomm, the US-based mobile phone chipmaker.
445;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Apple-Samsung patent battle worries Brussels;;Europe’s competition watchdog is investigating the increasingly aggressive legal tactics being used in Samsung’s patent battle with Apple, in what could pave the way for an in-depth antitrust probe into the hotly contested intellectual property agreements that underpin the smartphone technology market.The preliminary enquiry, which touches on patents that are essential to the 3G mobile communications standard, highlights growing unease in Brussels about the way that important technology standards are being dragged into the IP disputes between some of the world’s biggest technology companies.Friday’s confirmation of the European Commission’s interest in the case is “a warning shot” that shows wider unease over the potential impact on important technology standards, said Florian Mueller, an independent intellectual property expert who was the first to report the case.The two technology groups have received requests for information from Brussels, in a process used to establish facts before regulators make a decision to launch a full investigation, which could last for several years. In a statement, the Commission said it had sent “requests for information to Apple and Samsung concerning the enforcement of standards-essential patents in the mobile telephony sector”.The wording pointed to official concerns with Samsung’s legal strategy, since it is the only one of the two to have tried to enforce patents that play a role in industry-wide standards. Patents included in legal cases Samsung has brought against Apple include 13 that underpin the 3G mobile standard, said Mr Mueller.Patent wars are raging in the smartphone industry. What began as Apple v Google Android conflict has turned into a vast legal quagmire involving everyone from Amazon to ZTECompanies that own patents enshrined in industry standards face extra responsibilities to license them, since access to the intellectual property is essential for any company hoping to compete in a market where standards apply, as in mobile communications. Brussels has revealed its concerns in this area before, for instance in its investigation into Qualcomm over the terms under which the US company was prepared to license its own patents that are core to 3G.Samsung said it was “co-operating fully” with the EC’s request, and that it “at all times remained committed to fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms for our wireless standards-related patents”.Apple declined to comment.The EC enquiry could play a wider role in shaping the patent wars, with Apple close to acquiring important mobile patents from Nortel, and Google in the process of buying Motorola Mobility. Many of Motorola’s most important patents also concern technologies that play an important role in mobile communications standards.The commitments companies such as Motorola have made to standards bodies to make their technologies widely available will make it hard for them to use the patents for leverage in the legal battles .“Unless Google is going to flout those obligations, I don’t see how the acquisition changes things in a significant way,” said Brad Smith, general counsel of Microsoft.
446;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-11-04T12:40:19Z;Spirent benefits from wireless demand;;Brisk tailwinds in the wireless sector continued to boost Spirent Communication’s revenues in the third quarter despite “uncertain macroeconomic conditions”, the UK-listed telecommunications company reported on Thursday.Shares in the company, which makes network testing equipment, climbed nearly 7 per cent to 127.9p.Demand for mobile internet and cloud computing drove revenues up by 6 per cent to $130.2m in the third quarter of the year when operating profits rose by 7 per cent to $31.1m. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 11 per cent to 3.34c.Spirent’s buoyant trading statement comes as Qualcomm attributed better than expected fourth-quarter results to growing demand for wireless technologies on Wednesday.The company benefited from increasingly sophisticated smartphone software which it tests for handset developers, as well as fast-moving developments in mobile data and cloud systems that have weighed on networks. Spirent’s order intake in its performance analysis business grow by 8 per cent in the third quarter.“Mobile operators are looking at a stark transition – ‘data’ is more important than voice,” George O’Connor, analyst at Panmure Gordon said, referring to new data services with mobile data, internet, cloud computing and virtualisation.However, Spirent said its wireline revenues were hit by customers concerned about macro economic conditions in Europe and North America. Revenues from its service assurance business fell by 18 per cent due to spending restraints and order delays by its big customers. The company said this was unlikely to change in the fourth quarter.Bill Burns, chief executive, said demand from Asia-Pacific made up for macroeconomic concerns in North America and Europe.Spirent reported a robust cash position, with $25.8m in free cash generation in the quarter, putting the total it holds at $226.9m. Technology companies typically receive cash before recognising it on their profit and loss statement and the company held roughly half of its assets in cash, something Mr O’Connor said was “almost unheard of” in the sector..

Trading in shares of New York-based investment bank, Jefferies, was halted on two occasions as rapid price falls triggered “circuit breakers”.Research firm Egan-Jones had earlier downgraded Jefferies’ debt, citing the bank’s exposure to eurozone government bonds. Jefferies released a statement saying it, “had no meaningful net exposure to European sovereign debt,” because its long exposures are hedged by short positions.The stock rallied strongly and closed down 2.1 per cent to $12.01 at the close. Investors are barred from shorting the stock until Monday, under current SEC rules, after it fell more than 10 per cent.In the wider market, the European Central Bank’s interest rate cut was enough to settle US investors, even as infighting engulfed the Greek government. The S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent to 1,261.15. But the move simply underlined US markets’ continued dependence on European news.“Its all Europe, Europe, Europe again,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service. “It’s making it kind of ridiculous to trade as the market just reacts to news.“We’ve all got Greek fatigue,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.8 per cent to 12,044.47 helped by a 3.3 per cent advance for Kraft Foods.

MEMC manufactures polysilicon, the main material used in solar panels. The polysilicon price has tumbled this year, as European governments have cut subsidies for solar energy.Life insurer Hartford Financial Services was off 5.7 per cent to $17.90, after it reported no net profit for the third quarter, as tumbling equity markets wiped out returns on its investments. Hartford said it had cut 1,600 jobs since the start of 2010, in order to reduce costs.

449;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Qualcomm beats Wall Street expectations;;Qualcomm has bucked slower growth in the smartphone market to report revenues and profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.Shares of the biggest mobile phone chipmaker by revenues rose nearly 10 per cent to $57.01 in extended trading in New York as it also delivered a bullish outlook.The San Diego-based company reported sales rose 39 per cent year on year to $4.12bn in its fiscal fourth quarter ending September 25, while profits grew 18 per cent to 80 cents a share.Analysts expected $4bn in revenues and earnings of 78 cents a share.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said sales of smartphones, the continuing transition from 2G to 3G networks and strength in emerging markets had benefited Qualcomm.Mobile phone sales growth slowed in the third quarter, according to the IDC research firm, as smartphone growth declined in key mature markets. IDC reported 12.8 per cent growth for the quarter last week – the second lowest rate over the past two years. It blamed economic uncertainty and consumers waiting for the latest smartphones, such as Apple’s iPhone 4s.Mr Jacobs said Qualcomm was helped by its diversification across geographies and handset vendors.“Smartphones in China are going really strong now and cell phones are staples not luxury items any more – even in tough economic times, people will buy themselves a new phone,” he told the Financial Times.Qualcomm’s revenues for the fiscal year were $14.96bn and it predicted a rise of 20 to 27 per cent in its current fiscal year to $18bn-$19bn. This was well ahead of analyst predictions of $17.3bn, according to Bloomberg data.Qualcomm has been successful in expanding beyond phones to tablets with its processors and wireless chips. The acquisition of the chipmaker Atheros this year for $3.2bn has expanded its reach into consumer electronics devices and networking in the home.The company reported shipments of its Snapdragon chipsets for mobile devices grew by four times this year.Snapdragon processors have been used by every handset maker for the latest Windows smartphones and Qualcomm doubled the number of baseband processors that feature in the iPhone with the introduction of the 4S model last month.Mr Jacobs told an analyst conference call that he saw five key drivers for the future. There was the continued mass adoption of smartphones, which were expected to surpass 1bn units annually by 2015, while a second factor was the growth of 3G in emerging regions, which was 38 per cent in the third quarter year-on-year.3G connectivity was also moving beyond the handset, he said, with AT&T reporting nearly half its third quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets.Mr Jacobs said the growth of advanced networks satisfying data needs and increased connectivity for not just people but devices that could talk to each other would also play to Qualcomm’s strengths.
450;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
451;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-10-20T15:04:52Z;Telematics: Spy in the cab is proving an ally instead of an enemy;It is taking time but drivers are warming to real-time monitoring, writes Rose Jacobs;"One recent Wednesday, an engineer working for the refrigerator repair company Serviceline made a swooping right turn in Surrey, south-east England, at 47mph. The radius of the curve meant he should have been going closer to 35mph. He did something similar a few minutes later, this time at a slower 37mph – but again too fast for the road.These were but two of the dozens of driving “events” the engineer racked up that day, as measured by a device in his van and logged at Serviceline’s headquarters in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.“Tim” – not the engineer’s real name – “has not had the greatest of days,” admitted Kevin Sheehan, group IT and communications development manager, reviewing the report that evening.Serviceline has long had a keen interest in what its 100-plus engineers get up to as they criss-cross Britain, responding to distress calls from restaurants and other businesses whose refrigeration systems have failed.The walk-in units can carry thousands of pounds’ worth of food, meaning clients are often anxious, if not panicked, when checking in with the company’s dispatchers to see if help is on the way.But the GPS and mapping systems Serviceline employs to answer those questions do much more, too. The technology, by satellite navigation specialist TomTom, allows job tracking, messaging between head office and vehicle, and the separate logging of private and work modes for the vehicles – an important distinction in the eyes of the taxman.Moreover, they are part of a push by both carmakers and after-market product developers to record more effectively how a car is being driven, including whether speed limits are being observed and how aggressively a driver corners or brakes.While the system that Serviceline uses does not account for a vehicle’s make, newer models do, allowing easier like-for-like comparisons and standard-setting.The appeal for fleet managers is mainly the savings on petrol or diesel: “Driver behaviour is the key element in reducing fuel use,” says Geoffrey Finlay, executive chairman of Lysanda, the company that provides TomTom with software to give a “green” score to the way a vehicle is being operated. He estimates these sorts of in-car telematics have the potential to reduce fuel use by 20 per cent.The devices offer other cost-savings, too, most particularly through lower insurance premiums. That is partly due to underwriters counting on using the reams of data on offer to fend off dangerous driving charges or health claims such as whiplash; but the data-crunching feeds more than defensive actions.Robin Harbage, a director at Towers Watson, an insurance consultancy, and a 30-year insurance veteran, says the telematics revolution trumps other developments in the way auto insurance is sold. “Everything up to now loosely correlated with driving behaviour. This is driving behaviour,” he says.Analysts at BCC Research say that while the net market value of the industry – including both consumer and fleet systems – fell slightly in 2009 amid the global recession, it has since recovered and is forecast to grow 20 per cent a year for the next five years, surpassing $40bn by 2016. That surge will be led by companies that provide services rather than hardware, predicts BCC.The market is highly fragmented, says BCC, but the global leader in services for fleet systems is Qualcomm, with estimated revenues from such products of $435m. It is followed by GE Capital and Volvo.In terms of demand, South Africa is a world leader because early adoption was spurred by security concerns, and Brazil is growing quickly.Carmakers have taken note, with Mercedes-Benz developing a product called FleetBoard and Ford’s hybrid Fusion being one example of cars that tell drivers with coloured lights or graphics when their driving is deemed eco-friendly.“The UK is leading the way on this, whereas GPS was picked up fastest in [continental] Europe,” says Bart Vanham, who works with PwC in Belgium. He has watched telematics catch on first among trucking firms (20-25 per cent penetration, TomTom estimates) and now, more slowly, move to light commercial vehicles such as Serviceline’s fleet (15 per cent penetration).The next wave will be companies’ “perk cars”, he predicts (just 1 per cent penetration), where managing the feedback to drivers themselves rather than their managers is key. While a bad driver can push up the cost of care for a car by 15 per cent, he says, managers of those cars will nevertheless hesitate to tell off people who are likely to be their bosses for bad driving. They will prefer to leave it up to chirpy icons and automated messages sent to the executive’s iPhone.There is real hope that at least some will respond. Among Serviceline’s drivers, while many were wary of the system when it was first introduced, particularly to the extent it infringed on their privacy, others have been keen to learn from the record-keeping.It helps, says Mr Sheehan, that one of the first times the data were used, it got an engineer out of a jam: someone had called to complain about his driving, but when the team in Stevenage looked at his log to check speed limits and braking, they found he hadn’t been anywhere near the location cited.Giles Margerison, head of UK sales for TomTom, says fleet managers need to emphasise that sort of positive usage in order to get drivers to “buy in”.All the more frustrating, then, that the one measurement his company has yet to perfect is a positive one showing when people are driving safely, smartly and efficiently."
452;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;India’s digital revolution needs more than Aakash;;"Aakash, the $35 made-in-India tablet, may be one of the most significant efforts made by New Delhi, which backed the project, to finally bridge the digital divide that has kept Asia’s third largest economy lagging behind its emerging market peers in digital connectivity.But a 7-inch tablet that connects to the internet with WiFi alone won’t be enough to “vanquish” digital illiteracy and boost e-learning and internet usage. India needs more WiFi hotspots before the digital revolution can take place.Currently, only a handful of cafés, shopping malls and modern offices based in affluent areas in cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai offer Wifi hotspots. Outside these metropolises, the service is close to non-existent.Internet access remains the preserve of the urban rich in India. The country has only 5.1 internet users for every 100 people, compared with 39.2 for Brazil and 28.5 for China, according to 2009 data published by the World Economic Forum.The more recent introduction of third-generation mobile services, which offer faster speeds to download mobile internet data, are likely to boost the use of the web. But the so-called smartphones, which are 3G enabled, are also restricted to a small pool of wealthy people who can afford to spend $200 or more for one of these hi-tech devices.Which means that the choice for Indians wanting to get online with a mobile device boils down to: costly phone with 3G; or cheap tablet but with limited WiFi.International observers should be reminded that in spite of all the hype around India being the next economic superpower, the country’s annual per capita income is Rs54,527 (about $1,100), according to official data. That means that few have the privilege to spend $200 on a fancy mobile with internet facilities.All this might be changing soon, bureaucracy permitting.Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Qualcomm of the US have recently won licences to develop 4G technology in India that will offer wireless internet the same way mobile phone operators provide wireless telephony services.However, Ambani has yet to disclose his business plan for this venture, while Qualcomm is battling a dispute with the government over the licence it won and paid $1bn for last year. This means that it might take years before India’s consumers in urban centres and rural areas alike will be able to use wireless broadband services.With a $35 price tag, which could come down to $10 thanks to economies of scale, according to the government, Aakash truly has the potential to give everybody access to a fairly sophisticated digital device. But for this showcase example of India’s frugal innovation development to turn into a revolutionary device that can empower the masses as the personal computer did in the 1980s in the West the country will need better wireless internet infrastructure. Without it the Aakash risks to be just another great idea and nothing more.Related reading:

455;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm risks losing India investment;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, risks losing its $1bn investment to develop India’s wireless broadband network after the country’s Department of Telecommunications rejected its application for spectrum licences.The move comes in the wake of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal that rocked the telecommunications industry, and which has paralysed decision making within the DoT, analysts said.The application rejection highlights the cumbersome nature of foreign investment on the subcontinent, and the about face introduces further uncertainty on the part of global investors, analysts said.“The last thing India needs at this moment is the telecoms ministry turning down a company which has invested a billion dollars in the country, this is going to send the wrong message to other foreign investors,” said a senior analyst with a foreign bank.Qualcomm received a letter from the DoT on Wednesday, stating that the licences the company had won at last year’s spectrum auction had been rejected. It issued a statement on Thursday calling the DoT’s grounds “baseless”.The department said it had no comment beyond referral to the auction rules: “If at any stage, the spectrum allocation is revoked, withdrawn, varied or surrendered, no refund will be made.”Nick Paulson-Ellis, India head of Espirito Santo, a global brokerage firm, said that investors were increasingly concerned about corruption in India and the uncertainty surrounding regulation and policy. “Investors are trying to figure out how the policy framework works. At the moment it’s all very unclear,” he told the Financial Times.Qualcomm entered the spectrum auction in May of last year– the only fully foreign player to do so – and won licences for four areas, paying $1bn to the government. The process in India is such that companies must first bid for a licence, then pay for it, and at a later stage apply for the right to use it.Qualcomm was allowed to bid for spectrum as a wholly foreign entity, but it then had to locally incorporate in order to operate within India. The US group incorporated four separate companies, one for each of the licenced areas – Kerala, Haryana, Mumbai and Delhi – and each company applied for its respective spectrum in August.On November 30, Qualcomm said the government requested proof that the four companies were indeed its nominees, which it did by December 20. However, recently, the US group was told by the DoT that there were technical errors with its application and added that they should have only applied for a single licence.Two weeks ago, Qualcomm sent a letter to the DoT offering to consolidate the four companies into one in order to qualify for a single licence. This was rejected by the government on the premise that Qualcomm had missed the deadline.The telecoms ministry had been at the centre of the multibillion-dollar scandal over the allocation of second-generation licences in 2008. Andimuthu Raja, the telecoms minister at the time, was arrested in February over his suspected role in rigging the awarding of 2G licences. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India found the mishandling of the 2G auction had cost the state about $39bn in lost revenues.
456;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-09-12T15:14:26Z;Broadcom buys NetLogic for $3.7bn;;Broadcom, the US wireless chip company, announced a $3.7bn cash deal to buy rival NetLogic Microsystems, the latest in a wave of consolidation linked to the growing number and importance of mobile devices.The deal will extend Broadcom’s ability to make chips used in wireless base stations as operators build next-generation networks. It is the fourth-largest US technology deal this year, according to Capital IQ data.The $50 per share offer represents a 57 per cent premium to Nasdaq-listed NetLogic’s close on Friday. NetLogic shares rose 50 per cent to $48 in midday trading on Monday in New York, while Broadcom’s fell 2.5 per cent to $32.60.Development costs of mobile device chips are driving more consolidation in the industry. Earlier this year, Nvidia, the US chip company, acquired UK rival Icera for $367m in order to bolster its ability to make chips for mobiles and tablets.Meanwhile, AT&T, the mobile operator, has proposed a $39bn deal to buy T-Mobile USA, as the companies struggle to meet the costs of developing next-generation networks.Last month, Google announced the acquisition of the mobile operations of Motorola for $12.5bn, as the internet company becomes increasingly involved in the smartphone industry.Broadcom’s main rival Qualcomm announced a deal in January to buy wireless chipmaker Atheros for $3.2bn, strengthening its positioning in Wi-Fi, where Broadcom had been focusing its efforts. The NetLogic deal boosts Broadcom on Qualcomm’s home turf.“We like the deal and believe NetLogic will bolster Broadcom’s position in infrastructure, not to mention add to its strength at key customers, such as Cisco,” said analysts at BMO Capital Markets in a note.Broadcom said it expects the deal to add 10 cents a share to its adjusted earnings in 2012 and it expects to maintain a strong balance sheet, with $4.2bn in cash at the end of this quarter. Both boards have approved the transaction, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012.California-based NetLogic is involved in the manufacture of 4G chips but made losses of $66m on revenues of $382m last year. So far this year, it is thought to have racked up losses of $29m.Scott McGregor, Broadcom chief executive, said the deal would double the company’s market, particularly as it moved into the market for wireless infrastructure and base stations.“Customers are looking for complete solutions. This allows us to pull all the technologies together in a space where small companies are having a hard time competing,” he told the Financial Times.But Alex Gauna, analyst at JMP Securities, said the acquisition of NetLogic was expensive. “Broadcom is paying a very full price at 26 times consensus earnings estimates. It highlights Broadcom’s inability to grow internally. If I were an investor I would be thinking that there goes $3.7bn of my money on something that Broadcom should have been able to build itself.”
457;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-07-27T14:32:17Z;Tech supply chain faces excess inventory;;Fears of shortages in the global technology supply chain are turning into worries about excess inventory as precautionary stockpiling after the Japan earthquake has coincided with waning consumer demand in Europe and the US.Far from the doomsday scenarios in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that there would be shortages – thereby making components pricier and delaying production – the biggest problem now facing global technology manufacturers is how to clear overstocked warehouses.“Nothing is tight right now [in the PC supply chain],” says Jenny Lai, head of Taiwan research at HSBC.“Those components where there was a risk of shortage are now having the biggest problems [in terms of oversupply].”Global semiconductor inventory levels – a good indicator of the health of the overall technology supply chain because all electronic devices use chips – jumped 10 per cent, from 66 days in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 73 days at the end of the first quarter this year, estimates Credit Suisse. It was the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis that these inventory levels rose above the long-term rolling historical average.The fact that potential shortages arising from the Japan disaster in March have been so quickly addressed is testament to the flexibility and diversity of the global supply chain. Companies moved quickly to secure alternative sources for key components, and the absence of widespread rolling power cuts in Japan beyond specific quake-affected areas meant further disruptions were avoided.Unfortunately for manufacturers, the move to ensure sufficient supplies coincided with generally weak consumer spending, particularly in Europe and the US, which are still the industry’s biggest markets.Acer, the world’s third-biggest PC company by sales, in June wrote off $150m worth of inventory in Europe, where the consumer PC market has been particularly damped by macroeconomic concerns.Nanya, Taiwan’s biggest manufacturer by sales of D-Ram memory chips for PCs, said last week that its inventory levels were now double the normal two to three weeks’ worth of stock.Oversupply concerns also plague the flat panel industry. AU Optronics, the world’s third-biggest flat-panel producer by sales, is cutting this year’s capital expenditure by a third due to “highly uncertain levels of demand in the third quarter” for televisions and computers. “The most important thing for us to do now is to control our inventory levels,” says Paul Peng, executive vice-president at AUO.STMicroelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, also said it had been affected by overstocking. “We saw overbooking by some customers in April, as they tried to protect themselves from shortages of certain components. That led to a correction in June,” said Carlo Bozotti, chief executive.US semiconductor suppliers generally show a healthier position– Intel said last week that inventories were at healthy levels, while Qualcomm said levels for CDMA phone chips had declined a little in the last quarter and were heading for the low end of the historical 15-20 week range of supplies.But Texas Instruments, whose factories were damaged during the Japan earthquake, on Monday said it had purposely increased inventories in its last quarter.Companies along the supply chain building up stock – both after the financial crisis and the Japan quake – helped drive the growth of semiconductor groups in the past two years. But with inventory levels now approaching historic highs, many chipmakers risk having to take writedowns if demand remains weak in the second half of the year.“When the supply chain goes from restocking to destocking, it slows down growth for a couple of quarters,” says Randy Abrams, analyst at Credit Suisse.Prices of memory chips like D-Ram and Flash spiked briefly after the quake on concerns of short supply but sluggish PC sales meant that provided little respite in an environment in which D-Ram prices have fallen by 70 per cent since May 2010.Unlike in previous years, “no one [among Nanya’s customers] is increasing inventory for the ‘back to school’ sales season,” says Pai Pei-lin, Nanya vice-president. “Stocks of key components in the supply chain are just too high right now.”Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London and Chris Nuttall in San Francisco.
458;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-07-24T17:45:19Z;Technical difficulties: but good earnings;Taken as a whole, the tech sector deserves more respect;"Someone please let the technology industry know that the economy is slumping. Of the 10 largest US tech companies, eight (Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, and EMC) have reported earnings recently. Their news has been good.Aggregate revenue grew by nearly 30 per cent, or $25bn; net income grew by nearly 40 per cent, or $8bn. Apple contributed about half of the dollars, but strip Apple out and the sales and earnings growth rates are still 16 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. All eight managed to beat Street expectations. Guidance (leaving aside Apple’s habitual caution) has been fine.This latest quarter comes after the industry had already compiled a respectable record. Since world stocks peaked in late 2007, the S&P information technology index is up slightly, and 10 per cent ahead of the total S&P.Tech did no worse than the broad market on the way down and outperformed it on the way up; the only sectors it lags over that period are consumer staples and consumer discretionary. And the tech index’s earnings have risen nearly 80 per cent since the peak, far overshooting the index’s price.Given this, is it too much for tech investors to hope for a little multiple expansion? The eight big companies to announce earnings so far trade at an average forward price/earnings ratio of 11. At the top in 2007, the sector traded on a multiple roughly double that. All are thoroughly global, and hence exposed to healthy and growing emerging markets. Most have higher exposure to corporations’ strong balance sheets than to consumers’ weak ones.These bullish arguments must contend with the shadow cast by fallen tech angels such as Nokia and Research In Motion (and, to a lesser extent, Cisco). These companies’ recent history shows that, in tech, revenue momentum can reverse and margins collapse very suddenly. This is a reason not to overpay for any one company. But taken as a whole, the sector deserves more respect.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

The loss was the result of a charge related to the conversion of Mitsubishi UFJ’s preferred stake.The financial sector led all the S&P sectors, gaining 2.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley was the last of the large Wall Street banks to report second-quarter results in what was a largely positive earnings season. Bank of America gained 3.9 per cent, while Citigroup added 4.4 per cent. Regional banks SunTrust and Fifth Third were also boosted, gaining 3.2 and 3.5 per cent respectively. The regional banks report on Friday and next week.American Express, which reported after the bell on Wednesday, gained 0.9 per cent on strong profits. Cardholders spent a record amount in the second quarter, helping the credit card group report a 31 per cent increase in net profitAfter the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.4 per cent to 1,343.80, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.72 per cent to 2,2834.43. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2 per cent to 12,724.41.US media reported on Thursday that the Republicans and Democrats were nearing a deal to raise the US debt ceiling and avoid default. While not confirmed, the rumours cheered markets.Also on the economic front, eyes were on a possible European deal to help bail out Greece with the aid of private sector bond holders. Despite the agreed bail-out, some analysts were not sure it was enough to cure risk fears.“Discussions with officials suggest policymakers understand how serious the situation is,” Credit Suisse analysts said. “We think an effective solution to private sector participation in the Greek bail-out is not sufficient to ease markets’ fears.”E*Trade gained for the second straight session, adding 4.8 per cent to $15.43. The online broker gained nearly 14 per cent in Wednesday trading following news that Citadel, a fund that is a shareholder, asked for two board members to step down.“The hedge fund injected $2.55bn of cash into E*Trade back in November 2007 so that it could avoid bankruptcy, and that hasn’t turned out to be a winning investment so far,” noted Canaccord Genuity.A $29bn pharmaceutical deal boosted the sector 1.5 per cent despite Eli Lilly reporting a drop in quarterly earnings.Express Scripts agreed to a $71.36-a-share offer in cash and stock to buy Medco Health Solutions in a deal that will make it the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US. Medco shares soared 14.4 per cent to $63.83. Express Scripts also benefited, rising 5.3 per cent to $55.36.Eli Lilly reported that sales beat forecasts and the drugmaker boosted its full-year profit outlook. Shares rose 3 per cent to $39.32.The technology sector was cheered by positive results released after the bell on Wednesday. The sector gained 0.5 per cent after finishing the previous session slightly down. It was dragged down by Western Digital, which fell 7.8 per cent ahead of earnings after the bell on Thursday.F5 Networks was down 11.3 per cent after losing 6 per cent over the last two sessions. The cloud computing software maker reported third-quarter profit climbed 54 per cent.Ebay results exceeded expectations, registering a revenue gain of 25 per cent. The online auction company’s shares gained 0.8 per cent to $33.44.“Despite the strong quarter, the company’s updated 2011 guidance was disappointing … We believe the guidance is likely conservative – all key businesses are experiencing acceleration, and there is upside to guidance, even if they stayed at current growth rates,” said analysts at Collins Stewart.Traders were looking ahead to Microsoft’s results after Thursday’s close, which many expect will include warnings about sluggish PC growth.In consumer results, Safeway, the US grocery chain, fell 9.4 per cent after reporting weak same-store sales and lowering forecasts for the same group. Citigroup analysts were positive about Safeway’s forecast that same-store sales will gradually increase, but said investors were still “disappointed”.PepsiCo shares also suffered after the company’s second-quarter results missed expectations. The beverages division was hardest hit and sent shares down 3.4 per cent to $66.17.In its first report after activating its online paywall, the New York Times reported losses weighed down by print costs. Reports that more than 220,000 people subscribed to the digital model cheered investors sending shares 1.9 per cent higher to $9.14.
460;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-07-21T20:51:03Z;Mobile phones: calling for help;The business is still very healthy but the high tide is not lifting all ships;The mobile phone business is still very healthy. As a crude indicator, imagine a combination of five big players: smartphone leaders Apple, HTC and Nokia, along with chipmaker Qualcomm and Ericsson, the infrastructure leader. The revenues of this hypothetical giant were 60 per cent higher in the most recent quarter than a year earlier, and the return on equity from operations – excluding the effect of the remarkable $58bn net cash position – was a hearty 40 per cent.Such numbers fit with the industry’s characteristics. It has rapid growth: handset sales increased 32 per cent globally in 2010 and Ericsson projects 40 per cent annual growth in the number of mobile broadband users over the next four years. It also has compelling innovation: smartphones cost at least three times as much as the units they replace.Still, the high tide is not lifting all ships. On the contrary, it has an undertow which threatens to pull Nokia down. The Finnish company reported a loss in the second quarter, and sold 31 per cent fewer smartphones than in the previous one. The share price has been cut in half in two years. Ericsson is far from drowning, but its second-quarter results looked like they come from a fairly mature industrial in a cyclical upturn: revenues up 14 per cent, a 9 per cent operating profit margin and an annualised cash-adjusted ROE of 14 per cent. The struggle is not new: the share price, which dropped 10 per cent on Thursday on the results, is up only 6 per cent in two years.Why do corporate fortunes vary so greatly? With technology changing so fast, a leading position can quickly become a drag. And when price competition is lively, as it is in Ericsson’s hardware and services businesses, it is hard to earn a tremendous return on the big required investments in research and development.Eventually the mobile industry will settle down. But not for a while yet. The next few years are likely to be much like the last few, just a little more so.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Brazil’s central bank has raised interest rates for the fifth time this year as the country battles inflation above official target levels, the FT reports. Brazil on Wednesday raised its benchmark Selic rate by 25 basis points to 12.50 per cent, in line with economists’ forecasts, to try to quell inflation that reached 6.75 per cent in the 12 months to mid-July. Like other large emerging market economies, including China and India, Brazil has been locked in a tightening cycle to prevent overheating in the economy.Renminbi appreciation benefits limited, IMF says
A substantial appreciation of the Chinese renminbi would have little effect on trade and growth in the rest of the world even if accompanied by other economic liberalisation, according to the International Monetary Fund, the FT reports. In its annual report on the Chinese economy, the IMF said a 20 per cent trade-weighted appreciation in the renminbi – a level similar to that demanded by many American lawmakers – would increase growth in the US economy by between 0.05 and 0.07 percentage points.Free market champions named in Peru’s cabinet
Ollanta Humala, Peru’s president-elect, has appointed free market proponents to key cabinet posts to oversee one of the world’s fastest growing economies. Salomon Lerner, a businessman and one of Mr Humala’s most trusted confidantes, will become prime minister on July 28, when Mr Humala takes office, the FT reports.China manufacturing may contract for first time in a year
China’s manufacturing sector could be headed for its first contraction in a year as new orders drop and factories battle against persistent inflation, according to a survey published on Thursday, the FT reports.
The HSBC flash purchasing managers’ index for China, designed to provide an early snapshot of industrial conditions, has fallen to 48.9 in July, the lowest in 28 months. The final figure for this month will be published on August 1. A reading below 50 would denote a retrenchment in activity.Western sanctions create India-Iran impasse
US officials say India and Iran are in talks to resolve an impasse that has threatened Delhi’s access to Iranian oil and has held up a $5bn payment to Iran, the FT reports. The issue has thrown into focus the extent of US and international sanctions against Iran, which are not targeted at its oil exports but have hit many of the banks that facilitate oil transactions. India, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil after China, owes as much as $5bn for crude already delivered, but the money is stuck in an escrow account because India can not transfer the dollar-denominated payments without running afoul of the US Treasury. Iran has threatened to cut off oil supplies to India from next month unless it finds a way to pay for its oil imports, as US financial sanctions tighten their grip on Iran’s oil sector, the lifeblood of the Islamic Republic’s economy.Intel and Qualcomm bullish on second half
Leading US chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm gave bullish forecasts for the second half of the year as they expect strength in emerging markets and a surge in demand for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to drive sales, the FT reports. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, reported a 23 per cent growth in sales in the first half. Qualcomm raised its revenue and profits forecasts for its full year, citing “strong global smartphone adoption” and the addition of Atheros, a chipmaker whose acquisition it completed in May.Allen & Overy leads lawyers’ scramble for Africa
Allen & Overy has become the first of Britain’s so-called “magic circle” law firms to open an office in Africa after launching in Morocco, the FT reports. The London-based firm has pipped to the post its rival, Clifford Chance, in establishing a presence in the north African country after hiring two lawyers from the Casablancan office of French firm Gide Loyrette Nouel. Law firms are leading a new scramble for Africa as they position themselves to win deals stemming from China’s thirst for natural resources in the continent. Until now South Africa has been the focal point of interest, with Norton Rose announcing a merger with local firm Deneys Reitz last November.Oil India said to consider acquisition of stake in Maurel’s Gabon fields
Oil India, the nation’s second- biggest state-run oil producer, is in talks to buy a stake in Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA’s assets in Gabon, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said, Bloomberg reports. Oil India is studying the fields and plans to appoint banks for financial due diligence soon, two of the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Maurel wants to sell a controlling stake in the fields, which may be valued at more than $1.5 billion, one person said.Emerging Markets

462;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Google to wind down Labs;;Tech news from around the web:Google says it’s winding down Google Labs, its website that lets users try out new products that Google engineers were experimenting with, the Los Angeles Times says. The move follows chief executive Larry Page’s comments made at last week’s earnings announcement:Greater focus has also been another big feature for me this quarter–more wood behind fewer arrows.Last month, for example, we announced that we will be closing Google Health and Google PowerMeter.We’ve also done substantial internal work simplifying and streamlining our product lines.Staying with Google, The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is in preliminary talks with InterDigital about a possible acquisition of the wireless technology developer and licence group. The move is part of attempts by Google to bolster its patent portfolio after failing to acquire a raft of technology patents from Nortel, the WSJ said.Larry Summers, former president of Harvard University, has given an insight into his encounter with the Winklevoss twins – as dramatised in the film The Social Network. CNN quotes Mr Summer’s description of the twins and their legal battle against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg – a fight they tried to involve Mr Summers in:Rarely, have I encountered such swagger, and I tried to respond in kindGetGlue the “check-in” app that lets users share what they are watching, listening and reading with their social network, has secured an exclusive partnership with Channel 4 in the UK, PaidContent reports.

463;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;E Ink’s fading colour appeal;;The release of Amazon’s Kindle DX black-and-white eReader a year ago was also meant to presage a new era of colour for the devices.E Ink, provider of the screen’s technology, had improved the contrast by 50 per cent with this new “Pearl” display to ensure viewing would not be dimmed too much when it laid a filter on top to add colour to eReaders. But, a year on, it seems device makers are sticking to black and white due to dissatisfaction with E Ink’s solution.The problem is that, compared to the iPad or the bright LCD screen of the Nook Color eReader, E Ink’s colour screens – and even those of Qualcomm with its Mirasol technology - lack the same vibrancy.“It looks like a magazine faded by the sun,” Michael Serbinis, chief executive of Kobo, told me this week. His company’s latest model released in May (pictured) sticks with the black-and-white Pearl screen.“The E Ink [colour] screen is not really where the market’s expectations are, people have seen devices like the iPad and Galaxy Tab and expect a very rich colour experience and that’s not what E Ink provides, so I think it’s not really ready for the market.”Others seem to agree. The Nook 2nd Edition stays with black-and-white, while updates to Amazon and Sony readers later this year are also expected to feature monochrome displays.Mr Serbinis says E Ink’s Pearl technology still suits readers of books where pages are black and white anyway and the battery life of up to two months on a single charge cannot be matched by colour eReaders.But new types of customers that were looking for cookbooks or kids’ books or comics were okay with colour devices that did not have the same battery life or black-and-white crispness, he said.Instead of adding colour made popular by tablets, pure eReaders are adding their touch capabilities. The Kobo eReader Touch Edition was launched in May and was swiftly followed by the Nook 2nd Edition.Kobo has survived consolidation in the sector to figure as a credible competitor to Amazon, Sony and Barnes & Noble’s devices, although Mr Serbinis says its business model is built on software and book-selling services – it has eReading applications for the iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows and MacOS.While Barnes & Noble’s service is US only, Kobo’s eReader and services are available internationally and the Canadian company is striking partnerships with booksellers in different countries.In the UK, it sells the reader through WHSmith and is expected to announce a partnership with another leading bookseller shortly.EBooks have hit bricks-and-mortar booksellers and Kobo itself has been hit in turn by the demise of Borders, the US chain, this week, although Mr Serbinis said it would suffer a minimal impact from the loss of a sales outlet for its eReaders in Borders stores. Borders’ 11 per cent stake in Kobo was also not significant.“They participated in our first funding round, but not in our subsequent two rounds and their shares will likely be purchased by our existing shareholder base – our most recent round was oversubscribed,” he said.

Brazil’s central bank has raised interest rates for the fifth time this year as the country battles inflation above official target levels, the FT reports. Brazil on Wednesday raised its benchmark Selic rate by 25 basis points to 12.50 per cent, in line with economists’ forecasts, to try to quell inflation that reached 6.75 per cent in the 12 months to mid-July. Like other large emerging market economies, including China and India, Brazil has been locked in a tightening cycle to prevent overheating in the economy.Renminbi appreciation benefits limited, IMF says
A substantial appreciation of the Chinese renminbi would have little effect on trade and growth in the rest of the world even if accompanied by other economic liberalisation, according to the International Monetary Fund, the FT reports. In its annual report on the Chinese economy, the IMF said a 20 per cent trade-weighted appreciation in the renminbi – a level similar to that demanded by many American lawmakers – would increase growth in the US economy by between 0.05 and 0.07 percentage points.China manufacturing may contract for first time in a year
China’s manufacturing may have contracted for the first time in a year in July, preliminary data for a purchasing managers’ index showed, Bloomberg reports. The gauge fell to 48.9, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, and compared with a final reading of 50.1 in June. The final July reading is due on Aug. 1. China’s government signaled confidence in the expansion of the world’s second-largest economy by announcing extra measures to cool the property market last week. Growth was faster than forecast in the second quarter even after the central bank increased interest rates and boosted reserve requirements to a record.Western sanctions create India-Iran impasse
US officials say India and Iran are in talks to resolve an impasse that has threatened Delhi’s access to Iranian oil and has held up a $5bn payment to Iran, the FT reports. The issue has thrown into focus the extent of US and international sanctions against Iran, which are not targeted at its oil exports but have hit many of the banks that facilitate oil transactions. India, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil after China, owes as much as $5bn for crude already delivered, but the money is stuck in an escrow account because India can not transfer the dollar-denominated payments without running afoul of the US Treasury. Iran has threatened to cut off oil supplies to India from next month unless it finds a way to pay for its oil imports, as US financial sanctions tighten their grip on Iran’s oil sector, the lifeblood of the Islamic Republic’s economy.Intel and Qualcomm bullish on second half

465;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-07-20T23:47:37Z;Intel and Qualcomm bullish on second half;;Leading US chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm gave bullish forecasts for the second half of the year as they expect strength in emerging markets and a surge in demand for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to drive sales.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, reported a 23 per cent growth in sales in the first half. Paul Otellini, chief executive, said this “and our increasing confidence in the second half of 2011 position us to grow annual revenues in the mid-20 per cent range”.Qualcomm raised its revenue and profits forecasts for its full year, citing “strong global smartphone adoption” and the addition of Atheros, a chipmaker whose acquisition it completed in May.Intel, whose microprocessors power four out of every five PCs sold, said there was continuing softness in mature consumer markets like the US and Europe, but emerging markets were “healthy and growing”.Shipments to Turkey and Indonesia were up more than 70 per cent in the second quarter, while Indian and Chinese unit shipments were up 17 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.However, Intel lowered its forecast for PC unit growth in 2011 from the low double-digits to 8-10 per cent. Its shares fell 1.8 per cent to $22.57 in extended trading on the news. It was more optimistic on PC revenues, with businesses continuing to refresh their equipment at higher prices than in the consumer segment.Unlike Qualcomm, Intel has failed to make an impression with its chips in smartphones and tablets to date, but growth in mobile data usage has benefited server chips sold for remote data centres. Chip shipments for storage systems serving the internet “cloud” were up 38 per cent on a year earlier.Intel reported double-digit revenue growth in all its business segments, which contributed to record sales of $13.1bn in the second quarter, ahead of analyst expectations of $12.8bn, according to Thomson Reuters. Intel predicted revenues of around $14bn for its third quarter, ahead of analyst forecasts of $13.5bn compiled by Bloomberg.Second-quarter profits of $3bn or 54 cents a share were ahead of Wall Street expectations of 51 cents.Qualcomm, the world’s biggest wireless chipmaker by revenues, reported June quarter revenues rose 34 per cent year-on-year to $3.6bn and profits of 61 cents a share were up 30 per cent. It raised its revenue guidance for its fiscal year ending in September from $14.1bn-$14.7bn to $14.7bn-$15bn, reporting strength in North America and Asia.It also raised its forecast for average selling prices of mobile devices by $3 to $207 per unit “primarily driven by greater adoption of higher priced devices such as smartphones around the world”.

467;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-05-31T08:44:53Z;Intel unveils new vision for laptops;;Intel has unveiled its vision for a new class of mobile computers that it hopes could take over from netbooks as the growth engine for the core PC market and help protect it against the threat from tablets.Sean Maloney, the new chairman of Intel China, launched the Intel-powered Ultrabook category in a speech at the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Tuesday.He was joined on stage by Jonney Shih, chairman of Asus, the Taiwanese computer maker that virtually invented the netbook category with its successful Eee PC, introduced in 2007.“Transforming the PC into an ultra-thin, ultra-responsive device will change the way people interact with their PC,” said Mr Shih, showing off the Asus UX21, the first of the new Ultrabooks.It is an aluminium sliver of a laptop weighing about two pounds, with a high-resolution 11.6-inch screen and a solid-state drive that will enable long battery life and an almost instant-on capability.It bears a strong resemblance to Apple’s latest MacBook Air, which Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, described at its unveiling last October as drawing on the best features of a tablet to become the future of notebooks.Intel and its partners are clearly following Apple’s lead. “[Ultrabooks] will marry the performance and capabilities of today’s laptops with tablet-like features and deliver a highly responsive and secure experience, in a thin, light and elegant design,” Intel saidIntel’s Atom processors have dominated the netbook category, but the appeal of these low-priced small laptops has faded next to tablets such as Apple’s iPad.Intel is beefing up Ultrabooks with its more powerful second-generation Core processors, which are also frugal in battery usage.Navin Shenoy, Asia Pacific general manager for Intel, said this type of ultra-thin laptop comprised only about 5 per cent of the consumer notebook PC market, but by the end of 2012 Intel expected it to account for 40 per cent.While the Ultrabooks will not be nearly as cheap as netbooks, Mr Shenoy sees a “sweet spot” for PC makers to price models between $799 and $999, compared with more than $1,000 for the MacBook Air. Netbooks will be getting even cheaper. Asus announced on Monday that its next Eee PC netbook would sell for $199.Intel is also accelerating the introduction of new generations of its Atom processor to try to capture market share in tablets and smartphones, where it has lost out so far to processors based on designs by Arm of the UK.“We believe the changes Intel is making to its road maps, together with strong industry collaboration, will bring about an exciting change in personal computing over the next few years,” said Mr Maloney.“Intel is revisiting the netbook concept and pretty much eliminating it with these ultrabooks to re-establish the notebook as the pre-eminent form factor, albeit with a much richer technology underneath it,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle group.Its success against tablets would come down to marketing, he added. “Apple’s done a stunning job with the iPad and Intel’s going to have to change that mindset, it’s a battle for hearts and minds at the moment.”Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, spoke about the reinvention of the PC at the company’s analyst day earlier this month.He predicted the PC would be transformed within two years into a more mainstream-priced consumer electronics device that would be “ultra-thin, ultra-capable” and with all-day battery life, higher performance than the fastest laptops of today, instant-on capabilities, touch features and constant internet connectivity.Technology companies have struggled to define new mobile categories over the past decade. Microsoft made little headway with its ultra-mobile PC concept, while Qualcomm received no buy-in from manufacturers on its smartbook category and Intel failed to set pulses racing with its concept of Mids – mobile internet devices.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong in Taipei
468;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-05-15T18:52:21Z;US tax fears prompt overseas M&A rush;;US multinational companies are stepping up efforts to deploy their overseas earnings in cross-border mergers and acquisitions as they seek to avoid the tax hit from repatriating their so-called “trapped cash”.The activity has prompted debate among bankers over whether tax issues are distorting business decisions, potentially leading US companies to favour overseas investments over opportunities at home.“Companies have been asking bankers to find them targets in countries where they can use this cash,” said one adviser. “It is earning them zero and lowers the opportunity cost of an acquisition in an overseas market.”Other bankers, however, argue that using foreign cash to make acquisitions does not meaningfully contribute to decision-making but is just a bonus.Use of cash in international deals by US buyers is at record levels, according to Dealogic. Cash-only deals accounted for 90 per cent of international deal activity this year and last, and about 60 per cent of global deals.Last week, Microsoft said that it would use $8.5bn in offshore cash to buy Skype, a Luxembourg-based company.Companies rarely disclose the source of the cash used in deals. But people familiar with the matter said offshore cash was deployed in PepsiCo’s purchase of Russia’s Wimm-Bill-Dann last year and in General Electric’s recent international deals, as well as in a raft of transactions involving healthcare and technology companies with significant foreign earnings.US technology companies have been particularly vocal in calling for a tax holiday that would enable them to bring funds back to the US. Cisco, which used overseas cash in the $3.3bn purchase of Norway’s Tandberg in 2009, and Microsoft both have more than 80 per cent of their cash and short-term investments offshore.Senior officials in the Obama administration say they are fiercely opposed to such a move. Critics of a tax holiday worry that repatriated cash will be returned to shareholders rather than invested in job creation.Companies are also becoming more creative in seeking to use their overseas cash in the US without suffering adverse tax consequences, say experts. Qualcomm in January said it planned to use offshore funds to buy Atheros, the US chipmaker.Deals of this kind sometimes employ complex structures that can only be used in limited circumstances. Companies must also tread carefully. If the funds are no longer deemed to be “permanently invested” overseas, companies could be forced to provision for their potential tax liability in the US.Some credit rating agencies only give companies partial credit for cash overseas, assuming that they would lose a chunk to the government were they to bring it onshore.
469;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-05-10T03:36:35Z;Nvidia’s ace of base;;Nvidia’s acquisition of Icera on Monday for $367m completes the chipmaker’s transition from a PC-focused graphics chipmaker to one built to challenge in the post-PC world that Apple likes to talk about so much.It also deals another blow to Texas Instruments, once the leading wireless chipmaker but now one that prefers to emphasise its strength in analogue chips.Analysts point out that TI was a customer of the UK’s Icera for the baseband chips that process communications functions in phones and is now one of the only companies left that has an applications processor business without any internal baseband support, Nokia being another.“While Icera claims that it will continue working with existing partners, this definitely creates a problem for TI, which exited the baseband business in the 2009/2010 timeframe,” says Jim McGregor, chief technology strategist at the in-Stat research firm, in a report.“Not only does this eliminate one of the potential independent baseband partners, it makes partnering with the remaining suppliers more difficult.”Icera was the only remaining independent supplier with a solution that supported both 3G and 4G standards, he explains.He points out that Nvidia’s Tegra 2 application processor lacks an integrated baseband chip that would allow it to compete better in smartphones, where the main player Qualcomm has its Snapdragon applications processor well integrated with its own wireless chips.With Intel completing its $1.4bn purchase of Infineon’s wireless division in January to add its baseband chips, the competitive landscape has changed significantly this year.Nvidia’s dual-core Tegra 2 has been out in front in tablets – it is in the Motorola Xoom, LG Optimus Pad, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Sony’s upcoming S1 and S2 tablets, to name just a few.It is less well represented in smartphones, but features in “super phones” such as the LG Optimus 2X and Motorola Atrix 4G.With Nvidia due to move to quad-core Arm-based chips well ahead of the competition, the addition of Icera’s technology will make it a formidable competitor in tablets, smartphones and new growth segments such as in-car systems.
470;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-05-10T01:54:34Z;Nvidia buys UK’s Icera for $367m;;Nvidia, the US chipmaker, on Monday announced a $367m cash deal to buy privately held UK rival Icera.The deal will allow Nvidia to compete better with Qualcomm and Intel in the growing market for smartphone chips.The sale of the Bristol-based chip company will also come as a relief to the European venture capital community, which has invested heavily in the company. VC companies including Amadeus Capital Partners, Atlas Ventures, Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and DFJ Esprit have poured about $250m into the company since it was founded in 2002. It has been one of the biggest recent investments in a European semiconductor start-up.“It was such an iconic investment, if that had gone wrong, we would have been in real trouble,” said Hermann Hauser, founder of Amadeus Capital Partners.However, the sale price is a far cry from the $1bn stock market flotation that Stan Boland, Icera’s chief executive and co-founder, had originally envisioned for the company.“It is hard to be a small company innovating in the mobile space because it is a big boys’ game,” said Mr Boland, a serial entrepreneur. Being part of a large company such as Nvidia, he said, would give Icera the credibility it needed.“We were aiming for an IPO for quite a long time but it is more important to make sure we can be successful for the long term.”Mr Boland said he expected to remain running the Icera business for “several more years”.Icera’s top management owned 20 per cent of the company and should receive more than $73m from the sale. This adds to the already considerable wealth amassed by Mr Boland and his co-founder Simon Knowles when they sold a previous chip company, Element 14, to Broadcom for $594m in 2000.Icera, which makes an innovative type of radio chip for mobile broadband dongles and smartphones, is potentially a challenger to large US companies such as Qualcomm and Intel.Its products had been approved for use by more than 50 mobile phone operators, including Orange, Vodafone and AT&T. However, it has struggled to secure deals in the mobile handset market and was yet to generate any cash.The acquisition of Icera allows Nvidia to consolidate its already strong position in smartphones and tablets.It made a breakthrough with its Tegra processor, which now powers some of the best-known tablets in the market, as well as the “super phones” such as the LG Optimus 2X and Motorola Atrix 4G.
471;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-05-05T18:50:33Z;Intel wants grip on mobile market;;The revolution in chip design announced by Intel this week is being seen as an attempt to see off a threat from Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer, which challenges its dominance in microprocessors.The world’s biggest chipmaker by sales on Wednesday unveiled a breakthrough 3D structure for its next-generation processors that the US company estimated could give it a three-year lead over competitors.Intel already has 80.8 per cent of the PC processor market, compared with 18.9 per cent for its rival AMD, according to figures released on Thursday by IDC, the research firm.However, it has failed to produce chips power-efficient enough for use in mobile phones and tablet computers, where Arm-based chips dominate.In particular, Apple’s iPhone and iPad handheld devices have used chips based on Arm’s designs, rather than Intel’s.Arm is also moving into Intel’s core PC market. IDC predicted that more than 13 per cent of PC processors would be based on Arm’s architecture by 2015.However, with Intel’s new design promising to cut power consumption in half compared with its current generation, a breakthrough into phones should be nearer.The design’s introduction on chips with circuit widths of 22 billionths of a metre will go into mass production later this year.“We’ve been asking what’s your road map to get into cell phones?” said Len Jelinek, semiconductor manufacturing analyst at iSuppli, the research firm.Lee Simpson, semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said: “This is Intel starting to advance into mobile.”As early as next year, he said, customers such as Apple could be considering Intel chips for their devices.Arm, however, made light of the threat. “There is no real surprise in the announcement,” said Ian Drew, executive vice-president of marketing at Arm. “3D technology has been talked about for a decade.“Yes, Intel is the first to announce it, but there are lots of people following them quite quickly. We also need to wait and see how these chips will work in practice,” said Mr Drew.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a pivotal manufacturer for Intel rivals Qualcomm, Nvidia, and others, said its chips would remain competitive with Intel’s even though it would not use 3D transistors until the 14-nanometre generation arrived.The company said that while Intel would have more powerful transistors as a result of its new design, TSMC’s chips would have better interconnections and higher transistor density such that, “in terms of overall performance we won’t lag behind Intel”.Shang-Yi Chiang, vice-president of research and development, said TSMC had worked on 3D transistors since 2003.“If anyone is going to push Moore’s law to the furthest, TSMC will be there,” he said.Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies, said that to rival Arm-based chips, Intel may have to wait an extra generation and a further two years, when it can shrink circuitry to 14-nanometre widths.“As far as being competitive with Arm, I think the 22nm generation may be close to par but maybe not at par and will certainly not be enough reason to uproot the established architecture,” he says.“When it gets to the 14nm generation, it may have enough of an edge that the device makers and carriers will look at that.”Arm shares fell 7.3 per cent on Wednesday on speculation about the Intel announcement.They rebounded by nearly 3 per cent on Thursday. Many analysts took the view that Intel’s advance posed little immediate threat.A bigger loser was Soitec, a French semiconductor maker that pioneered an alternative technology for dealing with increasingly small-sized chips.Soitec shares have fallen more than 9 per cent since Wednesday.
472;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-25T20:50:28Z;Weaker earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street receded slightly from the strong gains seen last week after a string of disappointing earnings reports from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson Controls.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, released particularly lacklustre earnings, reporting a 9 per cent fall in first-quarter net income as higher raw material costs ate into its profitability.The company also revised up its estimate of input inflation for the rest of the year in response to the rising price of pulp, oil and resin. This worried investors, pushing the stock down 2.7 per cent to $64.24, amid wider unease over the effect of rising commodity costs on margins.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest makers of processors for personal computers, reported that profits had more than doubled to $510m, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter.But investors were a little disappointed by the news, and the stock lost 0.1 per cent to $8.70. This was largely because expectations for earnings in the tech sector were high after bumper earnings results from Intel, Apple, IBM and Qualcomm in the previous week. AMD added 5.3 per cent last week as sentiment jumped for such stocks.These results left the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 1,335.26 at the close, paring some of the sharp gains on Wall Street in the previous week.Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 80 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.This week, 181 S&P companies will report their earnings, setting the tone for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 12,479.88, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,825.88 in the session. The broadly negative sentiment was offset by the news that new family home sales rebounded 11.1 per cent to 300,000 in March from the previous month. This was higher than expected but “still miserable in absolute terms”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Volumes were very low as many markets around the world were closed for Easter Monday and investors were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on US monetary policy.“People are waiting to see what is going to happen with the Fed, but my expectation is that there will not be much news,” said Timothy Holland, portfolio manager of the Aston/Tamro Diversified Equity Fund.“Core inflation has not moved dramatically, and employment and gross domestic product are still not that great, so the Fed will likely just continue to be supportive,” he said.In corporate news, Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, reported profit up 29 per cent in the first quarter as volume growth helped offset its higher costs. But investors were hoping for more and the stock was down 2.8 per cent to $39.60.RadioShack, the cons­umer-electronics chain, reported first-quarter earnings down 30 per cent and lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 10 cents a share. Earnings were affected by lower margins, weakness in its T-Mobile business and the expense of rolling out its branded wireless kiosks in Target stores. But the stock was still up 0.1 per cent to $15.85.Polycom, the maker of video conferencing equipment, said its first-quarter earnings had risen more than sixfold. Its shares were up 12.6 per cent to $58.43.In deal news, Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold producer, announced a C$7.3bn cash offer for Equinox Minerals, the Australian-Canadian copper miner. This sent shares in Barrick down 6.8 per cent to $51.86, while shares in Equinox Minerals added 10.5 per cent to $8.74. Equinox is already the target of a hostile offer by China’s Minmetals Resources. Barrick offered C$8.15 a share, compared with Minmetals’ C$7.NYSE Euronext said it was set to increase its forecast for cost savings by up to a third from a deal with Deutsche Börse, in a further effort to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Shares in NYSE were down 0.7 per cent to $38.76 while Nasdaq and ICE were down 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, to $27.23 and $122.
473;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
474;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-24T16:13:22Z;Emerging markets boost US chip industry;;The US chip industry is looking forward to a strong second half of the year after shaking off the effects of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, weak economic conditions and gloomy analyst predictions.The tablet segment is not cannibalising the PC market to the extent many feared, while increased corporate buying and the strength of demand in emerging markets have been highlighted by semiconductor companies reporting earnings in the past week.“Emerging markets are now over 50 per cent of unit volume,” said Tom Kilroy, head of sales at Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.“That’s kind of off the radar screen for a lot of analysts.”IDC and Gartner, the research groups, this month reported a decline in PC sales in the first quarter and predicted growth this year of 6 and 11 per cent respectively. But Intel expects 13-15 per cent growth, with more than 400m PCs sold worldwide. It says the research groups are missing a lot of sales by local manufacturers and lesser known brands in emerging markets.Intel reported first-quarter sales and made second-quarter forecasts well ahead of Wall Street estimates last week, while rival AMD also reported “great traction” in emerging markets and this “white box” arena.Consumer demand in the US and Europe, where economic conditions are still difficult, was reported to have been “soft” by Intel and AMD as the public opted for tablet devices or delayed purchases. However, other mature markets, such as Australia and Korea, were seeing strong PC sales, as were China and Brazil, the number two and three markets for PC sales this year.Emerging markets are maturing to the extent that higher priced PCs, smartphones and tablets are selling well.“There were concerns when we moved towards emerging markets, but people there are buying higher-end devices,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, in a Financial Times interview after the leading mobile phone chipmaker raised its forecast for average selling prices for phones this year by $9 to $199-$209.Corporate purchases are also helping the industry. Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, said the prospects looked good for sales of PCs – combining its latest processors and Windows 7 – in the second and third quarters. He said a replacement cycle was under way with 75 per cent of enterprise PCs still running two-generations-old Windows XP.The effect of the disaster in Japan on consumer demand and the supply chain for PCs and mobile devices appeared to have been slight, according to Intel and Qualcomm, with little impact on sales and no effect on supplies.
475;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-21T20:30:41Z;Dow Jones hits 33-month high;;A slew of strong earnings reports from big industry names such as Apple and General Electric helped boost Wall Street for another session and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 33-month high.Apple’s second-quarter results blew past forecasts, with the company posting a 95 per cent jump in earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. The technology giant reported earnings of $5.99bn in the quarter, or $6.40 a share, sharply ahead of the $5.37 expected by analysts.The results were helped by strong sales in iPhones and Mac computers, but the company said that it was struggling to produce enough of its latest version of the iPad to meet demand. Shares in the company closed up 2.4 per cent to $350.69 on Thursday.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Qualcomm climbed 3 per cent to $56.94 after the world’s leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales reported second-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share, exceeding the 80 cents expected by analysts.The company also raised its 2011 forecasts significantly as it eyed an expansion into tablets, e-readers and home consumer electronics.These bumper results pushed the S&P technology index up 1 per cent, adding to the 2.4 per cent jump the previous session following similarly strong results from Intel and IBM.This led Wall Street higher on Thursday, helping the S&P 500 index close 0.5 per cent higher at 1,337.38 in low volume trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,505.84, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,820.16.The S&P 500 and the Dow were both up 1.3 per cent over the week.Sentiment was held back slightly after the Philadelphia Fed announced that its index of regional business activity fell to 18.5 in April, down from 43.4 in March and below the 35 expected. Separately, the number of weekly jobless claims declined, but by less than expected, and the previous week’s figures were revised up.In the industrial sector, General Electric beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 15 cents, the third dividend increase in the last year.But investors had been hoping for even more and the stock was down 2.2 per cent to $19.95. The stock had been up 1.8 per cent on the week before the results as sentiment in the industrial sector was higher following strong results from other key players.In the previous session, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, reported forecast-beating earnings while Eaton and Honeywell also reported strong results.Looking to the financial sector, shares in Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $26.48 after the investment bank also reported forecast-beating quarterly results. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding some items, were 46 cents a share, compared with the 40 cents expected by analysts.While the results beat expectations, in absolute terms they were less impressive. MorganStanley reported a 48 per cent drop in first-quarter profits as its joint brokerage venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group posted a $1.8bn annual loss and revenue from fixed-income trading fell by a third.Earnings results so far for the financial sector have been mixed. Goldman Sachs reported strong results on Tuesday, powered by strong revenues from its investing and lending divisions. But other results from Wells Fargo and Bank of America have been more disappointing, with results weighed down by troubled mortgage operations.Elsewhere on Wall Street, F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 7.2 per cent to $106.87 after reporting a 68 per cent boost to second-quarter profit and raising its earnings forecast for the current quarter above analysts’ expectations.Shares in McDonald’s fell 1.9 per cent to $76.91 after the restaurant chain warned that higher food costs could cut into margins, while its earnings came in ahead of analysts’ estimates with an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Verizon Communications slid 2.3 per cent to $36.91 after its first-quarter profit more than tripled, but its average revenue per user rose by less than analysts had expected.
476;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-20T23:21:57Z;Smartphones fuel Qualcomm record;;Qualcomm reported record quarterly revenues and raised its guidance for the year as global demand for smartphones and tablets grew.Paul Jacobs, chief executive said in an interview: “The world is coming our way, everyone wants smartphones, tablets and other mobile computing devices“.The leading wireless chipmaker by sales reported sales and profits ahead of Wall Street expectations for its second quarter ending in March – revenues of $3.9bn were up 46 per cent on a year ago and were ahead of the analyst consensus of $3.6bn, according to Thomson Reuters. Excluding some costs, profits of 86 cents a share beat the street’s 80-cents expectation.After closing 3.5 per cent higher in New York, Qualcomm shares rose another 5 per cent to $58 in after-hours trading.Mr Jacobs dismissed concerns that average selling prices of phones might fall – along with Qualcomm’s share from licensing fees and the chips inside – as demand grew in emerging markets.He said: “People there are buying higher-end devices as well,” he said, pointing to Qualcomm raising its 2011 guidance for phone average selling prices from $190-$200 to $199-$209.In its home market, Apple reported on Wednesday that US iPhone shipments were up 155 per cent on a year ago, with a version featuring Qualcomm chips and sold by Verizon Wireless playing a key role.Qualcomm shut down its FLO TV business at the end of the quarter as the mobile TV service failed to make an impact in the US. It recorded $310m in restructuring costs for the quarter, but said it had sold the spectrum that FLO TV used for $1.9bn.The San Diego-based company also raised its guidance for revenues and profits in its 2011 year – from a midpoint of $13.9bn in revenues to $14.4bn and from profits of $2.98 a share to $3.09.Mr Jacobs said supply-chain concerns stemming from the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan had not affected Qualcomm’s ability to make chips and it had seen very little impact on demand for its products.Meanwhile, Freescale, a chipmaker whose factory at Sendai in Japan was badly damaged in the earthquake, said on Wednesday it was taking a $90m charge in its first quarter related to its closure. The facility was due to close this year and no attempts have been made to reopen it.

478;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Texas Instruments profits dip with quake impact;;Texas Instruments reported lower profits and revenues than expected as it became the first major chipmaker to report the effect of the Japan earthquake on earnings.Two of TI’s three Japanese factories were damaged in the disaster and it warned on Monday that the biggest impact on revenues would take place in the second quarter.“We will only be operating with partial output at our factories there,” said Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, on an analyst conference call. “Our Japanese customers are still in the early stages of restarting their own factories and we and our customers may face potential supply-chain disruption.”The Dallas-based company reported first-quarter revenues of $3.39bn and profits of $666m, or 55 cents per share, after the market closed. This was below Wall Street expectations of profits of 58 cents a share on revenues of $3.40bn. TI shares fell 2.4 per cent to $33.95 in New York in after-hours trading.TI said both the quake and weaker demand for its wireless baseband chips used in mobile phones had hit sales, although new orders were strong.“We expect growth in the second quarter, though it will be pressured by the situation in Japan,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive. “Provided consumer and enterprise demand remain strong, we expect a good second half of the year.”TI earlier this month announced its biggest acquisition in more than a decade, a $6.5bn all-cash deal for Silicon Valley’s National Semiconductor.The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, reports first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and Advanced Micro Devices on Thursday.
479;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-11T15:01:43Z;Intel unveils first chip for tablets;;Intel is launching its first chip designed for tablet computers in an attempt to wrest control of the fast-growing market from UK-based Arm, whose chip architecture is now behind the majority of smartphones and tablets.The world’s biggest chipmaker will on Tuesday announce the availability of “Oak Trail”, the first product released by its newly-formed “netbooks and tablets” group, at a conference in Beijing. Intel expects more than 35 devices to be using Oak Trail starting from May, including ones from Fujitsu and Lenovo.While Intel has long dominated the market for processors in desktop and notebook computers, it has yet to make significant headway in supplying chips for smartphones and tablets – devices now having an impact on demand for traditional PCs.It had unsucessfully tried to enter the smartphone market last year with a chip codenamed “Moorestown”. Not a single smartphone company chose to use Intel’s chip, which was considered too large and power-hungry.Doug Davis, general manager of the new group, on Monday said the new chip would deliver “architectural enhancements for longer battery life and greater performance”.Smartphone sales are this year expected to increase by half and tablet shipments nearly quadruple, according to analysts. By contrast, PC shipments are expected to increase by only about 10 per cent compared with last year.The problem for Intel is that most smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhone and iPad, are powered by chips based on Arm’s architecture and designed by a variety of companies such as Qualcomm, Nvidia, Samsung, and Marvell.“[Intel] knows perfectly well that the . . . tablet market is being defined right now. And if the company doesn’t become a player immediately, its prospects of getting into the market in the future will only grow dimmer,” said Matt Wilkins, principal analyst at iSuppli.Intel concedes that it is late to the market in supplying chips for tablets, but says there is still time to catch up. “We don’t see [competition in the tablet market] as a 100m dash. It’s a marathon …this is the beginning of the beginning,” George Chacko, platform marketing manager at Intel, said.Intel is hoping to do so by delivering quicker technical advances than the rest of the industry. It aims to accelerate the rate it introduces new processors, with each new version being smaller, cheaper and using less power, to three within the next three years.Intel’s new chip may also have a broader impact on the tablet industry, according to Philip Winslow, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “Oak Trail” will be “critical to the medium-term success” of any tablet using the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system by helping to extend the battery life of a Windows-based tablet from about 5 hours to 7.5 hours. Windows is not widely used in tablets now because it is not optimised for tablets and uses a lot of power.But Gartner expects Apple – which uses an Arm-based processor manufactured by Samsung – to still claim nearly half of the global tablet market even by 2015.In smartphones, Intel is now pinning its hopes onto a next-generation chip, named Medfield, to be launched later this year.
480;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-04-04T23:20:04Z;Texas Instruments in $6.5bn deal for Nat Semi;;Texas Instruments announced its biggest deal in more than a decade with the $6.5bn all-cash acquisition of Silicon Valley’s National Semiconductor.Dallas-based TI said on Monday that the move would strengthen its market leadership in analogue chips, which carry out functions such as power management, amplification and convert audio and video to digital signals in phones and media players.The deal is topped by the $7.4bn that TI paid for another analogue chipmaker, Burr-Brown, in June 2000 – its biggest ever buy.TI said it would pay $25 a share for National Semi, representing a 78 per cent premium to its closing price on Monday.TI shares fell 2 per cent to $33.42 in after-hours trading on the news, while Nat Semi’s were up 74 per cent at $24.47.“This acquisition is about strength and growth,” said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive, in a statement. “National has an excellent development team and its products combined with our own can offer customers an analogue portfolio of unmatched depth and breadth.”Mr Templeton predicted strong returns on the investment, with a combined sales team, 10 times larger than National’s, able to accelerate growth.Both boards of directors unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close in six to nine months. TI plans to fund it with a combination of existing cash balances and debt.Mr Templeton told an analyst conference call that both parties were confident the deal would gain regulatory approval because of the depth of competition in a still-fragmented analogue market.Kevin March, TI chief financial officer, said it had existing cash balances of $3.1bn and with National Semi’s $900m, he expected to borrow $3bn-$4bn to complete the transaction. About $100m a year in cost savings have been identified.The Texas chipmaker has lost its position as the world’s leading wireless chipmaker to Qualcomm in recent years, but has been focusing more on analogue, offering 30,000 analogue products and operating the world’s first analogue factory based on the latest 300mm-diameter silicon wafers.National has manufacturing operations in Maine, Scotland and Malaysia.The addition of National’s portfolio will give TI 12,000 more analogue products and a strong position in the industrial power market.TI said the market for analogue semiconductors was worth $42bn last year, with TI being the market leader with revenues of $6bn or 14 per cent of the market. Adding National’s $1.6bn in revenues last year gives it a 17 per cent market share and sales of analogue chips will become almost 50 per cent of TI’s revenues.
481;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-30T00:19:31Z;AT&T bid for T-Mobile USA probed;;Opposition to AT&T’s proposed $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA grew as New York’s attorney-general launched a review of the deal, citing its “potentially anticompetitive impact”, while rural mobile operators asked federal regulators to block AT&T’s pending $1.93bn purchase of spectrum from Qualcomm.Eric Schneiderman, New York attorney-general, said that in creating the nation’s largest wireless company with 130m subscribers, the deal was “opening the door to a near duopoly shared by the merged firm and Verizon“. He said the proposed merger would be investigated, “for potential anticompetitive impacts on consumers and businesses across New York state”.While Mr Schneiderman is the first state official to announce an investigation into the AT&T deal, other states’ attorneys-general are expected to follow suit. The transaction requires the approval of the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission and will probably be the subject of hearings in Congress.The New York attorney-general could block the deal, according to Rich Brosnick, an antitrust legal expert with the firm of Butzel Long, as the states and federal government both have authority over antitrust matters.Meanwhile, the Washington-based Rural Cellular Association, which represents nearly 100 rural and regional telecommunications network operators in the US, told the Federal Communications Commission that it should delay AT&T’s proposed acquisition of the Qualcomm spectrum.“AT&T is on a spectrum buying binge, including both this Qualcomm acquisition and the recent announcement that it will acquire T-Mobile,” said Steven Berry, the association’s chief executive.“These actions are further proof that AT&T is doing everything possible to strengthen its already dominant position in the wireless industry at the expense of competition.”Mr Schneiderman’s comments and those of Mr Berry came a day after Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator, called on US regulators to block the deal and highlighted the growing opposition to the transaction from those who believe it will curb competition.“There is no way to separate the competitive impact of these transactions,” Mr Berry said. “The FCC must evaluate the combined impact of this transaction and the AT&T/T-Mobile proposed merger and ultimately deny the request based on the actual harms to competition.”Mr Schneiderman said, “Cell phones are no longer a luxury for a few among us, but a basic necessity.” The attorney-general stressed that market conditions differ across the state and highlighted the potential impact of the merger in cities such as Rochester, Albany, Buffalo and Syracuse where there are already fewer wireless options than in New York City.He added that he planned to “closely scrutinise AT&T’s argument that the merger has the potential to produce some benefits, such as expanding the coverage of AT&T’s next-generation broadband wireless network to rural areas in upstate New York that are underserved and have poor wired broadband connectivity”.AT&T said, “We look forward to sharing information with the attorney-general’s office and remain excited about the significant consumer and competition benefits that this transaction will provide, including improved customer service and expanded high-speed LTE wireless coverage to additional residents and areas across New York state and the rest of the US.”T-Mobile USA is a unit of Deutsche Telekom.
482;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-28T14:18:38Z;Lenovo joins tablet war with LePad;;When Lenovo, the world’s fourth-largest PC vendor, launched its tablet computer on Monday night, the world was not invited.The company treated Chinese media to a lavish party in Shanghai, and the LePad – a device with a 10.1-inch screen powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor – went on sale in China only. And yet, some industry experts see the Chinese company, under Yang Yuanqing, chief executive, as the most likely future rival for Apple in the global tablet market.Manish Nigam, head of Asia technology research at Credit Suisse, said Lenovo might be the best positioned among the new tablet vendors because of its dominant position in China. The company has a 30 per cent share in the world’s second-largest and fastest-growing PC market.“Lenovo is well-placed to make its tablet work. They have been a good engineering company,” said Mr Nigam. “Acer relies too much on [outsourced design and manufacturing], and Asus lacks global scale.”According to IDC, the technology research company, 18m tablet devices were sold worldwide last year, with Apple accounting for 83 per cent. This year, most forecasts expect the market to more than double to at least 40m units.Kirk Yang, head of non-Japan Asian hardware technology research at Barclays Capital, said he expected Apple’s market share to slide to about 72 per cent this year and named Lenovo, Samsung, RIM and Acer as strong candidates for grabbing at least 10 per cent each of the remaining market.Lenovo’s focus on China, which will make it a late-comer in other markets, is expected to be the group’s biggest strength. “When it comes to tablets, what matters is software, not hardware,” said Mr Yang. “Lenovo’s strength is that they have a Chinese interface and Chinese applications.”This follows Lenovo’s successful start in the mobile products segment with the LePhone, which sells well to Chinese consumers who are affluent enough to afford a smartphone but do not read English and want a wide range of homegrown applications.At Rmb3,499 ($532), the LePad is more expensive than the cheapest iPad, which is available from Rmb2,888 in China. But many Chinese consumers are more likely to compare Lenovo’s tablet with the iPad 2. Apple’s latest product has not officially started selling in China, but grey market imports are available from Rmb5,000.Analysts also believe that Lenovo’s strategy of launching its mobile products in China first gives the company a valuable testing ground. LG, the South Korean technology group, failed with this strategy for its handset business, but observers expect it to work for Lenovo because the Chinese market is so much bigger than Korea.
483;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Wall St rises as fears over Japan ease;;The telecommunications sector was shaken by news that AT&T will buy T-Mobile USA, while elsewhere on Wall Street sentiment improved as concerns over Japan’s nuclear crisis eased.AT&T announced on Sunday that it was buying T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that will create the largest wireless carrier in the US. Shares in AT&T were up 1.2 per cent to $28.26.The news sent Sprint Nextel, the No 3 US carrier, tumbling 13.6 per cent to $4.36. Sprint was itself in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, and this surprise deal with AT&T pulled the rug out from underneath it.The telecoms sector as a whole had a mixed reaction to the news. Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telecoms group by revenues, was up 1.7 per cent to $36.46 but Qwest Communications International fell 3.4 per cent to $6.69. Overall, The S&P telecommunications index was down 0.2 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,298.38, aided by news over the weekend that engineers had managed to cool down some of the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,036.53, up 3.6 per cent in the last three sessions, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8 per cent to 2,692.09. The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 15.2 per cent in the session, although it is still up 25.7 since its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.The improving situation in Japan lifted some insurance stocks as worries eased somewhat over the extent of their liabilities. Hartford Financial Services Group was up 3.9 per cent to $26.49 while American International Group added 6 per cent to $37.03.The gains for AIG came despite an announcement that its bill for the damage caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami will be at least $700m.The KBW property casualty index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 2 per cent losses last week.Semiconductor stocks also rose as fears over supply constraints resulting from the Japan disaster receded. “Our most recent checks suggest the supply worst-case scenario likely has been averted,” wrote analysts at Citigroup.Applied Materials was up 2.5 per cent to $15.21 while Cirrus Logic added 4.9 per cent to $20.95.Qualcomm, the world’s largest producer of mobile-phone chips, rose 3.7 per cent to $53.63, also helped by news that Sterne Agee & Leach had raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.8 per cent, bouncing back from the 2 per cent loss seen last week.The industrial sector rallied from its 1.7 per cent loss last week as Japanese tensions eased. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, added 2.4 per cent to $19.72 while 3M put on 2.2 per cent to $90.95.The previous week saw heavy volatility on fears of a nuclear catastrophe in Japan. In the first three days, the S&P 500 lost 3.2 per cent and the Vix volatility index spiked up 46.4 per cent. The markets then rallied somewhat on Thursday and Friday to close only 1.9 per cent lower over the week.Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial said that markets had been trying to get “back to normal” on Friday but were constrained as traders worried about potential bad news over the weekend.“When nothing major happened in Japan over the weekend, the upward momentum was able to take over and lift equities on Monday,” said Mr Warren.Energy stocks benefited from an oil price jump in the session following the bombing of Libya over the weekend and warnings from Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, of a “long, drawn-out war”.Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was up 4.4 per cent to $89.72 while Marathon Oil added 4.4 per cent to $51.84. The wider markets appeared unperturbed by the rise in energy prices.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Tiffany & Co was up 5.1 per cent to $60.22 after reporting fourth-quarter profits up 29 per cent, beating market expectations.The jewellery group, which gets 18 per cent of its revenue from Japan, fell 9.3 per cent last week following the disaster.
484;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
485;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Multinationals warn over Japanese supplies;;Multinational companies in several sectors are warning of supply-chain disruptions, after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan.General Motors became the first international group to announce a direct impact on production after the disasters. The US carmaker announced that it would halt output from Monday at an assembly plant in Louisiana due to a shortage of parts from Japan. The company said it had sufficient vehicles to meet customer demand.Sony Ericsson, the smartphone joint venture between Japan’s Sony and Sweden’s Ericsson, said the earthquake would affect its supply chain and German carmaker Volkswagen warned of a possible medium-term components shortage.One person close to Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, said it anticipated disruption to its supply chain. The company declined to comment. In 2010, 15 per cent of the components in its handsets were sourced in yen.Sony Ericsson said: “Although the full impact of the current situation on our business will take additional time to assess, [we] anticipate disruption to [our] supply-chain operations.”The company is trying to source alternative components from manufacturers outside Japan. It faces a ­further problem as the country is one of its important sales markets.iSuppli, an analyst firm, said that some Apple components, including flash memory and a thin battery used in the iPad 2 tablet, came from Japan and it warned that the company might “have difficulties obtaining this battery, and it may not be able to secure supply from an external, non-Japanese source”.Apple declined to comment. Most flash manufacturing facilities are in regions not yet affected by the quake and tsunami but problems with power, transport or other issues could affect supply for the iPad 2.Martin Winterkorn, VW’s chief executive, would not rule out that Europe’s top-selling carmaker could be hit by supply shortages in the next few weeks.“We are worried and we have to monitor this every day,” he said, adding that VW saw no near-term supply problems.Mr Winterkorn said the group was concerned about its Japan-sourced gearboxes as its Japanese supplier faced repeated power disruption at its plants.Gary Lynch, head of supply-chain risk management at Marsh Risk Consulting, said most disruption would not come from the physical destruction of production facilities, but from transport problems and a lack of energy supply. “A multinational company should [assume] its business [will be] severely disrupted for an extended period.” He said the high-tech, automotive and steel industries would be hit first.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline group, said there might be some “pinch points” in supply chains in Japan, with “some effect” on automotive and high-tech production.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by sales, and Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for phones, said the earthquake would not hurt production. Motorola Mobility and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, said they saw little or no impact on their supply chains.Additional reporting by Bernard Simon in Toronto and Joseph Menn in San Francisco
486;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
487;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-16T21:48:22Z;Imagination falls despite upbeat forecast;;"Imagination Technologies, whose graphics chip designs feature in Apple’s iPad 2, said it would exceed its full-year target of shipping 200m chips as it continued to benefit from demand for smartphones and tablet computers.The Hertfordshire-based chip designer, which competes with companies such as Qualcomm and Arm, said it expected the number of chips shipped by its customers in the second half of the year to “comfortably” surpass the 107m shipped in the first six months. “As a result the full-year volume is expected to exceed the previously set target of 200m by some margin,” it said.But the upgrade, widely expected by the market, failed to impress investors and the shares fell 6.9 per cent to 430.8p, as analysts questioned where new growth would come from and how much further the stock had to run.Imagination , which sells its chip designs to manufacturers and then collects royalties once those designs are put into products, has benefited from the jump in demand for internet-enabled smartphones, triggered by the launch of Apple’s 3G iPhone.Ian Robertson, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said that while he continued to hold the group’s video and graphics business “in high regard”, Imagination was also investing in other areas, such as WiFi and integrated television chips, that had a chance of success “but were far from guaranteed”.There was also disappointment as Imagination said revenues from its Pure digital radio arm were likely to be lower than last year due to the tough retail environment.FT CommentImagination shares have risen about 85 per cent in the past year as investors bet that the group’s graphics chips would feature in a growing array of smartphone, tablet and other internet-connected devices. Recent contract wins with companies such as ST-
Ericsson and Taiwan’s MediaTek, which makes chipsets used to produce cheap mobile phones, have fed into the share price.The concern now is how long the smartphone boom lasts and whether revenue from licensing and royalties warrant Imagination’s current valuation.Hossein Yassaie, chief executive, is wise to look beyond Imagination’s core graphics and video chips base, but Pure continues to disappoint and the recent US acquisitions of Caustic Graphics and Hello­Soft will take time to bear fruit. Add to that jitters about what impact the Japanese earthquake will have on supply chains, and the stock looks overpriced at 53 times prospective earnings for 2011, falling to 37 times for 2012."
488;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-03-16T21:34:12Z;Wall Street hit by overseas tensions;;Concern over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan and heightened tensions in Bahrain led Wall Street lower for its third consecutive session, with technology and industrial stocks suffering from the sharpest losses.The markets began the day without much direction, but news that Günther Oettinger, the European Union energy chief, had said that the nuclear situation in Japan was “effectively out of control” and that there could be “catastrophic events within hours” led the S&P 500 to tumble over 1.6 per cent within minutes before lunch on Wall Street.These fears left the S&P index down 2 per cent to 1,256.88 at the close, adding to the 1.1 per cent fall on Tuesday and bringing the total losses for the week so far to 3.6 per cent. The index is on track for the heaviest weekly decline in seven months.The S&P 500 index has fallen 6.4 per cent since its mid-February highs, with the feared effects of the Japanese disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies from the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The benchmark index is down 0.1 per cent this year, the first time it has strayed into negative territory.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, jumped up 19.4 per cent to an eight-month high on the comments by the EU energy chief.The Vix index is now up 77.1 per cent from its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.IBM and Apple saw some of the sharpest losses in the session due to supply worries following the earthquake in Japan and analysts downgrades on both stocks.Analysts at Citigroup said that one of the biggest risks to hardware companies such as IBM and Apple was supply constraints following the disaster in Japan. These constraints, it said, “could be meaningfully disruptive during the next couple of quarters”.“Apple could be the most challenged out of all the companies in our hardware universe,” said the note. “Apple derives roughly 8 per cent of the total operating income from Japan, but more importantly, the already tight supply of iPhones and iPads could get much worse.”Apple was down 4.5 per cent to $330.01, also weighed down by news that JMP Securities had lowered its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. IBM fell 3.8 per cent to $153, also suffering from a downgrade.Elsewhere in the sector Qualcomm, a leading mobile phone chipmaker, was down 4.7 per cent to $50.50 while SanDisk, which makes flash memory cards, lost 3.7 per cent to $42.09.The S&P information technology sector fell 2.7 per cent.Many strategists were still saying that the recent losses could present a buying opportunity. Robert Sluymer at RBC Capital Markets said the current pullback will continue to “present timely long-side entry points on a wide range of names over the coming days and weeks.”Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said that this was a good time to buy depressed stocks, but also to hedge against risk due to the upturn in volatility.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2 per cent to 11,613.30 with all 30 components losing ground, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9 per cent lower to 2,616.82.Looking at industrial stocks, General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, was down 3.4 per cent to $18.95 adding to the 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.Elsewhere 3M was 2.2 per cent lower to $87.55 while Honeywell declined 2.2 per cent to $54.33. The S&P industrial sector dropped by 2 per cent.Housing stocks lost ground after data showing that home construction had tumbled in February to its lowest level in nearly two years.The number of housing starts fell 22.5 per cent from the previous month to 479,000 in a further indication of weakness in the US housing market.Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, was down 2.2 per cent to $20.41 while Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, fell 2.9 per cent to $19.12.“While February’s result may overstate the case somewhat, the underlying trend of single-family housing starts shows no signs of improving in a significant manner anytime soon,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Coal mining stocks were some of the few to see gains in the session on hopes that a backlash against nuclear energy would spur on demand for coal.Peabody Energy was up 3.9 per cent to $67.67 while Consol Energy added 1.7 per cent to $52.38.
489;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-02-21T23:03:40Z;CSR shares dive as it agrees Zoran deal;;Shares in CSR fell sharply after the Cambridge-based chipmaker agreed a $679m (£418m) deal to buy Zoran, a US imaging and video technology group.The deal is an effort on CSR’s part to diversify in the face of stiff competition from the likes of Qualcomm and Broadcom in the US.Following the all-share deal, which is billed as a merger, CSR shareholders would hold 65 per cent of the enlarged company. Zoran shareholders would receive 1.85 ordinary shares of CSR in the form of American Depositary Shares for each Zoran share held.CSR also said it would return up to $240m to shareholders via a share buy-back programme. But CSR shares closed down almost 10 per cent at 392p as analysts and investors said it had overpaid – the price is a 40 per cent premium to Zoran’s closing price last Friday – and questioned the merits of bringing two lossmaking companies together.Zoran made a pre-tax loss of $33.3m in 2010, on sales of $357m. CSR made a loss of $5.7m on sales of $800m in the same period. Industry experts said the stock could have fallen further had CSR not sweetened the deal with the share buy-back.Zoran has $261m of cash on its balance sheet, giving the company an implied enterprise value of $418m.Ramius, a hedge fund, recently called on Zoran to replace its board, arguing that the Nasdaq-traded group needed to do more to restore growth and profitability.CSR said that the deal with Zoran would allow it to expand into internet-enabled, location-aware products such as digital cameras and home entertainment products.CSR was an early leader in Bluetooth chips but lost ground to bigger competitors after it failed to take advantage of the boom in demand for internet-enabled smartphones.Joep van Beurden, chief executive, said the company had already outlined a number of measures to take market share in smartphones, and was making good progress in WiFi chips for cars.He said the chipmaker – which last month settled a long-running legal case with Broadcom over the use of technology for GPS – would also consider other acquisitions in adjacent sectors such as audio or mobile payments once the deal was finalised.Mr van Beurden, CSR’s chairman and its chief financial officer will all continue in their current roles in the merged company. Levy Gerzberg, co-founder and chief executive of Zoran, will join the CSR board as a non-executive director. Zoran will also propose another independent non-executive director.The deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to save $50m in costs by 2012.JPMorgan Cazenove and Rothschild advised CSR while Goldman Sachs acted for Zoran.

491;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-02-20T20:27:57Z;Developers sceptical of app alliance;;A year ago, a group of the world’s largest phone operators, including Vodafone and China Mobile, announced an initiative at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to create a mobile applications community that would challenge the dominance of Apple’s App Store.The Wholesale Applications Community aimed to make it easier for developers – which currently have to adapt theirs apps and gain approval every time they put their software on a new phone operating system – to build apps regardless of the device.One year on and Peters Suh, chief executive of WAC, announced in Barcelona the commercial launch of a now 68-strong alliance and unveiled new software tools that will allow developers to sell apps that can be sold across devices. Companies including Ericsson, Telefónica and Huawei unveiled new cloud-based stores that will help house apps outside the existing operator-led app stores.But absent from MWC were the developers themselves. In fact developers and analysts remain highly sceptical that WAC is anything more than a talking shop for telecom operators angry that they are not getting a slice of the revenues from a fast-expanding apps community that is dominated by Apple, maker of the iPhone, and Google, whose open source Android operating system is used by 28 handset makers and has its own app store.Gartner, the research group, estimates that 17.7bn apps will be downloaded in 2011, a 117 per cent increase on last year. Revenue from mobile apps is expected to surpass $15.1bn this year, up from $5.2bn in 2010.Yet while many handset operators have their own apps stores, two dominate. Apple’s store, which accompanied the launch of its 3G iPhone in 2008, houses 350,000 apps, while Google says there are 150,000 apps in its Android store.While some argue having a large app store is irrelevant, analysts say it is what helps tie consumers to one handset market over another, particularly if you have paid for the app.Developers, which range in size from large companies to one-man enterprises, make their money from either selling their apps, splitting revenue with an app store, or by taking in app adverts or in-app purchases on games.Adam Leach, principal analyst at Ovum, says coming up with another ecosystem for developers could prove “an uphill struggle” for operators. Apple and Google have established their own app ecosystems and have their own developer programmes. “Collaborations [between telecoms operators] in the past have not been too successful. There is a business intent and common interest but there tends to be a difficulty on agreeing a standard,” says Mr Leach.Developers agree that reconfiguring apps for each new operating system – be it Apple’s iOS platform, Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7, Android or one of the many other platforms – is an unnecessary expense. It requires additional time and labour to rewrite codes that can run into tens of thousands of dollars depending on the complexity of the app. However, developers remain sceptical about WAC’s ability to drive change.“It would be really good if they could make it work,” says Peter Vesterbacka, head of Rovio, the Finnish developer behind the highly successful Angry Birds app. “But I’ve seen many initiatives from operators over the years and none of them have really gone anywhere.”Even with common standards, very complicated apps would still not work easily across platforms, they say. Developers say they have gravitated to Apple and Google’s Android platform because they have a fertile developer community. Involving the telecoms operators will not necessarily improve that experience.
492;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-02-14T23:32:38Z;Chip guys preview mobile future at MWC;;Aside from the flashy phones and tablets unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, chipmakers have been giving us a taste of things to come with announcements on future technologies such as quad-core mobile chips, new user interfaces and breathtaking graphics capabilities.A summary of the news from Qualcomm, Marvell and Nvidia, as well as a note on the serious lack of any major news from Intel, is after the jump.I expected Barcelona to be a major coming-out party for Intel’s smartphone ambitions, but its first-day announcements were run-of-the-mill ones, focused mainly on new wireless chips from its Infineon communications chip acquisition, now renamed Intel Mobile Communications (the deal closed two weeks ago).Intel has of course suffered the setback of Nokia favouring Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 operating system on Friday over MeeGo, which Intel has been jointly developing with its handset partner.Operators and handset makers also appear unenthused with the Atom processors Intel has built for smartphones, compared to the lower power use of ARM-based counterparts.Intel said on Monday it had made samples of its “Medfield” next-generation Atom chip for smartphones and was on course to introduce it this year.However, it would be a surprise now if Paul Otellini, chief executive, announced in his keynote speech on Wednesday that a big-name handset manufacturer with a well-known operating system would be releasing an Atom-based smartphone in the near future.In terms of processing power, the name of the game at MWC is dual-core – a step up from one brain to two brains powering the latest smartphones and tablets. Nvidia is enjoying success with its Tegra 2 chip – it is featured in Motorola’s Atrex phone, which is powerful enough to drive an accompanying laptop accessory. Announcements at the show included Tegra 2’s inclusion in the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and LG Optimus Pad tablet, both of which will run the new Honeycomb version of Android for tablets.But Qualcomm has given us a glimpse of new quad-core processor designs coming next year – code-named Krait, they will be offering “speeds of up to 2.5GHz per core and delivering 150 per cent higher overall performance, as well as 65 per cent lower power than currently available ARM-based CPU cores.”“All chipsets in the family will integrate a quad-combo of connectivity solutions — Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM — and include support for near field communication (NFC), as well as stereoscopic 3D (S3D) video and photo capture and playback.”These will compete with Texas Instruments’ Omap 5 processors in 2012, with TI announcing similar features last week. As ever, the chipmakers cite examples of how users will get higher performance computing capabilities than previous generations – with quad-core and improved graphics will come the ability to watch 3D movies and to beam from a phone and play a fully-featured video game on a big-screen TV.For the nearer term, Qualcomm also demonstrated Snapdragon-based phones running the US movie-streaming service Netflix as an app.The world may not need another mobile user interface, but it has to be said that Kinoma Play introduced by Marvell at MWC has some very attractive features.Kinoma Play is being demonstrated on top of an Android operating system. It is a separate user interface, and so has to be opened as an app itself to reveal the 40 more apps it contains inside its own interface. It could equally be adapted for other operating systems.Apart from its fast response times and attractive screen, with features such as animated icons showing video that’s currently playing, Kinoma Play makes touchscreen devices even more touch friendly. Photos can be zoomed with just a press of the finger and rotated just as easily, a video’s picture quality or a song’s volume can also be adjusted quickly with a press on the screen.Marvell is open-sourcing Kinoma, a recent acquistion for the company, to encourage its adoption by application developers and device manufacturers. It needs to do this to stand a chance of flourishing against competition from the likes of Apple, Google and Microsoft.
493;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-31T00:33:16Z;Speaking in tongues: translation technology comes of age;Online and smartphone technology is making light work of translation;Tech translation tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated – or, as they say in Haitian Creole: “Zouti teknolojik tradiksyon yo vin deplizanpli sofistike.” That last bit comes courtesy of Google Translate rather than my own limited language skills.I have often used Google’s online service website to translate text, copying and pasting news articles in various languages to make some English sense of them.The accuracy of what is produced has improved substantially over time, but nowadays I rarely need to visit it. Using Google’s Chrome web browser, a message appears every time I call up a foreign-language website, identifying it and offering a translated version of the whole page in an instant.When it comes to searching for the mot juste for something being written in French – or German, Spanish or Portuguese, for that matter – Linguee.com is a good option.The service has indexed millions of online translations produced by professionals. Searching for a word or phrase in English brings it up in a column containing numerous examples of the context in which it has been used, such as a paragraph in a legal document or a news report. A second column shows the translation of this paragraph into French or one of the other languages.A pie chart indicates how frequently a particular translation has been used compared with others, which helps narrow down the options to the most apposite phrase. Linguee also offers easy access to its service through Firefox and Internet Explorer search boxes and a Mac dashboard widget.A smartphone app is the obvious choice to replace a phrase book when travelling, and Google has come up trumps again with its Android applications. The latest version of Translate on the phone allows you to speak your phrase in English and see the text appear both in English and in the chosen language on the screen. Tapping on a loudspeaker icon renders the phrase as speech.The app was demonstrated during the keynote speech by Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin in September. A conversation was conducted between an English-speaking “shopper” and a German-speaking “shoe salesman” with the phone as an interlocutor. It was a little stilted – it took three attempts for the spoken German for “What colour do you want?” to be understood and translated properly – but the possibilities were there for all to see.Schmidt said a live simultaneous translation was the next logical step and may happen in the future.Google even has a solution for conversing with objects such as street signs, using the Google Goggles app and a smartphone camera. It allows you to take a picture of the incomprehensible item and then uses optical character recognition technology to figure out the letters and language before it offers a translation.Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker, has shown me a similar app, still in development, that uses an augmented reality technique. When the smartphone camera was pointed at a menu in Korean, its display outlined the choices on the menu and delivered the English translation next to them on the screen as the camera panned across the different items.For the iPhone, Word Lens from Quest Visual is already available and offers similar capabilities in the Latin script, although it is limited at present to displaying English and Spanish.At this rate, we will soon have no need for language learning tools, but there are still plenty of options available on mobile phones and online.Rosetta Stone offers software packages teaching a variety of languages, starting at $200 or more, but has recently launched a $10 iPhone app called Discover French. It features the company’s “Speech Activation” technology, which employs speech recognition to ensure correct pronunciation and build confidence in speaking a foreign language.For those wanting less formal language training, I came across Voxy.com, an online service, at the TechCrunch Disrupt start-up conference held in New York in the autumn.Voxy makes learning a language interesting and topical by showing current news, sports and entertainment stories. For Spanish speakers, a story in English about the actress Salma Hayek contains highlighted words and phrases such as “gave an interview”. Clicking on a highlighted item puts it into a “word bank” to the right of the story, where it can be selected to view an English pronunciation and to see the phrase in Spanish. There is also a quiz to test comprehension of the article.There are other games and challenges to help build vocabulary and understanding, and a “life skills” section presents real-life situations such as opening a bank account. Voxy’s web service should be available soon as iPhone and Android apps.Finally, what better way of learning a language than from a native speaker? Livemocha.com makes this possible with its peer-to-peer language learning.When I last wrote about it about two years ago, it had just passed 1m members. But its website now claims to provide free and paid online lessons in 35 languages to 6m members in 200 countries. Users help each other by correcting writing and pronunciation. They can also produce “flash card” lists of useful words and phrases in their languages. As members review and rate the work of others, they allow them to accumulate points and eventually gain “teacher” status, helping them earn money from online tutoring.LiveMocha has also linked up two educational publishers – Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, and Collins – for language learning content.And that’s a wrap for this personal tech guide for polyglot MBAs, or “das ist ein Umbruch”, as they say in German – courtesy of Linguee.

495;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-27T02:10:37Z;Qualcomm beats forecast as sales soar 25%;;Qualcomm, the leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales, raised its 2011 forecasts significantly on Wednesday as it eyed a significant expansion into tablets, e-readers and consumer electronics in the home.The San Diego-based company reported a record first quarter helped by strong smartphone sales. It raced past Wall Street expectations for its earnings and outlook, prompting its shares to rise more than 6 per cent to $55.07 in after-hours trading.The second-largest US chipmaker after Intel reported that revenues rose 25 per cent year on year to $3.35bn and earnings per share were up 42 per cent at 71 cents. Analysts expected profits of 59 cents a share on sales of $3.2bn, according to a Bloomberg survey.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said Qualcomm had benefited from smartphone unit sales that grew 70 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter and were expected to grow 50 per cent this year.He highlighted US operator Verizon Wireless’s planned launch of an iPhone containing Qualcomm chipsets in February and Microsoft‘s demonstration of the next version of Windows, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, as positive developments for the company.The company said that a dual-core version of Snapdragon with chipsets capable of producing advanced graphics and making 4G connections would increase Qualcomm’s presence in the tablet sector this year.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia has made the running in the sector with its Tegra 2 processor featuring in tablets such as the Motorola Xoom, which will be launched this quarter.Qualcomm announced its biggest acquisition this month – the $3.1bn purchase of chipmaker Atheros.Steve Mollenkopf, executive vice-president, said the deal would mean Qualcomm “could accelerate the extension of our technologies and platforms beyond cellular to computing, consumer electronics and networking”.Qualcomm raised its revenue guidance for its fiscal year ending in September by $1.2bn, with $650m of this driven by an improved outlook for its chip business and $550m due to improving conditions in its licensing business. It said royalties from the latter would benefit from the resolution of a licensing dispute with an unnamed company which had been underpaying Qualcomm.The chipmaker expects sales of $3.45bn-$3.75bn in the current quarter, up 30 per cent to 41 per cent on a year ago and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $3.14bn. The group raised its forecast for fiscal-year sales to about $13.9bn, up from prior guidance of about $12.7bn.
496;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-07T17:39:14Z;TV makers seek to retune 3D revolution;;Advances in televisions on display at the Consumer Electronics Show helped make a spectacular Las Vegas event, with Sony and Samsung even bringing on dancing girls during their presentations.There have been bigger, flashier sets, with images leaping out from the screens, in some cases without the need for special 3D glasses. Content is richer and more colourful, with film studios and broadcasters keen to see wider distribution.There is also a new live element to internet content to supplement the many on-demand services that have dominated web-connected TVs so far.But a year on from big introductions of 3D and connected “smart TVs”, the show is still barely on the road, with 3D sales disappointing to date and the choice of content services and TV interfaces still confusing consumers.Only about 3m 3D TVs were sold worldwide in 2010, just over 1 per cent of total TV sales of 247m, according to estimates by the DisplaySearch research firm. Internet-connected TVs were far more successful, accounting for about 21 per cent of global shipments.Manufacturers appear divided in their response to consumer resistance to 3D. LG and Vizio are now promoting cheaper “passive” glasses, similar to those worn in the cinema, in response to complaints about the cost of the more sophisticated active-shutter glasses, which are also heavier and subject to flat batteries as consumers forget to recharge them.The TV makers are also working with standard eyewear designers, such as Oakley and Silhouette, to improve the look and feel of the glasses. Samsung showed off spectacles weighing less than an ounce that could be charged wirelessly by resting them on a special stand.Toshiba demonstrated a large-screen TV that displays 3D without the need for any eyewear but the technology still needs work and there are no plans to launch such a set yet.Sony is standing by its active-shutter glasses, which it says provide unmatched quality.In terms of internet connectivity, the Japanese consumer electronics company has chosen Google TV for its web-connected TV interface, while incorporating features of its own Qriocity content service, which will now include streaming of music as well as films.Vizio, which was the leading US LCD TV maker in the third quarter, said this week that it was switching from Yahoo internet widgets to its own interface based on Google’s Android operating system. Samsung, meanwhile, has announced a deal with Adobe to encourage its developer community to provide applications for its own smart TV platform.While alliances with technology companies are shifting, new ones with traditional cable providers are being established that cut out the need for TVs to be dependent on set-top boxes or aerials and coaxial cable, which carries regular and cable TV channels into the home.During CES, both Sony and Samsung have announced partnerships with Time Warner Cable that will allow delivery of the full line-up of its channels of live programming over their TVs’ internet connections. Samsung also announced a similar deal with Comcast cable, which will make programming available over internet protocol to Samsung’s Galaxy Tab tablet and its Android phones.This is part of a newer trend for 2011 – TV makers such as Vizio and Samsung are coming up with tablets and smartphones that can act as both relays and remotes for TVs. This involves using wireless connections to switch content – such as films being watched on a tablet – to the TV screen and using the mobile devices’ touch screens as remote controls.This growing interconnectivity of devices, from phones to TVs, appears to have been behind Qualcomm’s biggest acquisition this week. The leading phone chipmaker bought home network chipmaker Atheros for $3.1bn.“The industry is moving very rapidly and the phone is going to bleed into these adjacent areas [such as the digital home],” says Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm executive vice-president.Intel has also enabled similar capabilities for notebook PCs with the launch of its next-generation chips at the show – allowing high-definition films to be streamed securely over wireless to TVs.Intel’s technology won the confidence of the film studios, which are always worried about copyright piracy among PC owners.Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros also announced at CES they would begin using UltraViolet this year – the brand for content that can be bought and stored in a digital locker to be used on any device owned by the consumer.With Hollywood now happy to offer content across devices and on TVs, this long-awaited move is promising for both TV makers and consumers, according to Dave Habiger, chief executive of Sonic Solutions, which securely encodes digital content for the studios. “This could be a transformational year – we’ve got an alignment of device manufacturers and storefronts and technology players . . . and consumers seem to like it,” he says.
497;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-06T23:04:27Z;Microsoft strengthens the outlook for Arm;;"Arm Holdings is the pin-up of the UK technology sector. The Cambridge-based group, whose chip designs feature in electronic devices made by international brands such as Samsung, Sony, Nokia and Apple, has seen its share price rise more than 150 per cent in the past 12 months as investors bet big on the group’s growth potential.On Thursday Arm shares rose by as much as 13 per cent after Microsoft told visitors to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Arm chip designs would feature in a new version of the Windows operating system.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said that Microsoft would roll out a new class of less energy intensive chips based on Arm designs and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.The move is part of efforts to widen Windows beyond basic personal computers to portable devices, and Microsoft signalled that it would be two to three years before Arm chips featured in its devices.Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies, says Microsoft’s announcement was little more than confirmation that Arm was making good on its promise to widen the range of devices on which its chip designs can work.The market has long anticipated that Arm-based chips would feature in Windows 8 and had priced that into the stock. Following the announcement by Microsoft, graphics specialist Nvidia also said that it would be developing a new Arm-based core processor for desktops and servers.Both announcements underline how Arm, whose low-powered chip designs feature in 95 per cent of mobile phones sold worldwide as well as in other products, is widening its market. The group has until recently made little headway in the higher-power computer chip segment where Intel dominates.Arm’s focus on designing energy efficient chips for phones has been buoyed by the launch of smartphones such as the iPhone, as each device uses more Arm- designed chips than a conventional “dumb” handset.But its business model looks even more clever given that Arm’s chips are now being used in tablets, a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.Arm’s chips appear in Apple’s iPad, and will feature in Microsoft’s next range of mobile products.The iPad’s success has opened the floodgates to copycats from rivals such as Toshiba, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard. And with analysts predicting nearly 60m devices could be sold next year, Arm’s presence in the segment has boosted its value.Richard Holway at TechMarketView says that if consumers treat their tablet computers more like their phones and upgrade their devices more often, even those estimates may be too conservative.A move up the scale towards mobile PCs will enable Arm to command higher fees for each chip sold, though the market is smaller than for phones.Yet even given the strong outlook, Arm’s market
capitalisation of more than £6bn looks full.Arm has created a solid business model licensing its designs and collecting royalties once the chips are in operation. Yet analysts expect Arm to report full-year pre-tax profits of only about £140m on sales of nearly £400m next month.Sandeep S Deshpande, analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, says the stock looks expensive. Prospective earnings for 2014, for example, when he estimates as many as 200m tablets could be sold globally, would put Arm on 30.2 times earnings per share. To put that into perspective, Google and Apple, two other high-growth companies, are expected to trade at 11.6 times and 10.8 times 2014 earnings respectively, based on consensus estimates.Arm points out that its chip designs also appear in microcontrollers and printers and says that the company’s chips will start appearing in servers in the next five years.Speculation that Arm could be a takeover target for a big US group has also fed into the share price.Warren East, chief executive, insists that there would be little value in any one of its customers buying the company given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to remove the cost of researching and designing chips for a wide range of clients.Analysts largely agree. The most likely candidate would be Intel, which has the cash to make a purchase and could use a deal to squash its competition. But even a deal by Intel seems unlikely given it would likely face competition issues from regulators.The greater risk is that Intel hits back by eating into Arm’s market share in chips for phones. Intel’s Atom chip, which has been used in netbooks, has been adapted for smartphones.Ian Drew, head of marketing at Arm, says the company knows “it can’t rest on its laurels” and will continue to innovate.In the meantime, investors look set to keep buying into the company’s potential. Arm is “the lighthouse” of the UK tech sector, says Mr Deshpande. How long that light shines for remains to be seen.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and Paul Taylor"
498;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
499;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-06T22:01:09Z;Retail sales report weighs on US stocks;;Gap, Target and Macy’s were among the retail stocks that fell after weak festive holiday trading but positive news from the jobs market helped US stocks pare losses.The final verdict on retailers’ holiday shopping season was disappointing as many large chains missed their estimates.Retail Metrics said its index of same-store sales had risen 3.2 per cent against analysts’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1.6 per cent while the wider consumer discretionary sector sank 0.7 per cent. The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained. Nvidia soared 13.8 per cent to $19.33, while Qualcomm added 1.2 per cent to $52.67 and Texas Instruments gained 1.4 per cent to $33.25.Intel, which used to dominate the processor market, fell 0.8 per cent to $20.77.Initial jobless claims edged up by 18,000 to a total of 409,000 last week, but the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits fell. The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.
500;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-06T21:23:06Z;Microsoft needs to rethink tablets;;If Microsoft needed a change of technology strategy to give itself a chance of catching up with Apple’s iPad, it was evident this week in the US prices that Taiwan’s Asus unveiled for its own forthcoming line of touchscreen tablet computers.Three of the machines, which will run on the Android operating system from Google, will carry price tags of between $399 and $499 – a level competitive with the least expensive version of the iPad, which sells for $499.But the fourth machine, carrying Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating software, will cost buyers $999.In reaching down into the tablet market from its perch in the PC world, Microsoft has been found wanting.Even though it was the company that pioneered full, keyboard-less computers nearly a decade ago – although the tablet PCs it spawned rely on a stylus, not fingers, for contact – must make this message all the harder to swallow.Its earlier software was designed for full-powered PCs, capable of running the gamut of heavy-duty applications and with hardware specifications to match.But Microsoft has more than just price to catch up on, as it revises its plans for Windows on mobile devices.“There is only so much you can do with Windows 7 on a touchscreen,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, consumer PC and tablet analyst at Forrester Research. “It isn’t designed for a touch experience.”The answer, according to Microsoft, will come in a complete rewrite of Windows to make it more suitable for all the lightweight, touchscreen personal computing devices of the future – not just today’s tablets, like the iPad.It will also entail an erosion of the central “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has presided over the PC era, as the software company looks beyond its traditional chip partner to extend its software to silicon produced by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments – all of which use designs from UK-based Arm.The silicon used in these devices will require less power, will pack more of a computer’s functions into less space and should prove more reliable, according to Steven Sinofsky, head of the Windows and Windows Live internet businesses.Unveiling the plans now will give the many hardware makers that have built their own strategies around Microsoft technology time to plan for the new direction: but it also means a wait of two-three years before the software company has a true response to the iPad.Microsoft may be taking longer than some, but it is not the only one to have been scrambling this week to present a coherent response to the iPad.Much of the anticipation around tablets at the annual Consumer Electronics Show this week has been centred on the Android operating system, which Google originally designed to run on so-called smartphones.A new version, codenamed Honeycomb, has been designed to accommodate the larger screens of tablets.But while tablets designed to run on Honeycomb have been in plentiful supply, hard evidence of the software has been in short supply among the Las Vegas slot machines and craps tables this week.Google was reduced to issuing a tease for the latest version of Android late on Wednesday, offering what it called a “sneak peek” of Honeycomb.Motorola, one of the many hopefuls lining up behind the software, predicted that it would be the first out with a full Android tablet, with the machine on sale before the end of March.For Microsoft, meanwhile, there may have been little choice but to dig in for the long haul. Its Windows Phone 7 smartphone software, released to considerable acclaim late last year, supports many of the main functions users also look for in tablets, said Ms Ebbs.These include accessing Facebook, catching up with e-mail or watching video.But that software was narrowly designed for small screens, according to Microsoft executives, and has a user interface and closely defined hardware requirements that are not suitable for tablets.With the iPad expected to dominate the booming tablet market this year, the long wait has just begun.

502;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-06T08:45:32Z;Microsoft links with Arm in tablets move;;Shares in Arm Holdings rose as 13 per cent in early London trading on Thursday after Microsoft announced overnight that the UK-based group’s chip designs would feature in a new version of the Windows operating system.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, revealed that Microsoft would be rolling out a new class of lower-powered chips based on Arm designs and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments as part of efforts to widen Windows beyond basic personal computers to portable devices.The announcement was made ahead of the official start of the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the industry’s flagship annual event.Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies, said that the market had long anticipated that Arm-based chips would feature in Windows 8 and had priced that into the stock. However, he said the official announcement was likely to keep feeding into the share price. A move into PC chips will enable Arm to command higher fees for each chip sold, though the market is smaller than for phones.The move is a boost for Arm, whose low-powered chip designs feature in 95 per cent of mobile phones sold around the world and in a range of other products but have made relatively little headway in the higher-power computer chip segment where Intel dominates.Following the announcement by Microsoft on Wednesday, graphics specialist Nvidia also said that it would be developing a new Arm-based core processor for desktops and servers. The move puts Nvidia in direct competition with Intel.Warren East, Arm’s chief executive, has said that the company expects to benefit from an expected leap in demand for tablet computers, which are seen as a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.The success of the iPad has prompted companies including Toshiba, Motorola, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard to rush to bring out their own tablets.Microsoft said Arm-designed chips would not start to be seen in new devices for another two or three years. Arm’s chips currently feature in a version of Windows that runs on the US group’s smartphones.In July, Arm signed a deal with Microsoft to extend and expand on an existing long-running licensing agreement. The deal gave Microsoft access to Arm’s core architecture, rather than licensing one product at a time. Microsoft had until relatively recently relied on Intel to supply most of its chips, though it has been widening its relationships with other chipmakers and designers.Shares in Arm have risen more than 150 per cent over the past year, boosted by speculation of a possible shift into supplying designs for Microsoft and news that Arm’s chip designs featured in iPhone 4 and iPad, Apple’s highly successful tablet computer.The group, which is trading on 44 times 2011 earnings, has also been seen by some as a prospective takeover target.Arm, whose shares were trading at 532½p early on Thursday, makes its money by licensing its chip designs to semiconductor makers and then collecting royalties once the chips go into new products.Mr East continues to insist that buying the company would make little sense to another chipmaker, given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to service lots of customers with its designs, thereby saving them the cost of research and development.

504;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Microsoft in Windows tablet move;;Microsoft has broken with two and a half decades of company history with plans to extend its next Windows operating system beyond the realm of traditional PC chips, repositioning itself for the upheaval in personal computing touched off by Apple’s iPad.However, the change in technology strategy, which marks a turning point in the so-called “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has dominated the PC era, will not bear fruit in new devices for “two to three years”, a Microsoft executive said.The world’s biggest software company announced its plans on Wednesday, on the eve of the annual International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which is set to see the unveiling of a slew of touch-screen tablet computers designed to compete with the iPad.Companies including Motorola and Toshiba showed off tablets on Wednesday that will run on a new version of Google’s Android operating system, which is also being revised to make it a stronger competitor to the software underpinning the iPad. While no launch dates or prices were given, executives indicated they planned to put the devices on sale before the end of March.Lenovo and Samsung also showed off hybrid devices with built-in keyboards that can be used either as a tablet or a laptop PC, echoing a design already launched by Dell.Despite the coming spate of rivals, most analysts predict that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet category this year.Microsoft played down the competition with Apple as it demonstrated Windows running on a new class of chips with lower power requirements, making them more suitable for portable devices.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said the new technology direction was intended eventually for a wider family of machines than tablets. The change will put Windows on chips based on a design by the UK’s Arm Holdings and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.Microsoft presented the move as part of a broader strategy that would benefit Intel and AMD, makers of traditional PC chips.The next version of Windows will run on so-called “system on a chip” hardware – integrated pieces of silicon that combine processor, memory, graphics and other functions that previously required larger circuit boards.A version of Windows for smartphones already runs on ARM chips, but Mr Sinofsky continued to resist calls for Microsoft to use this to mount an earlier challenge to the iPad.

This is unquestionably a positive for the economy, the labour market, income growth and risk assets,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “[But] it should be pointed out that December always has seasonal quirks for a host of estimates and, while ADP suggests that there is no real reason to dispute this number, we doubt such strength will be repeated.”The Institute of Supply Management’s reading on the services industries improved in December to its highest level since May 2006.Financials and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers after the improving economic data boosted confidence in the recovery.The financial sector gained 1.2 per cent with AIG jumping 7.3 per cent to $60.93 after the insurer said that it had received offers of up to $3bn for Nan Shan Life Insurance, its Taiwanese unit. Wells Fargo added 2.3 per cent to $32.14 while JPMorgan rose 1.2 per cent to $44.70.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.8 per cent with online travel agencies leading the gainers. Priceline.com added 5.9 per cent to $433.60 while Expedia increased 4.1 per cent to $25.43.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,276.56, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,722.89 while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.8 per cent to close at 2,702.20.Atheros Communications added 1.5 per cent to $44.64 after soaring 19 per cent in late trade on Tuesday on deal speculation. On Wednesday it agreed to be bought by Qualcomm for about $3.2bn in cash, or $45 a share.In the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector, Qualcomm is aiming to compete more effectively in the market for tablet computers by using Atheros’s expertise in wireless technology. Shares in Qualcomm added 2.1 per cent to $52.03.Elsewhere in technology, Youku, the Chinese online video website that listed in the US to much fanfare at the end of last year, climbed 6.5 per cent to $37.95 after the company said that it was working with a “major” Hollywood studio to provide an on-

Brian Yu, an analyst at Citigroup, cut the aluminium producer’s rating from “buy” to “hold”.Rising demand for fertiliser helped Mosaic beat earnings expectations in its second quarter. Farmers are buying more fertiliser as they seek to make the most of corn and soyabean prices that are at multi-year highs.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets kept their “outperform” rating on the stock. “Interestingly, the stronger-than-expected performance was largely attributable to the phosphate business,” they said. “Consistent with Mosaic’s third-quarter 2011 guidance, we expect to see improving results from the potash business that could provide additional momentum for Mosaic’s stock.”Majority-owned by Cargill, the agribusiness group, Mosaic earned $1.01 per share, excluding the sale of its stake in a Brazilian fertiliser producer, up from 24 cents a share in the same quarter the year before. Shares in Mosaic gained 2.8 per cent to $77.09."
506;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm expands into WiFi with chipmaker deal;;Qualcomm is pushing ahead with efforts to expand beyond its traditional mobile handset market with a $3.2bn cash deal to buy Atheros Communications, a leading maker of chips used for wireless communications.Atheros investors will get $45 a share, or 22 per cent more than the closing price on January 3, before reports about the purchase emerged. Qualcomm shares rose for a second day on Wednesday, gaining more than 2 per cent in midday trading.The companies confirmed the deal early on Wednesday, after advanced reports sent Atheros’s shares up 19 per cent.The purchase is Qualcomm’s biggest bet so far that microprocessors will continue to combine functions that have been handled independently, including multiple forms of communication.While Qualcomm is a leader in wireless chips for mobile phones, especially smartphones, Silicon Valley-based Atheros is stronger in WiFi transmission.The largest-ever acquisition for Qualcomm gives it immediate access to new customers that make networking gear and advanced products for consumers. But in the longer term, it plans to integrate current Qualcomm and Atheros capabilities on a single chip.“Three to five years from now, if you don’t have an integrated solution, you are going to be a loser,” said Wedbush Morgan analyst Patrick Wang. “You are not going to be relevant.”The deal follows top microprocessor maker Intel’s $1.4bn purchase of Infineon’s wireless chip business, announced in August. Both combinations reflect the increasing expectations from equipment manufacturers such as Apple for greater capability in chips with smaller size and lower cost.Smartphones are taking a rapidly growing share of the overall phone market, and many manufacturers are pouring into the nascent market for tablet computers that Apple pioneered a year ago.Broadcom of the US continues to play a main role at the high end of the communications chip market, with Asian chipmakers on the low end. In the middle, Qualcomm and Intel have run out of time to develop more effective chips in-house and are having to spend to acquire them.Analysts said that valuations had recovered from six months ago, discouraging a flurry of additional mergers. The major companies will now turn to the challenge of manufacturing integration.Qualcomm expects to close the Atheros deal in the first half of the year and be “modestly accretive” to earnings per share in fiscal year 2012, the first full year of combined operations.
507;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-04T21:48:54Z;Motorola split marked with S&P’s biggest rise;;"Newly formed Motorola Mobility soared while the S&P 500 edged lower, dragged down by falling commodity prices.In the first day of trading after Motorola was split in two, both the handset-focused Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions, which makes networking systems, rallied.Mobility jumped 9.5 per cent to $33.12, which was the biggest gain on the
S&P 500.Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse, gave the stock an “outperform” rating, saying that he expected smartphones to lead a recovery and the launch of Mobility’s first tablet device in early 2011 to add to earnings per share. He also said the company’s excess cash should not be ignored.But Ron Hall, an analyst at JPMorgan, rated Mobility “underweight”, citing concerns about smartphone and tablet competition, especially as Verizon starts to offer the iPhone. “We estimate that over 50 per cent of Motorola Mobility’s smartphone units sales could come from Verizon,” he said.“We believe the loss of around 4m smartphone units in 2011 would decrease our earnings per share forecast by around 55 per cent and that a larger share loss is possible given the continuing dominant position of Apple’s iPhone in the market.“In a worst-case scenario, we believe Verizon share loss could cause Motorola Mobility to fail to break even for full year 2011,”
he said.Mobility’s rivals edged higher with shares in Apple, which hit another all-time high on Monday, gaining 0.5 per cent to $331.21. US-listed shares in Research in Motion nudged up 0.3 per cent to $59.10.Analysts at JPMorgan were more positive about the prospects for Motorola Systems, initiating coverage with a “neutral” rating and a $38 price target.They said that, while the company’s enterprise assets were growing fast, investors should be more cautious about the government
division, where demand could be hit by tightening budgets.Shares in Motorola Solutions spent much of the session edging just slightly higher before a last-minute spurt to gain 6.6 per cent to $39.77 by the closing bell.The wider markets were mixed after Monday’s rally. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,270.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent up at 11,691.18 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4 per cent to close at 2,681.25.Energy stocks lost steam as oil fell back below $90. The S&P 500 energy index led the fallers, down 0.6 per cent with Halliburton losing 2.9 per cent to $39.55.The S&P 500 materials index was also lower, losing 0.5 per cent, as commodity prices fell on Tuesday. Precious metals miners suffered particularly as silver and gold sold off.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.7 per cent to $118.75 while Newmont Mining declined by 3.3 per cent to $59.08.But there were some bright spots in materials. Alcoa, the aluminium producer that rose on Monday after positive analyst comments, advanced further after it was chosen as 2011’s “top stock” by CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who said it could reach $22. Shares in Alcoa gained 4.6 per cent to $16.52.Elsewhere in materials, Molycorp rallied 7.3 per cent to $61.69 after the owner of the world’s largest rare earth deposit outside China said it might double planned production.Rare earth stocks have risen in recent weeks after China cut its export quotas for the elements used in technical devices.Molycorp has soared 26.8 per cent in the past five days with rival Rare Element Resources rocketing 68.9 per cent over the week.General Motors also benefited from increased demand in China with car sales to the country jumping 28.8 per cent in 2010. Its shares added 2.3 per cent to $37.90. Monthly car sales numbers showed that General Motors also expanded in the US in December with car sales rising by 7.5 per cent. Rival Ford put on 0.8 per cent to $17.38.In deals news, Atheros Communications soared 18.85 per cent in late trading to $44 after it was reported that Qualcomm could be interested in making a bid for the semiconductor manufacturer. The deal would be worth about $3.5bn or $45 per share, about a 22 per cent premium to the share price before the report.If it goes ahead, the acquisition would be Qualcomm's largest ever and the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector.Investors were unsurprised by the minutes from the December meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, and shrugged off a larger than expected rise
in US factory orders for November."
508;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2011-01-04T18:49:32Z;Motorola Mobility bets on Android tablets;;Motorola Mobility, the Droid smartphone maker that has formalised its split from Motorola’s enterprise division, is betting on Android-powered tablet computers as it seeks to use a separate stock market listing to claw back some of the ground it previously lost in mobile devices.Sanjay Jha, chairman and chief executive, hinted after Motorola Mobility rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday that the company’s first tablets using Google’s open-source Android operating system could be unveiled at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Mr Jha told reporters he saw “tremendous growth” in the nascent tablet market, which has been dominated by Apple’s iPad, citing analyst forecasts that 200m such devices would be sold by 2014. Motorola Mobility would “participate across the tiers” of different size tablets, from 7-inch to 11-inch screens, he added.Analysts at Jefferies said Motorola Mobility could launch a tablet using Google’s Honeycomb, a next-generation version of Android aimed at tablets, one or two months ahead of competitors.People briefed on the group’s tablet plans have also pointed to the likelihood that at least one device could lean heavily towards video consumption, tied to Verizon’s FiOS digital pay-television service.Mr Jha, brought in from Qualcomm in 2008 to engineer a comeback after heavy market share losses to Apple, Samsung and others, expressed confidence in its US mobile business, where analysts believe Verizon Wireless accounts for more than half of all the handsets Motorola sells.With growing expectation that Verizon will break AT&T’s exclusive grip on the iPhone in the US, and Verizon also supporting a rival Samsung LTE phone, Motorola Mobility is expected to diversify, working with additional carriers including Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and AT&T.Shares in both Motorola Mobility rose 9 per cent by lunchtime in New York after its split from Motorola Solutions, which focuses on public safety, data and advanced services for businesses. Shares in Motorola Solutions traded up 0.25 per cent.The Motorola split, initiated after pressure from investor Carl Icahn, would give Motorola Mobility currency to acquire companies and attract staff, ensure a more consistent pattern of innovation, and simplify the company’s message to investors, said Mr Jha.“You’ll see a board which is much more focused on understanding technology as opposed to managing a portfolio,” he said.Jefferies speculated that Motorola Mobility could be a target for Huawei, ZTE or Dell, or could merge with Sony Ericsson.
509;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-12-20T20:04:01Z;AT&T;Deal with Qualcomm shows airwaves are getting pricier;Just like the old saw that land is a great investment because “they aren’t making any more of it”, the notion that finite wireless capacity will keep rising in value may need some caveats. Monday’s announcement that AT&T will pay Qualcomm $1.93bn for the spectrum used for its floundering mobile TV venture is a case in point. Qualcomm paid a total of $683m for it between 2003 and 2008. But once AT&T’s price is adjusted for megahertz and population covered, it was cheaper than the prices paid in a 2008 broadcast spectrum auction, when the iPhone was in its infancy.The argument that prices will surge is based on an expected capacity crunch. Industry and government forecasts hold that US wireless data usage could rise 72-fold between 2009 and 2015. Credit Suisse reckons about a third of that will be satisfied by extra utilisation of existing capacity plus efficiency gains – Cooper’s Law (similar to Moore’s Law for microprocessors) says that wireless efficiency doubles every 30 months. Even so, two-thirds must come from additional spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission would like to see 300 megahertz reallocated from other uses, about 120Mhz of which would come only grudgingly from television broadcasters.Even if this reallocation goes smoothly, it might not be enough, leading to predictions of soaring spectrum prices. This may only be half-right. With data-hungry smartphone users paying far less per unit than those who use voice services, putting a fairer price on capacity – or rationing – would curb demand growth. Alternatively, as AT&T customers know only too well, service will deteriorate.Today’s shiny smartphones can do some amazing things, but there are still no apps for repealing the law of supply and demand.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
510;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;AT&T to buy Qualcomm’s spectrum for $1.93bn;;AT&T, the US telecoms group, is paying Qualcomm $1.93bn for wireless spectrum that it will use to support the roll-out of its nationwide 4G mobile network beginning next year.Qualcomm had sought a buyer for the spectrum, which is in the highly valued 700 megahertz spectrum band, following its decision to fold its struggling FloTV service which has been broadcasting live TV to select mobile handsets. The San Diego-based mobile chipmaker reportedly paid about $683m for the spectrum, which it acquired between 2003 and 2008. It has said that it was looking for new options for the spectrum after announcing that it expects to shut down FloTV in March 2011.Analysts said the price also looked fair from AT&T’s perspective. “The Qualcomm/AT&T transaction comes out to about $0.86/MHz/POP [a benchmark measure of spectrum pricing] which is an attractive price given the quality of the spectrum,” said Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research.Mr Moffett said the price AT&T is paying is meaningfully below the $1.10/MHz/POP prices paid in the auction of similar 700Mhz spectrum by the US Federal Communications Commission just a couple of years ago. “That’s a troubling signal for some of the more aggressive valuations that are floating around for what are lower quality spectrum bands than this,” he said.AT&T is preparing to roll-out a next generation mobile broadband network based on a technology called LTE (Long Term Evolution). The company said the spectrum it is acquiring, which covers about 300m people, will be used to boost the capacity of the new network.“The move will bolster AT&T’s ability to provide an advanced 4G mobile broadband experience for its customers in the years ahead,” AT&T said. Wireless broadband networks based on LTE are expected to offer data download speeds more than 10 times faster than the current third generation, or 3G, technology. All four leading US mobile network operators are racing to deploy the high-speed broadband mobile networks that are necessary to support the next generation of smartphones and other data-hungry mobile devices and services such as mobile video-conferencing.This month Verizon Wireless, the US mobile network operator jointly owned by Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone,launched its next-generation LTE network in 39 US markets including New York.AT&T, which is the exclusinve carrier for Apple’s iPhone in the US, has been criticised for the quality of its existing 3G wireless network in some heavily populated markets such as New York. It has been under pressure to improve its offering amid speculation that Apple could announce a LTE-version of its popular iPhone 4 early next year.Barclays Capital acted as exclusive financial advisor to Qualcomm on the transaction.Shares of AT&T were trading up 22 cents at $29.43 a share in early trading while Qualcomm’s shares were up 63 cents or 1 per cent at $49.75.
511;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-12-15T02:18:02Z;Brussels issues industry standards rules;;European competition authorities have released new rules governing the way in which all-important industry standards– used in sectors ranging from telecoms to IT – should be developed.This has been an increasingly fraught area for regulators, with companies battling to get technologies carrying lucrative intellectual property rights incorporated into industry-wide standards.The regulators’ concerns have focused on the possibility that companies could exploit the market power that the proprietary technology gives them. There have been EU-level probes in this area recently, including the Rambus and Qualcomm cases.As a result, consultations over the new guidelines have been intense, with much attention focused on efforts by European Commission officials to set out how they might assess whether essential technology that has become part of an industry standard was being licensed to third parties on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms – the so-called “frand” commitments.In the new guidelines, commission officials set out criteria that will not raise problems with a standard-setting procedure. To qualify for this “safe harbour”, the procedure must be open to all parties competing in the particular industrial or technology area and be transparent. There must also be an irrevocable commitment involving all intellectual property rights holders whose technology is included in the standard to license on “frand” terms.The guidelines acknowledge that there can be fierce disputes over the exact level of “frand” – and that one way to avoid them is for intellectual property rights holders to state in advance the maximum amount they would charge if their technologies were incorporated into the standard. Officials made clear that if this happens, they would not normally see such a system of advance disclosures giving rise to competition concerns.Some technology companies had been concerned that the new guidelines would beef up the standard-setting rules in a way that will undermine their negotiating positions with potential licensees. Those worries seemed to lessen after Tuesday’s final version was released, although some suggested that the wording was still open to interpretation in some areas.
512;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-11-04T00:02:24Z;River Lea shapes up as Silicon Valley;;David Cameron will claim the backing of some of the world’s biggest companies on Thursday as he attempts to realise the dream of an “east London tech city”, focused on the Olympic park, to rival Silicon Valley.The prime minister wants to establish a high-tech hub that builds on the creative industries already thriving in Shoreditch and link them to a new technology park by the River Lea after the Olympics in 2012.Mr Cameron will commit no new money to the venture when he speaks in east London but claims to have used his persuasive powers to woo companies including Google, Facebook, Intel and McKinsey to east London.“Our ambition is to bring together the creativity and energy of Shoreditch and the incredible possibilities of the Olympic park to help make east London one of the world’s great technology centres,” he will say.“Right now, Silicon Valley is the leading place in the world for high-tech growth and innovation but there’s no reason why it has to be predominant.”Mr Cameron says that he and his ministers have had “dozens of meetings” with high-tech companies and venture capital companies around the world in recent weeks to sell the idea.Google said it would create an innovation hub providing training workshops and bringing together dev­el­opers, companies, resear­chers and academics. Facebook will create a permanent home in east London for its “developer garage” programme, connecting developers and entrepreneurs, while Intel will set up a research laboratory.Mr Cameron will also announce that Cisco is setting up an innovation centre at the Olympic site, while BT Group will bring forward the roll-out of superfast broadband in Shoreditch and Old Street.Separately, the prime minister will announce links with Imperial College and University College London, while Loughborough University will bring together business and sports science on the site.Barclays, Silicon Valley Bank, McKinsey and Qualcomm will provide financial and technical support.Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary, was in California last week attempting to drum up further backing for the initiative, which is part of the coalition’s attempt to prove it has a growth agenda and is not simply obsessed with cuts.Mr Cameron will announce an “entrepreneur visa” – building on an existing scheme – to ensure that any entrepreneur with “serious investment” from a leading backer would be guaranteed the right to set up a business in the UK.The promise is an attempt to allay fears that the coalition’s cap on migrant numbers will deter foreign investment in Britain.The prime minister will also announce a review of UK intellectual property laws to “encourage the sort of creative innovation that exists in America”. He will say: “The founders of Google have said they could never have started their company in Britain. Over there, they have what are called ‘fair use’ provisions, which some people believe gives companies more breathing space to create new products and services.”Richard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView and one of the UK’s top IT analysts, welcomed the idea of creating a cluster in London and tapping into Imperial College’s skills base.
513;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-10-19T21:05:52Z;Optimist with a record of success;;"Always assume you will be successful. This is one of the maxims Stan Boland carries in his head as a result of his broad span of business experience. It is a tenet that has proved useful over the past eight years while establishing a technology company that he hopes will make it big on the back of the new wave of smartphones.Mr Boland, 50, is chief executive and co-founder of Icera, a UK company backed by $250m in venture capital that is trying to achieve what might seem an impossible dream: to mount a coup against the dominance in a specialised field of semiconductor technology of Qualcomm, the Californian microchip company.“It’s scary how good they are,” Mr Boland says of his big US rival. “But they take a conventional approach [to chip design], while we are doing something completely different.”Mr Boland’s career has included top jobs in both finance and technology, enabling him to build deep knowledge in a range of diverse topics from loan finance to high-speed telecommunications protocols.He has also had exposure to a wide range of company cultures, from blue-chip British, based on the six years he spent at Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker, to swashbuckling Australian, when he worked for a year in the late 1980s in a finance job for famed corporate raider Robert Holmes à Court. Mr Boland describes this spell working for Bell Resources as a “lot of fun”.But the eight years he has spent establishing Icera is the longest time Mr Boland, who describes himself as an optimist, has ever spent at one company.He says that his philosophy on success stems from Sir Robin Saxby, former chief executive of microchip group Arm Holdings, which in the 1990s was spun out of Acorn Computers, the pioneer of British personal computers. Mr Boland was running Acorn when Arm was created.“Another thing Robin told me was to take every opportunity to put yourself in front of the customer,” he continues.While Acorn ultimately disappeared, its legacy remains through its network of entrepreneurial alumni, which includes Herman Hauser, one of the UK’s leading technology entrepreneurs, a co-founder of Acorn Computers, and now a director of Amadeus Capital Partners, which has become one of Icera’s financial backers.Mr Hauser says Mr Boland’s ability to grasp complex ideas and explain it to non-experts is his greatest strength. “Stan has a great understanding of some extremely complicated technology but he has also got the ability to explain it in conceptual terms and sell the story of what the company is doing to customers and investors,” he says.Mr Boland’s career has also included a year in Silicon Valley at Broadcom, the microchip company that acquired Element 14, a business that Mr Boland cofounded in 1999 and sold a year later for $640m.Speaking at Icera’s unassuming headquarters in a technology park on the outskirts of Bristol, home of Britain’s biggest semiconductor design cluster, Mr Boland identifies the Silicon Valley culture as the one he has found “most conducive to entrepreneurialism, if you define that as the creating of new products for new markets in a risk-taking but ultimately rewarding way”.But he adds that European technology companies do have some advantages. “There is a darker side to American business practice, which is that companies often deny they are on the wrong track and executives blatantly lie about their product, schedules, competitors, funding and so on. I don’t think you see this much in Europe – the European tendency to be relatively honest is a strength, and one that is valued by the ultimate customer.”Out of Icera’s 300 employees, just over a third are in the UK, the rest mainly in France, the US, China and Taiwan.The company’s breakthrough has been to create a family of semiconductors that offers a novel way of connecting smartphones such as the iPhone with billions of other phones and terminals. Icera, like most semiconductor companies in Europe and the US, does not manufacture the semiconductors itself but outsources this to other companies, primarily TSMC in Taiwan.The chips work by an unusual design of their logic circuitry. A relatively small number of circuits can be made to do the job of the much bigger number than would be needed in conventional chips, through the technique of passing signals through them repeatedly rather than requiring new processors to do the work.“If you consider the intellectual aspects to what we’re doing, I can’t think of anything that’s more complex, apart from nuclear physics or space travel,” says Mr Boland.However, the real test for Icera is still to come: the company has yet to make a profit from sales described by Mr Boland as being “a few tens of million dollars a year”.A key challenge for Icera will be whether it can sell its chips to makers of 3G smartphones such as Apple, Nokia and Samsung; revenues so far have been limited mainly to selling the chips to Chinese or Taiwanese companies, including ZTE or Foxconn, that use them inside the modem devices, also called dongles, that plug into small computers to enable them to connect to cellular networks.Assuming Icera can find buyers for its products among the phone makers it is wooing in the next 12-18 months, then it could be in line for a stock market flotation, although Mr Boland is reticent about timing.Mr Boland’s self-deprecating manner conceals a tough streak. Icera has initiated a complaint to the European Commission about allegedly “anticompetitive” marketing practices by Qualcomm in Europe, in what amounts to a declaration of war. Along with a handful of competitors making 3G cellular chips, the company is playing for high stakes: sales of these devices are likely to be about $4.5bn this year but are likely to expand substantially in the next few years as more complicated mobile phones start to take over mainstream parts of the cellular industry. Of the current market for these chips, Qualcomm is thought to account for about 40 per cent.Mr Boland says reading magazines about personal computers triggered his decision to work at Acorn, one of the UK’s first computer start-ups but which had already suffered a series of financial problems.The Cambridge physics graduate believes he learnt a huge amount while at Acorn from Mr Hauser and other Cambridge luminaries – such as Andy Hopper, now head of Cambridge university’s computer department – about how to develop technology businesses. The Cambridge connection is still important; some of Icera’s best ideas on semiconductor design can be traced back to techniques that were under development at Acorn.“When I arrived at Acorn, it was really the first time I could see the direct connection between the work of engineers and the creation of products and business,” Mr Boland says.If Icera can turn into a big and profitable business over the next few years, which is by no means guaranteed given the scale of the task, it will be a celebration not just for an extremely special UK technology venture but also testimony to how such a broad business background as Mr Boland’s, together with the varied span of financial and technological connections that his career has involved, can provide the platform for success."
514;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-10-17T19:34:33Z;Bandit phone king has the last laugh;;When Tsai Ming-kai walks into the conference room, it is hard not to feel a slight sense of disappointment. The kindly 60-year-old hardly looks like the ominous-sounding “King of the Bandit Phones” – an epithet that Taiwan’s easily excitable press has given the chairman and chief executive of Mediatek, the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips to China.The exaggerated descriptions the press assigns Mr Tsai (which also include “King of Stocks” and “Godfather of Taiwan chip design”) stem partly from the fact that Mr Tsai is rarely seen in public. His appearances are limited to a handful of speeches every year and even the company’s quarterly results conference calls are handled by Yu Mingto, the chief financial officer.Indeed, this is Mr Tsai’s first face-to-face interview with the press in three years – it was nearly derailed by a small crisis the night before when his public relations manager was unable to inform him in advance that a photographer would be present.Workers at Mediatek, however, know a more personable Mr Tsai. One who, despite being a US dollar billionaire according to estimates by Forbes magazine, chats to his staff while lining up for a meal at the company canteen. Yu Mingto describes Mr Tsai as “a very fact-driven person”, but points out how, at critical junctures for the company such as during last year’s industry downturn, Mr Tsai had shown his softer side by sending encouraging letters to employees.That aspect of Mr Tsai’s personality begins to shine through shortly after the interview begins. As he launches into his favourite topic – management theory and strategy – a beaming smile breaks out across his face.“I never properly went to business school,” he declares. “I took one week off to attend a course on innovation and strategy at Stanford Business School.”It was there that Mr Tsai came into contact with the teachings of Harvard’s Clayton Christensen, Peter Drucker and other management gurus. “That was 10 years ago.”At the time, Mediatek was three years old and was just entering the mobile phone industry. Most of its customers were small family-owned factories in southern China, many of which where making cheap knock-off phones – thus earning Mr Tsai his “King of the Bandit Phones” nickname.Mr Tsai, who was educated in electrical engineering first in Taiwan and later in the US, joined United Micro­electronics, one of Taiwan’s earliest and biggest chip companies, in 1983. He climbed through the ranks, and by 1994 was in charge of United Micro­electronics’ consumer and multimedia product businesses, which made chips for products such as televisions and disc players.The unit was eventually spun off by United Microelectronics, becoming Mediatek and listing on the Taiwan stock exchange in 1997 – with Mr Tsai remaining at the helm and becoming both chairman and chief executive.Despite his short course at Stanford, Mr Tsai became deeply impressed with Prof Christensen’s teachings, particularly those that concerned how newcomers can use disruptive technology to unseat existing market leaders.Mediatek’s subsequent development and rise to become one of the world’s biggest chip design companies could essentially be viewed as Mr Tsai putting Prof Christensen’s theories into practice.His enthusiasm for management theory was such that, even though Mr Tsai has nearly always rejected invitations for public appearances, for three years he wrote a monthly column in Business Today, one of Taiwan’s more popular business magazines, about technology trends and business management.One of Prof Christensen’s theories declared that, although industries tend to be vertically integrated in their early days, they disintegrate into specialised segments once technology becomes more mature, with the process creating opportunities for newcomers to compete against incumbents.In the technology sector, this meant that a small, new company such as Mediatek could survive and thrive just by focusing on doing one thing well, and doing it as cheaply as possible. Mediatek started with CD drives for computers, and quickly moved on to chips for DVD players. By 2000, it had become one of the biggest suppliers of chips for both those markets and Mr Tsai began looking to mobile phones.Brands including Motorola had only started outsourcing their manufacturing to Taiwanese companies a few years earlier, but based on his then newly acquired management theories, Mr Tsai believed that process would only accelerate.While much of the outsourcing of technology manufacturing went to Taiwan in the 1980s, Mr Tsai saw that China was quickly growing into the world’s factory for even high-tech good such as mobile phones. “Taiwan was able to grab that opportunity in the 1980s, but by the consumer electronics era [in the 1990s] . . . all the manufacturing had already gone to Shenzhen [in southern China],” he says.So while the biggest players in the wireless chip industry – Qualcomm and Texas Instruments of the US – were focused on pioneering the third-generation phone chips that power advanced smartphones, Mr Tsai worked on improving the regular, or second-generation (2G) mobile phone chips to service the “newcomers” in China that he foresaw would one day unseat the industry leaders. “Actually there was still room for technological improvement [in 2G phone chips],” Mr Tsai explains.CK Cheng, an analyst with CLSA in Taipei, says Mr Tsai’s breakthrough was in offering not just a chip, but a so-called “turnkey solution” that included reference designs that made it possible for new phone makers to get into the business. “The innovation was not so much the technology but the business model. It brought down the barrier of entry significantly,” Mr Cheng says. “Mr Tsai was the first to do that and it was a turning point for the Chinese mobile phone industry.”Sure enough, while Taiwanese and western phone makers shunned Mediatek’s chips, Mr Tsai found a horde of eager customers in China’s budding phone makers. Using Mediatek’s technology, thousands of Chinese phone makers have combined to take about 20 per cent of the world’s biggest mobile phone market, to the chagrin of established brands such as Nokia and Samsung.It was a shame, Mr Tsai says, that the phones made by his Chinese clients came to be known as shanzai, or bandit, phones. “They were foolish to call themselves shanzai. They should have just stuck with ‘whitebox’, because then people used their name to criticise them,” he says.Instead, he says, cheap Chinese phone makers, and by extension Mediatek, embodies the process by which technology is brought from rich developed markets to the rest of the world living on much lower incomes.“When technology is developed it inevitably serves those who can afford it, so the value created by leading technology is to serve those whose annual consumption power of is, say $5,000 or $10,000,” Mr Tsai says. By relentlessly improving existing technology to reduce costs, “this serves a population that is a much bigger proportion of the world”.“If the financial crisis has confirmed one thing it is that emerging countries were almost not affected. Their economic development will continue and the opportunities there will be bigger,” he says.As well as being a keen student of the management theories that have underpinned Mediatek’s growth, Mr Tsai’s other big hobby is reading history books. Mediatek is now trying to repeat the history of its own feat with 2G phones by bringing prices down on more advanced 3G smartphones.But Mr Tsai already has his eyes on a new management theory: reverse innovation, a process whereby goods developed as inexpensive models to meet the needs of emerging markets are repurposed as low-cost products for western consumers.The idea makes sense, Mr Tsai says, “because the emerging economies are a big market with billions of consumers, but what they need are low-cost, affordable solutions. This forces you to innovate.”
515;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-10-14T17:13:13Z;Intel ready to close the gap on rivals;;Intel issued a clear warning this week that it intends to be a leading player in tablets, a category where its microprocessors have so far failed to figure.The world’s biggest chipmaker has so far been happy to defend its dominant position in netbooks with its Atom processor, while biding time for the tablet market to mature.But weakness in netbooks in the third quarter and fears that sales could be cannibalised by tablets has brought Paul Otellini, chief executive, off the fence.In pointed remarks during Tuesday’s analyst conference call covering Intel’s quarterly earnings, Mr Otellini said he wanted to respond to “the big question on everybody’s minds” of how Intel would respond to its lack of a presence in tablets. He congratulated Apple on inventing the category and predicted tablets would expand the computer market just as netbooks had done.This fitted with his forecasts earlier this year that tablets would be “additive” rather than taking away from other PC sales, but this time he went on to admit that tablets could impact some PC sales.“At the margin, they probably will. Consumers will have a limited amount of discretionary income and some will choose to purchase a tablet instead of upgrading an existing PC or purchasing a netbook in any given period,” he said.But in the long run, tablets would help grow the overall PC market, he insisted. “At Intel, we are going to utilise all of the assets that are at our disposal to win this segment,” he said, adding that Intel was working with partners on tablets running Windows, Android and its own MeeGo operating system.However, Intel is unlikely to dominate in tablets in the same way it has taken over the netbook category.AMD, its closest rival, is launching its Ontario platform, a low-power chip competitor to Atom, next year. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia also competes here with its Tegra processor.Both could win customers manufacturing 10-inch tablets, which could run Windows and serve as netbook replacements. Tablets, with screens of about seven inches, are seen more as enlarged smartphones. Makers may favour Arm-based chips from established smartphone suppliers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.This category of chipmakers are moving into e-readers and tablets after the failure of the smartbook category, which attempted to combine a netbook’s features with the long battery life, connectivity and always-on state of a smartphone.
516;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Win Phone 7 is Qualcomm lock, no TI, Intel;;Microsoft and Intel’s close bonds on the operating system and processor that dominate PCs became known as the Wintel partnership, but Wincomm is now the name of the game on mobile phones.All nine Windows Phone 7 smartphones announced globally on Monday will run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets and the two companies are making much of the exclusivity.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, led off a video of partners discussing the merits of Windows Phone 7 at the New York launch event.His counterpart at Microsoft Steve Ballmer features in a video on Qualcomm’s website.A Qualcomm blog post states: “Our relationship has never been stronger, and we are excited to help Microsoft bring a new generation of handsets to market, all featuring Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile processors.”The coup for Qualcomm is not good news for Texas Instruments, which has been strongly represented in smartphones such as the Palm Pre and Motorola Droid.Its Omap 3 processor was chosen by Samsung for its Omnia Windows phone, but the new Omnia 7 will feature the Snapdragon processor.This could be because TI’s latest Omap 4 processor is arriving this quarter, just a little too late for the initial Windows Phone 7 lineup, but Qualcomm does have a lock on the category now that could be hard to break.As for Intel, this is another cold shoulder for its “Moorestown” Atom chip, unveiled in May but without a major phone to its name to date.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said at its Intel Developer Forum last month that there would be announcements of a couple of major phones next year, but the chipmaker faces an uphill struggle against the established Arm-based chips of Qualcomm and TI.
517;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-10-07T00:43:58Z;iPhone order points to Verizon link-up;;Apple has ordered a large supply of iPhones that run on networks used by Verizon Wireless and other carriers that have yet to offer the devices in a step that could greatly increase the smartphone’s penetration.The move comes in the face of increasing competition from rival devices running Google software.As the largest US mobile carrier, Verizon has long been thought a likely partner for Apple, and a rise in production by manufacturers in Asia of iPhones with the Qualcomm chips compatible with the CDMA network has heightened expectation of a deal. James Ratcliffe, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said production had been ramped up to such a degree that Verizon must be an expected customer. China Mobile is another logical carrier for the new iPhones, he and others said.Apple has moved beyond exclusive deals with carriers in most of the world but in the US, the company has stayed with AT&T since the 2007 launch of the iPhone. Congestion on the network has been a prime complaint from customers.Apple is feeling more pressure to expand in the US because of the surge in phones running Google’s Android, which is backed by all carriers and many manufacturers.Nielsen, a consumer research company, this week reported that Android phones accounted for 32 per cent of US smartphone purchases in August, up from 28 per cent a month earlier, while Apple devices slipped to 25 per cent from 26 per cent.Lowell McAdam, president of Verizon Communications, Verizon Wireless’s majority owner, said on Wednesday that he expected Verizon to offer an iPhone at some point, but would not discuss timing.“Apple is the one that really has to make that announcement,” he said.Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment.Mr Ratcliffe said that neither Apple nor Verizon would be able to publicly confirm a launch until AT&T’s exclusivity ends because that would lead some customers to hold off on buying phones with AT&T service and violate the carrier’s terms with Apple.Nonetheless, he said, “the evidence is very strong that they will be a customer for the iPhone and will be offering it in early 2011”.Verizon is rolling out a new version of its network which, Mr McAdam said, would suit a range of new devices. The company announced it was accelerating the roll out, moving the 4G network based on a technology called LTE (long- term evolution) into 38 markets this year.
518;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-10-05T22:47:52Z;Qualcomm ends sales of FLOp TV;;Qualcomm’s bold experiment of building a mobile TV network in the US from the ground up can officially be called a failure with the suspension of sales of its FLO TV Personal TV standalone device.The San Diego-based chipmaker said on Tuesday it expected to maintain the network till next spring for existing subscribers and there would be refunds in the event of its closure. Some layoffs are also anticipated in the near future.FLO TV will continue as a service on AT&T and Verizon handsets for the time being, but it seems only a matter of time before Qualcomm pulls the plug or disposes of FLO.The company had invested $800m initially in setting up a nationwide broadcast network and recruiting content partners to provide a multi-channel television service powered by its mobile phone chips.Its FLO TV Personal TV, built by HTC, was a TV with a 3.5-inch screen, costing $150 and then a $15 a month subscription for its channels.While the lineup was impressive, with channels from the major networks and cable channels such as ESPN sports, CNBC financial news and MTV music, Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, said not nearly enough people were watching.Live sports did appear to be popular and there was a spike during the World Cup, but Qualcomm announced in July it was exploring other options for the service.This was continuing, it said on Tuesday:“We have been engaging in conversations with a wide range of partners for both the network and the spectrum. We are seeing strong interest in using the FLO TV network or spectrum to capitalise on the growing imbalance between mobile data supply and demand, the growth of tablets, and consumer demand for high quality video and print content, and a richer user experience.”Consumers do seem to want to watch video content on the go, but more in bite-sized pieces and less in the standard channel format of FLO TV. With smartphones, technology like FLO TV is becoming unnecessary – regular mobile browsers can now play video on demand and stream live TV, often for free.FLO TV would have stood a better chance if it offered features unavailable elsewhere, such as high-definition and DVR capabilities. It also lacked local programming, something the Open Mobile Video Coalition is eventually planning to provide.FLO TV’s main competitor on handsets is MobiTV, which insisted on Tuesday that its business was strong:“We are integrated with every major carrier in North America, every major handset manufacturer and every major content partner. World-class companies depend on the operational reliability of the MobiTV Accelerated Media Platform to deliver content to over 13m managed subscribers. We’ve proven the market in mobile,” it said in a statement.Mobile TV programming may also have a future in cars, where Qualcomm has partnered with Audiovox, although it has faced competition from satellite operators.But in terms of a dedicated device for watching mobile television, the FLO TV Personal TV is heading to the gadget recycling centre.
519;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-08-31T18:48:25Z;Wireless chipmakers;Intel's takeover of Infineon leaves the market open to disruption;There are still a few billion people left on the planet yet to own a computer. And a large proportion of these unwebbed will get their first taste of processing power from the most personal of computers: smartphones. At the same time mobile phone technology is finding its way into other consumer devices, for example providing books and map updates on the go. No wonder then that Intel, which makes the microprocessors found in four of every five PCs sold globally, this week snapped up the wireless chip business of Germany’s Infineon.Up for grabs is a $30bn annual semiconductor market. While 2010 mobile phone unit sales should be around a tenth higher on last year, the smartphone portion – which contains more valuable silicon – is expanding at three times that rate. As smartphone units replace simpler phones, average selling prices for chipmakers should stay reasonably stable, even as smartphone prices themselves continue to fall. New devices such as e-readers and media tablets are still in the tens of millions range, but such growth is incremental and technologically straightforward to address. Gartner forecasts revenue growth for the mobile application processor market of 22 per cent annually from 2009 to 2014.Production is still relatively dispersed. Qualcomm is the biggest manufacturer, supplying processors for 80 per cent of smartphones using Android, the fastest growing mobile operating system. But Qualcomm only takes 30 per cent of wireless chip market revenues overall, calculates consultancy iSuppli. While the competition has shrunk over the last five years from around 15 suppliers of baseband (a phone’s internal modem) to five which count, the market is still open to distruptive innovation.The source of that disruption remains to be seen. Texas Instruments is winding down its baseband business in wireless to concentrate on processors, while Intel is heading in the opposite direction – Infineon’s engineers are expert in cramming several functions onto one chip. It is not hard to understand the appeal.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
520;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-07-27T09:40:27Z;MediaTek and NTT Docomo in 4G alliance;;MediaTek is going decidedly upscale. The Taiwanese company, the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips to China, was until a year ago still best known as the enabler of gray market ‘bandit phones’ that flooded Chinese and other emerging markets.Within the past year, however, MediaTek has increasingly sold its chips to top-tier international phone brands such as Samsung and LG, and expanded its repertoire to include an advanced third-generation chip for smartphones. On Tuesday it announced its next step – licensing fourth-generation LTE technology from Japan’s NTT Docomo.Tsai Ming-kai, chairman and chief executive of MediaTek, said the agreement will provide “a smooth transition from 3G to 4G and beyond.”The agreement helps bring MediaTek to the cutting edge of wireless chip technology on a par with Western rivals such as Qualcomm, and to diversify its sales from emerging countries, where it is already expecting explosive growth, to Japan and other mature markets.The two companies said that besides technology licensing, MediaTek will also work with NTT Docomo in inter-operability testing and “joint worldwide marketing and technology initiative”, which suggests the future possibility of an NTT Docomo-branded 4G phone running a MediaTek chip inside.By working with MediaTek to bolster its own-branded lineup of phones, NTT Docomo reduces the need to provide subsidies for other brands’ phones. As operators worldwide now face having to make large investments to upgrade their network to fourth-generation technology, such a model could increasingly be emulated beyond Japan – a threat to established mobile phone makers who have long relied on operator subsidies to make their phones affordable to consumers.Separately, MediaTek’s move to LTE-PF is a blow to the Taiwan-backed, rival WiMAX standard. MediaTek already also produces a WiMAX chip, so it is unlikely to only choose one standard over another, but its announcement Tuesday marks the first time a major Taiwanese tech company has announced a move to LTE.
521;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The index made its largest leap for two weeks, with industrials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued his testimony to Congress. But his comments largely reflected topics covered on Wednesday and did not weigh on sentiment. Investors also downplayed data that showed US jobless claims rose more steeply than expected last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were up 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000.There was some relief as existing house sales fell less than expected by a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in June. The S&P 500 housebuilders rose 3.4 per cent.Michael Yoshikiami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET, said: “When you see home sales numbers and jobless claims numbers that go beyond this earnings season, we can see that the next earnings season is going to be the one that’s very difficult.” He added that although companies were raising earnings projections, it was because their original forecasts were “unreasonably negative”.Among stocks in the news, AmeriCredit surged 21.4 per cent to $23.91 after General Motorsannounced it was buying the auto finance lender for $24.50 a share.

Its shares rose 5.2 per cent to $63.15. Demand for smartphones boosted earnings at AT&T, the largest US phone group and Qualcomm, which makes chips for mobile phones. AT&T reported better than expected profits. Earnings before some exceptional items were 61 cents per share, against average estimates of 57 cents. Its shares rose 2.4 per cent to $25.51.Shares in Qualcomm pushed up 8.2 per cent to $39.11 as it benefited from strong demand for smartphones based on Google’s Android technology which needs more complex, expensive chips.Earnings rose to 47 cents per share from 44 cents per share for the same period a year ago. The S&P financial sector rose 3.1 per cent and the regional banks rallying 3.9 per cent. Fifth Third Bancorp led the way, up 10.4 per cent to $12.45 after posting its first profit in four quarters and announcing lower loan loss provisions.Other companies beating expectations included Ebay, which rose 3.8 per cent to $20.94. Philip Morris International was up 1.9 per cent to $50.84.Starbucks raised full-year guidance after it reported a 37 per cent rise in third quarter profit, in line with expectations. Its shares fell 0.1 per cent to $24.69."
523;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-07-22T00:54:30Z;Qualcomm buoyed by global growth in 3G;;Qualcomm, the largest wireless chipmaker, said on Wednesday the mobile phone industry had reached a “transformative stage” as it reported third-quarter sales and profits ahead of expectations.However, it hinted that its venture into mobile television might have been an expensive flop as it announced it was in talks with partners about FLO TV’s future.The San Diego-based company reported $2.7bn in revenues, beating analyst expectations of $2.63bn, according to Thomson Reuters.Earnings of 57 cents a share were 3 cents ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Qualcomm rose 5 per cent on the news in extended trading in New York to $38. The shares are down 25 per cent on a year ago.“This is an exciting time in the wireless industry,” Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call. “We are at a transformative stage in the industry as people increasingly use their 3G devices to stay connected.”There were positive trends, he said – the rapid expansion of mobile data usage, network technologies coming online to meet the demand for more capacity and the 3G footprint becoming global with licences awarded in India.New types of devices were emerging that used 3G, he said, in a reference to eReaders, netbooks and devices such as Qualcomm’s own Personal TV product.Qualcomm stood to benefit with its technology licensing and modem chips from the number of wireless subscribers passing 5bn, with 1bn being on 3G devices, supported by 85 per cent of the world’s networks.The company said it had shipped a record 103m modem chips based on its CDMA technology in its third quarter and it raised sales and profits guidance for the fiscal year.It expected sales to rise in a range with a midpoint of $2.85bn, compared to $2.7bn previously, while profits were forecast to rise by about 80 per cent on a year ago to $2.33-$2.37 per share up from $2.2-$2.32.Qualcomm has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its FLO TV service, building a network infrastructure and striking content deals in the US, but making little impression overseas.Its chips and service is embedded in Verizon and AT&T phones and its Personal TV device, but Mr Jacobs admitted recently that take-up of the service had been disappointing.The tenor of his remarks to analysts on Wednesday suggested Qualcomm was prepared to dispose of the service or find other uses for it.“We are in discussions with a number of partners regarding the future direction of the business. We are considering a number of alternatives,” he said.
524;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-07-12T21:12:32Z;Wall St posts small gains ahead of earnings;;US stocks inched slightly higher on Monday as investors cautiously awaited Alcoa’s quarterly results, after the market close, to kick off the earnings season.The aluminium producer posted modestly better than expected second-quarter earnings of 13 cents per share.Frank Germack, director of the investment department at Rehmann Financial, a division of Rehmann, said: “Folks are nervous about the next couple of weeks. We’re probably going to have a pretty decent earnings season, but earnings are going to be driven by cost reductions, rather than top-line growth.”Until there is an improvement in the labour market, corporate revenues will struggle to grow, he added.At the close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,078.75. The index has risen 4.7 per cent this month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 higher to 10,216.27 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,198.36.Alcoa fell 0.6 per cent to $10.87. Analysts’ average earnings estimate was for 12 cents per share for the second quarter.Hewitt Associates jumped 32.2 per cent to $46.79 as Aon, the world’s largest insurance broker by market capitalisation, agreed to buy the provider of human resources outsourcing and consulting services for about $4.9bn in a cash and stock deal.The move is aimed at expanding Aon’s unit that advises companies on employee pay and benefits.Shares in Aon fell the most in the S&P 500 index, down 7.1 per cent to $35.62.US-listed shares in BP rallied 8 per cent to $36.76 as the oil company continued work on a new capping system for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The cap could still take several days to install.The company is also reported to be in talks with Apache on a deal to sell stakes in its Alaska operations. Shares in Apache were down 3.2 per cent to $85.07. ExxonMobil rose 0.3 per cent to $58.94 amid speculation that the company may be considering a bid for BP.Johnson & Johnson lost 0.6 per cent to $60.21 as the consumer products company said it would buy Micrus Endovascular for about $480m to expand its portfolio of medical devices that treat strokes. It represents a premium of about 5.5 per cent to Friday’s closing price of $22.19. The company expects the deal to be “slightly dilutive” to full-year earnings per share. Shares in Micrus were up 4.5 per cent to $23.19.Weyerhaeuser was the session’s best performer as the stock rallied 8.4 per cent to $38.86. The timberland and forest products company declared a special dividend worth a combined $5.6bn. The pay-out to shareholders is part of its plan to convert to a real estate investment trust.Financial services stocks were mixed ahead of a number of banks reporting their second-quarter earnings later in the week.Bank of America and Citigroup, both of which report second-quarter earnings on Friday, climbed 0.7 per cent higher to $15.21 and 1.7 per cent to $4.11 respectively. Playboy surged 40.9 per cent to $5.55 as Hugh Hefner, its founder, offered to buy all the shares he does not own to take it private, in a deal that values the company at around $185m.Mr Hefner has offered $5.50 a share in cash, a premium of about 40 per cent to its $3.94 closing price on Friday. He already owns about 69.5 per cent of the class A common stock and 27.7 per cent of its class B stock.Qualcomm advanced 3.5 per cent to $35.10 as Goldman Sachs added the phone chipmaker to its “conviction buy list”, citing accelerating smartphone sales growth.Rival chipmaker Texas Instruments improved 1.1 per cent to $24.75, while Fairchild Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $9.27.Marriott International, the hotel chain, was down 0.6 per cent to $30.97 as the stock was downgraded to “market perform” from “outperform” by Jeffrey Donnelly at Wells Fargo Securities.Shares in Paychex, a provider of payroll and human resources services, was down 2 per cent to $25.75 as Jonathan Judge, the company’s chief executive, resigned to pursue other interests.
525;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-07-11T22:53:24Z;Mobile TV achieves World Cup goals;;"Mobile TV in the US has had a good World Cup, according to viewing statistics released by MobiTV  and Qualcomm’s FloTV.
 But now the last ball has been kicked, are there any compelling reasons to keep watching?FLO TV says it set several new service viewership records, with the France-Mexico game becoming its most-watched sports programme, Mexico-South Africa second most-watched and average viewing times hitting a record 41 minutes on June 22 driven by the Mexico-Uruguay game.That also suggests a big soccer-loving Hispanic quotient watching the service, but Flo TV thinks other sports will attract big viewership figures as well“In the coming months, we plan to add major franchises to our already strong sports line-up,” said Bill Stone, Flo TV president.Tellingly, FLO TV does not give any actual viewership numbers, which are believed to be small. Flo TV has not taken off as hoped for on AT&T and Verizon handsets and on its dedicatedFlo TV personal television .“There are people who love it, but the numbers are not nearly what we expected ,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, admitted last month.MobiTV gave harder numbers saying it had streamed more than 88m minutes of World Cup coverage up to July 2. It delivers more than 1,200 live sporting events per year but the World Cup, on ESPN Mobile TV, was its highest performing live event to date.It expects to beat handily in 2010 the 2bn minutes of mobile media content it streamed last year on the four major US wireless carriers.I tried both services side-by-side – MobiTV on my Sprint HTC Evo and Flo TV on the personal television.They were both great for following the World Cup during morning commute times, when many of the games were played, but both suffered frustrating signal losses when the picture would stutter, freeze or disappear.While the HTC-made Flo TV player is well designed and has a useful foldback stand, I found it difficult to wake up on occasions. Picture quality was bright but not that sharp.It seems to offer little advantage over a smart phone’s service – features missing that would set it apart would be widescreen HD video, a DVR capability to pause and store programming and better content, perhaps including an added radio service.Both MobiTV and Flo would greatly benefit from the addition of local programming and full services from the major broadcasters. The Open Mobile Video Coalition  is working towards this, but mobile TV still has a way to go to reach such integration and mass adoption.US viewers are expected to grow from 3.1m last year to 3.5m in 2010 and reach 5m by 2014,according to the iSuppli research firm."
526;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-06-17T02:02:48Z;Qualcomm faces fresh EU inquiry;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, is facing fresh allegations of anticompetitive conduct in Europe – just six months after seeing off a four-year probe by Europe’s competition watchdog.The new complaint, being looked at by the European Commission, comes from Icera, a UK rival, which claims that Qualcomm is using patent-related incentives to discourage customers from doing business with Icera.The probe is at an early stage but, if pursued by the Commission, could mark the start of a battle between the small venture capital-backed UK start-up and the world’s largest wireless chipmaker.Qualcomm and Icera make chips for high-speed 3G mobile phone connections. The UK company has a head start over rival chipmakers on an innovative software-based design for its chips, which could make them easier and cheaper for hardware makers to use.Mobile phone operators such as AT&T, Vodafone and Softbank are using Icera chips for “dongles”, which allow customers to connect laptops to mobile broadband services.“Qualcomm may be getting a little worried about pricing. It is struggling to maintain its 60 per cent margins and now it is seeing these guys coming into the market with a soft modem that could potentially disrupt the pricing further,” said Lee Simpson, semiconductor analyst at Jefferies.The timing of the new complaint is unfortunate for Qualcomm, which just six months ago saw the end of a four-year probe by antitrust officials in Brussels.That case involved complaints from six big manufacturers who claimed that Qualcomm had refused to license patents to chip set competitors “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”, while “offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chip sets exclusively from Qualcomm”.But Nokia and Broadcom subsequently withdrew their objections after reaching settlements with Qualcomm and, last November, the remaining complainants withdrew. The Commission said only that it had not reached formal conclusions.Qualcomm said on Wednesday night that it understood the Icera complaint was at “a very preliminary stage” and added that it was reviewing the allegations.“We do note, however, the similarity between Icera’s allegations and those in complaints made previously to the EU, which apparently failed to persuade the Commission and were ultimately withdrawn. We believe the new allegations to be equally meritless,” it said.Qualcomm stressed it would co-operate fully with the Commission, which declined to comment. Icera declined to comment.
527;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-06-16T00:02:33Z;Mobile networks: The race is on to keep the data flowing;;"Smartphones – such as Apple’s iPhone or Research In Motion’s BlackBerry – have given mobile operators a much needed boost during the recession. Sales of these high-end, usually higher margin handsets have continued to grow.Research by US-based analysts comScore, found that smartphone sales in Europe’s five largest markets grew 32 per cent in 2009, and by a staggering 70 per cent in the UK.Internal data compiled by Nokia Siemens Networks, the cellular equipment vendor, found that 11 per cent of consumers said they accessed the internet using a mobile handset in 2008; by last year, the figure was 33 per cent.As a result, mobile networks are starting to show the strain from far greater numbers of more sophisticated users and handsets. Smartphones, with their “always on” connections and data-intensive applications, are rapidly using up scarce radio spectrum, with one chief technology officer calling it “the iPhone problem”.The problem is not, of course, restricted to smartphones: 3G dongles, 3G-equipped laptops and even devices such as satellite navigation sets or Amazon’s Kindle, which downloads data in the background, are causing capacity shortages.According to research carried out by analysts at Exane BNP Paribas, an investment bank, for WiFi operator The Cloud, mobile networks are likely to run out of data capacity within the next three years – and in some areas, as soon as a year.The typical mobile network subscriber will use two to three times as much data in 2012 as they do today, the research predicts. But the aggregate increase in data traffic – combining both subscriber growth and those subscribers each using more data – could see network data traffic increasing 10-fold year on year.Some operators are certainly seeing phenomenal growth. At the CTIA Wireless event in Las Vegas in March, AT&T reported a 500 per cent rise in data traffic. AT&T is the exclusive US carrier for the iPhone, as well as for the Palm Pre.“There are three main problems,” explains Ed Marsden, partner in the tele­communications practice at Deloitte. “The first is the volume of devices using the network. There are now 600m mobile broadband connections, and smartphones have overtaken PCs.“The second factor is how consumers are using these devices. With ‘all you can eat’ data plans, we’ve gone from under-utilisation to congestion. One large US operator has identified a 5,000 per cent increase in data growth in the past three years.“The third is our level of understanding of, and the optimisation of, networks. Some smartphones strain the network: they generate eight times the signal load of a mobile broadband [dongle] connection. It’s about understanding how the network is being used and where the pinch-points are.”There is little doubt that the mobile data industry is becoming a victim of its own success. But as yet, it seems unable to agree on a solution, nor on the likely threat of mobile network congestion to business users of data services.At the network level, some operators are pinning their hopes on a move to a fourth-generation technology known as Long Term Evolution, or LTE, which promises more efficient use of the radio spectrum, especially for data traffic. The greater spectrum range should allow more users to connect at maximum bandwidth at the same time.Even vendors of fourth-generation equipment, however, acknowledge that LTE might be too little and too late to solve the network capacity problem.Operators have been conserving cash during the downturn, so the first large-scale LTE deployments, such as that of US carrier Verizon – will only start in earnest this year.Moreover, few devices currently support LTE, and for an operator to make full use of the spectrum, it will need to move significant numbers of users to the new radio technology.As an interim measure, operators are starting to look at alternative radio technologies, including WiFi, WiMax, and even multicast transmission technologies, such as Qualcomm’s MediaFlo, to handle some of the data traffic.On a more localised level, operators are looking at femtocells to add capacity. These small cellular base stations plug into a business or home user’s broadband line, and route traffic via that connection to the operator’s network. Larger, picocells could be used in public areas.Samir Khazaha, a senior director at Qualcomm, the cellular technology vendor, says: “Networks are going to rely on more picocells and femtocells, and a proliferation of antennae, so wherever users are, there is one nearby.”Although almost all smartphones are equipped with multi-radio chips, which can operate over both WiFi and 3G connections, not all handsets manage the transition to WiFi with ease. As a result, operators would need to develop software that switches phones to the nearest available connection without the need for user intervention.Unfortunately, outside some very busy areas, such as airports and railway stations, WiFi rarely provides seamless coverage.To fill in these gaps, operators would need to persuade private businesses or even individual broadband subscribers to open up their access points to wireless traffic. As yet, there is no proven business model for this.Sylvain Fabre, a research director at Gartner, the industry analyst, says: “WiFi is not ubiquitous, so it won’t allow operators to offload everything they need to offload.”Nor does better local radio coverage solve all the operators’ problems; they will also need to upgrade their core networks.“Operators will have to build a core network that supports any type of traffic and have the technique to monitor traffic in real time,” explains Thierry Maupilé, head of strategy and business development at Starent, a Cisco company.Such networks, he suggests, will have to prioritise traffic depending on who the user is and what they are trying to do.A “gold” tier business user might have traffic routed over a connection with a guaranteed service level; a standard-rate consumer might receive a “best efforts” service, but pay rather less.This could, ultimately, offer the best solution to operators needing to manage capacity and constrain capital expenditure: to restrict demand.It might be hard, or even impossible, to wean consumers from flat-rate data pricing, but that need not mean they have to receive the same service as higher-value, business users."
528;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;An insight into the 4G future;HTC’s EVO is bristling with features;"Increasing numbers of smartphones that aim to deliver a broadband-style internet experience are expected to become available over the next few years, as the big mobile network operators start rolling out so-called fourth-generation technology.But a question remains as to whether 4G handsets will deliver on their makers’ and network operators’ promises to bring bandwidth-hungry applications such as streaming video, two-way videoconferencing and location-based services to mobile users.I have been testing the first 4G smartphone to be available – HTC’s EVO 4G, which goes on sale for $199 with a new two-year contract from Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator, next week.HTC, the Taiwan-based smartphone maker, has launched a wide range of handsets recently as it vies with leaders in the smartphone market, such as Apple and Research in Motion.The new handset uses Sprint’s 3G network for ordinary voice calls but can switch to Clearwire’s WiMax-based 4G network for data-heavy applications in areas of the country where the Clearwire WiMax network has been rolled out, including several East Coast US cities but not yet New York (Sprint holds a majority stake in Clearwire).Even without its 4G mobile broadband capabilities, HTC’s Android-powered EVO 4G smartphone is an impressive touchscreen-based handset because it combines many of the best features found in other devices to produce what could start a whole new category, which might possibly be called “superphones”.It competes directly with the latest generation of 3G-based smartphones, which includes HTC’s own Droid Incredible and HD2, Apple’s iPhone 3GS and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry Bold (see right), all of which have many advantages except they lack the EVO’s WiMax capabilities.Like the Droid Incredible, the EVO 4G uses Qualcomm’s popular 1Ghz Snapdragon processor. It runs Goog­le’s Android 2.1 operating system, en­hanced with HTC’s Sense user interface – my personal favourite because of its design and smooth operation.The EVO 4G can operate as a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to eights users – a knockout feature that should be built into all smartphones (Palm’s Pre Plus also includes it). That means if you are a laptop or netbook user, you do not have to pay for a separate cellular data card and, in areas where 4G is available, you can talk and send or receive data at the same time.In terms of the physical device, one of the EVO 4G’s most striking features is its big 4.3in, 800-by-480-pixel multi-touchscreen. The same size as the HD2’s, the screen is significantly bigger than on most other smartphones, including the iPhone 3GS. The EVO 4G is bigger than most smartphones but not too unwieldy. Otherwise, sleek minimalism is the order of the day: the four navigation buttons (home, menu, back, search) – similar to other HTC handsets – just under the display are touch keys.Next to the screen in one corner is one of the EVO 4G’s most inspired features: a second camera designed for the videoconferencing that is expected to be one of the key services enabled by 4G mobile networks. One edge has a 3.5mm headphone socket and the power button, while the opposite edge houses a mini-HDMI port (for sending digital images, video and sound to a flatscreen TV or other display) and the micro-USB connector for charging and data transfer.On the back is an 8Mp camera with dual flash lighting, which takes good images – though not as good as most dedicated point-and-shoot cameras – and reasonable HD video. One of my favourite features, which is just common sense, is a flip-out kick-stand that means you can prop up the handset in vertical or landscape mode.The EVO 4G comes loaded with a good selection of Android applications, including productivity apps (for e-mail, messaging and document viewing); others, such as FriendStream, that integrate social networks (Facebook, Twitter and Flickr); and a YouTube video viewer. I downloaded a bunch of other free apps, including ABC’s free video and TV show viewer, which works well on the big screen. Other apps, such as HTC’s Sense music player, work well enough but lack the visual richness of iTunes or Microsoft’s Zune interface.Video streaming using the 4G WiMax network was smooth. The handset comes with an app, called Qik, that enabled me to stream live videos from my handset to friends and to a PC at home running the desktop version of the software.The onscreen keyboard is acceptable but still no match for a physical mini-keyboard such as those found on BlackBerrys or the Motorola Droid. Other limitations of the device inc­lude the short battery life, which undoubtedly suffers because of the power-hungry screen and the addition of the 4G technology (on top of the 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS technologies). I managed about six hours between charges – as good as many other smartphones but relatively poor compared with BlackBerrys and ordinary mobile phones.Generally, I found the WiMax network supported download speeds of about 6Mbps (MB per second) and upload speeds – sending a video file to YouTube or to friends, for example – of about 1Mbps were much faster than most 3G networks but about the same as T-Mobile USA’s HSPA+ network.If future 4G handsets match this performance, they will deliver real value to users who want to use high-speed mobile data services, especially those who rely on video.So far, Clearwire’s WiMax service covers only a dozen or so big US metro areas. Fortunately, the EVO 4G operates as an impressive 3G smartphone at a good price anyway.paul.taylor@ft.com"
529;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-05-16T22:13:51Z;Chip market still tough for Arm Holdings;Semiconductor designer face challenge to make iPad work pay;Arm Holdings scored a coup recently with the revelation that chips based on the company’s designs are running Apple’s iPad tablet, one of the most hyped and desired pieces of computer equipment to hit the market this year.Although not officially confirmed by either Arm or Apple, the news has helped underline Arm’s position as one of the UK’s technology stars.The shares have reacted well to the news, rising by more than 30 per cent since the start of the year against a 3 per cent fall in the wider FTSE 100. The company now has a market capitalisation of more than £3.2bn ($4.6bn).Yet in spite of the company’s involvement with such a high-profile device, analysts have started to put sell recommendations on the stock, or at least moved it from buy to hold.Concerns have grown about the valuation – a hefty 37 times forecast earnings for this year – and the company’s relatively precarious position in the brutal semiconductor market.Arm creates the architecture for the low-powered semiconductors found in more than 90 per cent of the mobile phones in the world, as well as in a host of other devices from cameras to power switches.Yet generating sizeable revenues from such a wide reach is proving to be tough. About 1.2bn mobile phones were sold last year – with smartphones accounting for 172.4m of that – but Arm’s annual revenue was just $489.5m.“They have saved billions of dollars in research expenses for the mobile industry over the last decade but it’s not the business model that people think it is,” said Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies.“Arm should have been going gangbusters after the big smartphone Christmas we just had, but there is a disconnect there,” Mr Simpson went on.The problem is that Arm has very little pricing power. It receives a royalty of about 1 per cent from each chip using its intellectual property. Applications processor chips that run smartphones cost somewhere between $15 to $20, meaning about 15 to 20 cents for Arm.However, many of the less complex Arm-based chips sell for less than $1.Average royalties per chip were 5 cents for Arm in the first quarter of 2010, down from close to 9 cents six years ago. It has been trying to inch the royalty rate up to 2 per cent but Warren East, chief executive, admits progress is slow.“We push it as hard as we can, but not too hard. The semiconductor world is littered with companies we no longer hear about, because they tried to charge too much,” Mr East said. “Yes, we help the chipmakers save money on research and development, but there comes a time when they say we are making enough out of them.”Discussion of the royalty rates will be one of the key themes at Arm’s analyst and investor day on Wednesday.If Arm put up its royalty rates too much, chipmakers would be likely to start looking at designing their own semiconductors again, as Intel does with the x86 chips that are used in most of the world’s computers.Qualcomm, the US chipmaker, which currently licenses Arm technology, easily has the resources to do this. Wider competition from Intel is becoming a real risk for Arm.Intel has recently developed low-powered Atom-branded chips, which could begin to replace Arm-based semiconductors in mobile phones. So far, Intel has only had success in netbooks, or small, low-powered portable computers.The chips have not been power-efficient enough for mobiles up to now but the latest version of Atom has reduced energy consumption 50 times.“It is still a little clunky, but the chip is now within an order of magnitude of what Arm can do,” Mr Simpson said.Arm is fighting back by making its own inroads into Intel’s traditional computing territory.US chip manufacturer Marvell, for example, recently announced that it would start shipping an Arm-based chip for computer servers later this year.Arm and Intel will go head-to-head later this year, battling for inclusion in tablet computers like the iPad. While Arm has secured a slot in the Apple device, Intel may be used by many competitors.Intel and Nokia, for example, have an alliance which may lead to the development of new types of tablets.Arm’s progress in this category may be hampered by the fact that the Microsoft’s Windows operating system does not work on Arm devices, although Linux and Google’s Chrome systems do.Pricing power is not likely to improve from here. Even more than before, Arm will have to continue its meek and ungreedy approach.Arm investors may have to do the same.
530;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-05-13T20:06:16Z;Battle of the smartphones;HTC’s Droid Incredible is latest to take on iPhone;Names can become a hostage to fortune but Taiwan’s HTC clearly hopes this will not be the case with the Droid Incredible. While the latest in HTC’s rapidly expanding portfolio of smartphones may not quite qualify as “incredible”, it is perhaps the best Android operating system-based handset to date.I have been testing the Incredible, which was launched in the US a few weeks ago on the Verizon Wireless network, and comparing it to some of its rivals, including another new HTC smartphone, the HD2 from T-Mobile USA. The Incredible is similar to HTC’s Desire, which was recently launch­ed in Europe, while the HD2 is also available in Europe and Asia.The Incredible is similar in size and weight to the iPhone, has an excellent touchscreen, a very fast processor and can be configured easily by users to their own personal requirements. As with the iPhone, users have ac­cess to a wide range of free and low-cost software apps.With its slightly soft, black case, the Incredible looks like many other touchscreen-based smartphones, al­though its interior is a surprising red. The large, bright 3.7in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen is slightly larger than the one on the iPhone 3GS. The HTC HD2’s very sensitive screen is even bigger at 4.3in and is its outstanding feature. Both screens deliver a resolution of 800 by 480 pixels, also a step up from the 480 by 320 pixel resolution of the iPhone 3GS. The HTC screens are excellent for indoor use but in bright outdoor sunshine they are less readable than, say, a BlackBerry.The Incredible is quite comfortable to hold, but the HD2 is a little bit too wide and heavy.Just under the Incredible’s screen is an optical joystick, while the back of the handset features an integrated 8 megapixel digital camera for still and video images. The camera is one of the most powerful I have used – although, disappointingly, there is no dedicated shutter button.The HD2 runs Microsoft’s Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system, has a standard set of control buttons below the screen, including a familiar Windows menu button, and a 5Mp auto-focus camera with a dual LED flash on the rear.One of the most noticeable features of both handsets is their speed – they are built round a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, which is quickly becoming a benchmark processor for high-end smartphones.Like the Motorola Droid, which was launched late last year, both the Incredible and H2D have excellent sound and had good signal reception on their respective networks when I used them. Battery life, at about five to six-and-a-half hours of talktime, is also relatively good for smartphones but fails to match my BlackBerry Bold.The big divergence between the Incredible and the HD2 is, of course, that they run different operating systems and have access to different app stores. I preferred the Incredible’s Android 2.1 operating system to Windows Mobile 6.5 (the latter will be replaced later this year by Microsoft’s new mobile phone operating system, Windows Phone 7).However, the differences are not as significant as might be expected bec­ause HTC has overlaid both operating systems with its superb Sense user interface, which I consider to be the closest rival to the iPhone version.The Incredible is particularly easy to set up, configure and personalise. But even if you decide to leave customisation for another day, the attractive de­fault home screen features a clock and a weather graphic.A finger swipe takes you to your contact list, which includes photos for easy identification, e-mail and social networking. Users can set up six additional screens while a new feature, Leap, lets you view thumbnail versions of all the open pages on one screen simply by pinching your fingers together on the home screen.Neither the Incredible nor the H2D has as extensive an online app store as the iPhone. But both do have a solid collection of basic apps that, in the case of the Incredible, include standard Android applications such as Gmail, Google Talk and YouTube as well as HTC’s Twitter app (called Peep), its photo geotagging app (Footprints) and an app called FriendStream, which integrates feeds from Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and My­Space among others. Users can also change modes so that the handset operates like a car satellite navigation system, using Google’s maps and navigation software.The Incredible makes it easy to configure corporate or personal e-mail synchronisation and, like other touch-based smartphones, has a virtual keyboard that, while less easy to use than a BlackBerry’s physical mini-qwerty keyboard, is fine for instant messaging, short e-mails and entering web search terms. Web access is smooth and fast with the Android 2.1 browser.Overall, the Incredible is an impressive smartphone and my favourite Android-based handset.

531;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-05-03T14:05:48Z;Brussels to beef up industry standards rules;;"European competition authorities will this week move to beef up rules governing the way in which all-important industry standards – used in sectors ranging from telecoms to IT – are developed.This has been an area of growing concern to regulators, particularly when companies have battled to get technologies carrying lucrative intellectual property rights incorporated into new industry-wide standards.The worry is that companies can then exploit the market power that the proprietary technology gives them.The ability of companies to make huge profits by creating technologies that then become industry standards has been at the heart of several high-profile investigations by the European Commission, Europe’s top competition regulator, notably in the computing and communication fields.It has looked, for example, at how Rambus charged for technology used in the memory chip industry; at Qualcomm’s dominance of third-generation mobile phone standards, and at the process by which a key Microsoft document format was adopted as an industry standard.Now, for the first time, competition officials at the European Commission are expected to set out how they might assess whether essential technology which becomes part of a standard is being licensed to third parties on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms” – so-called Frand commitments.One possibility could be to compare licensing fees charged before the industry has been locked into the standard with those charged afterwards; another could be to use independent expert assessments of the quality of the technology and its “centrality to the standard at issue”.Early drafts of the proposed guidelines, seen by the Financial Times, also suggest that Commission officials might outline essential criteria which the rules of standard-setting organisations themselves should meet. For example, they should guarantee that “all relevant actors can participate in the process leading to the selection of the standard”.“I think there is a concern that some of the standard-setting organisations’ rules are not clear, especially in terms of disclosure,” says Mark Powell, partner at White & CaseThe Commission’s move comes as part of a broader review of so-called “horizontal agreements” between companies, and the extent to which these may be exempted from normal competition rules. New draft guidelines, including the standardisation proposals, will be published in Brussels on Tuesday, starting a formal consultation process lasting several months.But the regulator’s focus on standard-setting has already attracted the attention of some big technology companies and their advisers, who are unhappy about the more aggressive stance. They are likely to point to the benefits of standardisation; argue that abuses are not a big issue; and suggest that tougher EU rules could isolate Europe from international standardisation policies and practices.Any attempt to set out ways of assessing “fair and reasonable” terms is also likely to be fraught. “That will be controversial – it has been argued over for years,” says one Brussels lawyer.."
532;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-04-29T22:11:54Z;Motorola swings to profit on smartphone sales;;Motorola’s mobile phone division is on track to return to profitability in the fourth quarter of this year boosted by strong first-quarter sales of Google Android-powered smartphones.Motorola shipped 8.5m handsets, including 2.3m smartphones in the first quarter, underpinning the continued turnround at the mobile handset business.It introduced six new Android-powered smartphones including the Backflip and Devour, as well as three products designed for the Asian market, expanding the company’s smartphone portfolio to eight devices.“We have made good progress,” said Sanjay Jha, Motorola co-chief executive in charge of the mobile devices and home businesses. “We had no presence in the smartphone market six months ago but now we have established ourselves as a serious player.”Motorola increased its estimate for its smartphone sales this year to between 12m and 14m from its previous guidance of 11m to 14m.Smartphones are the fastest growing segment of the mobile phone industry which is expected to become even more competitive following Hewlett-Packard’s agreement to buy Palm for $1.2bn this week.But Mr Jha, who joined the company 22 months ago from Qualcomm, said he remained confident that Motorola could succeed in the smartphone business helped by its strong relationships with network operators and its decision to choose the Android operating system.“We are in a strong position to improve our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market, particularly in light of our competitive portfolio, strengthened brand and improved carrier relationships,” he said.Mr Jha said he expected the mobile devices division, which will be spun off along with the home devices business next year, to reduce its operating losses in each of the next two quarters before becoming profitable in the fourth quarter.In the latest period the mobile phone business reported a reduced operating loss of $192m, compared with a loss of $545m a year earlier, on sales down 9 per cent to $1.6bn.The home division, which makes set-top boxes, reported an operating profit of $20m on sales down 18 per cent to $838m reflecting the depressed housing market.The enterprise mobility division reported sales of $1.7bn and operating earnings of $141m while the networks business recorded sales of $896m and particularly strong operating earnings of $112m, up from $62m a year earlier.Overall, Motorola reported net earnings of $69m, or $0.03 per share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $291m, or $0.10 per share, in the first quarter of 2009. Sales fell by 6.1 per cent to $5bn. During the quarter, the Motorola generated positive operating cashflow of $485m and ended the quarter with net cash of about $4.5bn.Looking ahead, Motorola forecast second-quarter earnings of $0.07 to $0.09 per share.
533;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-04-26T22:40:35Z;Texas Instruments’ investments pay off;;Texas Instruments said on Monday that its investments in new manufacturing capacity through the downturn were paying off, with record first-quarter results.The second largest US chipmaker announced that profits grew from just $17m a year ago, in the depths of the recession, to $658m. Revenues rose 54 per cent to $3.21bn.TI and its bigger rival Intel have maintained their own manufacturing facilities while other US chipmakers have turned to contract manufacturers and Asian foundries.“TI invested in new manufacturing capacity for both wafer fabs and assembly/test facilities during the downturn in 2009. The strategic investments we’ve made over the years are delivering strong growth and market share gains,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive.Earnings per share rose from 1 cent to 52 cents. The results beat Wall Street expectations of 51 cents a share on revenues of $3.13bn. TI shares rose 0.6 per cent to $27.33 in extended trading on the news in New York.TI has lost its position as the leading wireless chipmaker to Qualcomm, but has been focusing on analog and embedded markets in recent years.Analog revenues grew 70 per cent year-on-year to $1.37bn, compared with 27 per cent growth in wireless to $717m.“This was the fourth quarter of excellent sequential increases, with the combined revenue of our analog and embedded processing businesses setting a new record level,” said Mr Templeton.Maintaining the upbeat outlook of chipmakers during the current earnings season, the Dallas-based company said momentum was continuing into the second quarter as demand for its products were strong.Production output was at an all-time high. More manufacturing capacity was being added to support customers, including the industry’s first analog facility on 300-millimetre diameter discs.Higher utilisation rates of its chipmaking equipment had been a major factor in boosting operating profit from $10m to $950m.Other revenues grew 68 per cent due to strength in its calculator and DLP business, which powers displays in TVs and projectors.The chipmaker expects second-quarter revenues to be between $3.31bn and $3.59bn for earnings per share in the range of 56 to 64 cents. This is ahead of analyst forecasts of revenues of $3.23bn creating profits of 53 cents a share, according to a Bloomberg survey.
534;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Cash-rich tech companies avoid M&A path;;A handful of the largest US technology companies have increased their cash mountains by 40 per cent over the past year, taking their reserves to nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars, according to figures released in recent days.Conservative balance sheet management in the face of economic uncertainty and the failure of an anticipated wave of mergers and acquisitions to materialise have resulted in a massive build-up of liquidity among a small group of leading companies.The 10 largest tech companies added more than $65bn to their reserves since the depths of the slump a year ago, according to a Financial Times analysis. That has come in spite of declining revenues over that period at companies such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and IBM.Rising competition in some big tech markets, such as mobile computing, has also led the largest companies to hoard reserves, led by Apple, now the richest tech group with nearly $42bn in cash and investments.Tech executives such as John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, had predicted that last year’s slump would lead to a shake-out in the industry with financially stronger companies looking to do deals.Few companies were prepared to sell as share prices hit their lows, however, and the speed of the turnround in tech stocks has now made big deals less attractive.Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, the world’s largest maker of wireless chips, said last week that his company had stepped up the number of small deals it carried out as it looked to acquire new technologies. But he added that bigger potential acquisitions looked too expensive.Other groups, such as Google, have increased the pace of their dealmaking in recent months to strengthen their technological capabilities as they seek to extend their reach into new parts of the tech landscape.IBM said last week that it had pulled off $1bn of acquisitions in the first quarter, mostly for cash, in a deliberate pick-up in purchases of smaller companies.Overall, however, M&A in tech receded during the slump. The value of global tech deals announced in 2009, at some $125bn, was down nearly a fifth from the year before, according to figures from Thomson Reuters. Even an increase in the first quarter this year still left the level of dealmaking at barely half its level of two years ago, before the recession.The cash build-up has led some groups to promise a return to larger share buy-backs.
535;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;S&P in late recovery to reclaim positive territory;;US stock prices staged a late comeback on Thursday to end the session higher following a well-received speech by President Obama on financial reform.A benign producer price index, falling jobless claims figures and decent existing home sales gave some support. Growing worries about Greek debt woes and a number of disappointing earnings and forecast announcements, however, weighed on the market.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,208.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent to 11,134.29 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,519.07.“The news has been pretty bullish overall [in this earnings season] but yesterday evening that changed and turned much more mixed, with high profile companies like Ebay and Qualcomm guiding the market down,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Ebay an online retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, down 5.7 per cent to $24.78 as it stood by its previous full-year earnings outlook, disappointing those who had expected it to be raised in the wake of improving e-commerce trends.Qualcomm lost 7.7 per cent to $39.35 as the chipmaker forecast lower-than-expected revenues for the full-year and said pricing was still “a challenging environment”.The pharmaceutical sector was the worst performer. “The market is very disappointed in the pharma sector. Several companies have said the healthcare bill is expected to hurt revenue growth and profits,” said Mr Kalivas.Abbott Laboratoriesfell 1.3 per cent to $51.12, Johnson & Johnson was 0.9 per cent lower at $64.78 and Eli Lilly lost 1.8 per cent to $35.38. All have said the bill will adversely affect their earnings.Verizon Communications declined 1 per cent to $29.28 on the back of weaker-than- expected first-quarter figures, with disappointing wir eless subscriber growth. Verizon’s first-quarter net income fell to $409m, or 14 cents per share, from $1.6bn, or 58 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.Soft drinks and snacks group PepsiCo slipped 1.9 per cent to $64.76 as its first quarter revenues missed estimates. However, earnings were better than Wall Street was expecting.Starbucks rallied 7.3 per cent to $27.25 as the world’s largest coffee shop operator posted strong revenues and lower costs in its first quarter results released after Wednesday’s close and raised its full-year guidance.Philip Morris tumbled 1.4 per cent to $51.24 as the tobacco group that sells Malboro cigarettes internationally reported first-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ average estimates.
536;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-04-22T20:29:27Z;Traders spooked by Greek debt plunge and poor earnings;Wall Street eyes Obama speech on financial system overhaul;21:30 BST. Intense stress in the eurozone bond markets and a rare batch of disappointing earnings reports led global markets lower, though President Barack Obama’s speech on financial reforms and some strong macroeconomic news calmed nerves later in the day.The FTSE All-World equity index fell 1.4 per cent at its low, but improved to a 0.6 per cent loss by the close. Commodities were volatile and the euro at one point tumbled to its lowest versus the dollar in nearly a year, as strong reports on the region’s manufacturing and service sectors were trumped by heightened worries about Greece.Badly received earnings from Nokia, whose shares were down 13 per cent, and news of an apparently failed attempt to fire missiles into Israel added to the tension of an extremely volatile global session.Investors have been spoilt for much of the US first-quarter earnings season. Companies from a range of sectors have beat expectations – sometimes by spectacular margins – and reinforced the belief that the global economic rebound had become entrenched.But after the bell on Wednesday, downbeat forecasts from Ebay and Qualcomm set the scene for a less impressive collection of results in Europe and the US on Thursday.The mood was further soured by another fierce plunge in the price of Greek sovereign bonds as investors feared default. The yields on 2-year notes at one point pushed above 10 per cent after rating agency Moody’s again downgraded Greek debt.US markets demonstrated their vulnerability after opening sharply amid the myriad global headwinds, though traders latched onto positive catalysts, notably Mr Obama’s speech on financial reform.Speaking early in New York, he seemed to call for a compromise, and the Democrats made moves to reconcile their differences with the opposition Republicans on reform sticking points. After he spoke, the S&P lifted off its intraday lows, and in a late-day surge, the index ended slightly higher.● Europe got an initial boost from the service sector news, but caved in to the Greece/Israel/Nokia whammy. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1 per cent, while the FTSE 100 in London shed 1 per cent as banks retreated. Athens tumbled 3.9 per cent.In New York, the S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent as poor reports from companies such as Verizon and major drugmakers were outweighed by a positive jolt from better weekly jobless claims and improving home sales numbers.Financial shares in particular reversed from a 1.4 per cent drop to 0.6 per cent gain. Sentiment on banks were further helped after a Treasury official told a derivatives conference the US would not seek to ban customised derivatives.US markets were buoyed by the pricing of seven initial public offerings, the most in one day since November 2007, and as it began to look forward to bellwether corporates expected to report well after the close, including Amazon, American Express and Microsoft.● But the world’s main focus remains Greece. Unfortunately, it is feared the negotiations between Athens and its creditors could take a week or two.Heavy selling of Greek debt on Wednesday and again on Thursday suggests they need to get a move on, though some fear an agreement will provide only a short-term solution.Jose Garcia Zarate, economist at 4Cast, said: “The market debate has shifted from the urgent issue of liquidity to the more long-term issue of solvency.”Greek government bonds saw heavy selling as a survey of economists by Reuters found one in four thought Athens would default in the next five years, and Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office’ said Greek public finances were sporting a larger deficit than thought. The Moody’s downgrade came in late European trading when most of the damage had already been done.The yield on the 10-year note jumped 79 basis points to pre-euro era highs of 8.72 per cent. The premium Athens must pay over equivalent German Bunds at one point almost breached 6 per cent. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default – as measured via credit default swaps – rose through 600bp for the first time, and briefly hit 640bp, according to Markit.Worries about sovereign risk contagion continued. The yield on Portugal’s 10-year note rose 21bp to 4.97 per cent and its CDS hit a record of 305bp, up 34 per cent on the day.US Treasury 10-year yields added 3bp to 3.77 per cent, jumping after Mr Obama’s speech spoke of an advancing economic recovery, and on concerns about the inflationary implications of the strong PPI numbers.Investors were also reminded that, while it is easy to dismiss Greece’s problems as an extreme example of fiscal profligacy, it perhaps represents more of a harbinger than an outlier. The latest data on the UK public finances found that these had not been in a worse state since the second world war. However, UK gilts appeared unconcerned, and the 10-year yield fell 4bp to 3.98 per cent.● The euro came under severe pressure as the worsening situation in the zone’s “peripheral” debt market crushed optimism following the manufacturing sector report. The single currency at one stage hit $1.320, its lowest level since the start of May 2009. It was later trading off 0.7 per cent at $1.3299.The buck rose 0.6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis to 81.64 as a reduction in risk exposure led to haven flows into the US unit.● Hopes for economic recovery helped push palladium to a two-year high near $570 an ounce in early trade, but the industrial commodities complex later fell back as risk exposure was cut. Copper pared losses to lose 1.1 per cent to $3.51 a pound in New York trading, and oil rose 0.1 per cent to $83.71 a barrel.Gold fell 0.4 per cent to $1,142 an ounce as the dollar rallied.● Asian bourses had earlier struggled as many noted that, even though Wall Street had closed flat overnight, a 5 point advance in US equity futures when the Far East had shut for business on Wednesday had turned into a 5 point decline by the time they fired up their computers on Thursday. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index fell 0.6 per cent.Shanghai and Hong Kong also had to cope with the continuing fallout from Beijing’s move to damp property speculation, the former falling 1.1 per cent and the latter off 0.3 per cent. One of the worst performers was Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 shed 1.3 per cent as a stronger yen damaged shares of exporters.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
537;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Hopes of full tech rebound thwarted;;This year’s tech rebound is not shaping up to be as strong for some parts of the industry as Wall Street had hoped, according to mixed earnings reports on Wednesday from some of the sector’s leading companies.Shares in Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile handsets, and Ebay, the internet auction company, fell as much as 8 per cent in after-market trading as they issued financial forecasts that fell short of expectations.But EMC, the largest maker of storage equipment, added fuel to hopes that tech spending by large corporate customers would continue to accelerate in the coming months as it raised its projections, sending its shares up 2 per cent.The mixed picture left a question mark over the breadth of the tech recovery, which had been stoked during the past week by strong earnings reports from Intel, Google, IBM and Apple. Wall Street has looked to tech as one of the first, and strongest, engines of recovery.Qualcomm raised its forecast for 2010 revenues to about $10.6bn, but this was below analysts’ forecasts of $10.77bn. The group’s estimate of current-quarter revenues of about $2.6bn was also below expectations of $2.66bn.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, pointed to strength in smartphone sales. “On the chip side, we saw an improved mix of higher-end devices and the licensing business saw better volume than we anticipated from the holiday season.“We’re going to continue to see strength, we should see more data usage and, with 3G auctions going on in India, we should see additional growth in 3G.”But the shares slipped back on disappointment that Qualcomm was not willing to project a stronger rebound in the months ahead. It reported profits for its March quarter of 59 cents a share, ahead of guidance of 56 to 58 cents, and sales rose 9 per cent year on year to $2.7bn.Meanwhile, Ebay shares also suffered as the company declined to raise its guidance for the year. That was in spite of first-quarter earnings from the e-commerce company that topped expectations. Ebay reported solid quarterly results, with sales up 9 per cent to $2.2bn from $2bn and net income up to $398m from $357m.The company’s PayPal unit had performed particularly strongly, gaining global share in the online transaction business, said Ebay chief executive John Donahoe. The gains at PayPal and the other businesses were being offset by the effects of a stronger US dollar.
538;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Apple lawsuit: The elephant in HTC’s new headquarters;;There are not many companies that can get both Google and Microsoft executives to show up at a construction site to say what an indispensable partner they are, but Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC did just that on Friday when they held the ground-breaking ceremony for their new HQ and R&D centre in Taipei.John Kalkman, Vice President of OEM Engineering & Services at Microsoft, said HTC was “our most important strategic partner for well over a decade . . . we would not be here with Windows Mobile without [HTC's] creativity”.Chien Lee-Feng, Google’s Taiwan general manager, said “HTC is Google Android platform’s best partner globally . . . Android wouldn’t be this successful, this welcomed” without HTC.And if further indication of HTC’s growing clout in both the mobile industry and Taiwan were needed, Paul Davies, chairman and chief executive of Qualcomm, also took to the podium to say “HTC’s emphasis is on innovation”, while Taiwan premier Wu Den-yih said “Innovation has always been a core value of HTC”.Yet for all the talk of HTC’s technological breakthroughs and creativity in design, the one topic no one wanted to touch was the one on every attending reporters’ mind: Apple’s US lawsuit alleging patent infringement against HTC and what Microsoft and Google’s stance on it would be.But Mr Kalkman only referred to the fact that HTC has sold 40m Windows-based phones across 120 models since 1997, while Google’s Mr Chien just said, “this is HTC’s event”.HTC had earlier issued a statement saying it “disagrees with Apple’s actions and will fully defend itself”. The US International Trade Commission on Wednesday said it would open an investigation into Apple’s claims, but “by instituting this investigation . . . the USITC has not yet made any decision on the merits of the case”.It seems like the elephant in the room will continue to be ignored for a while longer yet.

Home prices typically move lower in the winter months when demand is relatively light.The index was down 0.7 per cent from last January, the smallest year-on-year decrease in three years.Meanwhile, US consumer confidence figures for March were better than expected. The index increased from 46.4 last month to 52.5.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,173.27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher at 10,907.42 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent at 2,410.69.Reaction to the payrolls report will be delayed given that US equity markets will be closed on Friday.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, said: “It is not unusual for markets to trade sideways before important macro data.“The unemployment situation hasn’t improved quite as much as people expected it to.”But as stocks continue to plod steadily higher, “it’s a good market for people trying to make a few dollars,” he said.Apple was up 1.5 per cent to $235.85 – a record high – on a report that the company was developing two new iPhone models, including a CDMA version that could work on the Verizon Wireless network.Verizon Communications climbed 2.6 per cent to $31.23. AT&T, the telecommunication services provider that has exclusively offered the iPhone since its launch in 2007, was down 2.1 per cent to $25.95.Large cap financials were lower across the board.Citigroup was down 2.2 per cent at $4.09, JP Morgan Chase was 0.6 per cent lower at $44.58, Goldman Sachs lost 1.5 per cent to $171.38 and Bank of America was off 1.6 per cent to $17.76.Energy stocks pulled back. ExxonMobil declined 0.4 per cent to $67.05 and Chevron lost 0.1 per cent at $75.30.Danaher, a diversified US manufacturing company, that makes Craftsman tools, among other products, was 4.5 per cent higher at $80.88 as it increased its first-quarter earnings forecasts to 90 cents a share or more.The consensus analyst estimate had been 83 cents a share.Other industrials in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also higher. 3M climbed 3.6 per cent to $84.28 and Emerson Electric rallied 2 per cent to $50.81.Qualcomm, a maker of mobile phone chips, added 0.9 per cent to $42.13 as the stock’s target price was increased from $52 to $54 by Deutsche Bank, with a “buy” rating maintained.Diagnostic products maker Myriad Genetics lost 4.8 per cent to $23.70 as a US Federal Court ruled that its patents on two human genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers were invalid.Knight Capital, a leading US broker, declined 2.9 per cent to $15.56 on news that it had bought Urban Financial Group, an originator of residential mortgage loans for an undisclosed sum.“This deal takes Knight in a new direction, moving away from the core competency of agency brokerage into origination in the mortgage market as the company continues to diversify its product set and build out its fixed income capabilities,” wrote Chris Allen, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in a note to clients.BJ’s Wholesale Club, a discount warehouse chain, rose 1.5 per cent to $37.20 as the company said that it had increased its stock repurchase programme by $200m.As of yesterday, a total of $272m was available to the company for share repurchases.Synaptics, a maker of touch pads for electronic devices, gained 4.5 per cent to $27.48 even as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” at Cowen & Co, citing slower future growth in phone sales.
540;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-03-26T21:11:24Z;US stock indices up for fourth week in a row;;US stocks were flat on Friday after fourth-quarter growth figures were revised downward and fears of military tensions on the Korean peninsula flared up.US gross domestic product grew at a 5.6 per cent yearly rate at the end of 2009, according to the commerce department, lower than the previously estimated rate of 5.9 per cent.“Each time they revise GDP, the composition has become less favourable to the near-term outlook,” said Zach Pandl, US economist at Nomura Securities in New York. “Underlying growth in sales, excluding inventory affects, has gotten weaker each time.”The market was supported on Friday by consumer sentiment figures.The University of Michigan’s index in March was 73.6, in line with expectations, revised upward from earlier estimates of 72.5.But traders used the sinking of a South Korean ship, which was being investigated as a possible attack by North Korea, as an opportunity for profit-taking.“The market was looking at Korea as an excuse for moving lower,” said John Stoltzfus, senior market strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “We have the worst stuff in the rearview mirror. It’s not time to put on the party hat, but it was a decent week.”US indices climbed each week in March, the first four-week winning streak since last April.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,166.59, gaining 0.6 per cent since the start of the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1 per cent to 10,850.36 and 1 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent at 2,395.13 for a weekly gain of 0.9 per cent.Financials saw gains once again. Fitch, the ratings agency, said that proposed US regulatory reforms would, on balance, reduce risks for banking companies. Among the advancers was Citigroup, which was up 1 per cent to $4.31, benefiting from speculation the government might convert its warrants into shares. It rose 10.5 per cent on the week. Bank of America, was up 0.9 per cent to $17.90 for a 6.4 per cent weekly gain.Radioshack led S&P 500 gainers, adding 8.5 per cent to $23.65, after a report that it could be sold for $3bn to Best Buy, its bigger rival.The much larger electronics chain was up 5.3 per cent on the week, part of a group of closely watched consumer shares that gained after strong earnings reports.Lululemon Athletica, a sportswear retailer, was up 21 per cent on the week and Qualcomm, a maker of networking equipment, rose 4.4 per cent over the five days.“We just haven’t heard any household name companies putting out strongly negative reports,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, rose 3.1 per cent to $37.98 after an upgrade by analysts at JPMorgan from “neutral” to “overweight”. Luxury retailer Coach was also upgraded by JPMorgan. It rose 4.2 per cent to $40.31.Consol Energy issued $2.75bn of notes in advance of its planned purchase of Dominion Resources’ oil and gas reserves. It slid 1.1 per cent to $42.50 for a 6.7 per cent weekly decline.Genzyme, the drugmaker, saw its shares rise 3.7 per cent to $53 after being raised to “outperform” by analysts at Leerink Swann, the healthcare specialist group. Shares in Genzyme have been volatile as investors track activist Carl Icahn’s interest in the company, which was down 10.7 per cent on the week.Pfizer fell 1.4 per cent to $17.14 on Friday after a jury told it to pay $142m in damages related to promoting a drug for unauthorised uses.The health sector, knocked about after the US approved a healthcare reform bill, was down 1 per cent on the week, with energy and utilities also lower.The worst individual performer in energy was Chesapeake, whose shares pulled back 7.6 per cent for the five days.

summit in Brussels where a plan to solve Greece’s sovereign debt problems was being hammered out, but strong results from electrical goods retailer Best Buy and encouraging weekly jobs claims provided some support.“Investors in the US are worried about the systemic risk [of a European sovereign debt default]. If a solution for Greece is hammered out, it will be seen as a potential template that could be used for other countries [that may need it],” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.Weekly initial job claims fell to 442,000 compared with consensus estimates of 450,000.“The jobs data was very important. It suggests that employment figures out on Good Friday may be a turning point in the employment recovery,” Ms Krosby said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 1,165.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,841.21, and the Nasdaq was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,397.41.Financials stocks gained following Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony on his exit strategy, which confirmed that the current “accommodative” policies will continue for “an extended period”.Bank of America was up 1 per cent to $17.74, Goldman Sachs was 0.3 per cent higher at $174.90 and Wells Fargo rallied 0.7 per cent to $31.06.There were reports that the US Treasury may unload its 27 per cent stake in Citigroup using a preset trading plan. Under the plan, the Treasury would be able to issue instructions on how many shares to sell, when to sell them and at what price. The programme may be announced as soon as next month. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $4.27.Best Buy added 3.6 per cent to $42.66 as the company reported significantly stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.Net profit was $779m, or $1.82 a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $1.79 a share. Revenues rose 12 per cent.Demand for notebook computers, mobile phones and flat-screen televisions was particularly strong, the company said. The company’s earnings guidance for the full year also topped expectations – $3.45 a share to $3.60 a share, against average analyst expectations of $3.37 a share.“This helps alleviate worries over the consumers’ role in the economy,” Ms Krosby said.The results boosted technology stocks. Apple, which is seen as an important bell-wether by many investors, closed 1.2 per cent lower to $226.65, but touching its all-time intra-day high. Hewlett-Packard gained 0.8 per cent to $53.50, its highest since September 2000. IBM was up 0.6 per cent to $129.24.Qualcomm led the Nasdaq, gaining 5 per cent to $42.19, as the maker of digital wireless telecommunications equipment increased its sales and earnings guidance for the
second quarter, citing stronger-than-expected demand for its chips and licensing business. The new forecasts exceeded many current analyst estimates.Shares in US bond insurer Ambac Financial dived 17 per cent to 66 cents as state regulators in Wisconsin took control of some of the company’s worst assets, which is expected to affect about $35bn of its assets. Ambac’s capital levels have been heavily strained by the mortgage crisis in the US.Hotel stocks outperformed the broader market as investors become increasingly confident that more people would take holidays as the global economy recovers.Starwood Hotels rallied 2.5 per cent to $45, Marriott International added 1.6 per cent to $30.15 and InterContinental Hotels strengthened 1.8 per cent to $15.40.ConAgra Foods slipped 4.4 per cent to $24.94 on reporting quarterly earnings that narrowly missed average analyst estimates. The maker of Hebrew National hot dogs and Slim Jim snacks recorded revenues of $3.1bn, below the $3.15bn expected.Ebay rose 2.3 per cent to $27.56 after the e-commerce website was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse."
542;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-03-25T19:38:35Z;Qualcomm rebounds;Signals from mobile phone companies can be misunderstood;What it is to be misunderstood. Somehow signals from companies connected to the business of making mobile phones don’t get through clearly to investors. On Thursday they were surprised by Qualcomm, as new guidance prompted shares in the chipmaker to bounce 6 per cent. Yet the group, whose technology is ubiquitous in handsets, has still not recovered the ground lost after it spooked the market in January with a lacklustre outlook.The problem then was falling prices, on which royalty payments to Qualcomm are based. Mobile phone prices were dropping in Japan and Europe, and expansion in emerging markets, where phones are cheap, drags down average selling prices overall. Qualcomm is still evaluating what it calls the “changing market dynamics”, and is not yet prepared to sing a different tune for the licensing part of its business.However, the chip manufacturing side is doing better – second-quarter shipments of CDMA-based mobile phone modems should be 92m to 93m units, above the top end of previous guidance. Qualcomm also appears to be winning new customers and using aggressive pricing to pressure competitors, which should provide benefits in the long term through greater market share. Nor is the company quite so hard to predict as customer Nokia, where forecasting margins is a guessing game at every set of results.Indeed, emerging market expansion, even if it means lower prices now, should ultimately benefit Qualcomm and the phone makers. Credit Suisse estimates that as high-end smartphones become cheaper, 1.8bn people will be able to afford one by 2015. Current penetration of that potential customer base is only 17 per cent, suggesting room for a substantial increase in smartphone subscribers. Now if only Qualcomm could do something about the interference.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
543;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-03-17T17:55:26Z;Qualcomm to bid in Indian wireless auction;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, plans to bid in India’s upcoming wireless spectrum auction and, if successful, will help build a wireless broadband network with an Indian partner, based on 4G technology.The Indian government plans to offer up to four 3G licences and two ‘Broadband Wireless Access’ licences in an auction on April 9 that could raise as much as $8bn. The deployment of high-speed wireless data networks based on 4G standards could help bridge a broadening digital divide in India and provide internet access to rural communities that lack fibre-based fixed-line infrastructure.India is the world’s fastest growing wireless market but with 15 national operators it is also one of the most competitive, at least for wireless voice telephony. However Qualcomm, which uses spectrum it acquired in the US to provide mobile TV services to US network operators, indicated that it did not plan to be a long-term network operator in India.Rather, it said if it was successful in the auction, it would seek an Indian partner or partners to construct the 4G network based on TD-LTE, a 4G standard that has also been adopted in China, and then would plan to exit the venture.“Qualcomm has a history of participating in spectrum auctions to expedite the commercialisation of new wireless technologies,” the company said. “By participating in India’s BWA spectrum auction, Qualcomm can foster the accelerated deployment of TD-LTE.”Most of the bids in the upcoming auction are expected to be for the 3G licences, but Qualcomm will bid for the BWA spectrum in the 2.3Ghz band in order to build a network based on the TD-LTE (Time Division – Long-term Evolution) technology which it has helped develop.The US company noted that a 4G network based on TD-LTE technology would also be able to carry mobile voice and slower data traffic based on existing technology standards creating economies of sale and enabling “a broad choice of wireless broadband devices at affordable price points for Indian customers.”Potential bidders in the upcoming auction have until Friday to register their interest. Qualcomm is the first company to formally apply to bid for the BWS spectrum which has a reserve price of R17.5bn ($385m) although analysts expect it to attract significantly higher bids. Google, the internet search and advertising giant, has been mentioned as another potential bidder for the BWA licences.The 3G licences are expected to fetch between $1bn and $1.5bn each. Britain’s Vodafone group and Telenor, which both have Indian ventures operating 2G mobile services, have said they would bid for 3G spectrum. AT&T, the second largest US-based mobile operator has also been trying to establish a foothold in the Indian market.
544;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-03-08T09:12:38Z;RIM;All click-clacking falls silent eventually;The click-clack of Newton’s Cradle was once the sound of a true executive office. Now that the internet offers greater variety of distraction, hearing the click of BlackBerry keys is more likely. But there is no reason to think that the e-mailing phones’ popularity will be any more durable than a set of swinging balls.The problem for Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, is that consumer technology is rapidly overtaking what is being offered at work, particularly for smartphones. While BlackBerrys remain the default choice for corporate e-mail, browsing the web is far superior on touchscreen phones running Apple or Google software. RIM announced a new browser based on the same underlying technology at an industry shindig last month. But while RIM plays catch-up, it is becoming easy for companies to let employees bring their own devices to work, and to “sandbox” confidential information – keeping corporate and private data a safe distance apart.Meanwhile consumers, whose adoption of BlackBerrys produced rapid growth for RIM, have widening choice as every phone maker chases the smart end of the market. Choice also extends to telecom operators allocating promotion dollars, meaning RIM will have to pay more to win customers. Competition will continue to shrink margins as average prices fall faster than costs.Indeed, while RIM increased revenues fivefold between 2006 and 2009, gross margins (sales minus production costs) shrank by 11 percentage points. A chunk of that was higher royalties paid to Qualcomm as RIM switched to 3G. Intellectual property costs are also likely to continue rising. The willingness of manufacturers such as Nokia and Apple to turn litigious in asserting their patents underlines the competitive pressures. There is a good chance that expectations for RIM are running too high. As Newton’s Cradle demonstrates, all click-clacking falls silent eventually.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
545;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-02-08T18:54:18Z;Dotcoms, tech dominate Super Bowl XLIV ads;;2010 is the 25th anniversary of the .com domain and dotcom companies appear to be back in rude health, judging by their domination of Super Bowl ads this year.Google’s Super Bowl debut on Sunday night, with Parisian Love, was a low-budget affair. It was a rerun of an ad it has been showing online for months on YouTube.“We liked this video so much…that we decided to share it with a wider audience,” explained Eric Schmidt, chief executive, in a blog post.With the CBS network charging $2.5m – $3m for a 30-second spot, sharing the Parisian love with a national TV audience did not come cheap.However, with the best ratings for a Super Bowl since 1987 and around half of US households watching the game, according to CBS, Google may consider it money well spent.Google was also judged the second most effective after Doritos in promoting its brand during the Super Bowl, according to a survey carried out using Twitter at BrandBowl2010.Dotcoms edged out car makers and beer as the leading Super Bowl ad category, according to Kantar Media.Google and HomeAway were the two dotcom newcomers, joining Careerbuilder, Cars, E-Trade, GoDaddy, Monster and Teleflora, who all advertised last year.The total of eight is still only half the 16 promoting websites out of the 33 advertisers at Super Bowl XXXIV ten years ago, at the height of the dotcom boom.Superbowl XLIV also featured some big-budget ads promoting new technology.Intel returned to the Super Bowl after a break of 12 years with two ads promoting its new Core processors.Qualcomm bought two spots for its FLOtv personal television, while Vizio had a high-tech ad featuring Beyonce for its TVs with Internet Apps. Megan Fox in a bubble bath plugged the new Motorola Devour Android phone.Critics gave the tech ads the highest scores:“The best, as usual, were the new tech commercials – this time especially for FloTV’s thumbnail history and Vizio,” said Paul Levinson, Fordham University professor and media expert.“They introduced the viewers to brand new media, and could ignite small revolutions in communication. But Google’s commercial was dull, and GoDaddy’s was no great shakes, certainly not as good as the raunchier GoDaddy commercials of previous years.”
546;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-29T16:44:24Z;Dismal week for Asia-Pacific equity markets;;Further falls for stocks on Friday on the back of disappointing US jobs data capped another dismal week for equities in the region, the worst for more than 10 months.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index lost 1.6 per cent to 223.24 for a weekly decline of 4.2 per cent, the biggest drop since early March when markets had yet to feel the benefit of government stimulus initiatives.January trading ended as the worst month of losses since last February.Thursday’s gain for regional equities proved short-lived, even though it broke a losing run stretching back eight sessions, the worst negative streak for more than eight years.“Markets are reacting extra sensitively to the US employment data,” said Yoshihisa Okamoto, of Mizuho Asset Management. “A wider concern surrounding credit tightening and bank regulation proposals was already in place, so a disappointing economic figure would cause a large drop in the market.”Tumbling metal prices yesterday took their toll on commodity-related shares with BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, falling 3.2 per cent to A$39.40 and Rio Tinto, the number three, sinking 4.8 per cent to A$68.Technology stocks also suffered in the wake of Qualcomm reporting overnight in the US a “subdued” economic recovery.The biggest loser yesterday in Tokyo was Advantest, the world’s largest maker of memory chip testers, which plunged 10 per cent to Y2,253 after forecasting a bigger annual loss than expected. Not far behind was chipmaker Elpida Memory, which sank 9 per cent to Y1,601 after its quarterly profit missed analyst estimates.“Good earnings have already been factored in and investors are now reacting sharply to negative surprises such as cuts in earnings outlooks,” said Hiroaki Kuramochi, of Tokai Tokyo Securities.Toyota’s miserable week continued as it fell another 2 per cent to Y3,490 on the back of a huge recall of its cars over fears of faulty accelerators. Its stock has slumped nearly 14 per cent over the week.The Nikkei 225 Average fell 2.1 per cent yesterday to 10,198.04 and the broader Topix lost 1.4 per cent to 901.12, the indices dropping 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent over the week, respectively.Chinese markets also suffered big falls as Beijing took the lead in monetary tightening and banks began reining in lending.The Shanghai Composite fell below the key psychological support level of 3,000 on Wednesday, dropping 4.5 per cent over the week to 2,989.29, the most for two months. The index lost 8.8 per cent in January.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 2.9 per cent over the five days to 20,121.99 while the index of mainland stocks listed in the territory, or H shares, sank 4 per cent.
547;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
548;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-28T22:17:09Z;Wall Street loses key level;Investors worry about job losses;Disappointing technology results added to lingering concerns over job losses, pushing US stocks below a key resistance point.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed below its 100-day moving average for the first time since last April, adding to fears that Wall Street may be heading for a significant pull-back.Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, cut its profit and sales forecast for the current quarter and also warned revenues for the year would be lower than expected.The group said it had suffered from increasingly tough competition and noted the slow pace of recovery in developed markets. Its shares dropped 14.2 per cent to $40.48.Motorola added to industry concerns by forecasting a surprise loss for the current quarter. The mobile phone maker said it would be hit by higher costs as it struggles to compete with other smartphone manufacturers, sending its shares down 12.4 per cent to $6.48.Economic data also weighed on the market. While more Americans filed fresh claims for unemployment benefits than expected last week, durable goods orders did not rise as much as hoped last month.Wall Street recovered some of its losses in afternoon trading in the lead-up to the confirmation of Bernanke’s second term as Federal Reserve chairman.The S&P 500 eventually closed down 1.2 per cent to 1,084.53, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,120.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9 per cent lower at 2,179.00.Craig Kaufman, co-founder of Kaufman Bros, a boutique investment bank, said President Barack Obama’s inaugural State of the Union address address on Wednesday night had also raised some concerns.Mr Obama said creating jobs would be his “number one focus” this year and reiterated his commitment to healthcare and financial sector reform.“People are still worried about jobs and real estate and as much emphasis as was put on that last night, we got smacked in the face in the morning with a worse-than-expected jobs number.”He said investors were also becoming nervous about the stronger dollar and had started to price its appreciation into the market.The durable goods data added to existing concerns over the sluggish pace of industrial production.Since the market’s peak 10 days ago, US stocks have fallen 6 per cent. However, the S&P 500 materials index has lost 11 per cent following disappointing results from industry bellwethers such as Caterpillar and moves by China to cool economic growth.Futures had indicated a good day for Wall Street following a series of positive earnings results but the S&P 500 spent only the first six minutes in positive territory before losses in the technology sector overwhelmed the market.However, the S&P 500 consumer staples index managed to stay out of the red for most of the day after a series of better-than-expected results.Profit at Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer products company, fell less than forecast thanks to strong demand for baby and family care products.Meanwhile, Colgate-Palmolive’s quarterly profit rose more than anticipated. Both groups said larger investments in advertising had paid off. P&G shares rose 1.4 per cent to $61.68 but Colgate lost 0.5 per cent to $79.99.Energizer said its better-than-expected results for the last quarter were mainly due to cuts to its advertising budget. The group was also cautious about consumer demand for its products, particularly at its namesake battery business. Its shares edged 1 per cent lower to $56.82.Ford Motor became the first of the country’s three big carmakers to emerge from the red, r reporting a full-year net profit of $2.7bn. The company, which was the only big carmaker to avoid bankruptcy last year, had indicated it would only break even in 2010. However, after an early surge, its shares were down 1.2 per cent to $11.41.Airlines added to the early optimism after JetBlue Airways and US Airways Group both beat quarterly estimates. JetBlue shares reversed their gains and were later down 7.9 per cent to $5.11 while US Airways lost 5.8 per cent to $5.14.
549;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;A worthy standard bearer;;"No handset has generated so much buzz since Apple launched its first iPhone two and a half years ago, but is the Nexus One really the “superphone” Google claims it is?The phone, manufactured by Taiwan’s HTC, is currently available in the US only, or on Google’s website for $530 (€380, £328) without the subsidy from T-Mobile USA. It has received mixed reviews since it was launched this month. Most of the complaints have been about the network and Google’s support, rather than the device itself. (The company said this week it would provide an over-the-air update to fix some of the 3G connectivity problems that have been reported.)Google has said it will launch a Vodafone model in Europe in the spring. In the meantime, to check out its claims I have been testing the device and comparing it with some of the other Android handsets that are available.The Nexus One is the first handset to ship with Android 2.1 or Eclair, and one of the first to be built around Qualcomm’s 1GHz Snapdragon processor, a combination that ensures it is the fastest, most powerful Android-based smartphone to date. In my tests, it easily outpaced rivals including the Motorola Droid and Cliq, and earlier Android-based smartphones such as T-Mobile’s myTouch 3G.It is also one of the best-looking touch-based smartphones, with its slim case and big, bright 800x480-pixel resolution 3.7in touchscreen. Unfortunately, the screen lacks the multitouch technology that helps make the iPhone interface so exceptional and which I expect to become standard in the next generation of smartphones.Below the screen are four touch-sensitive buttons and a trackball to make it easier to operate the device with one hand. Overall dimensions are 4.7in by 2.35in by 0.45in and the handset weighs 4.6oz.Other hardware features include a 5 megapixel auto-focusing camera with LED flash, which produces excellent still images and can capture video at 20 frames per second.The Nexus One also comes with 512MB of onboard memory – though currently only a relatively measly 180MB of this is available for storing downloaded apps and media. Fortunately, however, it also comes with a microSD (secure digital) slot with a 4GB card included, which can be expanded to 32GB.Unlike some of its rivals, the Nexus One does not come bundled with a desktop software system to sync music and other digital media, although I found it works well with Dazzboard 2.0, a software package for Android-based handsets launched a few weeks ago.When you connect the Nexus One to a PC, it shows up as a flash memory drive so you can easily add or transfer data. It can handle most formats of music file and Mpeg4 video, though playback is a little rough.Like other Android handsets, the Nexus One comes with GPS navigation, a digital compass and built-in Wi-Fi networking. The current quad-band model works on all 2G GSM networks but operates as a 3G handset only on T-Mobile USA’s 3G network, which undermines the claim that it is an “unlocked” device.Unlike on some Android handsets, battery life is very good for a 3G phone. With both Wi-Fi and the 3G radio enabled, I have found generally that I need to charge the handset only every other day – putting the Nexus One on a par with BlackBerry handsets and well ahead of devices such as the Palm Pre.Because power is supplied by a removable battery – unlike the sealed one in an iPhone – users can carry a spare battery for extended use when away from a power socket.There is no physical keyboard. Text input relies on a virtual keyboard, which works reasonably well but is not as easy to use as a mini-qwerty keyboard. Sensibly, it comes with a proximity sensor to prevent users from accidentally operating the virtual keyboard when they lift the device to their face to speak.Voice call quality is high and the built-in noise cancellation technology seems to suppress ambient noise effectively. That said, the voice-dialling seems to be rather inaccurate. Similarly, its innovative voice-to-text input feature is difficult to operate and does not seem to work very well – a pity because it could be a nice alternative to the virtual keyboard.The new version of Android (which will also soon be available on the HTC Hero, Samsung Moment, Motorola Droid and Motorola Cliq) adds some features, including a more jazzy main menu with 3D icons. But it would be nice if the Nexus One included the elegant HTC Sense user interface, which I prefer to raw Android.Nevertheless, the operating system supports true multitasking (which is lacking on the iPhone) and comes with a good mobile browser. The Nexus One supports Gmail and Pop3 e-mail, but Microsoft Exchange integration is limited to e-mail and contacts, and Google Talk instant messaging is the only IM service supported “out of the box”.It also comes with Google Maps and Google’s free turn-by-turn GPS navigation software, which is currently a trial package and is also available on the Motorola Droid but not other Android handsets.The Nexus One is a worthy standard bearer for Google’s Android operating system. If you want an Android-powered touchscreen handset, it should be at the top of your list.But it lacks some features, such as a multi­touch screen and more extensive software support. These would turn a solid smartphone into a “superphone”.paul.taylor@ft.com

550;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-28T21:40:53Z;Early optimism fades as banking fears resurface;Greek government bond yields hit 7%;21:25 GMT. Early optimism evaporated on Thursday as a cocktail of concerns pulled the rug from under a tentative global risk rally.The trading session had begun in a more optimistic mood as investors expressed relief they had navigated the political and policy minefield of the previous session, and attention turned to a set of generally upbeat corporate earnings reports.However, traders experienced a bout of nerves in the New York morning after wire services began flashing negative comments from Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency, about the relative health of the UK banking system.S&P told the Financial Times that its opinion that “We no longer classify the United Kingdom (AAA/Negative/A-1+) among the most stable and low-risk banking systems globally” came from “an old report” – but that didn’t stop a sell-off in European and US stocks and a slide in UK gilts. Sterling pared its gains against the euro and slipped slightly versus the dollar.Indeed, the early ebullience had already been contained by signs of escalating concerns regarding the fiscal position of Greece and other heavily indebted nations.And as the session progressed, a strengthening dollar and worries about the fragility of global growth served to hurt commodity prices, pushing pressure on resource stocks. In addition, mixed reviews of Apple’s iPad and downbeat forecasts from Motorola and Qualcomm stimulated profit-taking across the US technology sector ahead of earnings from Microsoft after the bell.All this conspired to turn an initially upbeat session decidedly cautious, with the S&P 500 in New York dropping 1.2 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 1.9 per cent. Softer than expected durable goods and weekly jobless data added to the gloom.The S&P 500 closed below its 100-day moving average for the first time since April last year, a potentially bearish signal. Worries that the index may experience more volatility led the Vix index to edge 2.5 per cent higher to 23.71.The FTSE World equity index fell 0.9 per cent.● Global stocks had earlier looked set to break a six-day losing streak and a modicum of risk appetite had been in evidence after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address overnight seemed to tone down the bank-battering rhetoric and his Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, emerged from a congressional grilling on the AIG bail-out relatively unscathed.There was also the small matter of a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Wall Street welcomed the fact that there was no change in the central bank’s policy or its promise to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period” – although some did mutter darkly that comments by Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, who said he wanted the Fed to withdraw this promise, might be a signal that the monetary tide was turning.“Equities are firm across the planet and bonds trading gingerly as the Fed’s pro-growth press statement and President Obama’s move to provide more tax breaks have helped shore up investor sentiment for the time being,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, before the S&P news broke and Wall Street stumbled.AT&T, which has secured the network contract for the new Apple iPad, was one of the major groups reporting results as the US earnings season swung back into focus. The telecoms group joined Ford and Procter & Gamble in initially helping sentiment by delivering well-received figures.● Asian stocks had rebounded after several days of heavy falls. Worries about Chinese monetary tightening were put on the back burner. Shanghai rose 0.3 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 1.6 per cent as banks rallied from what some analysts saw as oversold levels.The Nikkei in Tokyo rose 1.6 per cent as the re-emergence of risk appetite damaged the yen, which in turn helped exporters. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index added 0.9 per cent.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 turned tail as Wall Street fell back, losing 1.2 per cent – despite strong results from Nokia – while the FTSE 100 shed 1.4 per cent as miners got hit.● Greek bond yields surged higher again, adding to Wednesday’s spike. The yield on 10-year debt broke through 7 per cent at one stage as worries about Athens’ fiscal situation endured. This pushed the spread between Greek bonds and German Bunds to a new record of more than 390 basis points. The cost of Greek 5-year credit default swaps – a gauge of insurance against debt default – rose to a record of 395 basis points.The spread between Portuguese and Spanish bonds and their German counterparts also widened sharply, as investors targeted other eurozone members who they believed may struggle to service their debts. The CDS of Portugal rose almost 4 basis points to hit a record high of 153.4, according to Reuters.Yields on UK 10-year gilts jumped 6 basis points to 3.93 after the S&P comments hit the wires. “Markets didn’t react to the original report, so maybe they still need to wake up and smell the coffee,” said Marc Ostwald at Monument Securities.The US 10-year benchmark was unchanged at 3.65 per cent as stocks recovered some of their losses in afternoon trading.● The dollar pared gains after hitting six-month highs versus the euro. Having breached $1.3950, the buck was later trading up 0.4 per cent at $1.3965. It rose 0.4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.The yen had initially been weak, but the stock market sell-off reduced traders risk appetite and the Japanese currency was the favoured haven. It rose 0.1 per cent versus the dollar and added 0.5 per cent against a euro struggling in the wake of heightened eurozone fiscal concerns.● The stronger dollar caused a reversal in commodities, with the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, the sector benchmark, losing 0.4 per cent. Copper fell below $7,000 a tonne, off 1.8 per cent. Gold lost 0.3 per cent to $1,085 an ounce but oil edged 0.1 per cent higher to $73.71.
551;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-26T01:21:36Z;TI upbeat as healthy profits return;;Texas Instruments on Monday recorded its best level of profitability in two years as US chipmakers continued to report a strong rebound from the recession.The second largest US semiconductor manufacturer followed its bigger rival Intel in also issuing an upbeat assessment for the opening months of 2010.“Our outlook for the first quarter reflects the likelihood of sequential growth instead of the typical seasonal decline,” said Rich Templeton, TI chairman.The Dallas-based chipmaker beat Wall Street expectations for its fourth quarter, with revenues of $3bn and profits of $655m, or 52 cents per share. Analysts had expected sales of $2.98bn and profits of 50 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey.For the first quarter, it forecast revenues and profit ranges with midpoints of $3.07bn and earnings per share of 48 cents, compared to Wall Street expectations of $2.83bn and 44 cents.TI said this would represent a 2 per cent growth in sales when they were usually seasonally down by around 5 per cent.Operating margins in the fourth quarter were 29.1 per cent of revenues.For the year, TI reported revenues fell 17 per cent on 2008 to $10.43bn and profts were down 23 per cent at $1.47bn.“The last time we approached this level of profitability was the fourth quarter of 2007 when TI’s operating margin was 28 per cent,” Kevin March, chief financial officer, told analysts in a conference call.Mr March said the results reflected TI’s shift in focus towards analogue chips.TI still makes a wider range of chips compared to Intel’s focus on PC microprocessors. Their use across a number of industries means TI’s sales can give a broader picture of the economic situation.The company said that revenues for analogue chips were up 27 per cent and embedded chips were up 21 per cent on a year ago, with the recovering automotive sector showing strong growth as.Wireless chip sales for mobile phones were up 13 per cent and other chips, including those for calculators, TVs and projectors, were up 17 per cent.TI said demand was solid and customer and channel inventories were lean.Geographically, while growth compared to the third quarter was faster in US and European markets, all regions grew.TI shares have risen 58 per cent in the past year but were down 1.4 per cent at $23.35 in extended trading on Monday.Intel reported earlier this month that its revenue growth was almost double the norm in the fourth quarter, with strength across all regions and all product categories.Qualcomm, the leading wireless chipmaker, reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday.www.ft.com/technology

Years later, I bought a pocket-sized portable television for the same purpose, which ran on batteries and had a huge and unwieldy extendable antenna – but still could not deliver a half-decent picture.Today, you can watch television while out and about thanks to an expanding variety of services on a mobile phone, using digital or analogue capabilities built in to the phone or added via a small device. Recently, however, I have been exploring another option, in the form of a neat little device called the Qualcomm Flo TVPersonal Television – or PTV.Using it has meant that on my train journey home from work I have been able to watch MTV, live college basketball and the national evening news with a noticeably better picture than I get on my phone.Verizon Wireless and AT&T’s mobile unit both offer services based on Qualcomm’s Flo TV technology, which uses a network built by Qualcomm in the US and special handsets. Qualcomm would like to deploy a similar network in Europe even though the EU has endorsed the rival DVB-H technology standard.I have tried the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Flo TV services in the past and have been impressed with the quality of the 30 frames-per-second broadcast video, but remain unconvinced about the value for money of the service, which costs about $15 a month for eight channels.Now Qualcomm’s dedicated stand alone device, which is made by HTC, the Taiwanese mobile phone maker, has been brought out as an alternative to watching TV on a mobile phone.A neat, boxy package, it is small and light enough to fit easily in a jacket pocket. It has a 3.5in touch colour screen – like the iPhone – that enables users to change channels with a swipe of a finger. It also has built-in stereo speakers, and its rechargeable batteries powered the device for five hours or more in my tests.Nice design touches include a built-in stand and being able to set reminders for programmes. The device costs $250 in the US, including six months’ subscription to about 10 channels, including news, sports, comedy and children’s entertainment. After that, it costs $9 a month. While I found the channel selection limited, the device itself worked well, even in a fast commuter train, and the picture was generally very good.One advantage of a separate device for watching mobile television is that you do not need to sign up for a costly mobile phone plan as well. Even so, carrying another device about will not appeal to everyone – unless they are going to use it a lot, in which case they might be willing to pay for PTV’s superior picture.In fact, another Qualcomm Flo TV iteration, which was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, may have more appeal.

Hundreds of Mobile DTV stations are scheduled to launch this year in the US – and similar services are expected later in Europe.The Tivit is expected to cost bet ween $90 and $120, and will work with a wide range of smartphones including the iPhone 3GS, BlackBerrys, Android-powered devices and the iPod Touch, as well as Windows-based laptops and netbooks. Programming will be provided by local television stations, which are eager to broadcast their content to people on the move via phones and laptops.

A separate device just launched as an alternative to watching television programmes on your mobile handset. Qualcomm’s pocket-sized television with touchscreen navigation delivers high-quality pictures and enjoys good battery life. However, it is relatively expensive and runs on Qualcomm’s proprietary Flo TV, and means carrying another gadget, however small and neat.● Mobile phone-based television
A growing number of handsets let you watch an expanding variety of services on a handset, thanks to built-in digital or analogue capabilities. No extra hardware is required butcurrently most services are subscription-based – although free mobile services (Mobile DTV in the US and DVB-H in Europe) are coming."

554;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-10T22:46:42Z;CES 2010 – best in show;;The2010 Consumer Electronics Show , which closed in Las Vegas on Sunday, was arguably the best in years in featuring products ready for primetime rather than the vapourware often on display.Sony impressed with its 3D-readiness, there were plenty of appealing eReaders and smartphones on show, while new netbooks, smartbooks and tablets galore are on their way to the PC market.Our round-up of the best of CES is after the jump with links to the announcements, our coverage and reviews from other tech sites.Sony and Samsung led the way on3D , Panasonic also promised a full lineup of 3D TVs by the spring and Toshiba emphasised 2D to 3D conversion and its forthcoming 3D Blu-ray player. The other big theme was internet connectivity, content and services. LG and Panasonic showed Skype video calls through the living room TV and Toshiba demonstrated its own version of a videophone. Blu-ray players and internet-integrated TVs will have more than Netflix streaming in future, with companies such as DivX, Vudu and Yahoo bringing hundreds of video channels, widgets and applications tothis developing platform .eReaders had their own section of the show and Plastic Logic received the most attention for its large format Que, if only for the $800 price it planned to charge. The Skiff is another large format reader that will serve newspapers and magazines better than small-screen readers. The Alex with its dual-screen approach also made its debut. Qualcomm showed off its Mirasol technology, which means colour and faster displays later this year, although to me readability was hampered by a lack of brightness in the screens with all of the eReader technologies.Tablets may become a preferred way of reading books with their more vivid screens, if users can forgive the shorter battery life, and much rests on reaction to Apple’s reported tablet, due later this month. There were tablet prototypes shown off by the chief executives of Intel and Microsoft at their keynote speeches and Nvidia’s CEO went as far as describing 2010 as the year of the tablet – he thinks the next generation of his company’s Tegra chip will power many of them. Dell showed a 5-inch tablet it expected to launch later this year.Smartbooks made an auspicious debut at CES with the Lenovo Skylight and there were improvements to many netbooks, with multi-touch and high-resolution screens appearing. Lenovo also introduced an interesting hybrid laptop, the IdeaPad U1, whose multi-touch screen could be detached to become a tablet.In smartphones, attendees were keen to try out the Nexus One, announced by Google on the eve of the show. AT&T announced plans tolaunch five Android handsets from Dell, HTC and Motorola. Motorola showed off its fifth Android phone, the Backflip. Palm unveiled new versions of the Pre and Pixi and an agreement with Verizon Wireless to sell its phones.Intel announced its return to the handset market after four years with an LG smartphone.Best of the rest: the Sony Dash is a hybrid digital photo frame that offers hundreds of applications through its licensing of the Chumby platfrom. Sony’s Webbie camcorder, its answer to the success of the Flip, has been updated in the shape of the Bloggie. Netgear launched its Push2TV technology with Intel for streaming content wirelessly from a laptop to a TV. Finally, Samsung launched the coolest portable media player - the IceTouch – with its two-inch transparent screen.
555;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-08T08:50:13Z;Sony’s merry eReader Xmas, Qualcomm’s New Year;;Sony had a bestseller of a Christmas with its Reader devices in the US, according to executives here at CES in Las Vegas, and Qualcomm is expecting to spice up the market with colour displays in 2010.December sales of the Reader were four times the value of the previous year, eReaders were the biggest growth area for Sony Electronics in the run up to Christmas and had the largest unit volume of all its products, according to Steve Haber, president of its digital reading division.Note the lack of hard numbers there. But Sony has stopped issuing figures due to Amazon’s recalcitrance. Its experience is similar to that reported by Amazon last month for the Kindle.On Christmas Day, Mr Haber says the servers became overloaded for Sony’s Reader Store as new users unwrapped their gifts and went online to buy books.Sony’s sales were helped by the last-minute availability of the new Daily Edition of the Reader on December 22. Mr Haber said pre-orders were fulfilled by Christmas EveMeanwhile, Qualcomm has emerged from stealth mode with its eReader plans and could become a major force with its screen technology later this year.The chipmaker chose the Digital Experience product event at the Consumer Electronics Show for a coming-out party for its Mirasol display off-shoot.Until now, Qualcomm had maintained its focus was on mobile phone and other small displays, but Mirasol seems ready for the big time.Qualcomm showed a reference design eReader, which is expected to inspire manufacturers to come up with eReaders featuring Mirasol in the third quarter, Jim Cathey, head of Qualcomm’s display efforts, told me.It looked impressive – the screen was colour and allowed rapid coverflows and page turns, while many of today’s eReaders are painfully slow.Mirasol is also video-capable, with refresh rates of up to 30 frames per second, it draws very little power and is readable in bright sunlight.It harnesses ambient light and uses micro-electro-mechanical systems (Mems) at the sub-pixel level, according to a leaflet issued at CES  explaining the technology.
556;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Intel re-enters market with smartphone;;Intel unveiled a smartphone at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Thursday, marking its re-entry into the handset market after an absence of four years.The move will spark a battle for market share with wireless chipmakers such as Qualcomm.The world’s biggest semiconductor producer also announced an “app store” for netbooks, a category it has dominated but which is now under attack at the CES from “smartbooks” powered by the selfsame wireless rivals’ processors.In a keynote speech, Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, showed off a smartphone made by LG of Korea, using a new generation of lower-power Atom processors codenamed Moorestown. It has a 3D interface, can display HD video and will go on sale in the second half of 2010.Intel has faced the problem of reducing the power demands of its processors to match the capabilities of its wireless rivals, which make low-power chips based on the designs of the UK’s ARM.In a Financial Times interview, Mr Otellini said that the new phone and chip showed that Intel had reached the point where it was competitive.“And it’s going to get better, over time we should have the best silicon in terms of performance and power characteristics,” he said, referring to Intel’s advantage in miniaturisation.It has reached circuit widths of 32 nanometres – billionths of a metre – this year, ahead of its rivals, and launched a new family of more than 25 “core” processors based on the smaller chips on Thursday.Mr Otellini said that the smartphone would run on a 32nm chip and Intel would be reducing the size to 22nm.Intel’s previous attempt to crack the handset market failed and it sold its mobile phone chip business to the chipmaker Marvell in 2006.The company has been unstoppable in netbooks, dominating the high-growth category with its Atom processor. Mr Otellini revealed a beta version of an app store for netbooks called the Intel AppUp Center, with support from Acer, Asus, Dell and Samsung netbook makers.The model is similar to Apple’s App store, with software spanning education, entertainment, games and other categories available for free download or purchase immediately.Mr Otellini said he did not think AppUp was a threat to its partner Microsoft, which he said was taking part with its Silverlight platform for creating apps.The chief executive said Intel and Microsoft stood to benefit in 2010 as companies looked to upgrade four- to five-year-old Windows XP notebooks and desktops.“I think people will want to go to the new Windows 7 [operating system] for security and performance reasons, and then a new computer is in order,” he said.FT Techblog: Full coverage of CES Las Vegas
557;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-05T21:02:58Z;Consumer Electronics Show optimistic for 2010;;The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an annual barometer for the state of the industry, has its arrows pointed toward a fairer outlook for 2010.CES officially opens on Thursday, with the promise of new categories of technological devices to spur consumer spending this year and help countries pull out of the recession.Among the hot topics this year will be 3D. It is moving rapidly from the cinema to the living room, with the introduction of 3D HDTVs from groups such as LG, Samsung and Sony, and content announcements expected.Also expected to come into their own this year are e-readers, with a new generation of larger format devices being unveiled at the show.The new smartbooks category will compete with netbooks for attention, as portable PCs remain the hottest section of the PC industry.CES has been upstaged in the past by announcements from Apple, such as the unveiling of the iPhone at MacWorld in 2007. That event has been moved to February this year.But Steve Jobs, Apple founder, will still cast a shadow over tablets on display at CES, with Apple’s next major product expected to be a tablet launched in three weeks.Google is stealing the initial limelight this year, with the announcement at its Silicon Valley headquarters on Tuesday that it will sell its first Android phone – the Nexus One.Analysts at UBS said on Tuesday they expected new smartphone announcements from Acer, Asus, HTC, LG, Palm and Samsung at CES and other upcoming shows as competition increased in the smartphone segment.Chipmakers are taking a central role in the industry and finding new markets, with their processors featuring in e-readers, smartbooks, netbooks and set-top boxes bringing the internet to TVs. The chief executives of chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm are both keynote speakers at the show.The development of the car as a hub for consumer electronics will be reflected in announcements of TV services for vehicles and built-in internet connectivity. Alan Mulally, Ford chief executive, is another keynote speaker.Last year’s CES attracted 113,000 attendees, down from an expected 130,000 and Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) officials are cautiously predicting attendance will be flat this year.However, they report a big pick-up in interest in recent months as economies have recovered and absentees from last year, such as Philips, are returning. There are a record number of new exhibitors – more than 330 – and 20,000 products on show from more than 2,500 exhibitors.The CEA has predicted shipment revenues fell 7.7 per cent, to $165bn in 2009, the first decline since 2001.
558;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-04T05:00:29Z;Smartbooks launch assault on PCs;;Smartbooks are beginning a new year assault on the PC market with the launch on Monday of a range of multi-coloured devices that bridge a gap between smartphones and netbook computers.The chipmaker Freescale expects the devices, known as reference designs, to be copied by manufacturers and appear on retail shelves by the summer.It will show off their features at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week – all-day battery life, constant internet connectivity, a touch screen, Android operating system and expected to be available for less than $200.The PC maker Lenovo will introduce a pricier version of a smartbook at the same show.The clamshell device will contain an ARM-based Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm, a proprietary operating system from Lenovo and it will be sold by the operator AT&T.“The smartbook market has the potential to be as large as, or to exceed, the netbook market,” says Ninis Samuel, director of consumer marketing at Lenovo.Mr Samuel describes the target market as ranging from early teens to post-graduate young adults who use the web heavily.“These consumers don’t necessarily need the full PC functionality of a laptop or netbook all the time, but they do desire a device that can give them a rich web and media experience on the go with a stylish and cool design,” he says.Smartbooks were expected to be on sale this holiday season from a number of manufacturers, but the only significant launch has come in Japan with the Sharp Netwalker.The chipmakers blame software problems – finding an alternative to Windows has been problematic and they have also been waiting for Adobe to provide adequate Flash support for ARM-based chips – needed to enable fast video delivery.“We have all been working hard to make sure the software is user-friendly and highly reliable,” says Rich Beyer, chief executive of Freescale, whose processor is inside the Netwalker.“It’s taken us longer to get there than expected as an industry, but it’s coming together now.”Mr Beyer says he expects more than 30 smartbooks to be launched in the first quarter of 2010.Microsoft appears to be unsure of the economics of developing and offering a cheaper version of Windows on low-cost smartbooks.Henri Richard, chief sales and marketing officer at Freescale, says manufacturers are turning to free open-source operating systems instead, with Google’s Android OS currently having the most “sex appeal” with retailers.“By not embracing smartbooks, Microsoft is going to miss big. I’m certain that there’s a lot of work being done right now in [Microsoft’s headquarters in] Redmond to address the opportunity that this market shift represents,” he says.Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies, says consumers don’t care if such devices have Windows or not.“They’re not really looking for compatibility, but for what works.”The category is still unproven though and some analysts say it will struggle to differentiate itself from netbooks and other devices.Intel is also promoting smaller smartbook-like products it calls Mids – mobile internet devices.Intel’s rivals have had to market the smartbook concept relentlessly to manufacturers in Asia and carriers globally.Michael Rayfield, head of Nvidia’s mobile business, says his company has been promoting products based on its ARM Tegra chip to 27 different carriers.Mr Rayfield expects this to be the main route to market, with operators offering smartbooks at a subsidised price or free with a two-year contract.Atom-based netbooks cannot compete on price or power-savings offered by Tegra smartbooks, Mr Rayfield says.Netbooks have grown from 5 per cent of portable computer shipments to nearly a quarter in the space of a year, according to the DisplaySearch research firm.But while Intel will claim 94 per cent of the market for netbooks and smartbooks combined this year, it will have been overtaken by the ARM-based chipmakers by 2012, according to The Information Group.The research company predicts Intel chips will be in 43.2m netbooks by that year but 52.9m ARM-based smartbooks will ship, relegating Intel to 45 per cent of the total market for these smaller, low-cost machines.
559;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2010-01-04T05:00:29Z;Smartbook debut threatens netbook rise;;The netbook faces a challenge this year as the highest growth category in the personal computer market by a younger upstart – the smartbook.Smartbooks will make their full debut this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chipmaker Freescale heralded their arrival with the launch of its reference design for the category.The name signifies the marrying of smartphones and netbooks in a smaller laptop that has key advantages over a netbook. Smartbooks feature all-day battery life, constant internet connectivity through the 3G phone network, rather than relying on WiFi hotspots, plus lower costs that will encourage operators to offer them free to subscribers.The arrival of smartbooks could put Intel and Microsoft, the dominant hardware and software players, on the back foot. Microsoft is not providing an operating system to run on the new machines, while Intel, whose Atom processor has so far dominated the netbook category, is not a contender in smartbooks.Smartbooks will run instead on microprocessors based on designs by the UK’s ARM, similar to those used in the majority of mobile phones.The category is being promoted by wireless and graphics chipmakers such as Freescale, Nvidia, Marvell and Qualcomm, which have been unable to grab a significant share of the netbook market.They are entering the fray as PC makers call on their smartphone expertise as they find that ever-smaller machines attract consumers. Notebook sales have overtaken those of desktop PCs in the consumer market and netbooks have become the fastest growing part of the notebook market.“We’re going to see an explosion in the next couple of years of these new type of devices and that’s going to change the PC landscape,” says Henri Richard, chief sales and marketing officer at Freescale. Freescale’s processor was in the first smartbook released – the Sharp Netwalker launched in Japan in the autumn.“This ‘tweener’ category – between the phone and netbook – is actually a pretty attractive alternative. A device that is not really a phone and has PC-like characteristics expands the category,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies.Improved battery life and performance in a new generation of netbooks running on Intel’s Atom microprocessors could blunt the impact of smartbooks. The new devices are already late arriving – they should have gone on sale in numbers during the holiday season.
560;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-12-29T19:02:16Z;Nokia files fresh suit in Apple patent fight;;Nokia escalated its patent dispute with archrival Apple over smartphone technology on Tuesday, filing a complaint with the US International Trade Commission.The complaint accuses Apple of infringing Nokia patents in “virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers”, the Finnish company said.The ITC, a quasi-judicial federal agency with broad investigative responsibilities on matters of trade, has become an increasingly popular venue for patent fights in recent years, though more commonly US companies take grievances there against competitors in other countries. The Washington-based agency can bar imports and impose other remedies and it often acts more quickly than general courts.Nokia has won at least two battles at the ITC before. In late 2007, an ITC judge ruled it had not infringed patents held by US chipmaker Qualcomm relating to the control of signal power.Nokia also had an ITC run-in in 2007 with Interdigital, which alleged that Nokia was infringing patents on third-generation wireless transmission. The ITC decided in favour of Nokia.The new suit pcomes after Nokia’s October suit against Apple in the Delaware federal court. That case seeks royalties that could run into hundreds of millions of dollars each year.Apple declined to comment on Tuesday but it has countersued in Delaware, arguing that Nokia was trying to win access to unrelated computing patents, including touch-screen know-how, in exchange for giving Apple licences to use Nokia’s wireless patents.Likewise, the new case concerns patents beyond wireless. The intellectual property in question relates to user interfaces, camera management and antenna design, which Apple uses in various products.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San Francisco
561;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Intel rearms for Arm smartbook challenge;;Just in time for the Consumer Electronics Show and the launch of an assault on its mobile strategy, Intel has announced an upgrade to its Atom microprocessor.Atom has dominated the netbook category but it faces a challenge at CES from smaller, leaner-on-energy smartbooks featuring Arm-based processors.The specifications of the new N450 Atom chip for netbooks are unimpressive at first glance compared to the previous generation. It has the same 1.66GHz clock speed, 512Kb cache and single core performance.But Intel points out it has now moved the memory controller and graphics processor onto the same die as the central processor, meaning enhanced performance and better battery life.Intel says the package size is 60 per cent smaller and power usage 20 per cent lower than the previous generation.PC makers are already preparing to release more than 80 netbooks and entry-level desktop PCs based on the N450 and two other Atom versions announced today, according to Intel. The D410 and D510 offer better performance but are more power-hungry, making them less suited to battery-dependent netbooks.Around 30 smartbooks are expected to appear in the first quarter, many featuring 3G wireless connectivity, Linux-based operating systems and all-day battery life from their ARM-designed microprocessors, from rival chipmakers including Qualcomm, Freescale and Nvidia.Intel says around a dozen operators offer netbooks with 3G data connections currently and the numbers are expected to grow with the new platform. The bulk of the new systems will feature Windows 7 Starter or Home Basic operating systems, with some OEM’s offering Moblin Linux V2, an Intel-led alternative operating system and interface.“We have yet to see any [smartbooks], so it’s all speculation,” said Anil Nanduri, Intel’s director of netbook marketing, on the threat from the new category.“But Atom has been the processor of choice in today’s netbooks and we continue to innovate and provide the capabilities needed in the category.”The world’s biggest chipmaker has shipped more than 40m Atom chips for netbooks to date.One of the first netbooks to feature the new N450 is the Dell Inspiron Mini 10 (pictured).

563;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-12-11T19:00:28Z;Qualcomm’s Personal TV is new screen for FLO;;Qualcomm, which once produced its own handsets to try to win wider acceptance of its cell phone chips, is repeating the strategy with the announcement of a Personal TV product, aimed at boosting take-up of its FLO TV mobile technology.The new handheld device is FLO branded, Frog designed and made for Qualcomm by Taiwan’s HTC. It will go on sale at US retailers during the holiday season for $249 and will require a monthly subscription of around $10.(This review was first published on October 7, 2009)Qualcomm has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building a national broadcast network and recruiting content partners for its live TV channels service for cell phones equipped with its FLO chips.It has been adopted by the leading US carriers, Verizon Wireless and AT&T, but Qualcomm needs the service to achieve greater scale to justify its investment.It has struck a deal with Audiovox to bring FLO TV to cars and the Personal TV takes the service further beyond the cell phone.When I spoke to Bill Stone, FLO TV president, about Qualcomm going it alone with its own device, he said AT&T and Verizon price the the service at around $25 a month when they package it with some of their other data offerings.“My view is that’s shooting over the heads of the market a little bit, I think the opportunity to get to a $10 monthly price point with a lot more breadth of content is going to be really attractive to customers,” he said.There will be up to 20 channels of content, including NBC, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Four gigabytes of Flash memory on the device will allow recording and time-shifting of programming and provision of on-demand services.Qualcomm also plans to introduce accessories early next year that will FLO TV-enable devices like the iPhone, through either a separate Wi-Fi based device or an attachment.The focus is on the US for now, with FLO TV expected to be available in 100 local markets by the end of the year, but international growth will also be needed for Qualcomm’s FLO TV chip production to scale.
564;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-12-03T21:27:13Z;ST Ericsson cuts 600 more jobs;;ST Ericsson, the maker of mobile phone chips, on Thursday said was planning to cut up to 600 more jobs – 7.5 per cent of its workforce – in an effort to make an additional $115m in annual savings.It will be the third round of restructuring and lay-offs that the loss-making company has announced in the past year. Created by combining the wireless chip operations of three companies – Ericsson, ST Microelectronics and NXP Wireless – the company announced 500 staff cuts in November to save $250m and a further 1200 redundancies in April with an aim to saving $230m a year.“These savings are expected to come from reductions in operating expenses and spending, along with an extensive R&D efficiency program,” ST Ericsson said.ST Ericsson, which supplied chips for mobile phones made by Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG Electronics, is under pressure to cut costs and reach profitability. In October, the company reported a $121m operating loss on net sales of $728m. The company said it would break even once sales were between $750m and $800m, but the strong euro was making it difficult to reach this goal.The company, which competes with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, reports its sales in dollars but most of its costs are in euros. The company had $216m in cash left at the end of the third quarter, having burned through nearly half of the original $400m it started with earlier this year.If it cannot reach breakeven, ST Ericsson would be forced to make a cash call on its parent companies, Ericsson and ST Micro. Such a move would be particularly unpalatable for Ericsson which is already facing calls to support its Sony Ericsson joint venture with Sony.
565;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-11-24T18:51:25Z;Brussels drops Qualcomm antitrust probe;;Europe’s top competition regulator has ended a four-year inquiry into patent royalty rates charged by Qualcomm after the remaining companies that had brought a complaint against the US mobile chipmaker withdrew.European Commission officials said on Tuesday that they had “committed time and resources to the investigation in order to assess a complex body of evidence,” but had not reached any formal conclusions.“All the complainants have now withdrawn or indicated their intention to withdraw their complaints and the commission has therefore to decide where best to focus its resources and priorities,” they said in a statement. “In view of this, the commission does not consider it appropriate to invest further resources in this case.”The EU probe, which began in 2005, followed a complaint by Nokia, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Ericsson, NEC and Panasonic Mobile Communications. This alleged that San Diego-based Qualcomm had refused to license patents to chipset competitors “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,” while “offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm”.The complainants had argued that Qualcomm’s technology played less of a role in 3G than in the previous mobile phone generation and therefore its royalty rates should be lower.But two of the complainants – Nokia and Broadcom – soon withdrew their objections after reaching settlements with the chipmaker.This year, the remaining complainants won favourable decisions from the Japanese and South Korean competition authorities, with Seoul imposing a record fine of just over $200m on Qualcomm.However, the issues and technologies involved were not identical to the EU case and Qualcomm is contesting both the Asian rulings.There has been a lot of speculation over whether the EU authorities were as willing to pursue the case as their Asian counterparts. Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, is believed to have called a rarely used panel to review the situation.Frustration at the lack of progress in Europe – and the hope of greater success in other jurisdictions – seems to have led the remaining companies to withdraw their EU complaint, although no official reason was given.Ericsson said only that “after success in Korea and Japan, Ericsson withdraws its complaint with the European Commission”.But Ericsson did signalthat it hoped action by other parts of the commission might prove more productive – such as an industry directorate white paper on modernising information communication technology standardisation in the EU.Qualcomm said it was “extremely pleased” with the outcome.
566;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm sees falling phone prices in 2010;;The growth of the smartphone category is causing intense competition among operating systems, handset makers and the chipmakers that supply them.Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, the biggest wireless chipmaker, sees that competition intensifying over the next year in smartphones and other handsets, which will translate into lower prices.“If I look at the chip business, I definitely see some of our competitors who are sort of down and are getting a little bit more desperate, and I think we’re going to see a pretty competitive market over the next year,” he told me, before Qualcomm’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.Qualcomm’s competitors include Texas Instruments, Samsung, Broadcom, Freescale and, shortly, Intel with its Atom processor.Average selling prices (ASPs) for handsets using Qualcomm’s CDMA technology were $200 in its fiscal year ending in September. It expects ASPs to fall around 6 per cent in the current year to $189 as 3G operators expand in emerging markets and offer cheaper devices.ASPs for the chipsets inside the handsets will also fall. They usually decline around 3 per cent each year, but Qualcomm expects the figure to be “substantially higher” in 2010.It has been preparing for a possible price war by cutting its costs and investing in research that leads to integrated chipsets, where more technologies can be crammed on a single chip.This appeals to customers, who pay more for the chips but need fewer of them, and Qualcomm, which can maintain its gross margins by being the single chip solution of choice.If the chipmaker sees 2009 as the year of the smartphone, it views 2010 as the year when smartbooks – a category somewhere between smartphones and netbooks – will take off.Qualcomm stands to benefit from wider adoption of its Snapdragon 1GHz microprocessor, which is already appearing in high-end smartphones like Sony Ericsson’s X10.“We expect that the first smartbooks will be announced before the end of this year,” Steve Mollenkopf, head of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, told the earnings call.“2010 [is] expected to be the year that Snapdragon-powered smartbooks ramp [to] volume production.”
567;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-11-05T00:54:10Z;Cisco sees recovery gaining steam;;John Chambers, Cisco Systems chief executive, on Wednesday said the economic recovery was picking up steam, giving him the confidence to increase headcount and spending.“We are starting to see solid indications of economic recovery in most geographies around the world,” Mr Chambers said.“We will set our strategy assuming an optimistic view on the economy.”While he acknowledged that not all sectors were coming back strongly, he said the increase in orders was prompting the technology stock bellwether to put “the gas pedal all the way down” in making investments for growth.His comments came after the leading maker of networking equipment reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat projections, representing a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter.Cisco’s net income fell 19 per cent to $1.8bn, or 30 cents a share, as sales dropped 13 per cent to $9bn.Cisco predicted that sales in the new quarter would increase by between 2 per cent and 5 per cent from the quarter ending on October 24, returning the company to year-on-year growth.The company’s shares rose 3 per cent in after hours trading to $23.93.Cisco has helped some sales along with increased financing activity. Frank Calderoni, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that the company had not changed its parameters for extending credit to customers but he said the offers were now being made in more places due to geographic expansion.Cisco’s most popular equipment is used to direct data on the internet and within companies, so the orders it receives can indicate the anticipated growth of a broader segment of the economy.Mr Chambers said that not all his customers shared his optimism, suggesting they might not be planning to hire as rapidly as Cisco. “There are a lot of caveats around job creation and sustainability.” He said the recovery was uneven, with public sector spending outpacing corporate purchases.Citing uncertainty about the shape and strength of the recovery, Mr Chambers said that Cisco was only planning to ramp up its spending in the current quarter, deferring judgment on the following months until more evidence was available.“We could see economic growth bounce up and down in the next 12 months,” he said.The company is pursuing multiple large acquisitions and its board on Thursday approved an additional $10bn in stock repurchase authority.●Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, said the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones was “very bullish” on 3G market growth in 2010, predicting a 20 per cent increase.Mr Jacobs announced full fiscal year revenues of $10.4bn, in line with guidance given at the start of the year.www.ft.com/techblog
568;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-11-04T23:17:46Z;Fake handsets threaten brands;;Grey market handsets from China are posing an increasing threat to multinational brands such as Nokia as they flood emerging markets, according to a report.Total shipments are set to reach the equivalent of 13 per cent of the legitimate global mobile phone market this year, the electronics research group iSuppli said.China’s grey market wireless handset shipments are expected to amount to 145m units in 2009, up a “stunning 44 per cent from 101m in 2008”, said iSuppli.The figures shed light on a little-researched sector that has been booming in China during the past five years. Thousands of small workshops, mostly in Shenzhen, have been churning out cheap copies of branded handsets and “improved” models with creative new features such as powerful speakers or flashlights.The rise of the whitebox handset makers – typically tiny assembly shops with no previous history in electronics manufacturing and an average headcount of less than 10 – was helped by Mediatek, the Taiwanese chip design house, which offered turnkey software products alongside its mobile chips.But while the cheap devices conquered China’s rural and migrant worker markets from 2005, growth is now slowing as domestic branded handset makers such as Lenovo Mobile, TCL and Tianyu have started hitting back with cheaper phones that carry some of the features invented by the copiers.Kevin Wang, director of China Research for iSuppli. said: “Margins in the grey market are being squeezed so producers have started exporting aggressively.”The iSuppli report estimates that grey market handset exports will jump to 110m units from 60m units last year.“Although we are seeing some devices appearing in some western European countries, most of the exports are going to emerging markets, with India, Russia and Brazil being the focus,” Mr Wang said.“This will not hurt the supply chain – they benefit either way. But it will be most damaging for Nokia.”According to iSuppli, the grey market could peak at 192m units in 2012 as global branded handset makers are expected to respond with new models in emerging markets.How the sector fares beyond that depends mainly on whether Mediatek can continue its supporting role after third-generation mobile services become the mainstream.The company is ready to make 3G chips but still needs an agreement with Qualcomm on using its 3G-related patents.
569;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-11-02T16:44:02Z;Valley View: Google starts to reap rewards of smartphone openness;;The arrival of a giant chocolate eclair on the front lawn at Google last month had an extra significance, other than as the latest example of outlandish artwork installed at the headquarters of the world’s biggest internet company.It joined a huge cupcake and a well-rounded doughnut, both sitting under the watchful eye of a large green robot.The addition of another oversized bakery item in fact represented something of a celebratory tea party for the first anniversary of the launch of the Android mobile operating system and its first phone.To solve the riddle: Cupcake was the codename for the 1.5 version of Android, Donut was 1.6 and Eclair is 2.0, launched last week. The robot is a larger-than-life representation of the Android logo.After a slow start, Android is turning into a Google success story. The adventure began when Google bought Android, a Valley mobile software start-up in 2005. Two years ago this week, the Open Handset Alliance was launched, with companies including Google, T-Mobile, HTC, Qualcomm and Motorola announcing the development of Android, “the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices”.The first phone came out a year ago – the G1 from HTC of Taiwan, available on T-Mobile’s network in the US. There was little progress in terms of handsets over the next few months – only a second model from HTC – the Magic – was launched.When Google announced in July it was developing a second operating system, around its Chrome browser, there was speculation Android may be doomed.But in the last month or so, there has been a rush of support for Android. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, said on Google’s third-quarter earnings call that there were now 12 handsets with 32 carriers in 26 countries. The platform was “about to explode”, he added.Here in the US, Sprint and Verizon have joined T-Mobile in offering Android phones and even AT&T, exclusive carrier for the iPhone, is planning an Android alternative.As well as HTC, handset makers Motorola and Samsung have announced models for the holiday season, and more are due from the likes of Sony Ericsson and Acer. There are even Android-based netbooks and eReaders on the way.Adverts by Verizon for its first phone, the Motorola Droid, have created an Android buzz and paraded its advantages over the iPhone – superior hardware, such as a 5 megapixel camera, and open software that can run different applications simultaneously.This partly explains the platform’s sudden success – Android has quickly matured to offer smartphone makers and carriers a realistic contender at last to the iPhone. Microsoft recently introduced Windows Mobile 6.5, but multi-touch features and a major update will not be available until version 7 appears next year.Google has also been successful in winning over developers – a crucial factor if one looks at how they have driven the success of the iPhone, with more than 85,000 applications in its App Store.Google gave a free Android phone to everyone at its last developer conference and, as one analyst who attended told me: “Google is very open to developers and really engages them, it lets them pursue the ideas they want. You go to Apple developer conferences and you get controlled.”So while Apple has far more apps than the 10,000 or so in the Android Market and had sold more than 40m units of the iPhone and iPod Touch by this summer, compared with fewer than 2m Android phones, that superiority is likely to be reversed.The number of Android applications being worked on by developers nearly doubled last month compared with September, according to Flurry, the analytics company.The research firm Gartner expects Android will overtake the iPhone by 2012, when it forecasts nearly 100m Android phones will ship, with smartphones becoming around half of the mobile phone market at more than 500m sold.Google has no plans to push Android the same way that Apple does, with a huge marketing campaign – it is leaving it to carriers to advertise its virtues and its open nature means handset makers are overlaying their own interfaces and applications.Android seems more of an attempt by Google to steer the mobile computing environment in a direction that will suit the expansion of its core competencies – search and web services such as e-mail – and the advertising revenues that accompany them.It has encountered difficulties with Apple in expanding those services on the iPhone platform, but Android will give it a bigger opportunity to grow.What comes next is not all that clear: perhaps a Google own-brand phone, and we already know that “Flan” is next in the alphabetical progression of operating system codenames.But after that? Something beginning with G that you’d find in a cake shop – gateau? garibaldi? galette? The suspense is almost unbearable.
570;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Google to take on iPhone with own phone – analyst;;Google is expected to launch its own self-branded smartphone before the year is out, according to Ashok Kumar, Northeast Securities analystIt will follow up with a series of phones running its Android operating system, as well as launching a branded netbook running its new Chrome operating system early next year, the analyst told me.Mr Kumar said he had spoken to Google’s original device manufacturer (ODM) partners in Asia, who would supply the phones.“Google’s secret sauce is its software stack, that’s where it excels, it can outsource manufacturing, it has been using Motorola as a guinea pig,” he said.In a report, Mr Kumar said the new Google smartphone would use the 2.0 version of the Android operating system, “the same iteration of Android as the Motorola Droid. The hardware, featuring Qualcomm baseband, is expected to be competitive with Motorola’s offering.”The Motorola Droid is being launched on Verizon’s network in November, with the carrier launching an advertising campaign at the weekend that pitched it as being in direct competition with the iPhone.Mr Kumar’s report suggests the Google phone will feature the most powerful processor for Android – Qualcomm’s 1Ghz Snapdragon processor, and he says the same chipset will appear in the netbook.His report suggested Google would sell the phone at retailers, rather than through carriers, although he told me it made sense for Google to work with a carrier in distributing the phone, rather than selling it itself without a subsidy.A Google smartphone, while long rumoured, would be surprising at this stage, with a number of new Android phones already expected by the end of the year in the US from Motorola, Samsung and HTC.The Android platform appears to be taking off without the need for Google to drive the market with its own handset.“Android adoption is literally about to explode. You have all the necessary conditions. You have the vendors, you have the distribution, and so forth,” Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, told analysts on its earnings conference call last week.“Android, as you know, has come a long way in a year, from one device with one carrier in one country and now 12 devices in 26 countries with 32 carriers with much more coming.”Mr Kumar said in the interview the new Google phone would be “the first of many from Google, I think it can put out a differentiated product, this is a marathon not a sprint”.
571;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-10-19T19:59:55Z;Smartphones enter the gigahertz age;;An ARM race is beginning to take shape in smartphones, as the latest models demand faster processors to deal with an expanding range of computing and multimedia activities on devices.Marvell announced today it would overtake Qualcomm’s 1GHz Snapdragon processor with a new family of Armada processors, based on ARM of the UK’s designs, capable of speeds up to 1.2Ghz.That is twice the clock speed of the 600Mhz iPhone 3GS and the new Motorola Droid, reported to contain a 600Mhz Texas Instruments processor.Marvell says more than 50 devices have already been designed by customers for the new chips. The 1Ghz Armada 600 will be aimed specifically at smart phones, while a 1.2Ghz Armada 1000 targets Blu-ray players and set-top boxes. Other versions will cater for netbooks, e-readers and digital photo frames.Qualcomm is making samples of its second-generation Snapdragon, running at 1.3GHz, at the end of this year, with a dual-core 1.5GHz version coming after that.Handset makers have been piling on features to try to outdo the capabilities of the iPhone and there have been big investments in phones for Google’s Android platform.In processors, the iPhone is now outgunned on Android by the Samsung Moment, announced earlier this month, with its 800MHz processor, and the 1GHz Snapdragon processor in the Acer Liquid (pictured), announced last week.The first smartphone with a gigahertz processor was the Toshiba TG01, which runs the Windows Mobile operating system.“Our customers want differentiation and consumers want features, and the easiest way to add features is to make devices with more and more powerful processors,” Sehat Sutardja, Marvell chief executive, told me.“So today we have 1.2GHz, next year we will have 2GHz processors.”Marvell bought Intel’s XScale mobile phone business in 2006 and has continued to sell its processors, based on the x86 architecture used in PC microprocessors, for BlackBerry devices.However, Mr Sutardja said he approved a top-secret project eight years ago to develop processors with ARM instruction sets and Armada is the result.Armada also takes the best of XScale in its video acceleration capabilities and efficiency at running Adobe’s Flash technology.The company says Armada will run full 1080P HD video and span a range of devices from the low-cost embedded market to high-end smart phones and Blu-ray players.That means Marvell will join other chipmakers, such as Qualcomm, Freescale and Nvidia, in challenging Intel as it expands into consumer electronics, smartphones, netbooks and the embedded market with its Atom family of processors.
572;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-10-08T23:49:01Z;Qualcomm chief in call over heavy data users;;Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, has entered the net neutrality debate in the US with its chief executive calling for heavy data users to be discriminated against as wireless networks reach capacity.Paul Jacobs’ call at the CTIA wireless industry conference in San Diego came a day after Julius Genachowski, head of the Federal Communications Commission, warned that there was not enough room available on the airwaves for the “explosion” in wireless data traffic.Mr Jacobs said he had given the FCC chairman his views on “traffic shaping” as one solution to what the FCC describes as a “looming spectrum crisis”.He described traffic shaping as “the ability to say: ‘let’s be fair, this person’s moved a lot of data, this person’s used a little’, if they’re paying the same amount, then the person who’s used less will get more access”.John Donovan, AT&T’s chief technology officer, told the conference that smartphones and the applications they ran had caused a 5,000 per cent increase in data usage over three years.“We will need to manage our way through data-hungry applications or devices on our network that would degrade the experience for others,” he said.Supporters of net neutrality say there should be no discrimination on a free and open internet.Internet providers should not block, speed up or slow down web content based on its source, ownership or destination.Mr Jacobs said this “more radical notion” of net neutrality was born out of the internet bubble and the notion that bits of data were free, when in fact they had now become very expensive for providers.“Regulators may not know that, the lawmakers may not know that, and so we need to make that clear, and it’s very obvious that we are pushing the limits of the amount of capacity we have.”Mr Jacobs said it would perhaps be too intrusive to go down the route of saying one internet service was fine on a network and another was not, but operators needed to be able to manage their networks.In his speech, Mr Genachowski had said that the FCC had not yet decided what measures to take to preserve an open internet. Proceedings would begin this month to establish “rules of the road”.He conceded that mobile had unique congestion issues and the last thing the FCC wanted was to impose “heavy-handed and prescriptive regulation”.
573;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
574;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-09-10T22:16:46Z;Motorola unveils Google-powered smartphone;;"Motorola on Thursday unveiled its first Google Android-powered smartphone, a touch screen device designed to compete with Apple’s iPhone that will target consumers who use social media sites.The 3G and Wi-Fi enabled handset, called the Motorola Cliq in the US and the Motorola Dext elsewhere, is the first of a raft of new devices aimed at reviving the struggling US mobile maker’s fortunes.“I think we will deliver compelling smartphones in the marketplace over . . . the next 12 months which will definitely reposition the company from a voice-centric company to very much a mobile internet, data- driven company,” said Sanjay Jha, co-chief executive of Motorola and chief executive of the its troubled mobile devices division.The smartphone market is the most dynamic of the global mobile phone market segments, but Motorola will face tough competition from rivals including Nokia, Apple, Research in Motion, Palm and HTC, which have launched new devices in recent months.Motorola is seeking to differentiate its new smartphone from rivals with
a user interface called “Motoblur” that sychronises contacts, posts, messages and photos from sources such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Gmail, work and personal e-mail, and LastFM – and automatically delivers it to the device’s home screen.The Cliq will be offered exclusively in the US by Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and the Dext elsewhere including Orange in the UK and France, Telefónica in Spain and America Movil in Latin America.Mr Jha, who joined Motorola from Qualcomm with a mandate to turn round Motorola’s loss-making mobile phone business, acknowledged that the new family of Android-powered smartphones were crucial to the company’s strategy.“How they [the handsets] are received, and how they perform in the marketplace will be important factors in our deciding how we go forward,” he said.Motorola’s mobile phone business and market share collapsed after the company failed to develop products needed to replace its ageing Razr phone."
575;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-08-27T20:52:08Z;View from the Top: Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm;;Paul Taylor, technology reporter, interviewed Paul Jacobs, chief executive and chairman of Qualcomm, in New York. They discussed mobile computing, trends in cell phone technology, overseas sales and impact of healthcare and immigration reform in the US. This is a transcript of that interview.PART 1: On mobile technologyFinancial Times: We’re here with Paul Jacobs, the CEO of Qualcomm, the biggest cell phone chipmaker in the world. Paul, it’s a very exciting industry and a very exciting time to be in the industry. What are the big trends that you see?Paul Jacobs: Well we’re seeing the shift from second-generation to third-generation technology. And next year we actually project that third-generation phones will be more than half the total market. But what’s really cool is the kind of power that’s going into these phones. Computing power and lots of consumer electronics functionality. We’re going to see coming out at the end of this year, going into next year, things called smartbooks, which are basically smartphones but with a 10-inch screen and a full-size keyboard that will be on the net all the time. So you’ll have your email, contact and calendar synchronized all the time. You won’t have to wait to get on the internet.FT: Is that just another name for netbooks, or are we talking about something really quite different here?PJ: We see it as something quite different. A netbook to us is really an inexpensive PC with a smaller screen, little slower processor. A smartbook is really like a smartphone. It’s on the network all the time and that, I think, is going to make a fundamentally different experience for peopleFT: And what in terms of the underlying technology is different about a smartbook? What do you have to do that’s sort of difficult, if you like?PJ: So what we did was we built a very, very power-efficient microprocessor that goes into the same chip that has the radio in it. So the radio that would run your cell phone now has a gigahertz processor associated with it. And that means that it can run the web very, very fast. Run applications very fast, but doesn’t use very much power at all.FT: Right. So what sort of things do you think that consumers, business people, will use this sort of device for?PJ: Well, it’s really going to be very good for cloud computing models where you’re getting your application off of the internet. So people know a lot about these applications, Google obviously is a company that’s been pushing that kind of application…FT: So Google Docs and sheets and yea…PJ: Absolutely… Yea, all those kinds of things, but there’s also going to be local applications running on it. The Android operating system is one of the operating systems that’ll be running on these smartbooks as well. So you’ll have that whole ecosystem of developers building applications.FT: Right. I guess this is all really about convergence, isn’t it? The coming together or the telecoms and computing world. Is that how you see it?PJ: Yea, I mean we almost look at it as a perfect storm of the device capabilities, these high-speed networks and then all of the applications that are coming off of the web and being created. This comes together and gives you this opportunity to create a totally new experience.FT: Are you going to face a lot of competition in this market do you think? I mean recently Intel and Nokia announced a pact. We don’t know exactly what sort of products are going to emerge from that, but one could imagine that they could be quite similar.PJ: Right. So I think everybody recognizes that there’s a great opportunity here. The benefit for us of being the leading chipset manufacturer is that we can afford to do a lot of investment in R&D - 20 per cent of revenues into R&D. And so that allows us to stay ahead both on the radio technology side and we’re able to put a very large investment into the microprocessing technology. So I would say that we have a very strong position for mobile computing, meaning things where you really care a lot about power consumption. I think we’re leading them right now.FT: Is there any one area that’s holding you back there? For example, battery technology perhaps hasn’t made the sorts of strides that we’ve seen other areas make. Is that a problem?PJ: Sure. Power consumption really is the key thing in the device that you carry around with you. One of the things that we’re really working on for the future is the new display technology because it turns out that the display is where most of the power is being consumed since we’ve gotten the processor power down so much. So this display technology is a reflective technology and it has very nice colors, it can be always on. And so that will be another interesting thing. Today you put your device down it looks like it’s off because the screen goes dark. In the future we’ll be able to leave the screen on and actually have interesting information stay on the screen at all times.FT: Right. So that’s very interesting. What’s that technology called?PJ: That’s called Mirasol technology and its basically uses the same technique that a butterfly’s wings use to make color. It interferes, creates interference between light coming into the mirror and what’s coming out to make colors.FT: So this really quite fundamental research and development that you’ve done here to develop this technology…PJ: Yea, It’s a brand-new process. We actually invested in a company a few years ago. We bought that technology and we spent about four years trying to make it into a commercially realizable product and we’re there though.FT: Paul, the other area that Qualcomm has invested quite heavily in is mobile television. And you have a technology, a network called Media Flow. Tell me about that and how it’s been progressing.PJ: Well what’s nice is that we’ve now had the digital TV transition here in the United States so we’ve been able to be nationwide with this technology, this mobile TV since June. And we see some very interesting things. People like to have television with them when there’s some event happening. The biggest usage we’ve seen was during the Michael Jackson memorial service, if you can imagine that. We’re looking at putting this technology in other devices, including the smartbook devices so that you would be able to get not just video on the screen of your smartbook, but you’d also get data or maybe pre-caching content like the most popular YouTube videos, or Twitter, or things like this. So we look at it both as a mobile video solution so that you can watch TV, but also a mobile data solution as well.FT: At the moment Media Flow is a US-specific phenomenon in that you licence the technology and the bandwidth to US carriers. Do you see opportunities overseas for the same technology?PJ: We do. Mobile TV has had a chequered history I’d say internationally. It’s very popular in Asia, it has been less popular in Europe. We are looking at areas and we will be making some announcements in the not too distant future about partnerships that we’re having outside the United States.FT: Not all companies, not all big technology companies make those sorts of investments. It’s easy enough to continue to milk a successful technology rather than invest in new ones. What is the importance from your perspective of doing, of doing that type of investment?PJ: Well the key thing for us is that we don’t want to end up being a commodity product and so we really put a lot of effort into trying to understand where the market might go to try and drive the market there, whether it’s on the radio technology side, whether it’s on the kind of functionality that we’re putting into the device. Or on these other areas like screens. We recognized a long time ago that you’d be looking at your phone a lot more than you would be holding it up to your ear and therefore the display was really important.Part 2: On overseas salesFT: Qualcomm is a very interesting company financially because of course most of your revenues actually come from overseas now and yet you’re a San Diego-based technology company. How does it split out? What can you tell me about the picture of your geographic revenues?PJ: Yes. So basically we have 80 per cent of our employees in the United States, as you said, but really most of our revenues now are coming out of Asia Pacific region. And I would say it’s, I think the US revenues are in the roughly 10 per cent range now. So really most of our revenues come from outside the United States. Now there’s this whole issue of what revenues are onshore, what revenues are offshore. Chips are actually built offshore and sold offshore. They never even come into the United States until they come as a final product. A very interesting dynamic there.FT: What does this mean in terms of the US economy and perhaps the economic environment or the tax environment for Qualcomm? Are there things that coming out of the recession, and we all hope we are, that the government should be doing more of to assist technology companies like Qualcomm.PJ: While we like the things like R&D tax credits, we need to make sure that the government doesn’t put taxation policies in place that actually encourage jobs to move out of the United States. As I said, we have most of our employees in the United States creating these new technologies and designing the products. We don’t want policies put in place that incent you to move them out because you’re being penalized for creating those high-paying jobs in the US.FT: The policies that the current Obama adminsitration is following, you know some of them have quite dire, perhaps, repercussions for industry as a whole. What’s Qualcomm’s thinking on, for example, healthcare reform?PJ: Well healthcare is an interesting one because obviously something that people are watching very carefully. And one of the big impetus for healthcare reform is the cost of healthcare. And we actually believe that wireless technology is going to make a big impact in improving the cost and the quality of healthcare. We already have some products that we’re working with partners on that have been shown to be three times better than the traditional method. It’s using a wireless device to actually monitor your heart, see whether you have any problems with your heart as opposed to sitting in the hospital and seeing whether you have problems.So there’s already examples where wireless technology improves the performance of the healthcare system and lowers the cost and we think that’s going to be a trend going into the future.FT: Are there any other areas of policy that you would like to see reformed?PJ: Well immigration is obviously one that we’re very concerned about. We have this H1-B or skilled visa issue we often try to hire employees that we can’t bring into the United States. Even people who have been trained as students in US universities have to go to some other country to work for us, instead of coming to the United States. So we’d like to see that resolved as well.FT: Right. What in more general terms are you seeing in terms of the economy? Are you seeing any upturn yet, either in the domestic economy or in the broader global economy?PJ: I would say if we look around from our vantage point in the cell phone industry we can see there’s still some softness in western Europe, a little softness in Japan. But other than that I would say that things are pretty good in Asia Pacific, specifically is doing quite well. Obviously China is going well, South Korea seems to be going well. And then I’d say if I look out at the economy in general, you know we’re concerned because employment, unemployment may make the recession last a little longer, recovery a little slower. But people are spending on cell phones still.FT: Right, Good. Thank you very much indeed for your time.PJ: Great, thank you.LONG/SHORTFT: Now we’re going to play Long/Short. Are you ready?PJ: Alright.FT: SmartphonesPJ: Very long.FT: Telecom network operators?PJ: Long.FT: Nokia?PJ: Long.FT: The dollar?PJ: Short or long term? Long right now and maybe short in the future.FT: Okay. Engineering?PJ: Very long.FT: California?PJ: I love California. I’m going to have to say long.FT: Intel?PJ: Intel I think they’re a good partner of ours so I’m going to say long but they could be short if they get on the wrong sides.FT: Lawyers?PJ: Now you’re asking tough questions. Um, medium. You can’t live with them…FT: Yea, right. Or without them. China?PJ: China, very long.FT: Green technology?PJ: Long.FT: Great.
576;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-08-24T17:53:04Z;The Nokia/Microsoft truce, Part 2;;The unveiling of Nokia’s new Booklet 3G is the second piece of news this month to highlight the striking change that has gone on in the relationship between the once implacable enemies from the mobile and PC worlds. For both companies this makes eminent sense – up to a point.The first development was the agreement to put Microsoft’s Office on Nokia’s handsets (though timing and product details were entirely absent). This involved the tacit admission from Microsoft that its Windows Mobile platform was losing ground. With RIM, Apple and Google making the running, it was time to seed its software on other platforms, even if that meant cozying up to Nokia.Now comes a complementary move that will see Nokia promote Windows for PCs. This has a similar defensive feel. Nokia’s great strength is its massive distribution through mobile operators around the world. If it doesn’t have a full range of devices to sell – and these days, that means everything from the most basic handset to small laptops – its rivals will have a chance to jam a foot in the door.Do these moves make sense? Certainly. If you’re acting defensively, who better to align yourself with than the biggest player in town – and that means Nokia in mobile and Microsoft in laptops.But will they work? Only to a limited extent. Playing defence doesn’t innoculate you against real innovation. For Office, the threat comes from the propensity of mobile users to embrace new styles of working, and their willingness to plug into services in the cloud rather than client apps: they simply may not feel the need to engage with Office on their mobile handsets. For Nokia, the risk is that a new generation of laptop-like machines powered by ARM-based chips from companies like Qualcomm will bring superior battery life and more of the simplicity of handsets to the PC world.For both Microsoft and Nokia, success ultimately depends on a lot more than just playing solid defence.
577;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-30T15:33:39Z;Taiwan’s TSMC sees rebound in demand;;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported an 87.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in revenue for the three months to June on Thursday, underscoring the speed with which the technology sector has rebounded from its worst crisis in recent years.TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, commands half of the contract chip market.It is seen as a bellwether for the high-tech industry because its chips go into products from computers to mobile phones to machinery for companies such as Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices.The company suffered one of its worst drops in revenue in the first quarter as the impact of the slowdown moved up the complex technology supply chain.Chipmakers such as TSMC, which sit at the head of that chain, suffered outsized losses as customers chose to run down their inventory stock rather than continue to place orders.With high-tech brands and manufacturers restocking and with rising Chinese demand for electronics from Beijing’s stimulus measures, TSMC and United Microelectronics, its smaller rival, saw an influx of new orders in the second quarter.The company said the “second quarter saw a sharp rebound in the demand for semiconductors across all applications”, which helped boost revenue to T$74bn (US$2.25bn) and profits to T$24.4bn.This was 15 times more than the first-quarter profit but short of the T$28.8bn recorded a year ago.Morris Chang, the TSMC chairman and chief executive who returned to run the company in June, said that he expected the improvement in conditions to last through the third quarter but expressed concern that the fourth might be slightly worse than the third.Bill Lu, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said doubts remained about whether the recovery could be sustained.“We believe investors are waiting for data on back-to-school demand to determine whether growth can be sustained post 3Q,” Mr Lu wrote.TSMC’s results come a day after Taiwan’s UMC, the second biggest contract chipmaker, reported greatly improved results.UMC returned to profitability for the first time in a year as revenue more than doubled in the second quarter compared with the first.Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China’s biggest chipmaker, this week said second-quarter revenues had risen 82 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but remained in the red.Infineon, Europe’s second largest chipmaker, this week forecast sales growth after reporting a smaller loss than expected.
578;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Verizon, Qualcomm seek machine cell subs;;Verizon is turning to machines as a source of new subscriber growth, in a joint venture with wireless chipmaker Qualcomm.The great thing about machines is they won’t churn, said Steve Pazol, head of the new company at a press-conference launch today. He cited the example of a John Deere tractor sitting in a field having no interest in switching to a cheaper family plan with another carrier.Joking aside, M2M (machine-to-machine) wireless communications, including tractors talking to maintenance computers, is a promising market for service providers.The best-known example to date is Amazon’s Kindle e-reader. Qualcomm enabled the Whispernet and Whispersync services over the Sprint network that allow the latest editions of digitised newspapers to appear on the devices and Kindles to synchronise content with one another.The joint venture, yet to be given a name, is aimed at making it easier for companies to implement such applications by providing an “end-to-end solution.”It will offer wireless network services and application and device performance services to a wide range of industries, including those covering health care, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products.The new company cited an example of smart grid technology - the ability to connect wirelessly circuit breakers and transformers and create self-balancing networks would be of great interest to utilities.“This has been a niche space, it has been fragmented, we feel this partnership is going to bring us to the next level,” said Mr Pazol.The M2M market is expected to reach more than 85m connections globally by 2012, according to analyst forecasts.
579;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-27T22:57:58Z;Japan serves antitrust order on Qualcomm;;Japan’s Fair Trade Commission has taken action against Qualcomm, just days after South Korean authorities imposed a record fine on the biggest mobile phone chipmaker.Qualcomm confirmed in a statement that it had received a draft order from the FTC. The move followed Tokyo media reports that regulators planned to order the company to stop abusing its market dominance.Qualcomm said it was unable to comment in detail until it had reviewed a full translation of the order. “However, it appears that the draft is directed at common, industry-standard licensing terms that are in fact pro-competitive and were the subject of intense negotiations with very substantial Japanese companies,” the chipmaker said.Qualcomm shares dipped on the news before recovering to close down 1.8 per cent at $46.48 in New York.The company said it had “never seen any of the evidence upon which the JFTC may be relying and has not, until today [Monday], even been aware of many of the allegations”.It said it intended to pursue its right to a written response before a decision is made by the commission.The Korean FTC last week imposed its largest fine on a single company when it ordered Qualcomm to pay Won260bn ($207m). It said the company had abused its dominant position in CDMA mobile phone chips with “unfair” business practices.It charged higher royalties for handset makers who bought modem chips from competitors and offered rebates to those who bought products mainly from itself, the regulator said.The company said its practices were legal and “competition-friendly” and stated it would appeal.The San Diego-based company has also been under investigation by the European Commission since 2007 over whether it has been charging excessively high royalties for the use of its patented technology in mobile phones.This followed complaints by handset and chipmakers, including Nokia and Broadcom.Nokia and Qualcomm agreed a cross-licensing agreement a year ago to end long-running litigation, while Qualcomm settled a four-year patent dispute with Broadcom in April.Qualcomm has viewed its legal problems as an expensive distraction and would welcome an end to its clashes with regulators.
580;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-24T17:40:03Z;Microsoft;;"The last thing technology investors probably expected was a cold shower, given the Nasdaq’s recent hot streak. But Microsoft gave them one on Thursday when the software group announced the first fall in full-year sales in its 24 years as a public company. Microsoft’s numbers missed Wall Street’s already-downbeat fourth-quarter forecast by more than $1bn. On Friday, stock prices continued to drop across the sector, while Microsoft’s shares extended an 8 per cent after-hours fall.Bullish noises from the likes of Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung had fuelled hopes of a tech-led economic recovery. Indeed, component-makers do appear to have benefited from a pick-up in demand as hardware companies have replenished their depleted stockpiles. But Microsoft’s weak performance and humdrum forecast are worrying. They suggest that a recovery in IT spending by end-users remains distant.Still, not all of Microsoft’s problems can be blamed on the broader economy. Some of them are because of technology shifts, others because of Microsoft’s own failure to develop products to take on its increasingly powerful competitors. Google has won the search wars; Microsoft’s putative search deal with Yahoo is a defensive move at best.Meanwhile, Microsoft’s core software business is under threat. At the top end, it faces pressure from Apple, whose Macintosh computers are an increasingly appealing alternative to Windows-based machines. At the low end, netbooks, which mostly run inexpensive and less profitable versions of Windows, account for 11 per cent of PC sales.Come the recovery, new products such as Windows 7 and the recently-launched Bing search engine may help Microsoft ride the upswing. Still, with its shares trading on 14 times forward earnings, about half their five-year average, Microsoft’s monopoly rating seems to have gone.Hopes that a rebound in the technology sector would help to fuel a broader recovery from the downturn suffered a setback on Thursday as Microsoft reported an unexpected slump in sales for its latest quarter.The world’s biggest software company said revenues had declined 17 per cent amid falling global demand for new PCs and servers. The news follows a spate of more positive earnings news from Apple, Intel and IBM.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

581;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-23T21:01:50Z;Qualcomm legal storms abating;;Qualcomm’s lengthy legal battles mean no rest for the leading wireless chipmaker’s general counsel Don Rosenberg (pictured).After a sleepless night dealing with the Korean Fair Trade Commission’s decision to fine it a record $207m for its “unfair” business practices, he told me about the remaining outstanding complaints facing the San Diego-based company.There is still the European Commission investigation begun in 2007 into whether Qualcomm has been charging excessively high royalties and the Japan Fair Trade Commission investigation from 2006 into its business practices.These regulatory inquiries are not nearly as expensive in legal bills as the resolved disputes with Broadcom and Nokia, he said.Broadcom today reported a return to profit as it enjoyed a $133m boost from its settlement with Qualcomm.The Korean decision will be appealed once Qualcomm receives the full written report of the KFTC in two to five months’ time.The US International Trade Commission said in May that Qualcomm, Motorola, AMD, Freescale, STMicroelectronics and Spansion had infringed the patents of Tessera for the packaging of chips and banned US imports of their chips.Qualcomm learned on Wednesday that an appeal to put a temporary hold on the ban had failed, but it has already achieved a workaround – switching to a packaging contractor that has a licence with Tessera.Mr Rosenberg said Qualcomm should also be able to come into line with its business practices in Korea, where offending provisions still remain in some of its contracts.“While in some agreements some of these provisions continue to exist, it probably wouldn’t be too difficult for us to modify those in negotiations with our customers,” he said.Qualcomm’s possession of a library of mobile patents led by its development of the dominant CDMA technology, along with the complex matrix of chips found in today’s phones, are behind its legal entanglements. But does Mr Rosenberg see any light at the end of the litigation tunnel?“The big ones were Broadcom and Nokia and both of those are now behind us,” he said.“We still have some litigation and there’s no doubt we will have more – we do live in a litigious society after all, and it’s part of the cost of doing business.”
582;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm in record S Korea antitrust fine;;South Korea’s antitrust watchdog on Thursday fined Qualcomm a record Won260bn ($207m) for “unfair” business practices related to its chipset sales, sparking strong protests from the US wireless chip and technology supplier.The Fair Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the Korean market for CDMA mobile phone chips.Qualcomm had levied higher royalties on handset makers that bought modem chips from its competitors, while offering rebates to customers who bought products mainly from the US group, the regulator said in a statement.“Qualcomm owns the origin of CDMA technology and controls about 99.4 per cent of Korea’s CDMA modem chip market. It has strengthened its monopolistic position through those acts,” the FTC said.The fine is the largest the commission has imposed on a single company. The FTC fined Microsoft Won32.5bn in 2006 for anticompetitive business practices in Korea.The ruling came after more than three years of investigations into Qualcomm, following complaints from two US companies – Texas Instruments and Broadcom – and two small Korean firms – Nextreaming and Thin Multimedia Broadcom. Broadcom reached a settlement with Qualcomm in April and withdrew its complaint.The FTC said some companies such as Via of Taiwan and EoNex of Korea had tried to enter the modem chip market in 2004 and 2005 by supplying to Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, but they had failed to gain “meaningful” market share because of Qualcomm’s practices.The regulator ordered Qualcomm to stop such unfair practices and to stop taking technology royalties after the effective royalty agreement period expires.Qualcomm said the FTC decision was “regrettable” and that its business practices were “legal, appropriate and competition-friendly”. It said it would appeal.Its Korean office said Qualcomm could not accept the FTC’s decision because offering different incentives depending on the purchased volume was a “natural marketing” tactic. This week, Qualcomm warned the fine could have a “material impact” on its operations.
583;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-22T23:05:43Z;Qualcomm sales surge hints at sector recovery;;Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, reported a surge in demand in its June quarter amid growth in the 3G market.The San Diego company raised its guidance for its fiscal year in another sign that the chip industry was recovering from a slump in demand.Intel, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and now Qualcomm have all reported in the past 10 days that customers have begun replenishing their stocks after running them down in the recession.“Things have pretty much come back on the chipset side,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.“The lowest part of the trough was 63m [chipset sales] a couple of quarters ago. Now we shipped 94m this quarter, so it’s a pretty substantial recovery.”However, Qualcomm predicted lower shipments for its fourth quarter of 88m to 92m chipsets. The company said there had been a couple of significant operator launches in the June quarter and it still expected growth in the second half of the calendar year.It predicted full fiscal year revenues of $10.25bn to $10.45bn, up $200m to $400m on its previous estimate, and operating income of $3.3bn to $3.4bn, an increase of $250m to $350m on its earlier prediction.“Smartphone demand is still strong and the other trend we see is that 3G continues to be strong – we are looking at 3G passing 2G next year in terms of shipments,” said Mr Jacobs.Qualcomm also signalled it was nearing the end of extensive legal battles over its business practices, patent issues and the royalties it charges for use of its CDMA technology for mobile phones.It said it had been advised that the Fair Trade Commission in South Korea would issue a decision shortly over its alleged anticompetitive practices there.“We are also anticipating that the KFTC will impose a fine . . . we expect it will be substantial and could have a material impact on our results,” it said.Qualcomm has already settled with Nokia, the handset maker, and Broadcom, a rival wireless chipmaker, with both withdrawing complaints made to the authorities in the US, Europe and the KFTC.The company reported revenues of $2.74bn, compared to $2.76bn a year earlier. Profits of $903m, down from $915m a year ago, were an improvement on a $46m loss in the previous quarter. Its shares fell 5 per cent in extended trading, after rising about 9 per cent over the past week.
584;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-22T21:34:14Z;Squaring up for a battle in miniature;;On the morning that Google announced plans to create its Chrome operating system to rival Microsoft’s Windows, Ian Drew, head of marketing at Arm Holdings, the UK semiconductor design company, woke up with a big grin on his face.The cause of his delight was a sentence in the Google press release saying the new Chrome OS would be designed to run not just on standard computer chips, but also on Arm-designed semiconductors, which are most commonly used in phones.Arm had just won a powerful ally in what is shaping to be an epic battle with Intel over the future of microprocessors.Cambridge-based Arm dominates the market for mobile chips, with about 95 per cent of handsets containing microprocessors designed by the company. It excels in creating small and power-efficient chips that are ideal for mobile devices, and its designs form the basis of the chips made by companies such as Qualcomm, ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments,Intel, on the other hand, has dominated the market for computer chips, which are faster and more powerful, but consume far more power than mobile phone microprocessors.For many years the two chip markets remained separate and Intel made only a brief but unsuccessful foray into the mobile market.Recently, however, devices such as Apple’s iPhone and netbooks – cheap mini-laptops – have started blurring the lines between the mobile and computer industries. Intel and Arm have been set for a collision course.A number of netbooks using Arm chips were unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan in July, and Warren East, chief executive of Arm, has made bullish statements about wanting to put Arm chips in everything from television set-top boxes to servers.Intel, meanwhile, has developed a much smaller, more power-efficient chip, known as the Atom, which is used in a number of netbooks. It has said that by 2011 the company can create a chip efficient enough to be used in a mobile phone.There is still quite a difference between the two types of chips. Arm chips are about a quarter of the size and power consumption of Intel’s Atom chips, but the Atom is nearly twice as fast. Over time, these differences will shrink.“That basis of that differentiation will disappear in a year and a half to two year’s time,” agreed John Jackson, analyst at CCS Insight. At that point, what will matter are the alliances the two companies have built.Intel, for example, claims an advantage because most internet sites have been written for its chip architecture. People are increasingly surfing the web over their handsets, but some applications and websites may not run as well on an Arm-based phone.Some software companies such as Adobe have begun to switch their software to run on Arm as well as the Intel chip, but Microsoft, most notably, has not. Its full Windows operating system will not run on an Arm device, a major stumbling block. Consumers have shown a strong preference for netbooks running the familiar Windows system.Google’s plans for an operating system makes this less of a problem, as it could create a real alternative to Windows. It may also cause Microsoft to rethink its strategy.Intel, meanwhile, is also developing alliances of its own. Last month it announced a strategic partnership with Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer, to undertake joint research into products that would be a hybrid of a smartphone and a laptop.The Arm camp, however, believe they have an advantage in their more competitive business model. Unlike Intel, which designs and manufactures chips, Arm designs the chips but licenses the technology to a range of manufacturers.The market for the new hybrid devices is still in its infancy. But as more of these products come onto the market, the battle will commence.This is part of a series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.

585;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-09T05:01:30Z;Google’s free OS could cost others dear;;Google has released a few more details on the Chrome operating system, including pricing, and yes, you guessed it – it’s free.The news is completely expected but still refreshing, compared to the complicated tiered pricing and discounts detailed by Microsoft for Windows 7 last month.Google also listed some of its partners for the Chrome OS:“The Google Chrome OS team is currently working with a number of technology companies to design and build devices that deliver an extraordinary end-user experience,” it said.“Among others, these companies include: Acer, Adobe, ASUS, Freescale, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments.”So that means Acer, ASUS, HP and Lenovo are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) likely to offer a Chrome option for their netbooks. Qualcomm, Freescale and TI can all provide ARM-based processors to work with Chrome on small netbook-like devices, while Adobe can optimise its Flash software to ensure speedier rendering of web pages and applications.Google’s need for speed and better performance for its web applications seems to be driving Chrome’s development team.“Google wants to drive the evolution of computers and operating systems faster in the same way it wanted to drive the evolution of browsers faster with the Chrome browser,” said a person familiar with the project.He pointed out the desire for an end-to-end solution – while Google could speed up its web applications, it could not control other factors, such as how fast a computer booted up, unless it designed the operating system.If Google does not plan to charge for the OS and is not just doing this to antagonise and weaken Microsoft, as some have argued, where is the business benefit?“As people use more powerful computing devices centred around the web, web usage will go up and Google will benefit from that, its very similar to Android and Chrome['s business model],” said the source close to the project.Meanwhile, spare a thought for small companies, like Phoenix and DeviceVM, which have been building a business around fast start-up operating systems for netbooks, but now face an uncertain future with Google muscling in.However, they were determinedly looking on the bright side on Wednesday.“By the end of 2010, Splashtop will be in the hands of more than 150m desktop, nettop, notebook, and netbook users,” said Mark Lee, DeviceVM’s co-founder and chief executive. “Google’s entry into the market should accelerate this trend, and help to make instant-on the de facto computing standard.”Woody Hobbs, chief executive of Phoenix, which makes HyperSpace, said: “It is great that Google has validated our vision and is bringing an alternative to Microsoft’s operating system to netbooks and nettops.”So will Google expand demand for instant-on or be a category killer?

586;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-07-08T15:34:44Z;Valley View: A more mobile Intel must be agile;;Intel held its annual open-house Research Day for the media at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View this year, placing its impressive displays of future technologies among hardware relics of transistors past.While we admired a demonstration of how electrical power could be transmitted wirelessly in one corner, at the other end of the museum, Difference Engine No. 2 was being cranked up – a computing machine designed by Charles Babbage in 1849.Never built at the time, it was faithfully reproduced and made functional only this century.Between these two extremes, the evolution of computing could be seen in a succession of boxed circuitry in all shapes and sizes, including Digital Equipment Corporation’s groundbreaking 1959 PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1) and the Altair 8800 personal computer that inspired Bill Gates to create Microsoft.The exhibits were a reminder that tomorrow’s advances quickly become yesterday’s technologies and that many of the companies producing them are just as swiftly consigned to history.Intel’s Research Day emphasised that the world’s biggest chipmaker does not want to be haunted by the ghosts of computers past. It is moving forward at a rate of gigahertz into new markets, as growth in its core PC one slows.We heard how the Corporate Technology Group had been renamed Intel Labs and was being more closely aligned with the new sectors being eyed by the company, with a special focus on handheld devices.Among the displays, much was being made of how the compatibility of Intel’s designs would mean different kinds of devices being able to connect and collaborate with one another from server to desktop to laptop to handheld and consumer electronics set-top boxes.Variations of its low-power Atom microprocessor are being produced for the netbook, Mids (mobile internet devices), embedded and consumer electronics markets.The biggest prize for Intel would be to win significant share in the mobile phone market from rivals such as Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Freescale.At the same time, its rivals are moving into its territory, as the increasing power of their chips, based on the designs of the UK’s ARM, makes them good candidates for computing machines of decreasing sizes, from smartphones to Mids and whatever the future holds.This convergence of chipmakers, low-powered microprocessors and mobile devices threatens a conflagration of competition and – as with any impending war – Intel has been plotting its strategy, building its arsenal and creating alliances.It has invested substantially in software – focusing its research, strengthening its in-house teams, funding open-source mobile software and making acquisitions.It paid $884m in cash for Wind River Systems last month, a software company that should help its push into mobile.It had earlier acquired OpenedHand, a leading handset user-experience company and in May, it introduced Moblin, a new open-source operating system designed for smaller devices.This year, it announced an alliance with TSMC, the Taiwanese chip foundry, for Atom, and last month, agreed a strategic partnership with Nokia, which will give it an entry into the smartphone market and access to its 3G wireless technology.This is crucial. Intel has done well with Wi-Fi [short-range wireless networks] in notebooks, but its WiMax standard for wider areas has made little headway so far and Intel has lacked a partner to combine its wireless chips with 3G ones.In contrast, analysts expect Qualcomm-based netbooks to appear in the coming months with integrated 3G/Wi-Fi connectivity, instant-on capabilities, 10-hour battery life and lower costs because of better chip-level integration.With Intel backing open-source Moblin, some also expect Qualcomm to announce a partnership with Microsoft for Windows 7, its new operating system, to run on Qualcomm netbooks. The rupturing of the “Wintel” alliance and creation of Wincomm would indeed be a sign of changing times.In the meantime, Intel may not be in a good position to challenge as a smartphone chip supplier until 2011, when a smaller version of Atom is ready.Intel may be able to achieve success and market share with its considerable resources, but I have been surprised at the number of analysts who give it little chance of making a big impact on these unfolding markets.There is also the size and strength of the opposition.Intel faces not just big players such as Qualcomm, but scores of smaller ones, particularly in Asia, that are leveraging ARM’s designs and quickly improving on them to bring out new devices.Intel will have to be more mobile in every sense to keep up with the pace of change.
587;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;MediaTek sets sights on challenging suppliers;;Taiwan’s MediaTek, the biggest supplier of chips used in low-priced mobile phones in China, is aiming to challenge bigger US rivals Broadcom and Qualcomm by supplying chips to some of the world’s top mobile phone brands.MediaTek, which is also the world’s biggest supplier of chips for DVD players and high-definition televisions, is one of the few companies that have thrived in the current downturn.Sales in the first half of this year were up 25 per cent from a year ago and Yu Ming-to, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that he expects this year’s profit margins to improve from last year thanks to more stringent cost controls.Taiwan’s biggest chip design house has grown rapidly in recent years on the back of China’s expanding mobile phone market to become the world’s fourth-largest fabless chip design company by revenue at the end of the first quarter this year, according to the Global Semiconductor Alliance. Fabless chip makers do not own their own factories or production facilities.While MediaTek’s success in the handset market was built largely on it selling chips to large, but predominantly domestic, Chinese phone makers such as ZTE or Tianyu, Mr Yu said his company’s “biggest target” in the future was to become supplier to global handset makers such as Nokia. MediaTek already supplies chips to South Korea’s LG.Mr Yu said MediaTek hoped to compete for such supply contracts “not only on price” but on its ability to provide mobile chips that can incorporate a large variety of functions. But he added it was not something that could be easily achieved in the short term.“For tier one brands to choose a new supplier, it will require some time for them to feel comfortable with MediaTek,” he said. But he remained optimistic due to MediaTek’s experience in the DVD chip market. The company began by selling chips to little-known Chinese brands, but was approached by larger brands such as Sony and Philips for custom-made chips.Mr Yu said MediaTek hoped to build on its 18 per cent global market share in handset chips by launching chips for those using 3G technology in the second half of this year. He added that while the majority of MediaTek’s overseas sales were in China, it was Chinese mobile phone exports to markets such as India, Russia and Africa that had boosted its performance.Nearly 40 per cent of Chinese-made phones are exported, according to analysts.
588;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-29T19:54:26Z;Europe set for standard mobile phone chargers;;The hours spent combing the office to find a mobile phone charger to fit your handset will soon be over, after much of the European Union’s telecoms industry committed on Monday to producing a common charger. In addition to reducing consumer frustration, the move by 10 of the main manufacturers should also cut down on waste when old chargers are thrown away.The European Commission estimates that old chargers create “several thousand tons” of waste annually. Manufacturers supporting the move include Apple, LG, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, Research in Motion, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments. The move may also cut long-run costs for consumers because they will be able to buy new phones without chargers, as well as more cost-effective standalone chargers. Günter Verheugen, EU industry commissioner, said the manufacturers agreed to harmonise chargers in the EU in a memorandum of understanding submitted to the European Commission.Brussels’ backing should accelerate existing efforts by the mobile phone industry to simplify its chargers. An alliance of 17 device manufacturers and mobile operators, led by the GSM Association, a trade body, in February pledged to adopt the same charger technology as standard. Mobile operators have been pushing for such a move for even longer.The deal, which covers only the EU area, followed threats of legislation if a voluntary solution could not be found. It will apply to “data-enabled” mobile phones – which can be plugged into a computer to exchange pictures and files. The first generation of “inter-chargeable” phones should be in the high street from 2010, the Commission said. In most cases, they will charge within two hours,“The days of drawers full of useless old mobile phone chargers will soon be over …It is particularly welcome that the Commission was able to reach agreement with the industry without introducing new regulation,” said Malcolm Harbour, a British Conservative MEP.But while consumer groups welcomed the progress, they ex­pressed disappointment the deal did not cover the entire market – in terms of both phones and manufacturers. Beuc, the umbrella group for national consumer associations, said the problem was not confined to phone chargers but embraced other portable electronic equipment, such as MP3 players.
589;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-23T23:56:47Z;Nokia and Intel strike research deal;;Intel and Nokia unveiled plans on Tuesday to work together to create a type of mobile computing device beyond today’s smartphones and netbooks.The move takes Intel a step further towards a breakthrough into the highly prized mobile phone market. Nokia typically works with potential suppliers on joint research for several years before deciding to adopt a particular technology.For Intel, a partnership with a leading mobile player is crucial to adoption of its chips although the announcement suggested the groups would focus on niche products initially in categories of devices yet to be developed.“We believe that this will allow us to create an entire new category of devices,” Kai Öistämö, Nokia executive vice-president in charge of the group’s devices unit, told a media conference call. “The mobile and computing industries are coming together and we, as leaders in our respective industries, are taking the responsibility to really be the enablers to create this brave new world.”His counterpart, Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice-president of Intel’s ultra mobility group, described the partnership as “this year’s most significant collaboration in our respective industries”.However, the announcement was short on detail about any specific devices. “This is a technology collaboration. It is premature to talk of products,” said Mr Öistämö.Intel’s microprocessors run about 80 per cent of the world’s personal computers but the US group has struggled to enter the mobile market. In 2006, Paul Otellini, chief executive, scrapped a $5bn investment in chips for mobile devices.Recently, however, the company has been looking at the mobile device market again to reduce its dependence on PC chips, which account for 90 per cent of sales.The mobile phone chip industry is dominated by companies such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, which make chips based on designs by Arm, the UK semiconductor company, and are about a quarter of the size and power consumption of Intel’s Ato.Intel has said that, by 2011, it could have a much smaller chip for use in smartphones.
590;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Carry small, thin and light, live large;;What’s next in personal computing after netbooks? The answer, it seems, depends very much on what directions the makers of microprocessors are taking.If you were to ask Intel – at its Research Day this week - the answer would be Mids (mobile internet devices). AMD said in a briefing it was “thin and light” or “ultrathin”, while Freescale came up with some interesting-looking “smartbook” concept machines (pictured) at this month’s Computex trade show in Taiwan.Via is pushing cheaper “thin and light” notebooks for its Nano processor, while Nvidia’s Tegra processor is for machines hot on playing multimedia and displaying long battery life. Qualcomm also talks about “smartbooks” for its Snapdragon processor.Intel sees several new markets for its energy-efficient Atom processor, including netbooks, Mids and embedded applications, such as in the automotive industry. It sees all these markets being unified by the Intel Architecture and this was clearly displayed at its Research Day as its “rockstar” boffins showed applications in cars, classrooms, the living room and the office.The emphasis was on how different devices such as notebooks, Mids, set-top boxes and in-car systems could work together using Intel processors, and an office environment showed collaboration on different interfaces including a tabletop display similar to Microsoft’s Surface computer. More in the audioBoo below.Intel Labs’ vision and slogan is “Carry Small, Live Large” and includes using wireless connectivity to locate and use nearby resources such as remote displays and storage devices.Meanwhile, AMD has been briefing on its second-generation “ultrathins”. It does not have a competitive processor to compete with Intel in netbooks so it came up with this “thin and light” concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.The idea is that consumers are becoming dissatisfied with the limitations of netbooks and want something more powerful, but still light and affordable.“We’ve blazed the trail for a whole new category,” Patrick Moorhead, a vice president in AMD’s Worldwide Marketing Group, told me.“We saw there was a spot between these very expensive ultra portables like the Macbook Air and Dell Adamo and the netbooks. This market is taking off and even our competitor [Intel] has just acknowledged at Computex that it’s all about ultrathins.”Two years ago at Computex, the buzz was about ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), last year it was netbooks, this year it was ultrathins. “Thin is in,” he said.AMD had just one design win – for an HP ultrathin – at the beginning of the year, but it says 11 manufacturers are bringing out 24 machines for the holiday season, using AMD dual-core rather than single-core processors and better graphics chips. Prices will be $600-$900.That sounds impressive, but Qualcomm, Freescale and the other chipmakers are all touting forthcoming machines that show off the attributes of their processors and give another take on these mobile categories.As Richard Waters points out in his analysis of these attempts to redefine personal computing, there may end up being a big winner out there, but there are certain to be some equally big losers.
591;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-14T18:52:43Z;Mobile TV benefits from US switchover;;It may not have been a practical alternative for viewers staring at blank television screens, but a mobile TV broadcaster was able to switch on nationwide in the US at the weekend as analogue transmitters turned off.At the same time, organisations representing the elderly and minorities in San Francisco reported fielding hundreds of calls from confused viewers who had lost their pictures and did not know how to receive the new digital channels now being offered by local broadcasters.The freeing up of channels 54, 55 and 56 in Friday’s long-awaited digital switchover meant FLO TV, an offering for mobile phones from wireless chipmaker Qualcomm, could begin broadcasting immediately on the spectrum.FLO was also able to launch straightaway in the three other top-ten US markets previously denied it by the blocked-off bandwidth – Boston, Houston and Miami – as mobile TV’s hold in terms of adoption and coverage began to look less patchy.The service forecasts it will now have access to 100 major markets and more than 200m potential customers by the end of the year.FLO has spent more than $800m setting up its own national network to broadcast to phones that use special Qualcomm chips, but a rival, MobiTV has been showing strong growth with a service that streams channels over mobile operators’ existing data networks.It reported 7m subscribers this month, representing 40 per cent growth in the past six months.Paul Scanlan, co-founder and president, says new devices, cheaper plans and media companies’ increasing interest in the medium are driving growth, compared with MobiTVs early days when it was a “content scavenger”.“The big drivers are the phones, the performance of the network, the availability of these data plans and the carriers really successfully marketing them now. And a huge driver is the availability of content,” Mr Scanlan says.While the two competitors offer channels of live news, sport and regular and specialist TV programming for an extra $10 to $15 a month on a mobile phone bill, existing broadcasters have formed the Open Mobile Video Coalition and plan to equip their transmitters to offer free-to-air channels on mobile phones. Tests are planned in Washington DC this summer.For Bill Stone, president of FLO TV, expansion means establishing FLO TV in other countries and going beyond the mobile phone.“The next step for us is to get more devices out there and we’re going to have a direct-to-consumer offering,” he says.That will initially be a small box that can receive its television service and beam it over wi-fi to a device such as an iPhone or iPod touch. Qualcomm’s chips will also be incorporated in in-car entertainment systems and mobile TV could also come to laptops and other handheld devices.According to the Informa research company, the mobile industry has miscalculated in thinking mobile TV would reach the mass market earlier.It says revenues should rise from $1.5bn in 2008 to more than $10bn in 2013 although growth in many regions is still fragile.Japan and South Korea have led in deployment, but Mr Stone says spectrum availability has been problematic in many other countries.“Here we are off to the races, but in a lot of other countries that’s not the case and there’s a question of who is going to take the step to build the networks out – is it going to be the mobile operators or the broadcasters or a partnership?”
592;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-12T17:48:21Z;Companion of wisdom;;"Gadget lovers have never had it so good.Consider some of the headlines of just the past few days. Palm, a handheld computing company largely given up for dead, came out with the first smartphone that truly deserved to stand alongside Apple’s groundbreaking iPhone – only to have the rug pulled from under its feet two days later as Apple unveiled a new generation of its device while slashing the US price of its cheapest model to $99.This comes just after the world’s biggest computer makers, at a trade show in Taiwan, showed off a new range of low-priced, small-scale personal machines that test the boundaries of traditional computing. They include the first laptop-style computer to carry an operating system made by Google, an indication of how the new classes of device are heightening competition among technology companies.It seems, suddenly, that personal computing devices are turning up in all shapes and sizes. For nearly three decades, the PC has dominated the landscape. But a surge of innovation is ripping through personal technology as companies from the computing, mobile phone and consumer electronics worlds all race to define the next intelligent mass-market item.Periods of change such as this often lead to shifts in industrial leadership. As a new class of products takes shape with a different computing architecture, companies that have grown up around the new technologies come to the fore.Whether such a disruptive shift is now in the offing is the subject of growing debate. Needless to say, the powers-that-be – companies such as Microsoft and Intel – argue that their technologies can extend to absorb the new forms of computing; outsiders, however, dismiss such claims as the death throes of old empires.Everything depends on how consumers take to the coming wave of electronic gadgets. In the next few months, some strange new beasts are likely start roaming the personal technology jungle. Some go by the name of smartbooks, while others are part of a genus known as Mids, short for mobile internet devices.Then there is the dark horse that has been the subject of recent intense speculation – a rumoured Apple “media pad”, a device that could usher in a whole new category of personal technology products.One person who claims to have handled an early prototype describes it as a portable, high-definition touch-screen device, like a large-scale iPhone designed for games and video. Apple, however, is famous for experimenting with different products, many of which never see the light of day, and for now the media pad retains a unicorn-like mythicality.Much of this effort to redefine personal computing is taking place in the no-man’s-land between smartphones, with screens around 10cm (4in) diagonally, and laptop computers, the smallest of which tend to have 25cm screens. The Holy Grail: a device with the power and flexibility of a laptop and the portability and battery life of a smartphone.The history of personal computing is littered with failed attempts to invent such categories. John Sculley, who replaced Steve Jobs at the helm of Apple in the 1990s, once predicted that handheld devices such as the Newton would outsell PCs by the turn of that decade. Yet it was the returning Mr Jobs, nearly 15 years later, who eventually struck gold in the touch-screen smartphone business.Optimists point to two changes that may bring demand for new mid-sized devices, breaking down the old barriers between computers and handsets. One is the growing demand for richer communications and media experiences on the go. “With the almost addictive nature of social networking, people want to be on Facebook and Twitter and online with their friends all the time,” says Phil McKinney, chief technology officer in Hewlett-Packard’s PC division.As a result, he adds, “we’re seeing a fundamental shift in the way consumers use notebooks”. Rather than just being moved from room to room in the house – and from one electrical socket to the next – these devices are finally becoming fully portable. That change in behaviour has raised hopes for a true “companion” device, something more portable than a laptop but that still has a bigger screen than a smartphone.The other change is the arrival of more power-efficient chips that can bring far better performance to larger classes of mobile device. Qualcomm, a maker of mobile semiconductors, says for instance that its chips will soon be available in small laptop-like gadgets with 8-10 hours of battery life, twice or more the typical charge of a laptop. It calls these machines “smartbooks”, or large-scale smartphones.Intel, trying to reach down from its dominant perch in semiconductors for the PC business, is meanwhile pushing out more power-efficient chips of its own, under the Atom brand. It enthuses about the smaller Mids – though after two years, few have seen the light of day.Just because they can be built does not mean consumers will come. The “tweener” market, as Mr McKinney calls the segment between phones and laptops, is awash with concept devices and blueprints – and the contract manufacturers of Asia are lining up to build such machines. But for now, this market remains stubbornly out of reach.“It’s a Bermuda triangle, a dead zone where things are too big for your pocket and not comfortable to write on,” says Roger Kay, a veteran PC industry consultant. Consumers still show a tendency to gravitate to larger devices for creating content and smaller ones for consuming it, with little sign of a converged midrange gadget that can do both, adds Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner, a technology consultancy.So will Apple, fresh from its iPhone success, come out with a category-busting device? It has yet shown no sign of being ready to introduce such a machine and opinions are sharply divided over whether it would ever take this path. “Apple is much more about reinventing existing categories than creating new ones,” says Mr Dulaney.In the absence of a hit new crossover product, technology companies have been left trying to expand more familiar categories – with some success. A new class of small-scale, low-priced laptops, known as “ netbooks”, has become the one bright spot in the computing world. While demand for traditional machines has fallen, sales of netbooks are projected to double this year to 20m.Thanks largely to the enthusiasm for touch-screen handsets ignited by the iPhone, meanwhile, smartphones have become the only hot area of the mobile handset market, with unit sales up 14 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, compared with a 9 per cent decline in the market overall, according to Gartner.The battle lines in personal technology have been drawn around these two categories, with skirmishes across the no-man’s-land in between as PC companies try to move into the mobile phone world and mobile companies eye the PC business. So far, the entrenched powers are winning against the disruptive newcomers.Netbooks, for one, began as a potentially radical technology that challenged the PC world’s established powers. The first of those machines did not come with chips from Intel or Microsoft’s Windows operating system and were designed to be used mainly for accessing internet applications and services, not running the demanding software found on PCs. As consumers have demanded more from the machines, however, they have progressively been loaded with more software and the screen size has crept up. The vast majority are now shipped with Intel chips and Windows.Claiming victory, the PC camp now calls these machines mini-notebooks. It is a victory that comes at a price, though, since it has forced the PC industry to accept lower price points that are straining its profit margins.This suggests that, despite the occasional promise of break-out devices that threaten to turn the personal computing industry on its head, the status quo is holding for now. Speaking of today’s new personal computing devices, Mr McKinney at HP says: “I don’t think there’s such a radical shift in the use that you have a disruptive architectural shift.” The silicon and software foundations on which PC and mobile technology have been built have yet to be shaken.Technological disruption, however, has a habit of coming from the least expected places. Among the many “tweener” gadgets that are set to hit electronics stores in the coming years, there may be one that has the potential to redefine personal computing for a generation. It is a racing certainty, though, that there will be many others that join the junkyard of discarded technological dreams."
593;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-08T16:16:39Z;ST Ericsson eyes growth in US and China;;Alain Dutheil, chief executive of ST Ericsson, is looking to the North American and Chinese markets to generate growth and pull the newly created European mobile chipmaker into profit.In particular, Mr Dutheil would like to get ST Ericsson’s chips into future versions of Apple’s iPhone, or Research in Motion’s BlackBerry. Apple currently uses chips from ST Ericsson’s German rival Infineon, while the latest BlackBerrys use Qualcomm chips.“We have no American companies among our top five customers. We need to convince them to work with us,” Mr Dutheil said.In China, ST Ericsson had a recent coup in being selected by China Mobile as a partner for developing handsets for China’s domestic 3G phone standard, TD-SCDMA.“China is the one place where the market is really picking up today,” Mr Dutheil said. “The Chinese government has initiatives to restart consumption and there are big investments by telecoms operators. Development of the TD-SCDMA standard is boosting demand and we are now well positioned with Chinese suppliers.”Mr Dutheil is under intense pressure to find growth opportunities for the company. Last week, it announced plans to cut 146 jobs in France and wind down operations at its plant in Caen, France, in response to poor market conditions.ST Ericsson was created four months ago as a joint venture combining the chipmaking operations of ST Microelectronics and Ericsson. The plan was to create a large-scale European entity to compete with large US companies such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, which dominate the wireless chip sector.ST Ericsson is the world’s number two by mobile chip sales, but it got off to an inauspicious start as the market for mobile handsets and their components collapsed at the end of 2008. One of the first things Mr Dutheil had to do in April, just two months into the job, was announce 1,200 job losses. The company made an $89m operating loss in the first two months, and he is reluctant to predict when it will be out of the red.“With our restructuring plan it is possible to reach break-even in the second quarter of 2010, but I am not saying we will. It depends on whether we can get topline growth, and it depends on the market.”If ST Ericsson, which had $358m cash at the end of April, is unable to reach break-even, it may be forced to call on its parent companies for more cash. Such a move could be particularly unpalatable for Ericsson, which is already facing calls to support Sony Ericsson, its struggling mobile handset manufacturing venture with Sony.
594;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-06-02T23:14:33Z;Acer to launch Google Android notebook;;Acer, the world’s third biggest PC maker, on Tuesday said it would start producing the world’s first mainstream notebook computer using Google’s Android operating system before the end of September.The move opens a new front in Google’s battle with Microsoft by offering an alternative to the Windows operating system on small, low-priced PCs rather than just the smartphones for which Android was originally designed.It came as Microsoft revealed that Windows 7, the latest version of its operating system and one designed to work better on less powerful machines, would go on sale on October 22.Meanwhile, Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, indicated that it would also launch its own software platform for PCs and handheld devices once it completes its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, though he gave no further details.Signs that Microsoft’s stranglehold on PC operating systems is about to face fresh challenges reflect a sea change in the computing business as smartphones and “netbooks”, or small notebooks, gain in popularity and the lines between different categories of computing device blur.Microsoft charges about $20 per netbook computer for Windows, analysts say, while Google does not charge for its Android system, which is based on the open source Linux software.Microsoft’s price for the most basic version of its software is expected to rise with Windows 7, though details have not been announced.Acer’s new low-end Aspire One will run both the XP and Android operating systems and allows users to switch between the two.It would still be cheaper than the current model, the company said, but declined to comment further on its pricing strategy.Skytone, a Chinese maker, recently announced a pure Android netbook that has yet to ship.Dell, the second biggest computer maker, plans to introduce an Android product, according to a software developer that last month accidentally issued a press release announcing work on the product.Industry leader Hewlett-Packard was conducting tests but was reluctant to forge ahead for fear of reducing revenue, analysts said.“Android is beginning to show some wings,” analyst Roger Kay, of Endpoint Technologies Associates, said.
595;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-05-28T20:39:41Z;Connecting the world: Ubiquity will be a hard state to reach;;At the end of last year, 1.54bn people in the world had access to the internet. At the same time, more than 4bn people subscribed to a mobile phone, according to figures from the International Telecommunications Union.Globally, there were 1.3bn fixed phone lines – and mobile broadband was used by 5 per cent of the world’s population.The statistics reflect the changes over the past decade in the way individuals and businesses connect and communicate.Communications have become faster, more reliable and in many cases cheaper, especially in developed economies where broadband penetration is high. In developing countries, the growth of the mobile phone has brought the most change.Almost 40 per cent of people in developing countries had access to a mobile phone by the end of 2007, again according to the ITU. Although mobile broadband penetration remains low, it is only just behind the 6 per cent level of fixed, broadband connections and could well overtake that in the near future.This growth presents challenges as well as opportunities for businesses, telecommunications providers, governments and regulators. The arrival of improved communications for some have raised the prospect of a “digital divide” excluding the unconnected, and not just in the developing world.In the UK, Lord Stephen Carter’s interim report on Digital Britain, published in January, calculated that the country’s digital economy accounted for 8 per cent of GDP.But in the same report, he cautioned that the growth of the internet and related communications services could raise issues of fairness, unless steps were taken to ensure “near universal participation” in the digital economy.Increasing participation is about money, of course, but there are also considerable technical hurdles. In developing countries, fixed line infrastructures have already been “leapfrogged” by cellular networks. But even in mature markets, network technologies such as WiMax and satellite links are as important as fibre-optics and mobile broadband for businesses to be able to operate electronically, and on the move.“People are beginning to take for granted the fact that 3G services, at least, are available in the most heavily trafficked areas,” says Roger Roberts, a partner in California at McKinsey & Company, the consultancy.“For white collar knowledge workers it tends to be the case that you can count on connections in ways that people simply could not, even five years ago. But there is still a gap between pervasive, high bandwidth connectivity, and true ubiquity.”Mr Roberts points to the example of a US utility company that needs to cover rural and semi-rural areas with its field force operation. “The stretches of territory that can only be reached by satellite are significant, so the application has to be designed …to allow working in both high bandwidth and low bandwidth zones,” he says.Such considerations add significant hardware and software costs. But satellite communications remain an important option for both fixed and mobile connections in areas that are often impossible to reach with other technologies.Attempts by businesses and telecoms operators to find alternatives to both fixed and cellular connections have, however, proved less than successful.Technologies such as wireless OFDM – offering above-cellular speeds to semi-portable modems – have been used with some success in less populated areas.Digita, a Finnish network, uses Qualcomm’s Flash OFDM network running in spectrum previously used for analogue services, and plans to cover the whole of the country by the end of this year.In other markets, WiMax has been touted as the answer to high-speed connections in areas not already well covered by fixed broadband networks. It has some significant backers, including the computer chipmaker Intel.“The case for WiMax looks most attractive for fixed networks,” suggests Alan Carr, at PA Consulting. “[It] is weaker in countries such as the UK, where there is a good, fixed network. But in the Middle East, for example, where broadband and cellular networks are not as good, WiMax is more attractive.”The challenge, Mr Carr suggests, is that fixed or semi-fixed wireless networks have failed to compete with fixed connections. Faced with competition from an alternative technology, fixed and even cellular operators are likely to fill in the gaps in coverage that could attract businesses or consumers to WiMax or an alternative network.“There have to be gaps in capacity or coverage, and competition usually stimulates the fixed networks to improve,” he says. “There may be some isolated cases where these technologies are attractive, but demand might not be large enough.”Developments in fixed network technologies have also enabled them to stay ahead of the competition in technical terms. Additions to the ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) standard – Annex M for higher upload speeds and Annex L for better coverage further from the telephone exchange – have enabled it to encroach on markets previously dominated by leased lines or, at the low end, ISDN networks.In cities, operators are also introducing faster Metro Ethernet networks, giving businesses access to higher-speed connections at around a third of the cost of leased lines, according to BT. In cable, innovations such as Virgin Media’s fast 200 megabits per second service in the UK offer possibilities for very high bandwidth services, such as streaming video or telepresence.But it is also convergence that is prompting both business users and consumers to opt for fixed networks, and justifying operators’ investments in them. “The big change has been the convergence of voice and data networks,” notes PA Consulting’s Mr Carr. “In the future, there will only be one [fixed] network, based on next generation technology, which will carry everything.”In the next few years, entertainment applications, such as the BBC’s iPlayer video-on-demand service, will drive demand for connectivity as much as business services. Video conferencing and internet telephony are also set to grow, not least because of their potential to help businesses save money and cut carbon emissions.But they will also drive demand for bandwidth and, quite possibly, increase organisations’ communications costs.“Convergence covers the entire value chain. We have convergence, when Vodafone moves into fixed broadband, and when France Telecom buys sporting rights or produces movies,” says Didier Bonnet, head of telecoms, media and entertainment consulting at Capgemini.“But convergence is also causing a blurring of what you have at home, and what you have in the office, especially for the younger generation. They have YouTube at home, so why not at work?”
596;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-05-20T17:50:37Z;Silicon Valley flexes political muscle;;Silicon Valley lore has it that in 1996, when prominent technology venture capitalist E. Floyd Kvamme tried to arrange a meeting with presidential candidate Bob Dole, all he got was 15 minutes in a holding room at the San Jose airport.Much has changed since then. The headquarters of Google and Yahoo are now requisite stops on the campaign trail, and money made from technology companies flows freely towards Washington and Sacramento.Now Silicon Valley is upping its political ambitions, putting forth its own candidates for office in a bid to extend its influence on society at large.“This is the next logical progression in any community’s involvement,” said Dan Schnur, a California-based Republican strategist who worked on John McCain’s 2000 campaign. “First the politicians reach out for money, then they look for grassroots and organisational support. Gradually the community realises they can cultivate and run their own candidates.”Nowhere are the political ambitions of technologists more evident than in the 2010 race for California’s governorship. Competing for the Republican nomination are Steve Poizner, the entrepreneur who sold SnapTrack to Qualcomm for $1bn, and Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of Ebay.Both are already using their substantial personal fortunes to fund their campaigns. Earlier this month, Mr Poizner donated $3.5m of his own money to his campaign. Weeks before, Ms Whitman put $2.8m of her own money into her campaign.These candidacies demonstrate the growing clout of Silicon Valley. With its tremendous wealth and growing presence in Washington, the technology community has emerged as an important constituency to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Indeed, political power in California today may be shifting north, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley.“It’s indicative of the maturing of Silicon Valley,” said Jim Hawley, chief executive of TechNet, a lobbying group for technology companies. “More and more, the leaders of the companies are understanding the importance of policy on their companies and you see more and more people getting involved and throwing their hat in the ring.”As well as running for office, technology executives are finding other ways to be more involved in politics. Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, campaigned for Barack Obama and now serves on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, was an economic adviser to John McCain during his latest presidential bid. In Washington, many large tech companies have increased their lobbying efforts.Some see Silicon Valley as a natural incubator for politicians. “You have a lot of money in Silicon Valley, and a lot of start-ups,” said Justin Buell, a big Democratic donor consultant. “The same people are drawn to politics. They don’t start another company but a campaign.”The same ambition that led to a lucrative career can make for success in politics. “The attitude is that anything is possible,” said Mr Buell. “There’s that same entrepreneurial spirit.”Political ambitions are not confined to one side of the aisle. Chris Kelly, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, recently announced his candidacy for the state attorney-general’s office. Mr Kelly, a 38-year-old Democrat, will be among the first candidates of the “Facebook generation” to run for state office.Mr Hawley believes voters could be swayed by the candidates’ strong business records. “These are people who have been very successful at what they do,” he said. “There’s an emphasis on pragmatism and problem solving. That is what voters are very interested in.”With its large immigrant population and liberal social mores, California’s high-tech centre has long been a Democratic stronghold. But there are signs that this is changing. Aside from Mr Kelly, no prominent technologists are running as Democrats. And with few other Republican candidates for the governorship, Mr Poizner or Ms Whitman look likely to emerge as the party’s nominee.“Democrats in the late 1990s established a huge advantage in Silicon Valley,” said Mr Schnur. ”Poizner and Whitman represent an effort by socially moderate Republicans to reclaim a seat at the table.”
597;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-05-14T04:19:42Z;Profiles: Europe’s top stock picker and earnings estimator;;"Vincent RechThis year’s top European stockpicker is Vincent Rech, who specialises in technology hardware and communications equipment in Europe and US for Société Générale. Mr Rech was bearish about his markets throughout 2008, advising his clients to sell most of the stocks in his coverage area, including ADVA Optical Networking, Alcatel-Lucent, Memscap, Nokia and TomTom.He beat his benchmark by 40.6 per cent, using proprietary indicators. He attributes his success to identifying several unique sources of data over time and building a database and tools to process them.“The main advantage of this approach is to be objective,” he says. “We are not biased by sentiment or management guidance, as their visibility on their own business was close to zero, especially in the fourth quarter. Objectivity is especially useful in volatile markets with limited visibility.”Mr Rech’s background as a telecommunications engineer helps in understanding technologies and trends and how companies can benefit from them. His most spectacular achievement was to turn a “sell” on ADVA Optical Networking into a buy. For ten months the shares plunged 79 per cent and underperformed the industry benchmark by 79 per cent.He then advised investors to buy it as a value call, after which it gained 63 per cent, to outperform its benchmark by 47 per cent. “I thought that the share price was not reflecting the ability of the company to survive or the value of its brand and customer relationships,” he says. “It appears that most investors agreed with this view.”Mr Rech kept a “sell” on Memscap for the full year, as the shares sank 87 per cent and underperformed the industry benchmark by 36 per cent. He had been a long time seller, reflecting his fundamental view on the company and its management. The coverage has since been discontinued.On the positive side, Qualcomm was one of the few “‘buys”, due to the recurring nature of its cash flow, growing third generation mobile network technology adoption and the resilience of its licensing business model. Ericsson was the only European stock which he favoured.The biggest uncertainty during the year was quantifying the impact of the world economic crisis on consumer demand for technology products, such as handsets and home computers. “So far consumer-driven industries, such as mobile handsets, have been relatively more resilient than corporate and government investment,” he says. “Destocking in the retail channels and specific subsidies in China have made it more difficult to track underlying consumer demand. We have picked up some worrying signs in certain emerging countries and delayed adjustment of consumer spending could be a negative catalyst in the second half of 2009.”Gianantonio VillaniEurope’s leading earnings estimator is Gianantonio Villani, who covers Italian insurance companies for Gruppo Banca Leonardo. In his first StarMine analyst award he achieved a five-star overall rating and four or five stars on all of his ranked stocks.“Equity and credit market volatility dramatically impacted estimates for asset gatherers and insurers,” he says. “As they are directly impacted by market trends, from mid September we needed to change estimates on a weekly basis to keep them sound.”The biggest issue that Mr Villani has faced was regulatory changes. These include amendments to the accounting rules on recognition and measurement of financial instruments; insurance-specific changes in accounting rules; the regulatory framework for Italian companies; and changes in the assumptions underlying the embedded value calculation. “It was difficult to factor all of those changes into our estimates in a proper and timely way,” he admits.Mr Villani uses fairly mainstream valuation and earning models and focuses on divisional earnings generation. To increase accuracy, he factors company-specific features into the model, which he ensures reflects the company’s reporting standards rather than generic ones. He tries to keep his figures up-to-date with the changing environment throughout the year and bears in mind that accounting rules often deeply affect operating figures. He has just started coverage in the closely related area of real estate.His achievements include being top out of 18 analysts on Alleanza Assicurazioni, 35 on Assicurazioni Generali, 20 on Mediolanum, 13 on Unipol Gruppo Finanziario and 12 on Banca Generali. Interestingly, he used different models for each one.“You need to look at each company in a very different way, depending on its business model,” he says. “Even if you cover a quite small part of the financial sector, you need to limit the standardisation of earnings and valuation models as much as you can. Even though they are usually covered by the same analyst, a global player is different from a local one, a life insurer has little in common with a property and casualty player and a pure fund manager is very different from an integrated asset gatherer. You must also avoid thinking that all the peers in a sector will follow common trends and strategies and bear the same risks.”Mr Villani’s previous experience as an external auditor working on insurance companies helped him to understand sector-specific accounting rules and practices and also business risks. “In a tough environment, it is helpful for understanding where the companies I cover are going and what kind of figures they are reporting.”"
598;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-05-13T18:23:48Z;Intel looks beyond EU litigation;;Intel gave an annual briefing on its business to scores of analysts at its Silicon Valley headquarters this week, but a record fine from the European Union was never on the agenda.Hours before Wednesday’s decision in Brussels, Paul Otellini, chief executive, told a question-and-answer session that rumours of a fine were just that, and he would not discuss them.Instead, analysts were shown charts, including one showing Intel’s healthy cash balance of $10bn.“Solid cash, solid returns, enough to pay the dividends and to handle any kinds of issues we may have, even in tough times,” Mr Otellini said. The implication seemed to be that a fine of €1.06bn ($1.45bn) would not trouble the world’s biggest chipmaker and, whatever Europe decided, it would be business as usual.But this third regulatory decision against Intel may give it pause for thought. Its practices have been condemned in a judgment of more than 500 pages and with a fine that dwarfs the $25m levied by Korea’s Fair Trade Commission last year, as well as the penalty-free wrist slapping meted out by Japan’s FTC in 2005, over similar concerns to the EU’s.“I think Intel would be wise to seriously reconsider its conduct before these penalties begin to mount up,” said David Balto, former policy director of the US Federal Trade Commission, which, along with certain US states, is investigating similar allegations.“What this decision does is substantially raise the likelihood that you are going to see the FTC and the state attorneys-general bringing enforcement action challenging these anti-competitive practices.”On a conference call, Mr Otellini admitted that the investigations and legal action, which also include class action lawsuits consolidated in a civil case brought by its rival AMD in Delaware, had become both costly and time-consuming.“I haven’t found a low-priced lawyer yet that’s any good …and rather than our senior managers spending their time working on new products and out trying to win business, they are spending an awful lot of time in depositions and in courtrooms,” he said. “So to me, that’s counter-productive to the interests of our shareholders.”But there seems little indication Intel will try quickly to settle its disputes, in a move similar to rival Qualcomm. That chipmaker made peace in its major disputes with Nokia and Broadcom over the past year.Intel’s date in court with AMD is in 2010. Meanwhile, US regulatory inquiries rumble on. Intel has pledged to appeal against the EU decision, despite its grounds for doing so being weak, according to Mr Balto.“This case is much more straightforward than the [much-appealed] Microsoft case in Europe,” Mr Balto said. “It’s simply a form of strong-arm tactics to coerce manufacturers and retailers only to use Intel, so I don’t think its chances on appeal are very promising.”In Brussels, commission officials were at pains to stress that their objection was not to rebates offered by Intel – which tend to drive prices down – but to the conditions which Intel attached to them.In particular, officials claimed that, under Intel’s pricing policy, a computer manufacturer which took AMD processors for part of its needs could lose the rebate – or a large part of it – which Intel provided on the rest of its supply.However, the commission did not pursue one charge which it had outlined in its initial statement of objections – namely, that Intel engaged in below-cost pricing against AMD-based products to strategic customers.There was widespread debate in Brussels over what immediate impact the commission’s measures might have on the market, with many observers cautious about predicting any rapid changes.Intel itself sees no change. Mr Otellini said it would continue with its normal practice of offering discounts on volume purchases and had not engaged in the alleged rebates with strings attached.The company still holds about 80 per cent of the market and has taken a decisive lead over AMD in the technology that follows Moore’s Law – Gordon Moore, Intel’s co-founder, predicted accurately that the number of transistors on chips would double every few years. This means cheaper processors, a big price advantage over AMD, and lower cost or more powerful PCs for consumers.“There’s nothing in this ruling that reverses Moore’s Law,” said Mr Otellini.
599;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-04-30T11:21:57Z;Network order delays dent Ericsson;;Ericsson on Thursday admitted some telecoms operators were postponing orders for mobile network equipment because of the global recession, as its first-quarter earnings were hit by losses at its joint ventures that make handsets and microchips.ST-Ericsson, Ericsson’s partnership with STMicro­electronics that manufactures semiconductors, announced plans to axe 15 per cent of its workforce after reporting a maiden net loss of $89m.Ericsson’s earnings were also heavily dented by a pre-tax loss of SKr2.1bn ($262m) relating to Sony Ericsson, its joint venture with Sony that makes mobiles and is struggling partly because consumers are buying fewer phones in the downturn.Ericsson, the world’s leading mobile network equipment maker, recorded net income of SKr1.7bn for the three months to March 31, down 35 per cent on the same period last year. Revenue rose 12 per cent to SKr49.6bn in the first quarter, boosted by the weak Swedish krona.Ericsson’s shares closed down 8.03 per cent at SKr71 after analysts said the Swedish company was striking a more cautious tone about sales prospects with fixed-line and mobile operators.Carl-Henric Svanberg, Ericsson’s chief executive, denied any change of tone, and stressed the recession had so far had a limited impact on the mobile network market. But he added: “We have seen operators – in a few markets where local currencies have depreciated dramatically – postpone investments.”He pointed to Russia and Ukraine, where some mobile operators are cutting their capital spending sharply.Several European and US telecoms companies, such as France Telecom and AT&T, have announced plans to cut capital spending this year, although Chinese mobile operators are proceeding with large investments.Ericsson’s basic earnings per share were SKr0.54, down 35 per cent, and the company’s cash flow performance was weak.It recorded a cash outflow from operating activities of SKr2.9bn in the first quarter, partly because of a SKr1.5bn payment into its pension scheme.The company’s net cash position deteriorated from SKr34.7bn at December 31 to SKr22.9bn at March 31, partly because of a $1.1bn payment to establish ST-Ericsson.The ST-Ericsson joint venture was created in February in an effort to challenge Qualcomm’s position as the world’s leading supplier of microchips for handsets.It reported on Thursday revenue of $391m for the two months to March 28, its first period of trading, and an operating loss of $98m, because of reduced demand for semiconductors used in mobiles. ST-Ericsson outlined plans to cut 1,200 jobs, in a restructuring programme that will provide annual savings of $230m.“The job cuts are a reflection of the lower sales volumes we are seeing and the pressure on pricing,” said Alain Dutheil, chief executive of ST-Ericsson. “There is an urgent need to react with speed.”ST-Ericsson is aiming to break even in the second quarter of 2010. Although Mr Dutheil said he did not anticipate seeking further funding from Ericsson and ST Microelectronics, there are no limits on the cash call he could make on the parent companies if trading does not improve.Mr Svanberg did not rule out the possibility of Ericsson providing a capital injection to Sony Ericsson later this year, given the joint venture is burning up cash.

602;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-04-27T22:30:07Z;Qualcomm and Verizon;;"It is not enough to grab the golden goose, you also want to be holding on to it at the right end. Two companies released good results on Monday, both boosted by consumers using clever smartphones to browse the internet. But their prospects remain very different.Telecom operator Verizon reported first-quarter numbers that, while slightly better than anticipated, were a close copy of AT&T’s. Revenue growth has moderated, but margins improved on the year, thanks in part to data usage that was 56 per cent higher than a year ago. Verizon managed to find an additional 1.3m subscribers in the period as well. Yet the problem for the US wireless operators is that their market, where almost 90 per cent of people already own a phone, is very nearly saturated. Competition for ears will soon start to eat into profitability.Not so for chipmaker Qualcomm, sitting pretty at the other end of the supply chain. The group makes and designs chips for mobile phones, but the bulk of its revenues come from licensing technology – it takes a royalty every time a phone using the CDMA wireless network standard is shipped. As Qualcomm has no meaningful presence in the alternative GSM standard, its market is set to grow rapidly as operators around the world move from GSM (2G) to WCDMA (3G). So this year the group Qualcomm expects shipments of handsets employing its technology to rise about 18 per cent, to 565m, even though the overall handset market may shrink.Qualcomm’s second-quarter numbers were hit by the settlement of a long-running intellectual property dispute that requires it to pay Broadcom $891m over the next four years, pushing it into loss. And that settlement follows the successful resolution of a separate dispute with phone-maker Nokia last year. Its largest problem now is deciding what to do with all its eggs.Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, put an end to years of legal wrangling on Monday by settling a four-year patent dispute with rival Broadcom.With the Broadcom settlement, Qualcomm has resolved all of the major court battles it has fought in recent years, in order to preserve a mobile phone business model where more than 90 per cent of its licensing revenues comes from royalties earned on handsets.An agreement to pay Broadcom $891m over four years will lead to the dismissal of all court cases and Broadcom withdrawing its complaints about Qualcomm’s business practices to the US International Trade Commission, European Commission and Korean Fair Trade Commission.Nokia, after settling patent disputes with Qualcomm last year, had already withdrawn similar complaints to the authorities.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

603;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
604;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-04-27T18:08:26Z;Qualcomm settles four-year patent dispute;;Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, put an end to years of legal wrangling on Monday by settling a four-year patent dispute with rival Broadcom.With the Broadcom settlement, Qualcomm has resolved all of the major court battles it has fought in recent years, in order to preserve a mobile phone business model where more than 90 per cent of its licensing revenues comes from royalties earned on handsets.An agreement to pay Broadcom $891m over four years will lead to the dismissal of all court cases and Broadcom withdrawing its complaints about Qualcomm’s business practices to the US International Trade Commission, European Commission and Korean Fair Trade Commission.Nokia, after settling patent disputes with Qualcomm last year, had already withdrawn similar complaints to the authorities.“[The European Commission and Korean FTC] are not bound to stop any investigation. What we hope is that they will factor into their deliberations the fact that we have now settled with two of the primary complainants,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm general counsel, on an analyst conference call.“We’ve often said these are commercial disputes and they are best resolved between the parties.” The company has suffered substantial legal costs and the settlement with Broadcom reduced its second-quarter earnings per share, reported on Monday, by 43 cents.“In this particular settlement, the key goals were to maintain the business model, and we very much wanted to eliminate the distraction it was having on management, and also on the engineers that were focused on workarounds [to Broadcom patents],” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, told analysts.“Today’s settlement allows both companies to move on with their business and compete in the semiconductor sector as two of its innovation leaders,” said Scott McGregor, Broadcom chief executive.Qualcomm said it suffered a net loss of 18 cents a share or $289m in its second quarter, but raised its revenue forecasts for the full year as it expected rising demand in emerging markets, such as China, for its wireless chips. It raised revenue forecasts from $9.3bn-$9.8bn to $9.85bn-$10.25bn. It recorded a charge of $748m in the second quarter relating to the Broadcom settlement.For the second quarter Qualcomm reported revenues of $2.45bn, beating forecasts of $2.35bn. Its shares rose 6 per cent by midday in New York at $43.84.Analysts at UBS said a strong operating performance was largely driven by demand related to China’s 3G deployment and the stabilisation of handset makers’ inventories. Thomas Weisel Partners analysts said the settlement was positive for Broadcom, as it added to its credibility as a leading player in handsets, reduced legal uncertainties and shored its balance sheet.

606;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-04-22T23:44:05Z;Qualcomm and Broadcom close to settlement;;One of the technology industry’s most bitter legal disputes looked close to a resolution late on Wednesday after chip companies Qualcomm and Broadcom indicated that they were in late-stage settlement talks.The possibility of a resolution led Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, to put off the announcement of its latest quarterly earnings until the beginning of next week, prompting speculation that the outcome could have a significant impact on the numbers. However, the company said that its latest sales and earnings had met or exceeded its earlier forecasts.The signs that the four-year-old dispute was drawing to an end lifted both company’s shares in after-market trading on Wednesday, with Qualcomm rising 4 per cent and Broadcom up 6 per cent. They refused to give further details about the progress of the talks.A series of claims and counter-claims have flown between the rival chipmakers over the rights to intellectual property in mobile phone chips. Broadcom began the battle with series of attacks on Qualcomm, alleging patent infringement and breaches of anti-trust laws. The cases have been heard in Federal court in California and by the US International Trade Commission, which has the power to block imports of products that are found to fall foul of the country’s IP laws.In a sign of the scale of the case, Qualcomm had set aside $200m to cover the costs of contesting the Broadcom claims this year.Qualcomm has indicated in the past that a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies, allowing each to use the other’s broad range of technology, was likely to be one aspect of any settlement, since Broadcom needs access to some of Qualcomm’s intellectual property for its planned push into the mobile phone business.Qualcomm reached a similar agreement with Nokia last year, putting an end to a long-running dispute that had pitted the world’s biggest handset maker against the biggest producer of chips for mobile phones.
607;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-03-23T07:05:56Z;Zeebo takes aim at emerging markets;;A games console powered by mobile phone parts and aimed at emerging markets will be launched on Monday.The Zeebo console is being unveiled at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, targeting developers and publishers that would like to expand in new markets without fear of piracy.For consumers in Brazil, where it will be sold initially, Zeebo offers affordable and instant access to popular video games through downloads over a free, secure, 3G wireless connection.“Instead of the consumer having to take a bus and go to a favela [shanty town] to buy pirated software, they can sit on their couch, turn on the Zeebo console and buy directly from home,” said John Rizzo, Zeebo’s chief executive.His San Diego-based company is backed by Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips and supplier of the processor, graphics, software and 3G connection in the console.Qualcomm says it is moving beyond the phone, with its chips and software now capable of powering netbooks and new kinds of consumer electronics devices.“The Amazon Kindle is a good example – an electronic book reader where giving it wireless connectivity has added this magic sauce where people buy books and they just appear on the device,” said Mike Yuen, senior director of games and services at Qualcomm.The largest console makers – Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo – and major publishers have generally shunned emerging markets, with profits hard to come by because of rampant piracy and consumers having less disposable income.The latest consoles cost about $1,000 in Brazil on the grey market, while an older PlayStation 2 sells for $250 and needs a $50 modification to run pirated software. The Zeebo console will cost $200 with four pre-installed games and the company will sell further titles for about $12 each, slightly more than the $10 paid on average for illegal titles.The business model has already won backing from leading publishers including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. The latter is offering popular titles Need for Speed Carbon and FIFA 09, featuring a Portuguese voiceover, at launch.Zeebo plans to launch in Brazil in May, in Mexico in the third quarter, India and Russia in 2010 and China in 2011.“The barrier to entry has been income, not broadband – cell phones have penetrated all these markets,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.“This is a very substantial unexploited niche that could ultimately have 200m-300m addressable households, if not more.”

611;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Orange Q&A;;"Mobile operators today are offering businesses and consumers a rapidly expanding range of applications and data services – these days most commonly in the form of enhanced iPhone-inspired “app stores”. Olaf Swantee, the head of Orange’s mobile operations, wants to make sure his company is in the thick of this trend.At the 2009 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Orange announced upgrades to its own app store, as well as further collaborations with handset makers Nokia, Sony Ericsson and LG, to make those companies’ own application portals more Orange-friendly. The aim, says Mr Swantee, is to make 80 per cent of all the devices that Orange sells “go out with an Orange user interface”.In the handset market, as prices fall – Qualcomm, the company that makes chipsets and software that power many devices, says for example that we are close to what it calls the “$150 smartphone” – functionality that has always been the preserve of higher-spending prosumers and business users is brought down to the mid- and lower-tiered markets. Put this together with simple data plans, and a mobile internet revolution could well be in the making.Here are Mr Swantee’s views:IL: Everyone is talking about “app stores” on devices. Where is an operator like Orange fitting into this?OS: We sell 28m devices annually. What we are trying to do with these is to make sure that 80 per cent are going out with an Orange user interface to make using data easier. When we first met with Apple leadership, they were surprised when we first came in because we didn’t want to talk about the products we would resell; we could do that on the phone. What we wanted to discuss were the 12 applications that we had developed for the iPhone, including mobile TV and radio players. Orange has spent a lot on developing content and applications. We’re not just in the business of mobile telephony. We expect 16 per cent of our business to be in applications and services.IL: What other platforms are your R&D people working on besides Apple’s SDK?OS: Our engineers are telling me that Android [from Google] is good to develop on. We’re expecting to bring out an Android phone in the second half of this year.IL: What is the ultimate goal in mobile data for Orange?OS: We believe that to democratise the mobile internet, to get it from the niche to the masses, you still need to try to make it more seamless. What we find in our research is that a lot of customers from the long tail are reluctant to use the mobile internet still because they have to take a lot of steps to make it work. For example, if you try to find the address of our office on your PC, you don’t have an easy way of getting it from that PC to your cell phone to use the information. Our engineers are working very hard at providing a three-screen capability. Another example is television: in France we have developed a service where you can start watching a programme at home and finish watching it on the mobile.IL: When will be the tipping point for the mobile internet?OS: We believe this year we’ll see a big boost in mobile internet usage. You can see it in our financials. When you look at the markets and the amount of dongles we are selling it is absolutely incredible. In spite of the economic crisis we see 10-20 per cent of new customers every week asking for a data tariff with a mobile connecting device, whether it is a cell phone or a dongle. And the netbook [min-laptop] business has also been an incredible phenomenon: it’s a business that didn’t even exist a year ago.IL: Which customers give you the best margins right now?OS: We can’t answer that directly but what we can say is that mobile broadband customers that typically buy a notebook will sign a 24-month contract, so we are seeing long tenure on those customers. But we still have a lot of work to make sure we are bringing people to the right tariffs: we are trying to do a lot to fight “bill shock”, especially with customers downloading TV programs, filling up the network.IL: Do you think the trend is really towards flat rates for data for all, similar to fixed broadband?OS: I think we will go into much more segmented pricing. Mobile data right now is not a completely scalable model. When people use more data, we the operators incur enormous costs on backhaul. This is where regulators have not really looked at the details [when they get involved in setting tariffs]. Regulators think of data as an unlimited good. But the questions you should ask are around sustainability. We’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to size out how much energy we need, how to reduce energy consumption, what we can do in terms of network sharing.IL: As mobile broadband grows, and you see more take-up and better coverage, do you see prices coming down and reaching parity with fixed services?OS: It’s going to be a challenge with the upward cost curve for data usage. This is one of the reasons why we believe fixed and mobile will coexist. We’re trying to offload traffic on the mobile network over to fixed infrastructure whenever we can. We use UMA in France, which allows you as soon as you have your cellphone at home to go on to the fixed line. Of course prices will come down for mobile broadband, too: they came down at least 20-25 per cent in the last year.IL: A major issue with enterprise users and people that travel is mobile broadband roaming. It’s very expensive – around £10 per megabyte in some markets. What’s happening with that?OS: Data roaming will go down in pricing for sure. We are absolutely committed to bringing down prices further. We don’t really believe in one-size-fits-all tariffs; we believe in targeted packages. Over the last few months we’ve introduced a lot of specific packages that make data roaming more attractive, such as a daily tariff. With enterprise users, what we do within the Freemove alliance is that we provide specific solutions around data roaming. We look at the footprint of that customer: these are typically global contracts so we negotiate with the different partners in Freemove or sometimes we talk to bridge organisations and then build a package for specific customers to meet their needs."
612;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Nokia and Qualcomm to develop new 3G handsets;;Nokia, the leading mobile phone maker, and Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, signed a deal on Tuesday to develop a new range of advanced 3G handsets to launch next year in the North American market.The move highlights the improving relationship between the former courtroom rivals after years of bitter disputes over intellectual-property rights and royalty payments and could have significant benefits for both companies.In July Nokia and Qualcomm agreed to a 15-year settlement that included a E1.7bn one-time payment from Nokia, ending a three-year battle where the firms raised dozens of cases against each other on three continents.Nokia dominates the global market for smartphones, one of the few categories of handsets that are expected to continue to grow through the recession, but remains weak in the US market – something Nokia’s senior managers have acknowledged and said they are determined to fix.The agreement could provide Qualcomm with access to a major share of the smartphone market where it competes with rivals including Broadcom - which has supplied most of Nokia’s 2G chips - and enables Nokia to further lower production costs by using Qualcomm’s highly integrated chipsets for the first time. Nokia also announced on Tuesday that it had signed a deal with Broadcom to supply 3G chipsets.In a joint statement, Nokia and Qualcomm said the new devices would be based on Nokia’s S60 software and Qualcomm’s MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chips and “are expected to launch in mid-2010”. They will be compatible with the open source Symbian Foundation platform.“Nokia is very pleased to be in discussions with Qualcomm around designing mobile devices that can benefit from the high level of integration found on MSM chipsets,” said Kai Oistamo, executive vice-president of devices at Nokia. “We are eager to demonstrate to the industry the possibilities that exist when innovative and open software is combined with advanced hardware solutions.”Steve Mollenkopf, executive vice president of Qualcomm and president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, added: “Nokia and Qualcomm are leaders in advanced wireless technologies, and this new level of cooperation would bring exceptional leaps in mobile performance to people around the world. We are very excited about the possibility of the substantial synergies between S60 software and MSM chipsets.”

614;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-02-12T06:04:53Z;WiMax’s minimal presence;;"Expect the debate over the future of wireless internet connectivity to become a little more heated over the next few days.Next week is the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where announcements will emphasise the crossover and convergence in this area. Think 3G netbooks and wi-fi phones.In a preliminary bout, Qualcomm, the leading wireless chipmaker, announced its next-generation Gobi chip on Wednesday, while Intel, the biggest microprocessor maker, revealed forthcoming support from laptop makers for its WiMax chipsets.Consumers generally associate Wi-Fi with an out-of-sight embedded chip in their laptops, with 3G coming from one of those dongles plugged into a USB port – or, in my case, my Blackberry linked to my laptop with a USB lead to give me connectivity when Wi-Fi is out of reach.Increasingly though, 3G options are being embedded inside, creating something of a melee on the motherboard with Intel’s Wi-Fi and its next-generation mobile WiMax technology, which promises 3G-like wide-area coverage.Qualcomm says its second-generation Gobi module supports HSPA or CDMA 2000 EV-DO flavours of 3G, with increased data speeds and enhanced GPS functionality. Gobi2000 should feature in laptops launched in the second half.Sean Maloney, Intel executive vice president, told a teleconference that Acer, Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung and Toshiba were delivering laptops now or in the next few weeks that featured integrated Intel WiMax chips. He expected 100 models to be available by the end of the year.Intel’s problem is that users may find Gobi-like 3G solutions far more useful than WiMax, given the widespread coverage of 3G and the limited availability of WiMax, particularly in the US.Mr Maloney reeled off a long list of countries where WiMax was beginning to take root, but could refer only to Clearwire and its Clear service in Portland, Oregon for a US example.Clearwire has been having problems and last month Intel wrote down by $1bn the value of its investment in the company. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Clearwire may have to delay its network expansion if its fails to close a $2bn funding gap.Mr Maloney was noncommittal when asked whether Intel would have to step in with more funding to achieve a national network in the US.“They’ve got enough money to keep going for quite a while and build out a lot of the network,” he said.
“If you look at the historical build levels of 3G, the current build-out rate for Clearwire is pretty fast. We can come back to whether it needs to be faster or not at some point in the next year or so.”"
615;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-02-03T22:16:14Z;Motorola scraps dividend after $3.6bn loss;;Motorola on Tuesday gave its clearest signal yet that it sees its future in the global phone market as a supplier of mid-priced models and smartphones after its mobile handset division suffered another dismal quarter.Sanja Jha, co-chief executive who is in charge of the mobile phone business, said Motorola would continue to offer a full range of handsets, but he said the company would “de-prioritise” sales of mass market mobile phones costing $50 or less.His comments came as Motorola suspended its quarterly dividend and announced the departure of its chief financial officer after announcing a $3.58bn fourth-quarter loss. Shares in the group, which also forecast a larger-than-expected loss for the current quarter, fell 12 per cent to $4.01 on Tuesday.The struggling US mobile phone maker said last month it would cut about 4,000 jobs, with more than three-fourths of the reductions coming from the mobile devices unit.Motorola shipped about 19.2m handsets in the fourth quarter, less than half the 40.9m the year-ago period and its market share slipped to about 6.5 per cent, ranking it the fifth largest global mobile phone maker.Less than three years ago Motorola was the second largest mobile phone maker behind Finland’s Nokia with more than 23 per cent of the global market. Since then, however, the company has been unable to match the success of its Razr handset.Mr Jha, who joined Motorola from Qualcomm six months ago, said Motorola would focus on expanding the data capabilities of mid-tier handsets costing between $100 and $200, and on the market for high-end smartphones.The smartphone market, currently dominated by Nokia, has attracted a raft of new entrants including Apple with the iPhone, HTC with the Google Android powered G1, and Sony Ericsson with the ExperiaAnalysts said that Motorola has had only limited success in the smartphone market to date and that its planned new devices based on the still relatively unproven Android operating system are not due to appear until much later this year. Motorola has about 2.2 per cent of the smartphone market.Mr Brown said the dividend suspension would save $350m this year.He said the decision to replace Paul Liska after less than a year as chief financial officer reflected the changed market environment and the decision to pospone the planned spin-off of the mobile phone unit.The company named Edward Fitzpatrick, senior vice-president and corporate controller, as acting chief financial officer, while the company searches for a replacement for Mr Liska.Motorola forecast a loss of between 10-12 cents a share in the first quarter, excluding some costs, mainly reflecting the weakness in the global handset business and Motorola’s shrinking market share.The fourth-quarter net loss was equivalent to $1.57 per share, compared with a profit of $100m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Nearly all of the loss – $1.56 a share – stemmed from one-off costs. Excluding charges for items such as goodwill amortisation, Motorola’s loss would have been 1 cent per share, in line with forecasts.Fourth-quarter sales fell by 26 per cent to $7.1bn as the declining mobile phone sales offset relative strength in the home and networks mobility division.

617;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-01-29T00:24:46Z;US chip group bearish on 3G take-up;;Take-up of 3G mobile phones will be held back more than expected this year by the downturn, according to Qualcomm, the US chip company whose technology is central to 3G.With handset makers slashing purchases of chips in the short term and expected to carry lower inventory levels for the rest of the year, Qualcomm warned on Wednesday that as a result, its own revenues in 2009 would drop 12-16 per cent while operating profits would fall 24-30 per cent.The comments, which wiped 5 per cent from the company’s shares in after-market trading, came in spite of signs from its latest quarterly earnings that it had weathered the early part of the downturn better than expected.However, the figures were also dented by $388m of losses from investments as a result of the financial crisis, pushing the company’s net income down 56 per cent from the year before.Qualcomm, which either makes or licenses the technology for all the chips in 3G handsets, has become a bellwether for the health of the growing high-speed mobile market, pushing its stock market value above that of Nokia.on Wednesday, it said that sales of 3G handsets this year were likely to grow by about 20 per cent to 565m as older 2G phones were replaced.That was below the 600m it had forecast earlier.Wall Street had been expecting Qualcomm to issue a downbeat outlook, particularly for the early months of this year as a result of the sharp inventory correction but its caution about conditions later in the year came as a surprise.The outlook reflected a belief that handset makers would continue to keep unusually low inventory levels on hand and fewer phone users would opt to replace their existing handsets, executives said.They blamed the weaker outlook on lower average selling prices, as China came to account for a bigger share of the overall business.For the latest quarter, Qualcomm said revenues had risen 3 per cent to $2.52bn. Pro forma operating income climbed 4 per cent to $986m as the company reduced operating costs more than expected.After the $388m loss on investments, net income fell to $341m, or 20 cents a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of 47 cents a share.Qualcomm is still carrying $1.1bn of unrealised losses in its investment portfolio, although Paul Jacob, chief executive, said it planned to continue to hold those securities and believed it would not need to recognise the losses.
618;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-01-27T22:45:48Z;Impresario of the lavish lifestyle;;Those attending the recent opening of Sam Nazarian’s SLS Hotel at Beverly Hills must have wondered if the US really was experiencing its worst recession in decades.A starry crowd in tuxedos and ball gowns drank a seemingly limitless flow of champagne and feasted on tapas delicacies prepared by José Andrés, an acclaim­ed Spanish chef. Guests mingled with models, Hollywood stars and political figures such as Antonio Villaraigosa, the Los Angeles mayor.But then Mr Nazarian knows how to throw a good party, having turned his talent for creating cool venues into a fast-growing empire that includes restaurants, a film production unit, an event-planning company, bars and clubs.There is a strong entrepreneurial streak in the Nazarian family. Fleeing the revolution in Iran, his parents came to Los Angeles when he was a child. “They came here with four suitcases and four kids,” he says. “My dad invested in a company that merged with Qualcomm, which was a very small company at the time.”The investment paid off handsomely and the family became very rich. As a young man, Mr Nazarian started his own telecoms business and invested in real estate before forming SBE, which stands for Sammy Boy Entertainment. His wealth has afforded him a lavish Hollywood lifestyle: he lives in the Hollywood Hills but his previous house belonged to Jennifer Lopez. He paid $12.5m for it, lived it in for a while and then sold it to pop star Gwen Stefani.He is a regular face on television, appearing in the MTV reality programme The Hills – his SBE group employs Heidi Montag, one of the show’s glamorous stars – and is also redeveloping the Sahara casino, a faded Las Vegas property that was popular with Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack.But SLS is his most ambitious project to date and one that signals a new direction for an entrepreneur who until now has been best known for glamour-soaked nightspots so trendy that getting in to them is practically impossible.His office is a shrine to high-tech design: one wall is covered in flat-screen TVs while the automatic sliding doors to his sanctum glide silently in and out of the wall like those on Star Trek’s Starship Enterprise. “Madonna’s company used to have this building,” he shrugs.He does admit that recession makes this a difficult time to open a luxury hotel. The global economy is in the doldrums and business travel is in steep decline. “Every day there seems to be more bad news,” he sighs. Nevertheless, he says there is un­tapped demand in Los Angeles for upscale hospitality venues and insists that SLS is a “long-term play”.“In a macro sense, it’s not the best time [to open a hotel]. But West Hollywood and Beverly Hills are the most under-served hotel markets in the country,” he says. SBE owns the hotel but it will be managed by Starwood, which owns brands such as the W and St Regis.There will be an emphasis on good service, he says, adding that he has drawn inspiration from Ian Schrager, who pioneered the boutique hotel concept, and André Balazs, owner of the Chateau Marmont and Standard hotels in Los Angeles.Mr Nazarian has also given international designer Philippe Starck free rein over the SLS property. SBE has a 15-year deal with Mr Starck, which has already yielded Katsuya, a high-end Japanese restaurant brand that has expanded from its first site in Brentwood into other southern California locations.Before launching SLS and taking on the Sahara casino redevelopment, Mr Nazarian was known as a nightlife impresario. His bars and clubs helped rejuvenate parts of Los Angeles that had grown stale. He explains that he persisted where red tape had discouraged other entrepreneurs from trying to operate new properties. “When I started SBE [in 2002] I acquired the most valuable liquor licences and leaseholds in town. Los Angeles is difficult in that respect – it is almost impossible to open new places in areas like the Sunset Strip or the Hollywood Hills.”The city’s nightspots had lacked the distinction of their counterparts in New York, he says. “No one was really looking at the hospitality business [in Los Angeles] in an institutional way. No one wanted to be a high-end food and beverage provider in the city.”His Area club and venues such as Hyde and Foxtail attracted Hollywood types like Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan and lured eager bar-goers back to the heart of the city. “For two years, Hyde was the hardest bar to get into in the country. For LA that’s unheard of…that usually only happens in New York or Miami.”Mr Nazarian is more than just a trendy bar owner with a nice eye for design. Pictures on the wall show him with Hillary Clinton and Bill Bratton, the Los Angeles police department chief who pioneered zero-tolerance policing in New York. When the Clinton and Obama presidential campaigns rolled into Los Angeles, SBE venues hosted fundraisers for both candidates on the same night.SBE has also turned the cachet of its properties into cash. Excluding its hotels, the stand-alone bars and restaurants are projected to generate $70m (€53m, £49m) in revenues in 2009 (Mr Nazarian declines to give revenue figures for the hotels or the other parts of the group).SBE has also diversified into entertainment: Element Films, a division of the company, has produced a string of movies, including Down in the Valley, starring Edward Norton, and Mr Brooks, with Kevin Costner. It has a $220m loan facility to cover print and advertising costs as well as a nine-film distribution deal with Lionsgate Entertainment, the studio behind Mad Men and the Saw horror franchise.While he thinks about expanding SBE in other parts of the US – it is due to open a Starck-designed Ritz Plaza in South Beach, Florida in 2010 and is busy in Las Vegas with the Sahara – he remains committed to his home town. “We have used Los Angeles as the backdrop for launching all of our brands,” he says. “It is the perfect place for a lot of stuff that I do.”
619;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-01-26T11:58:24Z;Valley view: Real-time web comes of age;;They called it “The Moment” and the US’s transition of power was a significant one for the web too, as the clock tripped over to 12:01pm Eastern Standard Time last Tuesday.It was then that the mantle passed to Barack Obama as the 44th president and then also that whitehouse.gov switched over to the new administration and a blog post and news items time-stamped 12:01pm were instantly published.“Change has come to America”, said the front page, and “Change has come to whitehouse.gov” was the title of the first post, placed front and centre.No more dated press releases, was the message. From now on, the emphasis was going to be on up-to-the-minute blogging, RSS feeds and e-mail updates from a constantly in-contact administration, wrote the president’s director of new media.At around the same time, usage of the microblogging service Twitter spiked, as the number of tweets, or short messages sent by users, increased to four times their normal levels, the service reported.As Barack Obama took the oath of office, cellphones and digital cameras of spectators on the Mall and Capitol Hill clicked to capture the moment.Many people instantly uploaded their photos to CNN and, in partnership with Microsoft, the shots were stitched together with its Photosynth software to create a 3D panorama of that moment in time.Back in San Francisco, I was able to watch events on my iPod Touch MP3 player, using a Ustream app just released that day, which fed me a live stream of CNN’s coverage over the Touch’s Wi-Fi connection.CNN had also linked up with Facebook to put its live pictures on a web page next to a window where Facebook friends could chat with one another about what they were witnessing.CurrentTV combined its live pictures with tweets to provide a colourful running commentary and reaction from users around the world, with a different viewpoint scrolling up every few seconds.What all this signified and sealed was the advent of the real-time web, a phrase coined to describe the growing instantaneity of web interactions.It may seem like nothing new. Web technologies, best known as Ajax, have been around for several years, bringing live changes to web pages. We are familiar with scrolling headlines from news agencies, videprinter-style sports scores and financial tickers and share prices that update before our eyes.What the real-time web refers to is the extension of this capability to social media in the form of live comment and conversation and the ability for individuals to broadcast in text, pictures and video.We have had a series of “moments” in recent months, where observers have pointed to the aggregated effects – Twitter provided eye-witness accounts of forest fires in California and the violence in Mumbai. There were the instant alerts and massive tweeting of concern about the health of Steve Jobs this month.Many people now get their first notice of breaking news from services such as Twitter and Friendfeed, as their users are often on the scene quicker than news agencies.The US Airways flight crashing into the Hudson River this month demonstrated how both new hardware and software are enabling this revolution.An eyewitness took a picture on his iPhone of the passengers evacuating on to the wings and uploaded it to Twitpic, a service that feeds photos with messages directly into Twitter. The service and the user scooped the world’s traditional media.New web plumbing is increasing update speeds. As well as XMPP, first developed for instant messaging, there is Friendfeed’s Simple Update Protocol and the Gnip service, all working to remove the delays in the broadcast of information by users.There is still work to do on filtering and shaping the information, eliminating duplication and providing some kind of alert status, but that will come.At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month, I found lots of support developing on the hardware side.The iPhone and Touch are leading the way, but Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, talked about the company’s Snapdragon processor.This is enabling a new generation of netbooks that are always-on, in the sense that they are able to operate at low power levels like a cell phone and be constantly receiving information – from incoming e-mails to information delivered over the web.Digital picture frames and bedside alarm clocks from companies such as Chumby, with high-powered but low-cost application and media processors from Marvell and Samsung, were pumping out news, weather and other information through small “widget” applications.Yahoo and Intel showed me their creation of a carousel of widgets that will appear on the screens of networked Samsung televisions by the spring.That will show services such as Twitter as an on-screen overlay, on top of the programmes of traditional broadcast news.It is to be hoped that they will complement each other, but we will also get our first opportunity to compare directly, and find out which is offering the more real-time service.

621;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-01-11T21:58:38Z;TV on the radio spectrum widens;;@CES, Las Vegas -The Digital TV Transition in the US on February 19 will not only produce sharper pictures in the living room but will also boost TV on mobile phones.Qualcomm, which offers its MediaFLO TV service over cell phones, said this week that the turning off of the analogue TV signals would free up spectrum and allow an expansion of its network.It said it would make FLO TV available to more than 200m consumers across 100 markets.Operators offering the service – Verizon and AT&T – have been cagey to date about how many subscribers are using a service that costs around $15 a month, suggesting take-up has been slow.But Qualcomm expects that to change once the service goes nationwide and full-scale marketing begins.The introduction of the service into cars should also help. Audiovox announced at the Consumer Electronics Show that it would put MediaFLO on in-car screens later this year. That will compete with the satellite-based service AT&T CruiseCast, which was also featured at CES.Qualcomm also will be in competition in-car and on cell phones and other mobile devices with the Open Mobile Video Coalition. Broadcasters announced at CES that they would be offering mobile TV channels using their over-the-air digital signals. They plan a launch across 22 markets, covering 35 per cent of US TV households, later this year.We spoke to Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, at CES about his hopes for mobile TV in the US and globally. Edited highlights below:Paul Jacobs: The big thing for us is we have the digital TV transition coming in February and we’ve built out markets already in anticipation of being able to turn on where we haven’t been able to because of interference from existing analogue TV stations, so we’re looking forward to that. It will take us a little while after the transition, to get the FCC certification to turn the transmitters on, but very shortly thereafter, we will be able to turn on all these other markets.For me, the traction has not been as good as perhaps I wanted it for MediaFLO but it’s still been good, the attach rates have been pretty good and especially given that we have not had any marketing out there. The [take-up] has not been that bad, it’s just not as big as we had hoped.I can’t tell you the number of times people have said to me when I’ve showed it them: “That’s great, when is that going to be commercially available?” Because we didn’t have a nationwide network, nationwide operators that are running and selling the service – AT&T and Verizon – don’t want to go out and do nationwide advertising, so I think, with the DTV transition, we’ll see more marketing and that’ll really solve the issue. Today we are in 65 markets, we will be in the top 100- I think we said 107 – by the end of the year.Has the EU endorsement of the DVB-H standard affected your plans to compete in Europe at all?Not really, it wasn’t a binding thing. That pressure seems to have diminished reasonably significantly, and the DVB-H guys are not doing that well. There’s a threshold you need to get over in terms of channel-switching time and I don’t think they got there. We really tried to focus on that when we developed MediaFLO and keep it under two- seconds channel-switching time, even then you get a little frustrated. So when you’re talking five or 6 seconds it’s not acceptable. And I think the economics were harder for them, it was originally conceived as piggybacking on top of the existing terrestrial broadcasters, but we found this out pretty early on that if you rollout on exactly the same towers as the broadcaster uses, it doesn’t work that well, you need something like three towers instead of one to get a good signal.How do you think it’s going to pan out in terms of standards and geographies on a global basis? What we are going to end up doing is build a chip that has all the different standards, we believe we have a technical benefit, but a lot of it is political, so if somebody’s going to choose a different standard then it’s okay. We would just provide the chip and it will work for people to build in any fashion, and I think that’s the right strategy for us.
622;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2009-01-11T19:54:45Z;Rival lays challenge to Intel over netbooks;Qualcomm plans to challenge for dominance in the fast-growing market for mini laptops and expects a wave ofmany companies to use its chips in devices;Qualcomm plans to challenge Intel for dominance in the fast-growing market for mini laptop computers, or netbooks, and expects many companies to use its chips in devices this year.Intel’s Atom chips power most netbooks, but Paul Jacobs, chief executive of the leading US mobile phone chip maker, expects Qualcomm’s Snapdragon to break that trend this year.However, Mr Jacobs said he also expected Intel, the leading US computer chip maker, to attempt a push into the market for smartphones at the same time – highlighting a blurring of the lines between electronic devices and the rivalry between the two groups.“Intel is trying to figure out how to get into the smartphone space, they call them ‘mids’ [mobile internet devices], trying to change the name,” he said.“In the computing space, I think there’s going to be a competition between Snapdragon-based netbooks and the [Intel] Atom-based netbooks,” Mr Jacobs told the Financial Times at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which ended on Sunday.Mr Jacobs said at least 15 companies would launch “always connected” Snapdragon-powered netbooks in the first half and he believes that they will have a significant advantage over their Intel-based counterparts.“The interesting thing is that with Snapdragon all of the communications technology is integrated …it is more like a Blackberry that is always on,” Mr Jacobs said.“My e-mail is always being downloaded to it, it’s not like I have to open up my laptop to go online. It’s totally different. It’s more real time. I am positive that it is a more attractive model.”He added that Atom-based products were relatively hungry for power when used for communications.Mr Jacobs said Snap­dragon-powered devices would run a Linux open-source operating system rather than Microsoft Windows XP, which powers most Intel-based netbooks.He acknowledged, howver, that Qualcomm and its partners would have to ensure that Snapdragon/Linux-based netbooks were easy to use.“We are spending a lot of effort making sure that the Linux experience is a very good one,” he said. “The race is whether we can build software that is compelling to the consumer before the Intel camp finds a way to reduce its power consumption.“We are putting a lot of effort into making sure that all the pieces of software will be there that people expect and that the user interface is good.”Mr Jacobs added: “The next two years are going to be really interesting in mobile computing because you’re going to see these highly connected netbooks at very low price points – particularly if they come through an operator channel and they are subsidised.”Meanwhile, Mr Jacobs also expressed confidence that Qualcomm’s Kayak initiative would help boost internet access in emerging ­markets.“Kayak is basically a cell phone in a box and instead of driving an LCD screen like on a phone, it’s got a thing that can drive either a TV or a computer monitor,” he explained.“It is interesting for emerging markets because they don’t have any kind of wireline connectivity to the internet …governments are interested in promoting it to bridge the digital divide.”www.ft.com/ces

The company, which makes most of the microprocessors for PCs, said it expected sales in the final three months of last year to drop by 20 per cent, signalling the most brutal downturn since the tech bust at the start of the decade, when the market was far smaller than it is now.To some extent, the dire headlines from the PC world this week reflect shifting
fortunes that were under way but which have been intensified by the economic downturn.Dell, which said it would cut 1,900 jobs in Ireland as it closes a plant there to consolidate manufacturing in Poland, has been losing ground to Hewlett-Packard, the new market leader.Lenovo, which plans to axe 2,500 jobs, has been overtaken by Acer and has fallen to number four in the rankings of world PC makers.But, while falling competitiveness has intensified the pain at certain companies, there is no denying the broader slump.Even the tech world’s most profitable company is looking at ways to cut costs in the face of the downturn. Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, dismissed speculation that Microsoft was bout to make big job cuts as “irresponsibly wild”, but added that the company was looking to scale back some of its investments in the short term.In this market, it is no wonder that the technology industry has turned its attention with renewed interest to the next big trends in personal computing: smartphones and “netbooks”, small, low-cost laptops that emerged as a hot category last year.Both should sell relatively well during the coming hard times, partly because they represent new and more portable forms of computing, and partly because of their low prices. Netbooks are relatively affordable because they lack the resources of more powerful machines, while smartphones are subsidised by mobile phone operators, which expect to turn a profit from monthly charges.Most tech companies are expecting smartphone sales to rise this year – even as overall mobile handset sales tumble – as a range of new touch-screen devices follow in the tracks of Apple’s ground-breaking iPhone.“People are still buying smartphones. That trend seems to keep going on,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm, in an interview at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.“Smartphones are an exploding piece of the overall phone market and that’s going to continue,” Mr Ballmer said.Smartphones accounted for 10 to 12 per cent of the 1.2bn or so phones sold last year, but will rise to 60 per cent of the global market by 2015, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a tech consulting firm.Sales of netbooks, meanwhile, will jump by 90 per cent this year, according to the Consumer Electronics Association.These new personal computing markets, though in their early stages, have brought some new companies to the fore – such as Asustek, the Taiwanese company that has been a pioneer in netbooks, and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry.Now, though, the traditional heavyweights of the computing world have their sights squarely set on these rare pockets of growth. Smartphones have become a crowded market, while most of the participants in the PC industry are rapidly adapting their products to suit the needs of netbooks.The result, for tech companies, is likely to be a period of fierce competition, and for consumers, more innovation and lower prices."

625;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-11-16T22:52:04Z;Qualcomm backs LTE technology;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, is giving “full support” to a new network technology called long-term evolution (LTE) and has abandoned efforts to promote its own alternative - Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) - among network operators.The decision, part of a cost-cutting exercise at Qualcomm that includes a recruitment freeze, underscores the success of LTE’s backers in establishing the technology as a global fourth-generation standard.LTE, which will enable much faster mobile data and internet connections than current 3G technologies, was at one stage pitted against both Qualcomm’s ultra-mobile broadband and WiMax, backed by Intel, Motorola and others.In the past year LTE has won the backing of the GSM Association and most of the world’s largest mobile network operators, including Vodafone, Verizon Wireless, AT&T and China Mobile.Len Lauer, Qualcomm’s chief operating officer, said the company would throw its weight and resources behind LTE. The company’s ultra-mobile broadband development team would be rolled into the LTE research group, he added.Qualcomm spends approximately 20 per cent of its revenues on research and development.“We took a look at the adoption for LTE and, since we’re are an enabler of technology, we don’t try to pick winners or losers,” Mr Lauer said.Qualcomm had a strong intellectual property position in LTE, he said, which had been helped by its acquisition a few years ago of Flarion, a wireless broadband pioneer, and a patent settlement with Finland’s Nokia.Mr Lauer, who joined Qualcomm from Sprint Nextel two years ago, said the decision to cut costs, announced last week, reflected changes in the market as manufacturers braced themselves for a slowdown in demand, particularly in developed countries with high handset penetration rates.Mobile phone makers were cutting chip inventory levels to about 14 weeks from just less than 20 weeks in September, he said. But he expressed confidence that demand would pick up again in the second half of 2009.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, told an annual analysts’ meeting in New York last week that Qualcomm had no plans to undertake “a large lay-off across the company”.
626;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-11-14T22:09:27Z;Wall Street ends a wild week lower;;Another highly volatile session on Friday that rounded off a wild week ended sharply in the red as investors took fright at the latest round of bleak economic data.The market remained downtrodden for much of the session after retail sales figures showed a worse-than-expected 2.8 per cent drop last month, the latest dramatic sign of a collapse in consumer spending.Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets said the figures were “even more dire than expected. Let’s not dance about this, the data is awful.”Still, the market crept higher during a false afternoon rally as traders snapped up battered stocks in energy and financial services.That gave way to a sell-off into the close, which some observers said did not augur well for the market as traders did not want to hold on to stock over the weekend.The benchmark S&P 500 index found positive territory less than an hour before the close – only to finish down 4.2 per cent at 873.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.8 per cent at 8,497.31 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 5 per cent at 1,516.85.JC Penney and Nordstrom, the department store chains, were among several retail losers and were down 10.4 per cent to $17.27 and 9.4 per cent to $11.74 respectively after the pair cut earnings forecasts.Meanwhile, technology and telecoms came under further pressure. Sun Microsystems escaped the falls, up 1 per cent to $4.12, after the computer server group unveiled plans to cut up to 6,000 jobs. Traders took kindly to the move as it could save the company as much as $800m a year, but feared that it was a symptom of broader malaise across the sector.Qualcomm lost 5.4 per cent to $32.94 after Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, warned of lower sales due to “a sharp pullback” in consumer spending. They were the latest glum developments in the sectors this week, which included a surprise warning from chipmaker Intel.Friday’s declines took the weekly loss for the S&P to 6.2 per cent, for the Dow to 4.5 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 7.9 per cent.Hopes were raised early in the week that China’s $600bn economic stimulus package could help hard-hit material and construction stocks. Yet the relief was short-lived.Three straight days of falls pushed the market below the five-year intraday low hit last month but stocks subsequently bounced in a spectacular rally late on Thursday in the hope the market had set a new bottom. But the gains were short-lived.Financials were the worst-performing sector, off 11.8 per cent overall for the week after the US Treasury reversed course on its plan to mop up toxic mortgage assets. Citigroup hit a 12-year low, down 19.5 per cent for the week at $9.52, and reports on Friday said the bank was to cut at least 10,000 jobs.American Express and CIT Group shed 21 per cent to $19.99 and 15.2 per cent to $4.14 respectively after the pair sought approval to become a bank holding company as well as funding under the government’s recapitalisation programme.As fears over the health of the financial sector heightened, a series of grim developments elsewhere highlighted the bleak prospects facing corporate America in what is expected to be a severe downturn.Technology and retail came under severe pressure on fears that both are particularly vulnerable in a protracted downturn.Best Buy sent a chill through both sectors when the electronics chain warned of a “seismic” slowdown in consumer spending when it slashed annual profit forecasts.The downbeat outlook disappointed traders who had hoped the chain could benefit after smaller rival Circuit City filed for bankruptcy, and its shares shed 13.8 per cent over the week to $22.06.General Motors and Ford lost 31 per cent to $3.01 and 10.9 per cent to $1.80 despite hopes that Washington may save the industry from the brink of collapse. The fall came after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero on GM.
627;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-11-14T19:12:44Z;Nokia;;"Nokia’s warning that global handset sales are likely to fall for the second time ever next year should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following developments further up the mobile phone supply chain.Last week, Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of microchips used in mobile phones, warned that the handset makers were tightening their belts as it cut its sales forecast for the full year. Applied Materials, a maker of semiconductor equipment, has announced job cuts and a fall in orders. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker and a technology industry bellwether, also weighed in with grim news, warning of a slowdown across all geographies and market segments.Nokia’s shares, nevertheless, managed to shed more than 11 per cent of their value in the hour or so after its announcement. They later bounced back to end the day down 4 per cent, capping a slide of 61 per cent since January. Nokia has issued profit warnings in two successive quarters. News that business customers’ purchasing power had been hit by limited access to credit was hardly reassuring. Yet in spite of its problems, which include aggressive price cuts by rivals, Nokia’s scale and broad portfolio of phones make it perhaps among the best-positioned of the big handset makers to weather the storm.Nokia declined to provide a number, but analyst forecasts for the decline in global handset shipments range between 4 and 27 per cent next year. The more optimistic end of that spectrum would match the 4 per cent sales drop during the industry’s first downturn in 2001. High rates of ownership and a trend of customers holding on to their old handsets longer mean the industry faced a tougher sales environment even before the recession took hold. The sales forecast was an unwelcome development. But it would be hard for investors to argue they were not sufficiently warned.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

628;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Intel shocks Wall Street with revenue warning;Rapid decline in demand hits chipmaker;Intel on Wednesday shocked Wall Street with a revenue and margins warning that indicated a rapid decline in the business of the world’s largest chipmaker over the past month.Intel, a bellwether for the technology industry, reported that sales were being “affected by significantly weaker than expected demand in all geographies and market segments”.“In addition, the PC supply chain is aggressively reducing component inventories,” it said.The warning came less than a month after Intel issued forecasts for the fourth quarter on its third-quarter earnings call, and amounted to a 14 per cent cut in revenue expectations since the time of that call.Intel said it now expected revenues of $9bn, plus or minus $300m, down from $10.1bn–$10.9bn. Gross margins were now expected to be about 55 per cent compared with 59 per cent previously.In another sign of the rapid deterioration of the business climate, Intel said its warning replaced a planned mid-quarter update scheduled for December 4.It announced last month that it was bringing back a mid-quarter update after a three-year absence, because of the level of economic uncertainty.Intel’s shares fell 6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Wednesday to $12.71.Roger Kay, semiconductor analyst with Endpoint Technologies, said PC makers such as Dell were cutting back on orders from manufacturers in Asia and reducing their inventories of chips and other components to conserve cash.“I think frankly the worst is yet to come – despite the throttling back by the participants in the supply chain, it won’t be enough, and there will be inventory overhang in Q1 and the first quarter will be worse,” he said.“We went through this before in 2000 when we mis-predicted the depth of the recession and 2000 was much milder than this.”Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of wireless chips for mobile phones, last week cut its estimates significantly for the remainder of the year as it noted its customers were tightening their belts. It reported a very sharp decline in inventories over the previous fortnight as customers tried to preserve their working capital.Applied Materials, the biggest supplier of chip-making equipment, said yesterday it was cutting 1,800 jobs or 12 per cent of its workforce in order to cut costs in the face of a slump in orders.
629;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-11-06T21:50:04Z;US stocks plummet on grim economic outlook;;Fresh signs of the serious difficulties facing corporate America pushed Wall Street stocks sharply lower for a second straight session.A host of big names neared or surpassed yearly lows in a heavy sell-off that took in all sectors and extended the losses endured in the market’s worst ever post-election day drop.“This time next year, Obama euphoria will be crushed under the weight of the unfolding economic and market meltdown,” warned Albert Edwards, analyst at Société Générale. “The crushing weight of the ‘Great Debt Unwind’ has only just begun.”The future of carmakers General Motors and Ford topped a long list of traders’ concerns. The pair fell 13.7 per cent to $4.80 and 5.3 per cent to $1.98 after Toyota warned that operating profits would fall to a 13-year low.Along with privately-held Chrysler, they were expected to meet with Nancy Pelosi, House of Representatives speaker, and push for a fresh aid package in addition to $25bn in loans from the Bush administration.The S&P 500 closed down 5 per cent at 904.88 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.9 per cent at 8,695.79. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 4.3 per cent to 1,608.70.A fresh round of interest rate cuts overseas had earlier trimmed losses in the futures market, but the relief was brief and did little to calm jitters upon the open. Investors digested the International Monetary Fund’s stark warning that the developed world faced its first annual fall in growth since the second world war.They were further unsettled by business productivity data and weak jobless claims figures, which failed to inspire confidence ahead of a closely watched payrolls report due for release on Friday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up 16.6 per cent to 63.64, indicating heightened signs of distress.The media sector came under pressure from News Corp’s downbeat outlook, which prompted JPMorgan to downgrade its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.“We have little confidence that the company will be able to cut costs fast enough to offset newspaper ad revenue declines,” the bank said, and also cited concerns over TV income.Rupert Murdoch’s group sank 16.3 per cent to $8.31 while Walt Disney, also exposed to the advertising market, shed 5.9 per cent to $22.81 ahead of results due after the market close.In technology, Cisco fell 2.6 per cent to $16.94 after the network router and switches maker warned of a slump of up to 10 per cent in its current quarter revenue. The glum outlook heightened fears that the technology sector would be hit by corporations scaling back IT spending. Savita Subramanian, quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said stocks were tending to “travel more tightly in industry groups as news typically affects the entire sector”.Qualcomm fell 6 per cent to $33.05 ahead of results due from the chipmaker after the market close.Yahoo edged 0.3 per cent higher to $13.96 and was one of the few in the sector to find positive territory after Jerry Yang, chief executive, rekindled the prospect of a deal with Microsoft, which fell 5.4 per cent to $20.88.The energy sector suffered some of the heaviest declines, down 6.1 per cent overall as crude oil settled near $60 a barrel.Meanwhile, the worst monthly retail sales data so far this decade rekindled fears over US consumer spending and highlighted the worsening prospects for chain stores over the vital holiday season.Consumer staples was nevertheless the best performing sector, down 2.5 per cent among even heavier losses elsewhere and helped as Wal-Mart bucked the gloomy trend. Higher in the morning session on the back of a better-than-expected 2.4 per cent rise in same-store sales for October, the world’s largest retailer later fell back with the wider market and finished down 1.2 per cent to $53.49.Regarded as a defensive stock, Wal-Mart was still one of the strongest performers on the Dow and its performance contrasted with discount peer Target, whose shares fell 6 per cent to $35.47 following a worse-than-expected sales slowdown.

I am no big fan of iTunes – it sells copyright-constrained music in its own particular format and I find Amazon’s DRM-free MP3 service preferable at the same price – but the new App Store within it has opened up a world of thousands of applications, many of them free.This has turned the touch and its bigger brother, the iPhone into semi-open mini-platforms for computing and gaming. In fact, on Apple’s recent earnings call, Steve Jobs maintained the iPhone’s functionality was the same as the new netbook category of smaller laptops.I would not go that far – there is an obvious trade-off in the lack of a proper keyboard and a smaller screen to create the iPhone’s sleek profile.But the new apps have compensated for this to some extent by optimising themselves for the screen and its touch features.Some of my favourite apps, all of them free, include the Bloomberg and AP news services, Stanza e-book reader, Pandora and last.fm music services, AOL radio, Flixster’s movie application, Wikipanion (Wikipedia for the small screen), and Google Earth.So far I have downloaded 36 apps on to my touch and I am not alone. More than 100m copies of applications and games were downloaded in the first 60 days of the store being opened.Such popularisation of the concept was bound to breed competition and the first phone with the Google-inspired Android operating system was launched last month with its own version of a store – the Android Market.This had an initial collection of about 50 applications, with many more to come.Research in Motion has also been stirred into action. RIM sold 6.1m BlackBerry smart phones in its latest quarter, but it was topped for the first time by Apple’s quarterly numbers – it sold 6.9m of the iPhone 3Gs launched on July 11, more than the 6.1m units that the first-generation iPhone sold in total.RIM held its first BlackBerry Developer Conference last month and announced at the Silicon Valley event a BlackBerry storefront, launching in March next year.RIM differs in that it shows sensitivities towards enterprise users and carriers – it promised control over employees downloading apps and offered customised versions of the store for carriers.The latter move seems a step back to the pre-app store days.There have always been places to go to download applications and games for phones – carriers’ stores accessed via the handsets or websites such as Handango and PalmGear.Apple has taken the competition to a higher level, making app stores the equivalent of arms races being staged by warring operating systems.It is Apple’s OS X for the iPhone against the open Android OS and Windows Mobile (Microsoft is due to launch SkyMarket, its own version of App Store, later this year).The strategy of RIM and Symbian and Qualcomm’s Brew in so far supporting a more fragmented market for applications has to be questioned in this context.To help win any arms race, financial incentives can influence developers to focus on a particular platform.The VC firm Kleiner Perkins opened the $100m iFund for the iPhone and the $150m BlackBerry Partners Fund announced its first three investments last week.Buzzd, one of the companies, told me they preferred developing their location-based social networking service for the BlackBerry platform, as it had a bigger installed base of users and Apple’s store had reached saturation point, where newly released apps easily got lost among the thousands already there.I sympathise – I now have several pages of apps cluttering my iPod touch’s interface, but this in itself is presenting an opportunity for platforms within platforms, where more use is being made of limited screen space.Pageonce for the iPhone and BlackBerry aggregates all your online accounts under one icon, while Where uses a map interface to offer a range of services that can be flicked through and brought up near your location.Where has opened its platform so developers for something like GasBuddy can reveal the cheapest fuel locations.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m sure there are some new apps I could be downloading, if I can just work out where to find them …
631;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;AMD splits;;Where once it was the quick and the dead, it is now size rather than speed that discriminates the living (at least for technology companies). Hence the need for US chipmaker AMD to seek out the deep pockets of Abu Dhabi. The Emirate’s sovereign wealth fund is to buy a majority stake in the chip manufacturing business to be spun out of AMD for $700m and then contribute another $3bn-$6bn to build foundries for the new group.The need for help is the result of the harsh reality faced by all but the largest manufacturers and designers of hardware: once a lead is established in terms of scale and technology, it is very rarely reversed.AMD created a debt burden that threatened to overwhelm it by trying to stay competitive against dominant competitor Intel. In 2006 AMD bought graphics chip designer ATI for $5.7bn, betting that the technology would converge with the computer processors that it makes. That may ultimately pay off, but after losses of $1.6bn on revenues of just $2.8bn in the first half of this year, time was running out.Meanwhile, the largest processor, digital memory and chip manufacturers – Intel, Samsung and TSMC – have announced plans to build the next generation of chip manufacturing processes, due to come online between 2010 and 2015. With an annual capital spending budget of $1bn, compared with more than $11bn at Intel, AMD would not be able to compete.So, by following the path of outsourcing – graphics chipmaker Nvida, Qualcomm and Broadcomm are all similarly without foundaries – AMD should at least survive. The group’s bombed-out stock surged by almost a fifth on Tuesday on the news. Prospering, however, will remain a challenge. It no doubt suits Intel to have a small competitor that shows it is being kept honest. But Abu Dhabi’s new partner will be hard pressed to do more than that.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public commentsclick here
632;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Freescale lacks scale, plans retreat from mobile chips;;Nearly four years after its spin-off by Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor could be spinning off itself the cell phone chip business that represented its best-known ties to the mother ship.Freescale became the subject of the biggest tech buyout in history two years ago, when private equity firms Blackstone Group, Carlyle, Permira and TPG paid $17.6bn for the Texas-based company.They brought in a new chief executive in March – Rich Beyer from Silicon Valley chipmaker Intersil – and he has taken a fresh look at the business.“Scale is important in this [cellular] business, particularly as we are seeing consolidation, and Freescale simply doesn’t have the scale to grow back to be one of the true market leaders,” Mr Beyer told me this morning.The consolidation he refers to is among handset makers, where the top five have more than 80 per cent of the market and Motorola’s market share has more than halved to less than 10 per cent.They are demanding more complex chipsets and accompanying application software – an area where Qualcomm has become a master, but smaller chipmakers cannot make the level of investment to be competitive.Motorola has been buying more chips from Qualcomm, hitting Freescale’s market share further and reducing its revenues from Motorola to below 25 per cent of its total chip sales.Freescale fell from fourth to eighth position in the worldwide top ten of wireless chip suppliers in 2007, according to the iSuppli research firm.It had 3.6 per cent of the market by sales, compared to 16.7 per cent for Texas Instruments and 19.1 per cent for Qualcomm, the market leader.In an announcement, Freescale said it was exploring strategic options for its cellular business and intended to complete a sale, joint venture agreement “or other transformation in the coming months.”Mr Beyer said bankers had been appointed and he expected an outcome in the next 90 days. He did not name any possible partners but STMicroelectronics, Infineon, NXP, MediaTek and Broadcom are other leading wireless chip providers.Freescale will be focusing on its market leading businesses in networking and the automotive industry in future, in a strategy that Mr Beyer said his private-equity board members were fully behind.With some major debt financing behind Freescale’s acquisition, I had to ask if the company was suffering any liquidity problems in the current financial crisis.“At the end of Q2, we had about $1.3bn in cash, our debt service is in the $700m [a year] range, we are generating significant cash…so the company’s in very healthy shape from a liquidity standpoint,” he said.
633;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-09-29T22:17:39Z;Groups spend $1bn on Mobile Broadband ads;;A group of 17 of the world’s largest IT and telecommunications companies have thrown their weight behind a $1bn marketing campaign to promote Mobile Broadband as a “ready to run” system, making it easier to connect to the internet right after purchasing a laptop.The advertising budget will be spent this year both online and offl to try to create Mobile Broadband as a well-known brand, in a similar way to microprocessor Intel’s “Intel Inside” campaign in the 1990s.The move is aimed at countering the launch of the rival wireless broadband network WiMax, which is being rolled out in cities across the US this week.Mobile Broadband is supported by industry groups such as computer manufacturers Dell, Lonovo and Toshiba, software giant Microsoft, telecoms providers Vodafone, Telefónica, Orange and T-Mobile, and equipment and chipset providers Ericsson and Qualcomm, and will be launched in 91 countries.Many of the laptops will come pre-installed with SIM cards so that customers can connect straight away to the existing mobile broadband network, with typical speeds of about 1 to 3 megabytes per second.At the point of purchase, customers will have a choice of mobile operator to provide data services, with prices typically at £15 a month ($30).Although mobile broadband connections are available for customers using plug-in devices called “dongles”, the new laptops have the technology embedded into the laptop, making it simpler to access using existing connection software.The laptops will still be able to access WiFi networks, which typically offer higher connection speeds but have limited coverage, but can then switch back to the mobile broadband network, which offers a high geographical spread of coverage.Mobile Broadband is led by the GSM Association, which is keen to promote the High Speed Packet Access network as an alternative to other competing wireless networks, including WiMax, which is being rolled out in Baltimore in the US this week by Sprint Nextel.WiMax offers speeds of about 2 to 10mbps, which is faster than mobile broadband but does not offer the near-ubiquitous coverage of HSPA.According to Wireless Intelligence, the mobile research organisation, there are over 55m subscribers to mobile broadband services worldwide, which is expected to grow to about 70m before the end of the year.With the promotion of mobile broadband preinstalled on laptops, the GSMA expects the number of subscribers to reach 1bn by 2012.
634;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-09-26T20:23:10Z;Wimax v HSPA – let battle commence;;A major skirmish in the battle over competing mobile broadband technologies is set for next week with launch announcements for WiMAX and HSPA.Dan Hesse, Sprint chief executive, and Sean Maloney, executive vice president of Intel, will be in Baltimore, Maryland for the launch in that city of the first US WiMAX network.The hoopla will include speeches, technology demonstrations from leading manufacturers and WiMAX availability in the area.WiMAX provides broadband internet connections wirelessly over wide areas and claims better upload speeds than 3G mobile phone technology.While Intel is introducing its WiMAX chipsets for notebook PCs (codenamed Echo Peak) in time for the US rollout, mobile chip players such as Qualcomm are fighting back with HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) 3G chips and cards that can also be included by notebook manufacturers.In what appears to be an attempt to steal WiMAX’s thunder, the GSM Association has scheduled an announcement for Tuesday. It says:“Some of the world’s best known mobile operators, PC companies and chipset providers are uniting to pre-install Mobile Broadband onto a range of notebook PCs that will be ready to switch on and surf straight out of the box. The 91-country initiative is the first step in the GSMA’s vision to create a new world of always-connected devices.”The GSMA says it will also unveil “a new global service mark” that will be used to help consumers identify Mobile Broadband ready devices.“The Mobile Broadband service mark will simplify buying decisions, especially for consumers.”So it could come down to a battle of the branding – Intel WiMAX Inside versus Mobile Broadband.Still, there seems to be a big enough pie in the oven to share. Gartner estimates 200m mobile broadband users in 2009 and Informa estimates 1.3bn by 2012.
635;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-09-23T04:01:28Z;IBM takes a blunt axe to its dealings with standards-setters;;To most people, the setting of technology standards sounds like an arcane and generally dull pursuit best left to the experts. But tech companies have long realised that influencing the standard-setting process can bring huge competitive advantage: getting your technology preference adopted by the world at large brings immediate home-field advantage.Which is why the new row that IBM is trying hard to whip up over international standards is so important.Bob Sutor, vice president of open source and standards, tells me that Big Blue has decided to cast a cold eye over the performance of the standards bodies it belongs to – which number “several hundred” – and may drop its links to some. The process of creating standards is “much more broken than people realised”, he said: in particular, there is a lack of transparency in some bodies about how decisions are arrived at or even how membership of the standards groups is set, which opens the system to abuse.The immediate cause of all this, of course, was Microsoft’s successful and controversial promotion of its Ooxml (Office Open XML) formats as a standard earlier this year. The formats first got the backing of Ecma, which put them forward for approval by the ISO – a process that drew complaints about how Microsoft packed national standards bodies with its own supporters in order to tip the ISO vote in its favour.“It has exposed how Ecma operates, as basically a standards body for hire,” complains Mr Sutor, who is pretty direct in his warning that if Ecma does not clean up its act, IBM will quit. (Plastered across the top of Ecma’s Website is the proud claim, “Standards@Internet Speed”. They might want to rethink that one.)Mr Sutor insists this is not just a Microsoft-induced sulk. He points to other companies of whose practices IBM disapproves. These include Rambus and Qualcomm, each of which he accused of steering standards in their own favour without first revealing that they already had proprietary technology in the area.Will IBM’s public threats have any effect? Much depends on how well it has read the mood in the emerging world. There were various complaints from emerging countries earlier this year about the Ooxml process. This month the rumblings got much louder, as a group of six mainly South American countries wrote an open letter to ISO saying that after the Ooxml debacle they will no longer adopt all of the body’s standards as a matter of course.Siding with these customers looks like a smart business move for IBM. The risk, though, is that if a big vendor unilaterally starts to abandon some standards bodies, or to end support for the technologies they have recognised, it could lead to a fragmentation that is helpful to noone.
636;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-09-22T18:48:56Z;Pack a punch on the move;;"As soon as a business traveller steps out of home or office with a portable PC, staying in touch with colleagues and contacts becomes a top priority. After all, no one wants to be out of the loop at such times when the financial sector and markets are in turmoil.So preparations for even a short trip can weigh a traveller down with a bunch of cables, plug-in power supplies and adaptors for the laptop PC, BlackBerry, Apple iPod, digital camera and other electronic devices, along with network cables, broadband wireless data cards and the other paraphernalia of connectivity.We asked some regular business travellers about their favourite devices (see below) and, as they confirm, no travel kit is complete without a reliable – and preferably lightweight – laptop. Interestingly, two picked ultra-lightweight systems – the Apple MacBook Air and a Sony Vaio, both geared to road warriors with aching shoulders.Staying connected to communications links has become easier thanks to the growth of wireless e-mail and smartphone devices, particularly Research in Motion’s BlackBerry family, the spread of Wi-Fi hotspots and the advent of broadband wireless services.While smartphones still comprise a small slice of the nearly 500m mobile devices sold each year, their owners’ working lives have been transformed by being able to send and receive e-mail while on the move and, increasingly, access business applications such as ERM (enterprise resource management) and salesforce automation systems. Even better, you no longer have to pay inflated hotel telephone fees or the exorbitant international roaming charges imposed by wireless carriers in Europe and elsewhere.Mobile phone owners can use one of the new internet-based mobile VoIP (voice over internet protocol) services such as Jajah (www.jajah.com), Yeigo (www. yeigo.com) or Rebtel (www.rebtel. com) to cut call costs, or use a PC with an internet connection, Skype software and a headset to make a call.For travellers with access to a WiFi connection, another alternative is to carry a Skype-based WiFi handset, now offered by a handful of network equipment companies including Netgear (www.netgear.com) and Cisco’s Linksys unit (www.linksys.com).Most network equipment makers and other IT companies, including Apple, offer portable WiFi routers that can be plugged into a hotel ethernet connection and let you set up an instant – and secure – in-room WiFi “hotspot” that can be used for data or VoIP voice communications.If you already carry a 3G cellular wireless data card for a laptop, as does Rob Small (see below), you can add a wireless datacard mobile router such as Kyocera’s KR2 (www. kyocera.com). This clever device enables users to create an instant WiFi hotspot anywhere there is a 3G signal by plugging a 3G datacard or USB device into the box.Of course, you can also use a cellular wireless data card to add wide area network (Wan) data communications capabilities to almost any standard laptop with a PC card, ExpressCard or USB port. Coupled with virtual private network software, this lets you establish a secure wireless data connection to a remote business network down the road or on the other side of the world.A growing number of laptops aimed at business users, including models from Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Toshiba and Sony, also come with built-in cellular wireless data modules in addition to their now standard WiFi capabilities.Typically, however, this means a user has had to stick with either a 3G GSM-based wireless data carrier or a carrier that uses the rival CDMA mobile technology used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel in the US and a number of carriers elsewhere in the world. If you travel extensively outside the US, your best bet may be to stick with a GSM-based carrier.Recently, however, Qualcomm, the US-based mobile phone chipmaker, unveiled a cellular wireless data module, dubbed Gobi, that combines both CDMA and GSM 3G radios, enabling users to swap carriers relatively easily.The rollout of 4G broadband wireless data services over the next five years will also make staying connected while travelling easier for business travellers. In the US, for example, the Clearwire consortium, comprising Sprint Nextel, Clearwire, Intel, Google and three leading US cable TV operators, is committed to rolling out a nationwide 4G network based on WiMax technology, an IP-based broadband wireless standard.Elsewhere, Vodafone, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility and China Mobile have announced plans to adopt LTE (long-term evolution) technology for their next-generation wireless networks. The first commercial LTE networks are expected to start operating in 2010 and have the potential to create the first truly global broadband wireless network.Staying connected while travelling is now a top priority. Fortunately, technology is making this easier but the price may ultimately be the end of the “disconnected” vacation.New priorities: when wireless hotspots are more important than the gym or poolAles Spetic

My Logitech QuickCam is useful for having Skype video IM or video calls with my kids from wherever I am. Lastly, I take a Maxtor BlackArmor external disc drive to keep all my confidential work documents secure.”Gladys Lau

“From my base at our headquarters in San Franciso, I travel quite a bit within the US and often in Asia, especially Shanghai and Hong Kong. My immediate “to-do” when I plan my travel is to inquire whether the hotel has wireless hotspots – I used to ask about a pool or gym, now it’s about the wireless. Shanghai and Hong Kong have super access but, in other parts of Asia, it can be tricky.The laptop I carry everywhere I go is a Toshiba Tecra. In my “always ready” carry-on bag, there is an extra battery back-up. I am most dependent on my phone, a Palm Centro, with its small portable size and full qwerty keyboard feature. When I’m overseas, I’m looking for the urgent items and the phone is the best way to scan e-mail, text and urgent incoming items.”

637;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Tech sector;;The technology sector, it was once hoped, might be a safe haven. But it has proved merely another refuge to be blown away by the winds of the credit crunch. Research released by Forrester on Tuesday found that 43 per cent of large global companies have cut IT budgets this year, adding to mounting gloom. During the past two weeks Dell, Qualcomm, Corning, Ciena and Nokia have warned, in various ways, of softer demand – and most have suffered double-digit share price falls, dragging down both European and US peers. The Nasdaq Composite’s recent 5 per cent slide outstripped the S&P’s 3 per cent fall.The challenges facing tech companies are now spreading outside the US and all along the technology chain. Demand in Europe and Asian emerging markets that had partly offset US weakness is slowing. The stronger dollar makes things worse for US groups, though provides a modicum of relief for European counterparts. Corporate and domestic customers are both being squeezed. Forrester’s survey found nearly half of financial services companies, their balance sheets creaking, have trimmed IT spending. Ciena warned that phone companies, feeling no urgency to upgrade technology, are delaying new contracts. And cash-strapped consumers are, says Qualcomm’s chief, keeping old mobile phones longer. That is forcing some handset makers to cut prices, although Nokia says it will not follow suit. Even segments enjoying growth, such as LCD TVs, are not immune. Corning cut projections of sales of glass for LCD panels after TV assemblers built up excess stocks.This slowdown lacks the force of the technology collapse in 2001, when a huge build-up of overcapacity was followed by large-scale order cancellations. Companies with competitive products either recently released or about to pop out of the pipeline will be in a position to take market share from rivals. But a broader recovery across the technology sector will not come until demand shows clear signs of reviving. Historical trends suggest that may not be before the second half of 2009 at the earliest.To email the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
638;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-09-05T14:04:21Z;Nokia stuns market with strong warning;;Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, warned on Friday that its market share would shrink in the third quarter of the year, ending a period of almost uninterrupted growth and wiping almost 10 per cent off its share price.The Finnish company stood by its earlier forecast that industry-wide unit sales for the full year would increase but admitted for the first time that aggressive moves by its competitors were pricing it out of the market.The warning shocked investors, who had come to believe that the industry juggernaut was immune to the global economic downturn.Shares in Nokia closed down 9.6 per cent at €14.20 on Friday, its lowest level in almost three years.The news also hit shares of Nokia’s leading suppliers. STMicroelectronics was down 5.5 per cent to €8.15 while Qualcomm shares were off about 0.8 per cent on the Nasdaq and Texas Instruments was down 1.8 per cent on NYSE.Rick Simonson, Nokia’s chief financial officer, declined to predict how much the company’s market share would drop but said: “We are not talking about several points here”. The company sold four out of every 10 mobile phones globally at the end of the second quarter.Mr Simonson told analysts that that profitability would be affected: “Less units equals lower revenues equals lower operating profit,” he said.Nokia is not the first large mobile maker to report problems this year. Sony Ericsson, the world’s fifth-largest mobile manufacturer, has issued two profit warnings because fewer consumers are buying handsets than previously expected in its core European markets because of the economic downturn.Nokia stressed that the decline in its market share was due to a decision not to participate in a price war for low-end phone sales being waged by competitors such as Samsung of South Korea.“Nokia’s strategy is to take market share only when the company believes it to be sustainably profitable in the longer term. Nokia has not broadly participated in recent aggressive pricing activity as it believes that the negative impact to profitability would outweigh any short-term incremental benefits to device unit sales,” the group stated.In spite of this commitment to profitability, the announcement has made clear for the first time that Nokia is not impervious to competitive pressures and the giant Finnish company can be undermined.It raises doubts about the sustainability of Nokia’s business model of building market share, especially in large emerging markets, and increasing its profitability while being able to reduce the prices of its handsets.Mr Simonson insisted that the prices being offered by its competitors were “not sustainable” and he was confident that there would be a recovery in the fourth quarter.The company continued to expect an increase in its market share in mobile devices for the full year 2008.However, it cautioned that this global market would be “impacted by weaker consumer confidence in multiple markets”, although industry mobile device volumes in 2008 should grow 10 per cent or more from the approximately 1.14bn units Nokia estimated for 2007.When it released its second-quarter results in July, the company reported a 13 per cent year-on-year rise in earnings per share and increased its sales forecasts at the time. Net sales for the second quarter rose 4 per cent to €13.2bn ($20.9bn) while its operating margin rose from 11.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 to 14.7 per cent, even though the average price of its handsets fell to €74 from €79.The results had added weight to Nokia’s long-stated claim that its scale and geographical scope allows it to increase market share, margins and earnings while average selling prices drop.
639;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-08-20T09:24:51Z;Ericsson and STMicro to join forces;;Ericsson and STMicroelectronics are creating a joint venture to supply semiconductors to mobile phone manufacturers in an effort to compete with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, the biggest mobile chipmakers.The as yet unnamed venture, which will also supply other handset components, will have annual sales of $3.6bn. Sweden’s Ericsson, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone networks, will inject $1.1bn into the joint venture, $700m of which will be paid to STMicroelectronics.Geneva-based STMicroelectronics, the fifth-largest semiconductor maker, is contributing its ST-NXP Wireless mobile phone semiconductor business that was formed by another joint venture only 19 days ago. Ericsson will put its mobile platform business into the venture.The deal underlines how the need for economies of scale continues to fuel consolidation in the telecoms industry. The growth of the mobile internet, which requires more capable handsets, is also pushing companies to pool their capital and research and development resources.Carl-Henric Svanberg, Ericsson’s chief executive, said the rationale behind the joint venture was based on the complementary nature of STMicroelectronics and Ericsson’s businesses rather than any cost savings. “There has been an increase in complexity in this business. We will provide a complete solution customers have been asking for.”Mr Svanberg said that the venture would compete with Texas Instruments and Qualcomm as one of the top three mobile semiconductor ­makers.Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, has also recently stated its intention to move into the mobile semiconductor market. Mr Svanberg acknowledged Intel’s intentions, adding that computers and mobile were “coming to a meeting point”. The joint venture already has relationships with four of the top five handset makers: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG.ST-NXP Wireless was formed on August 2 out of the wireless semiconductor operations of ST Microelectronics and NXP, a European rival.Carlo Bozotti, STMicro-electronics chief executive, said the joint venture with NXP had been designed to strengthen its wireless operations, and described the two successive joint ventures as a “quantum leap”.Analysts sounded a cautious note, suggesting that Ericsson’s mobile platform had not lived up to its potential and was questionable as a standalone business.Martin Nilsson, analyst at Carnegie in Stockholm said: “This is a defensive play by Ericsson to ensure they have a business model they can continue to run.”The new joint venture will have almost 8,000 employees, with about 5,000 coming from STMicroelectronics and 3,000 from Ericsson. It will have headquarters in Geneva and be divided into two companies. The first will focus on research and marketing with its revenues consolidated by STMicroelectronics.Ericsson will consolidate the revenues of the other company, which will provide platform designs.Shares of STMicroelectronics gained 2.9 per cent to $12.24 while Ericsson was up 0.5 per cent at SKr65.80.
640;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-08-04T21:00:53Z;Motorola taps Qualcomm for mobiles chief;;Motorola scored a coup on Monday with the recruitment of a highly rated executive to head its mobile phone business, which will be spun out of the US electronics group next year.The company named Sanjay Jha, Qualcomm chief operating officer, to lead the unit, sending its shares up 10 per cent by midday in New York.The appointment ends a four-month search for a chief executive for the mobile phone arm, which has been struggling with losses and declining market share for 18 months after failing to update its mobile phone portfolio and relying for too long on sales of the ageing Razr handset.Analysts said Mr Jha’s appointment was expected to give the unit credibility and quell doubts that Motorola would go through with plans to split off the mobile phone business in the third quarter next year.He will be replaced at Qualcomm by Len Lauer, who joined Qualcomm from Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile network operator.Motorola’s stock gained more than 11 per cent, closing at $9.82.“Motorola is getting a leader with great technical background, industry experience and business savvy,” said Mark McKechnie of American Technology Research.Mr Jha, who has helped turn Qualcomm into a mobile phone chip powerhouse since he joined in 1994, was also named Motorola’s co-chief executive, a role he will share with Greg Brown, Motorola’s current chief.“This is the culmination of several months work,” Mr Brown said. “We got the best candidate available and I am confident Motorola is on its way back.”Mr Brown, who took over as chief executive of the struggling company in January, bowed to shareholder pressure led by Carl Icahn, the Wall Street investor, in March and agreed to spin off the mobile devices business.Motorola’s second-quarter results released last week showed that Mr Brown had made some progress in stabilising the unit.While it still reported a loss, strong mobile phone sales in North America enabled Motorola to narrowly hang onto its ranking as the third largest mobile phone maker behind Nokia of Finland and Korea’s Samsung.
641;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-07-24T19:44:02Z;Qualcomm hails Nokia settlement;;Qualcomm on Thursday hailed a new technology cross-licensing agreement with Nokia as a major boost for the wireless industry.The 15-year deal put an end to extensive litigation between the world’s leading wireless chip producer and the largest handset maker, opening up use of each other’s patents in 2G, 3G and future 4G technologies.Qualcomm’s shares opened 20 per cent higher at $53.82 on news of the settlement.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call the dispute had “overshadowed the performance of the company”.As part of the deal, Nokia is withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission about Qualcomm’s licensing practices. It also includes an undisclosed upfront payment to ­Qualcomm and ongoing ­royalties.Rick Simonson, Nokia’s chief financial officer, said: “We can lay down our legal arms. Litigation is not our core business. This 15-year deal – which in our industry is a long time – takes away all the noise, and covers all the relevant technologies.”San Diego-based Qualcomm overtook Texas Instruments last year as the number one wireless chipmaker, but makes most of its profits from licensing its extensive patent portfolio.The European Commission launched an investigation of Qualcomm’s dominance of 3G standards last year, following a 2005 complaint by TI, Broadcom, Ericsson, NEC, Nokia and Panasonic.They said that Qualcomm was failing to license its patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.An Ericsson spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday that nothing had changed and the Commission investigation should continue. The Korean Fair Trade Commission has launched a similar inquiry.Qualcomm raised its ­outlook for its fiscal year, now in its fourth quarter, and said the Nokia deal could improve its profits by seven to 13 cents a share.It reported third quarter revenues grew 19 per cent year-on-year to $2.8bn, but profits fell 4 per cent to 45 cents a share as research and general costs, including legal expenses, grew.
642;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-07-24T19:13:38Z;Qualcomm and Nokia make up;;A nine-figure legal bill tends to concentrate the mind. Just as the really expensive courtroom stage of the battle was about to kick off, Qualcomm and Nokia settled their dispute over intellectual property. All litigation, including Nokia’s complaint to the European Commission, has been dropped and a 15-year technology licensing deal agreed. Remarkably, it seems like a good result for both sides.The actual terms of the agreement remain confidential, but can be roughly inferred from fourth quarter guidance given by Qualcomm. Assuming the chipmaker’s annual legal bill will fall by about $200m, it looks like Nokia will be paying a royalty to Qualcomm of 2-2.5 per cent of the price of each mobile phone it sells. That compares with the 4-5 per cent that Nokia paid under the agreement that expired in June 2007, and will still be paid by its peers. Nokia will also make an undisclosed upfront payment, and transfer some patents to Qualcomm, but resolution lifted the mobile phone group’s (bombed-out) stock by 4 per cent.Qualcomm shares, meanwhile, soared by a fifth. That reflects the return of Nokia royalty payments to forecasts – worth about $700m next year. It also represents a significant validation of Qualcomm’s licensing model. Unlike most chipmakers, who incorporate the cost of intellectual property into the price of their chips, Qualcomm demands royalties due to ownership of fundamental building blocks of mobile phone technology. This has been largely accepted for phones using CDMA, but is more uncertain for the wireless technologies that will come after 3G. Agreeing payments across the range of technology standards in development with the largest handset maker underpins faith in that lucrative model. Furthermore, the patent transfer should prevent other handset makers being able to negotiate a similar discount. Only the lawyers will be upset by the outcome.Post and read comments on this Lex
643;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Brickfish aiming to use viral adverts;;When Kodak, the US photo supplies company, decided to re-enter the inkjet printer business with a range of printers that claim to cut the cost of ink in half, the company chose an unconventional way to get the message out.Kodak teamed up with a San Diego-based start-up called Brickfish that has pioneered a new web-based viral marketing method called social media advertising.Together they created a campaign dubbed ‘Pricey Ink Stinks’ built around a competition that challenged online visitors to find another use for their old, ink-hungry printer and blog about it, take a photo, draw it or video it for the chance to win one of the new Kodak models.The campaign was a success, generating 87 entries and more than 173,022 ‘engagements’ which Brian Dunn, Brickfish’s chief executive, claims are a much better metric than unique visitors or page views. Engagements, or a campaign’s ‘E-score’, measures consumer action defined by entries, votes, reviews, and views of branded user generated content.Clients use the Brickfish platform to launch online advertising and marketing campaigns designed to capture the attention of consumers – particularly the young, creative and connected – and tap the power and reach of social networking.Instead of marketing to consumers, the Brickfish advertising platform effectively co-opts consumers who become part of the campaign, generating blogs, images, video and audio content that is shared virally and voted upon. Meanwhile, Brickfish enables its clients to monitor and track the campaign through ‘viral map’ technology that provides detailed analytics about campaign reach, performance and demographics.“This viral, consumer driven, marketing approach has proven to be five to 10 times more effective than existing online advertising methods such as display ads and search optimisation,” claims Mr Dunn.With online banner ads stuck with their 0.1-0.2 per cent click-through rates, marketers at big name companies including Samsung, Nike, Qualcomm and Procter & Gamble have begun to listen.P&G used Brickfish to launch a campaign for its Aussie shampoo brand. Like the Kodak campaign, the Aussie effort was a contest site. The competition attracted 4,017 entries and more than 2m visitors, 80 per cent of whom were viral connections through sites such as MySpace, MyYearBook and SugarFoot. Brian Jochum, P&G’s Aussie brand manager, described it as one of P&G’s most successful engagement branding efforts so far this year.“In order to broadly reach consumers across the internet, Brickfish provided us with a highly cost conscious and effective method to virally spread our brand name to thousands,” he said. “We were able to reach more active consumers than with many traditional online advertising methods.”Using Brickfish’s media platform, P&G was able to track not only the initial message sent but subsequent ones to other social networks. This enabled the company to follow the viral path from one peer to the next – a colour-coded viral map shows the initial messages that were generated on the contest site and then messages that were later passed on from one social network to the next.In total, Brickfish has launched more than 200 campaigns for clients, including about 30 for the fashion and cosmetics industry. Some of the brands the company has worked with include Givenchy, Frederick’s of Hollywood, Estee Lauder’s Clinique and Origins brands, and Smashbox.Brickfish, which was founded three years ago by a small team of entrepreneurs, has quickly emerged as the leader in social media advertising with few if any direct competitors, though that could change.Last year it raised $11.2m in a Series A financing from a group of venture capital firms including DCM, Draper Richards, Mangrove Capital Partners and OCA Venture Partners. The company is expected to launch another round of funding shortly.
644;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-06-05T17:55:20Z;Telegent bets on old-fashioned mobile TV;;Telegent Systems, a small Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company, is betting that old-fashioned free-to-air analogue television broadcasting could hold the key to driving the adoption of TV in mobile phones in many large markets, including China.While most of the world’s biggest telecoms equipment companies and network operators are battling over which digital technology standard will become dominant, Telegent has developed a semiconductor chip that, when built into mobile phones, enables them to receive existing live analogue broadcasts.Telegent’s move is significant because digital mobile phone-based TV services have been slower to take off than most handset and chip makers had expected.Analysts suggest this is partly because of the battle over digital standards and the limited digital content available.Qualcomm, the leading US mobile phone chip maker, Samsung Electronics and Nokia have all invested heavily in developing digital technologies such as MediaFlo and DVB-H, which enable especially adapted mobile phones to receive live digital TV.Mobile carriers in Japan, South Korea, Europe and North America have all launched limited mobile TV services.Last month, Qualcomm spent $558m in the US and $16.6m in the UK to buy radio spectrum for that purpose, while rivals Samsung Electronic and LG Electronic announced that they were teaming up to develop a rival digital mobile TV standard in North America.The companies are hoping to stake their claim on a rapidly growing market.According to Juniper Research, an IT consultancy, the value of the global mobile TV market will grow from $1.4bn last year to $11.9bn in 2012.Japan and South Korea account for the bulk of that market. Elsewhere, consumer response has been lukewarm because of the limited number of digital TV channels available, the quality of some of the services and the additional monthly fee most carriers charge for the service.“Mobile TV uptake is significantly influenced by the content that consumers are able to view on their handsets,” says Michelle Abraham of In-Stat, a leading US-based technology analyst firm.“The growing success of free-to-air mobile TV services suggest consumer pre-ference for programmes that are most like what people watch at home.”Telegent, founded in 2004 with venture capital funding, is hoping to tap into this pent-up demand by delivering receiver chips for mobile phones that consume little battery power – a key constraint for handset manufacturers – and enable owners to watch existing analogue TV broadcasts for free.“Digital TV broadcasts rely on specially-made content, but consumers are used to watching television for free, [which makes it hard for providers to charge a premium for content],” says Yun Weijie, co-founder and chief executive of Telegent.Telegent began shipping its receiver chips last May and by the end of last year there were 5m phones in the world with their chips installed inside.Mr Yun expects an additional 25m receivers will be shipped this year, bringing the total number of analogue TV enabled handsets to 30m – surpassing the number of digital TV enabled units. Telegent also makes chips that can receive both digital and analogue TV signals.Mr Yun claims Telegent is the “first and only company” to succeed in making an analogue TV receiver small enough and that consumes little enough power to be used in mobile phones.“Many have tried to do that before, but 100 per cent of them failed. It was considered impossible,” he says.Most of Telegent’s sales generate in emerging markets such as Latin America, Middle East and China, where, unlike Europe and North America, which are switching to digital broadcasting, analogue transmissions are expected to continue for many years.Telegent has linked up with local manufacturers – in China it works with Shanghai Tianyu Technology and ZTE, for example, which produce phones in large volumes locally, but have relatively little global presence.Telegent is in discussions to license its receivers to the so-called “Big Five” global manufacturers, such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson, Mr Yun says.
645;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-05-31T04:12:28Z;Home thoughts reassure when investing abroad;;"If you expect the dollar to continue going down, should you buy foreign stocks? Not necessarily. One consequence of a devaluation is a unilateral wage reduction. In an export industry, that’s pure gravy.Suppose that you were, as I once was, a wine grower in France and (as it did under President Mitterrand) the franc lost half its value against the dollar. Bliss! Your expenses stay about the same, while the dollar component of your sales soars, as do your profits.In reverse, though, if the dollar drops, a French wine grower selling mostly to America is in terrible shape. His expenses remain the same, but his sales and profits collapse. If you expect a lower dollar, you should avoid foreign companies dependent on our market.Usually matters are not black and white. Boeing gains a lot against Airbus from a weak dollar, but still must pay more for the materials and components it buys from abroad.Should we then, expecting a lower dollar, buy foreign stocks – let’s say European companies selling very little here?I’d say, sure. Assuming a lower dollar, the whole eurozone will become relatively more valuable in dollar terms, so other things being equal you will come out ahead. On the other hand, things often aren’t equal. Foreign companies are more likely to have two sets of books, to take more advantage of their shareholders, and to be less transparent. The requirements of our regulatory bodies are onerous to fulfil, but do give shareholders a good view of what’s going on, and a powerful redress if they are abused.In general I think leading American companies are likely to be better managed than foreign ones. They’re more innovative, and our home market is bigger. Furthermore, the immense salaries given to our chief executives allow our companies to hire top top talent from anywhere. Often, they’re worth it.Where things get tough is when the US company has much higher labour costs, including healthcare, than its foreign competitors, as in the car and apparel sectors. In general, companies with high labour costs should be avoided, and particularly if they compete head on with say, the Chinese. Instead, buy our service companies.“Foreign” is a big place, of course. You’ve got good countries and not so good but growing countries, and countries that are growing explosively. I would say that aside from a possible currency play, there’s no particular reason for an American to invest in a highly developed nation – Germany for example, or Japan. And they have troubling pension problems ahead as their populations age.Moving to the second tier, Russia is a puzzle. I wouldn’t be happy there personally, but it’s an interesting world: corrupt, but becoming stronger. China and India are booming, but again have corruption problems. In cases such as these, local subsidiaries of international companies can be more comfortable places to be.Then come the high-growth third-world countries. (Here I must declare an interest: I’ve been involved in that sector, lately as a director and shareholder of emerging market funds run out of London.) I feel at home there, particularly in the smaller-company category. Good, smaller third-world companies do better and sell more cheaply than larger companies, but are vastly harder to analyse. And consider that the more alarming the country, the cheaper the companies. So an admirable play is a top company in a disconcerting country that turns out all right, such as Egypt or Nigeria. As a retail investor, you should buy through a fund.So if you want to venture abroad it is usually more sensible for the individual investor to buy US companies with extensive foreign sales rather than foreign companies, unless they are hard-to-analyse “emerging” ones, in which case a fund is best. But which US companies? You can find the foreign sales component in their regular reports and, for example, in the Value Line reports. Here are some good growth companies, in order of their foreign sales: Intel (81 per cent); Ebay (80); Qualcomm (78); Schlumberger (68); Corning (59); Procter & Gamble (57); Goldman Sachs (46); Johnson & Johnson (44); Apple (41).Finally, though, should one necessarily assume that the dollar will continue to decline? It’s already cheap in terms of purchasing-power parity: you pay much more for the same article in euros than here. And the dollar isn’t going to zero. The other big countries have problems, too.The writer is chairman of Montrose Group, investment counsel in New York.

646;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-05-27T19:15:47Z;Infineon and on and on;;So farewell, Dr Wolfgang Ziebart. The Infineon chief executive resigned on Wednesday, after four years in charge of the German semiconductor maker. Differences of opinion with the board over strategic direction is the official reason but it seems likely that his failure to follow through on a good idea – getting out of the memory market – may have ultimately cost him the job. The new chief executive must be much more ruthless.In 2006 the group, sensibly, decided to float a minority stake in its memory division QiMonda. Producing D-ram memory chips is a volatile commodity business. But while the unit is now listed separately in New York, Infineon still holds 78 per cent of QiMonda. Meanwhile, D-ram prices have collapsed and losses have ballooned. If a recovering memory market later this year provides an opportunity to exit completely, it should be taken.Resolution in wireless communications may also be needed. The unit has been hamstrung since Siemens, until then its largest customer, stopped making mobile phones in 2005. Parts of the business have gone but, without a serious presence in 3G, Infineon lacks the size to really challenge the entrenched positions of Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.Yet radical action of this sort seems improbable. Peter Bauer, head of Infineon’s one good business – the automotive and industrial manufacturing division – will pick up the broom for now. A board member for almost a decade, he seems unlikely to challenge the consensus. Instead, a new programme to raise margins is under way and, worryingly, a merger or takeover of private equity-owned NXP is reportedly being considered. The heavily leveraged NXP has an automotive unit generating sales of €1bn that would fit but its lossmaking home appliances business, with sales of €700m, would not. Strapping together two leaky ships would not make them float any better.Post and read comments on this Lex
647;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-05-21T18:25:29Z;Qualcomm buys into UK wireless group;;Qualcomm, the US chipmaker, has joined fellow telecoms technology groups Cisco Systems, Intel and Motorola by taking a stake in Ip.access, a UK-based pioneer in a new in-building wireless technology known as femtocells.Femtocells are similar to WiFi routers, but connect directly to 3G mobile phones. Ip.access, which is based in Cambridge, is developing the technology to allow operators to create 3G “hotspots” in their customers’ homes.Many mobiles contain 3G radio and WiFi, so femtocells can allow operators to improve indoor coverage and redirect traffic from their own networks to customers’ fixed-line broadband connections.Ip.access did not reveal the size of Qualcomm’s “strategic investment”, which follows a similar deal with Cisco in January. It has also raised undisclosed sums from venture backers, including Scottish Equity Partners, Rothschild Gestion and Amadeus Capital Partners.Stephen Mallinson, chief executive of Ip.access, said that it had been fully funded before Qualcomm’s investment. “It’s a way of tying in a strategic partner,” he said. “Qualcomm wants a little stake in the company so it can have an open dialogue.”Frederic Rombaut, head of Qualcomm Ventures Europe, added: “3G femtocells will have a very important role in future network architecture. Ip.access has an innovative approach to the 3G femtocell market.”In spite of the interest from larger technology companies, the femtocell market is still in its infancy.ABI Research, an analyst firm, predicts just 100,000 shipments this year. “2010 will be the year when the market moves to double-digit millions in volume,” said ABI’s report, when the price of femtocells falls below $100.Before full deployment, operators must ensure that the devices do not interfere with wider 3G networks, as well as being easy for customers to set up and for carriers to manage remotely.Martin McNair of Advent Venture Partners, which has invested in another UK-based femtocell developer, Ubiquisys, backed by Google and T-Mobile, said most European Tier 1 telecoms companies were trailing the technology in spite of its relatively recent emergence. “I’ve never seen such a rapid ascendancy in 20 years of telecoms investment,” he said.Ip.access already operates a profitable business selling indoor 2G wireless “picocells” to corporate customers, with partnerships with mobile operators such as T-Mobile, Vodafone and O2 in individual territories.

649;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
650;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Chipmaker’s TV connection;;Hopes of creating a UK broadcast network capable of serving up television programmes on mobile phones took a step forward on Friday.Qualcomm, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of microchips for mobiles, emerged as the successful buyer of radio spectrum that could be used to put live TV on handsets.Live TV on the mobile in the UK has failed to take off. Only 0.6 per cent of the UK’s 47.5m mobile phone users say they watch broadcast TV each month on their handsets, according to research by media analysts M:Metrics. Last year BT shut its broadcast network that enabled Virgin Mobile to offer live TV to its customers. Virgin Mobile attracted few customers for its TV services partly because it offered only five channels and handsets were clunky.As a result, in the past six months mobile operators have shifted their attention from video to music services on handsets, according to Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner. In the US, however, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two largest US mobile operators, have used Qualcomm’s MediaFlo technology to stream live TV to mobiles and are now offering more than 10 live TV channels on handsets.In 2006 Qualcomm conducted trials of MediaFlo in Cambridge in conjunction with British Sky Broadcasting, which Ms Milanesi said were successful. The key question now is the strength of consumer demand.Qualcomm paid £8.3m for the radio spectrum at an auction on Friday organised by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator. Andrew Gilbert, Qualcomm executive vice-president, said it would initially be used for research and development and the company had not yet decided how to use the spectrum, although MediaFlo was a possibility.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last month that he was confident MediaFlo would be rolled out in Europe, adding the company was eager to work with mobile operators.02 said it was interested in hearing more about Qualcomm’s plans, adding: “MediaFlo is a technology well suited to providing TV to mobiles. As always, it’s about having a good range of handsets and getting the customer experience right.”The BBC said it was interested in mobile TV and talked to all the main players. “We are watching the current situation with interest.” The case for Qualcomm creating a dedicated broadcast network capable of serving up TV on mobiles may only become compelling when the activity is popular.
651;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;AT&T to launch live TV for mobiles;;AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, will launch its new live mobile television service on Sunday using two handsets, the LG Vu and the Samsung Access, both designed for television viewing.AT&T Mobile TV, which will be based on Qualcomm’s MediaFlo technology and will cost an additional $15 a month, will offer subscribers 10 channels of broadcast TV including two exclusive channels – PIX, from Sony Pictures Television, and CNN Mobile Live.The launch of the service positions AT&T to compete for mobile TV subscribers with Verizon Wireless, the joint venture mobile carrier owned by Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group, and Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US carrier, which have already launched live mobile TV services.Like AT&T, Verizon uses Qualcomm’s MediaFlo technology and stand-alone network.US mobile network operators view mobile TV services as another way to expand their data offerings and attract new subscribers and advertising revenues to offset pressure on their standard voice services.AT&T will launch its 24-hour service in 58 markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle and Washington DC.Other news and entertainment channels available to subscribers include CBS Mobile, Comedy Central, ESPN Mobile TV, FOX Mobile, MTV, NBC 2Go, NBC News 2Go, and Nickelodeon.Mark Collins, vice-president of consumer data for AT&T’s wireless unit, said: “Our research revealed that news and movies were the two most popular programme categories consumers wanted to watch on their mobile phones”.Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, developed the MediaFlo technology and built the nationwide MediaFlo network in an effort to fuel demand for its advanced mobile phone chips and persuade mobile network operators to adopt the system.Qualcomm paid $554.6m for five licences in the recent US government auction of spectrum in the 700MHz band that will become available in February 2009 when TV stations switch from analogue to digital broadcasting.

That sent banking and insurance companies lower.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was down 0.1 per cent at 148.26 by late afternoon in Tokyo.Shanghai’s composite index leaped 9.3 per cent – its biggest one-day gain since October 23, 2001, amid the turmoil following the September 11 attacks on the US – to close at 3,583.03.The rally was spurred by Beijing’s decision to reduce the tax on each share trade from 0.3 per cent to 0.1 per cent, in a bid to encourage investors to return to a market that had fallen by more than a half since it peaked six months ago.The announcement effectively reversed the government’s move last May to triple the tax to limit speculation and cool a strong rally. The index rose 141 per cent from February to October 2007.Many shares closed up 10 per cent – the maximum allowed under exchange rules. They included Ping An Insurance, which ended at Rmb66.78; China’s biggest listed broker Citic Securities, which closed at Rmb32; China Railway Construction at Rmb12.41; Shanghai Pudong Development Bank at Rmb29.72; and oil refiner Sinopec at Rmb11.97.”I’m sure they’re smiling in Beijing,” said David Cohen, head of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore. He noted that an earlier attempt to boost confidence this week, by slowing the flow of untraded shares onto the market, had not been successful. ”But the excitement is not over yet. Global markets still face uncertainty. I sense that Shanghai will not be immune to that.”Shanghai’s surge sent Hong Kong to a three-month high.

653;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-04-21T22:43:33Z;TI blames downturn for cautious forecast;;Texas Instruments has blamed economic uncertainty for a worse-than-expected outlook for America’s second largest chipmaker.TI had warned last month that its first-quarter revenues would be lower than expected and it followed up with a “conservative” second-quarter forecast that disappointed analysts.Its caution was a contrast to the comments of the world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, last week. Its earnings had cheered a recession-spooked Wall Street with first-quarter sales beating expectations and second-quarter forecasts also better than anticipated.Intel pointed to strength in its core PC microprocessor business. TI has been displaying weakness in its cellphone chip sales, where it has lost its number-one supplier position to Qualcomm.TI, based in Dallas, said revenues declined 8 per cent from the fourth quarter, “primarily due to weaker sales into cell phones, especially high-end cell phones”.Sales were up 3 per cent on the same quarter last year at $3.27bn, just below the mid-point of the revised range of $3.21bn to $3.35bn given in March. Earnings of 43 cents per share, excluding a 6 cents tax benefit, were in line with analyst expectations.TI last month blamed reduced demand for 3G phone chips and a “supplier transition” at Ericsson, a major customer, for its revenue disappointment. Along with Nokia, its biggest customer, Ericsson has begun a strategy of sourcing chips from a number of vendors, rather than depending almost exclusively on TI.TI predicted second-quarter revenues in the range of $3.24bn to $3.50bn and earnings per share of 42 to 48 cents. Analysts had forecast revenues of $3.32bn to $3.54bn and earnings of 44 to 51 cents.“Given uncertainty in the near-term economy, we have become more conservative with our outlook for the second quarter,” the company said.TI’s shares were down 2.5 per cent at $29.82 in after-hours trading.The company emphasised the strength of its analogue chips, which convert data back and forth from analogue to digital. It said sales were up 20 per cent year-on-year and analogue would be “a great growth opportunity for a very long time”.
654;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-04-15T18:30:14Z;Mobile sector looks to data services;;When AT&T announces its first-quarter results next Tuesday, investors will be looking for evidence that the recent surge in wireless data revenues at US telecoms companies is continuing.Revenues from wireless data services in the US rose 53 per cent to $23bn last year according to figures prepared for CTIA Wireless, a Washington-based industry trade group. Overall, revenue from e-mail, text and picture messaging, and other non-voice services accounts for about 17 per cent of total wireless revenues.US mobile network operators including AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone, are counting on growing revenues from mobile data services such as wireless e-mail, web browsing and mobile TV to offset flat, or in some cases declining, wireless voice revenues.While income from voice calls continues to make up the bulk of mobile revenues, fierce competition and an expected slowdown in subscriber growth as the percentage of the US population with a mobile phone pushes towards 100 per cent, mean that growth in mobile data is likely to become an increasingly critical measure for US carriers.Most are counting on continued growth in revenues and profits from their wireless operations to offset steeply declining revenues from residential phone lines as consumers abandon fixed-access lines.AT&T has seen its average revenue per user from data services including wireless e-mail surge, fuelled in part by the success of Apple’s iPhone, which AT&T has an exclusive right to sell in the US. Wireless data revenues at the San Antonio-based group increased 58 per cent last year and in the fourth quarter, data comprised 20 per cent of AT&T’s wireless service income, up from less than 15 per cent in the last quarter of 2006.“iPhone owners are big data users,” says Ralph de la Vega, president of AT&T’s mobile unit. During a speech to the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, he described Apple’s iPhone as “a game-changer”, noting that 95 per cent of iPhone owners regularly surfed the mobile web, even though 30 per cent had never done so before owning an iPhone.“There isn’t a device that’s easier to use,” Mr de la Vega said. “[The iPhone] proves that price resistance is only as strong as the user experience is weak.”Over half of iPhone owners have also watched videos on YouTube, fuelling growing optimism that mobile TV services including Qualcomm’s MediaFlo, which AT&T plans to launch next month, may finally take off.Like AT&T, Verizon, which reports first-quarter results later this month, is also betting mobile data services will build on the success of text messaging and wireless e-mail and drive data usage higher.Data revenues at Verizon Wireless, the second-largest US telecoms group, jumped 53 per cent jump last year and data now accounts for 21 per cent of the carrier’s wireless service revenues.Indeed, as Research in Motion, the Canadian manufacturer of the BlackBerry family of smartphones predicted, the success of the iPhone appears to have spurred consumer interest in smartphones and ‘data centric’ devices. Earlier this month, RIM said it sold a record 4.4m Blackberrys in its fiscal fourth quarter, boosting its subscriber base by 32 per cent.In the US, the number of smartphone users doubled last year to about 14.6m according to analysts at M:Metrics – much faster than the rate of growth for mobile phones generally.
655;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-04-04T20:57:44Z;Auction boosts US wireless broadband;;AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two largest US mobile operators, confirmed on Friday they would use the spectrum they won in a recent US government auction to build faster wireless broadband networks capable of delivering video and other advanced mobile services.Both companies said they planned to use the spectrum in the 700MHz band to build new 4G networks based on the LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology standard, which is rapidly emerging as the favoured next generation technology for incumbent wireless operators.The new US networks will start to be built in 2010 – about the same time that operators in Europe and Asia, including Vodafone, which also owns 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless, and China Mobile, plan similar initiatives.In the US, the coveted 700Mhz spectrum will become available in mid 2009 when TV broadcasters switch from analogue to digital transmissions. The auction of the spectrum raised $19.6bn for the US treasury and was completed last month, however the winners were restricted on discussing their plans until Friday.AT&T and Verizon Wireless won the bulk of the new licences, spending a combined $16bn. Other winners included Qualcomm, the mobile chip maker, which paid $554.6m for five licences.
656;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Infineon’s value;;Infineon, its stock down almost 70 per cent from last summer’s peak, has a market capitalisation of €3.3bn. Yet since its first set of results issued shortly after listing at the height of the technology bubble in March 2000, it has reported full-year profits just once: in 2004, the semiconductor maker produced earnings of €61m. Losses are anticipated again this year. Why is it worth so much?The answer is that the group has one good business, alongside two mediocre ones. The Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing (Aim) division generates three-quarters of group sales and has always been profitable. Number two in the global automotive chip market behind private equity-owned Freescale, it has expanded its market share for the past three years. Meanwhile, rising electronic content in cars makes this one of the fastest growing areas for semiconductors.Then there is QiMonda, and communications. The latter division has some products with promise, but has only dallied with breakeven in recent years. Optimistically, profits are at least a year away. The wireless chip market is dominated by Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. Without a serious presence in 3G, it is debateable whether Infineon’s unit is viable in the long term.QiMonda – listed separately in New York, but still 75 per cent owned by Infineon – makes D-ram memory chips, a market suffering its worst slump ever. That said, manufacturers have curbed expansion, and prices have stabilised. Recovery later this year would provide better conditions to sell off more of QiMonda.Adjust Infineon’s valuation for the market value of QiMonda. Then factor in a worst-case valuation for the communications business of zero. On that basis, Infineon trades on about one times the sales of its Aim division – relatively low for a growing semiconductor business.Reporting in dollars, Infineon has a problem in the form of a strong euro, and the management so far seems disinclined to bite the bullet on communications. But given that low multiple of sales, the question regarding Infineon’s valuation might equally be, why is it worth so little?Post and read comments on this Lex
657;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-03-17T19:05:27Z;EU backs single standard for mobile TV;;Mobile television on Monday edged closer to becoming a serious commercial reality in Europe after regulators backed a single standard for the technology.The move to endorse the Nokia and Motorola-supported DVB-H format could finally turn much-hyped mobile TV into a flourishing industry, Brussels believes.Mobile TV allows customers to receive shows such as live broadcasts, news and sports on their phone handsets and other hand-held devices, for a charge.But Italy is so far the only EU country where commercial operations are in place.Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner who is behind the regulatory push, claims that mobile TV could soon become a multi billion euro market.But consumers are wary of paying for the service, industry members say.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at research firm Gartner, adds that surveys show customers prefer to access music, rather than TV, on their phones.A planned overhaul of the radio spectrum regime is also needed to ensure mobile TV succeeds, analysts say.Access to this resource, which is becoming available as the EU moves from analogue to digital television, is required to offer widespread mobile TV services.Mrs Reding said: “For mobile TV to take off in Europe, there must first be certainty about the technology.”“An EU-wide adoption of DVB-H will provide industry with the necessary market scale to launch mass mobile tv services across the EU.”She argues that DVB-H is already the most widely use standard for mobile TV in Europe and is “between trials and commercial launch in 16 countries.”Rival systems to DVB-H include Mediaflow, provided by US group Qualcomm, and DMB, widely in use in South Korea.Critics say that Mrs Reding has failed to present enough evidence to justify backing a single standard.The UK was among countries that opposed the decision, arguing that the market should be left alone to develop.Under the move, the union’s 27 nations must promote the DVB-H standard over other systems for mobile TV.The clash over mobile TV underlines tensions over the expansion of the union’s electronic communications sector and the intense debate about how far regulation is needed to promote new services.
658;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;The CEQ on FT.com: China’s 3G adventure;;Mobile phone networks that include internet access – wireless telephony’s so-called third generation or “3G” – have been a magnet for irrational exuberance in the telecoms sector over the last decade. Despite all the hype about the “convergence” of phones and personal computers, commercially viable 3G networks have been slow to emerge.In an attempt to give Chinese telecoms equipment makers a leg up in what was expected to be a lucrative market in supplying hardware and handsets for these networks, China decided in the late 1990s to launch its own home-grown 3G technology standard.Today this techno-nationalist gambit looks increasingly like an expensive failure, and 3G mobile networks may prove as disappointing in China as everywhere else. But amid this botched effort, an unanticipated success story has emerged: Chinese telecoms equipment firms have carved out a profitable global niche for themselves selling cost-effective systems based on existing international standards.China’s 3G adventure began in the late 1990s, when the industry overlord, the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), surveyed the telecoms world and saw that it was not good. Chinese telecoms equipment makers had already spent $20bn on royalties to the holders of patents underlying first-generation mobile telephony networks (i.e., telecom equipment firms like Ericsson and Qualcomm). They were well on their way to shelling out an even more enormous sum (about $50 bn by the end of 2007) to the patent-holders controlling the dominant 2G standards, GSM and CDMA. MII concluded that the best way to end this techno-colonialism and climb the value chain would be for China to develop its own 3G standard.The stakes were high: for a patent-less equipment firm, royalty payments can reach 15% of the retail price of a 3G handset, according to an industry insider.Multiply that times half a billion handsets, and it’s easy to see the appeal of a domestic standard.The Chinese standard’s underlying technology, developed by state-owned Datang Telecom Technology, is fundamentally solid. But Chinese equipment manufacturers lacked experience developing a new standard from scratch. Even with help from outside firms like Siemens, which has participated in developing the standard, a process that ought to have taken four or five years is still grinding on in year 10. Meanwhile, the European and American 3G standards – WCDMA and CDMA2000 – reached technical maturity and commercial deployment.According to Beijing, technical setbacks to the home-grown standard are not to blame for the delay in issuing 3G licenses. Instead, MII claims that 3G networks around the world have proved expensive failures. Until there is a proven 3G business model, it says, there is no reason to issue licenses.The explanation is self-serving but also contains more than a grain of truth. The global wireless revolution that 3G was supposed to usher in has not materialized. In 2000, European wireless carriers spent a whopping $129bn for 3G spectrum licenses alone, an investment now widely viewed as a debacle.The big reason that 3G hasn’t taken off is that internet users are now accustomed to the speeds they enjoy with broadband connections on their PCs. They are reluctant to pay hefty fees for more sluggish 3G data services. This may be an insuperable technological barrier for 3G: CDMA, the basic technology underlying all 3G standards, was originally designed for voice, not data, so there are limits to the web-browsing and download speeds of any 3G service.At UK-based Vodafone, whose equity interests in 25 countries make it the world’s second-largest mobile telecom carrier behind China Mobile, data services (excluding short messages) accounted for just 6% of total revenues in the year to September.Regardless of how well the Chinese 3G standard fares in China, it is now virtually certain that MII’s dreams of Chinese equipment manufacturers marketing the Chinese standard abroad will not be realised. This is not necessarily bad news for the Chinese industry. MII exaggerated the ability of domestic equipment manufacturers to establish a new wireless standard for the world. But it vastly underrated those same firms’ ability to grab global market share using established standards.In recent years, China’s top two telecoms equipment firms, Huawei and ZTE, have enjoyed spectacular revenue growth from contracts to install or upgrade traditional wireless networks in international markets. Nearly two-thirds of Huawei’s revenue now comes from outside China, in markets as diverse as Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Colombia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. In the first half of 2007, foreign revenues accounted for 48% of ZTE’s revenues, up from 15% in 2004.Chinese telecoms firms still ring up most of their sales in the more price-conscious developing world, but their mere presence trims margins even in rich countries. Network operators in Europe and North America cite price quotes from Chinese manufacturers in negotiations with their top-tier western rivals.Moreover, the Chinese advantage is not all about price. Five years ago, Huawei mainly sold copycat versions of international vendors’ costlier equipment. Today its equipment boasts unique proprietary features.The lesson of the success of Huawei and ZTE is that innovation and the profits that flow from it are not usually a matter of producing a radically new technical standard or technological breakthrough. The most lucrative innovations are those that deploy existing technology in ways that better meet the needs of the market.
659;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-02-12T22:44:58Z;Battle lines drawn for the future of 4G;;A key battle that could determine the shape of next-generation 4G wireless broadband networks across the globe is playing out behind the scenes at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona this week where the backers of competing standards including WiMax and LTE (Long Term Evolution) are rallying supporters.At stake is a potentially huge market for 4G telecoms equipment and services that could dwarf the market to date for 3G technology.Now, as consumer demand for higher speed mobile data services, especially video, accelerates, and mobile network operators look for ways to cut costs and accelerate the adoption of data, incumbent carriers and opportunistic new entrants alike are beginning to line up behind one 4G standard.In the last few weeks AT&T, the US telecommunications group, has thrown its weight behind LTE, joining Verizon Wireless, the US joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group.On Wednesday, China Mobile is expected to join the LTE camp.Meanwhile, a handful of leading carriers including Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US carrier, and most recently KDDI in Japan are committed to roll out wireless broadband networks this year based on WiMax technology, which was initially pushed by a consortium led by Intel, the US chipmaker, Motorola and others including Korea’s Samsung.In total, there are an estimated 300 WiMax trials and deployments – including many in emerging markets – under way, of which about 120 are designated mobile deployments rather than fixed WiMax, which effectively replaced a DSL broadband link with a wireless connection. In Barcelona this week, all the leading telecoms infrastructure vendors are showing off their WiMax kit, including the base stations needed to build a network and the end user devices such as handsets, mobile internet devices WiMax PC Cards and USB modems that plug into laptops and will enable them to connect wirelessly to the internet at broadband speeds.“This is a big year for WiMax because the first real products are coming to market,” said Sean Maloney, general manager of Intel’s sales and marketing group and the senior Intel executive to champion the chipmaker’s WiMax initiative.WiMax, which is also known as 802.16 and is a close cousin of the 802.11x technology that powers WiFi hotspots, won early backing from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers international standards body but was endorsed by the International Telecommunications Union, the standard-setting body for the global telecoms industry, in October.The ITU’s endorsement is significant because it ensures that WiMax – which has its roots in the computer industry rather than the telecoms sector – has emerged as a viable alternative to LTE and UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) another 4G standard backed primarily by Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chipmaker, which has so far failed to attract much support.Inevitably, the existence of rival 4G standards has led to a battle of words between proponents – in particular about the relative costs and advantages of deploying different 4G technologies.A key advantage for WiMax is that it is ready for deployment, whereas even LTE’s most ardent supporters accept the technology will not be ready for commercial deployment before the end of 2009.That could give carriers such as Sprint Nextel and KDDI a key time-to-market advantage. Nevertheless, all the leading telecommunications equipment makers – most of which back both WiMax and LTE – are racing to ready LTE equipment and several, including Alcatel-Lucent and Nortel have been demonstrating live LTE systems in Barcelona.Nokia, led by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, is another high-profile supporter.As Patricia Russo, Alcatel-Lucent’s chief executive, acknowledged on Tuesday, the possibility of accelerating LTE’s development was the key factor behind the decision announced on Tuesday by Alcatel-Lucent and NEC to pool their LTE resources in a new joint venture.Both Alcatel-Lucent and NEC held out the possibility that the joint venture would cover other technologies, including WiMax, which could potentially lead to a converging of the two standards – something operators would likely welcome.In fact, in spite of their differences, LTE and WiMax share much of the same technology underpinnings. Both are flat IP (Internet Protocol) technologies which makes them ideal for integration with carriers’ fixed-line IP backbones. “Eighty per cent of technology in LTE and WiMax is the same,” says Daniel Moloney, executive vice-president of Motorola’s home and networks mobility unit. In theory, that should make it easier to unify the two standards, but industry insiders caution that no one should hold their breath because this requires rival standards bodies to work together. “It is a political rather than technology issue,” says Intel’s Mr Maloney.
660;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-02-11T10:20:19Z;Perspectives: The dangers of too much distributed intelligence;;"Steve Jobs and Apple are past masters at polarising opinion. Take the latest MacBook laptop, the ultra-thin “Air”. Supporters admire its slim good looks; detractors marvel at Jobs’ chutzpah in promoting less as more.One wag, writing online, predicts a future product launch in which Jobs strides on stage bearing nothing more than an elegantly designed USB cable to rapturous applause from the faithful.The launch of Air raises an interesting question, however. Its design philosophy means there is no optical drive, no firewire port and no Ethernet jack. There is simply not the room to incorporate them. How minimalistic can a computer be and still be acceptable to buyers whether corporate or domestic?In an interview in this edition of Digital Business, for example, Paul Jacobs, chief executive of the mobile device development group Qualcomm, discusses research the company is undertaking which will lead to cell phones capable of performing, after a keyboard and screen have been connected, as a fully featured computer.Conventional wisdom has it that computers are becoming so small and powerful that they will be ubiquitous, conferring “intelligence” and memory on all kinds of currently dumb objects.However, the dangers of too much distributed intelligence and memory are already obvious: computer discs bearing confidential information go astray; laptops and mobile phones are lost or stolen; memory devices with the capacity to store a company’s entire database are readily available at little cost.Information systems managers are already protecting their data by installing the modern equivalent of the original mainframe: intelligence at the centre linked to dumb terminals – thin clients, although not necessarily thin in the MacBook Air sense – at the periphery. The aim is to shut the door on any possible misuse of corporate information.Fredrik Linaker, a research manager in the consultancy Accenture’s Sophia Antipolis laboratories in France, faced a different problem. Software capable of sophisticated speech and image recognition was available but the calculations were too much for the computing power in a mobile phone.He had been working on a mapping robot, a wheeled, visual device capable of making its way around a building and registering the equipment it recognised there – telephones and furniture, for example – for insurance purposes.The robot’s visual system was up to the job of pattern recognition, but the computing load was significant. First, one laptop was attached to handle the computations, then another. By the time the third laptop had been added, the physical load was more of a problem than the computing load.Mr Linaker’s solution was to use the video transmission capability in smart mobile phones and the 3G network. The images captured by the robot could be transmitted over the 3G network using the built-in video calling facility to a powerful computer based elsewhere for processing.Video calling has been available in European mobile phones for years but is not hugely popular.This inspired Mr Linaker to devise a new product combining the pattern recognition and video transmission capabilities of the mobile phone with the power of the supercomputer.The result is a kind of pocket encyclopaedia, a mobile phone capable of recognising and analysing complex images and providing information about them.“Say you are looking at a painting,” Mr Linaker says “Point the cell phone at the painting and you can quickly receive on the screen information about the painting – who the artist is and some historical details.” Add speech synthesis and you have a device which could greatly benefit the blind or poorly sighted.A prototype exists and Mr Linaker says it will not be long before a commercial product is available. Apart from consumer uses as, for example, a pocket tourist or supermarket guide, he thinks it will find a diversity of business applications.One interesting example is a device to help new employees find and identify specialist manufacturing tools from a shared toolset. Experienced engineers have no problem recognising the best tool for the job; for novices it is more of a problem. As the tools are mostly made of metal, RFID tags may not be suitable.Variations on the Accenture theme are being researched by a number of organisations including Hewlett-Packard and Nokia – whose system depends on location as well as pattern recognition.The drawback, of course, to universal thin clients is the load on the network. Mr Linaker claims his system can recognise an image and send back information about it in a second or less; but that means transmitting a huge amount of data in both directions.Today’s networks are not up to this kind of challenge. It will take further excursions up the electromagnetic spectrum to provide the needed bandwidth.For the moment, then, conventional wisdom would seem to hold the winning hand and thin computing will be synonymous with the MacBook Air – providing it doesn’t join the remote control down the back of the sofa."

These include a major expansion of its 3G network to enable it to cover nearly 350 leading US markets by the end of 2008.
662;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;ARM holds on to its lossmaker;;"Shares in ARM Holdings lost a fifth of their value on Tuesday after the microchip designer revealed a 15 per cent fall in overall profits and a sharp decline in sales at its physical intellectual property division.ARM, which designs chips used in mobile phones and iPods, bought Artisan for $913m in 2004, but has had to spend more time and money turning it round than anticipated. It revealed that revenues at the physical IP division had fallen to $19.5m (£9.9m) in the fourth quarter, 30 per cent down from the same period a year ago.The division accounts for just 17 per cent of Arm’s overall revenues but is acting as a drag on overall performance. Shareholders are questioning the wisdom of the acquisition.However, any disposal of the unit would probably come at a considerable loss. The business is worth half what ARM paid for Artisan, analysts estimate.Warren East, chief executive, would not rule out a disposal “in due course” if the division failed to perform, but insisted it was
still at an early stage of a turnround strategy of four to six years.In September the company sent Simon Segars, an executive and board member, to California to oversee the division.The physical IP division provides libraries of components used in computer chips. As chips become more complicated, ARM believes, more microprocessor makers will want to buy in ready-made components to speed up the design process.But Artisan’s technology lagged behind the rest of the industry and ARM has had to plough huge resources into catching up.It has yet to win one of the big three semiconductor makers – Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Broadcom – as clients for the division.Overall revenues for 2007 fell 2 per cent to £259.2m, mainly because of the weakening of the dollar against sterling.On a dollar basis revenues grew 6 per cent and Mr East said growth would be at similar levels for 2008. But this estimate is far below analysts’ consensus of 15 per cent growth for the current year.Pre-tax profits fell from £57m to £48.2m and earnings per share emerged at 2.7p (3.2p). The shares dropped 20 per cent to 94¼p, their lowest level since the end of 2004."

664;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-01-23T20:05:50Z;Motorola falls 20% on loss warning;;Motorola, the struggling US mobile phone maker, saw its shares plunge more than 20 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, after it warned it would slip to a loss in the current quarter and reported an 84 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits.Profits were $100m on revenues down 18 per cent at $9.65bn, reflecting slippage in market share amid tough competition.The dismal results and outlook raise the possibility of another campaign against Motorola by Carl Icahn, the activist investor who owns a significant stake in the company.In October, Mr Icahn told the FT that “there is value there, and if that value doesn’t manifest itself I, as an activist, would think very seriously about coming back”.Greg Brown, Motorola’s new chief executive, acknowledged the problems at the company but said he would take whatever steps were necessary to turn the mobile devices division around.“We face stiff winds. Demand for some of our products has slowed,” said Mr Brown, who was chief operating officer before taking over from Ed Zander at the end of December. “Our focus has to be on profitability. We are focused on aggressively rationalising the company’s cost structure and working to get mobile devices back on track.”Mr Brown said Motorola’s share of the global mobile phone market, which slipped to about 12.4 per cent by the end of the fourth quarter from a peak of about 23 per cent a year earlier, will probably fall further.Motorola, until recently the second-largest mobile phone maker behind Finland’s Nokia, has slipped to number three behind Samsung after a series of missteps including the lack of attractive and low-cost 3G handsets – something the company is trying to fix in part through a new chip supply agreement with Qualcomm, announced on Wednesday.“The recovery in mobile devices will take longer than expected and there is a lot more work to be done,” Mr Brown said.Motorola’s mobile business began its plunge last year, having run into trouble after failing to reproduce the success of its ultra-thin Razr model. Management has restructured the business, cutting 7,500 jobs and seeking to reduce costs and boost margins. In spite of this, Motorola expects a first-quarter loss from continuing operations of $0.05 to $0.07 per share, excluding charges.
665;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-01-23T01:58:55Z;Texas boosted by analogue products;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, saw strength in its analogue and digital signal processing semiconductors in the fourth quarter, producing revenues in line with Wall Street expectations.Dallas-based TI reported revenues of $3.56bn, slightly below the $3.58bn midpoint of its updated forecast in December.Earnings per share of 54 cents, which included a one-cent tax benefit, were slightly ahead of the analyst consensus of 52 cents, surveyed by Reuters Estimates.Shares rose 2 per cent in after-hours trading to $29.57 on the news. They are down 13 per cent this month and have fallen by 24 per cent in the past six months as TI has been overtaken by Qualcomm as the leading maker of mobile phone chips.TI makes chips for a wide range of industries, from automotive to consumer electronics, and has sought to emphasise the growth of its analogue chips in converting sound and pictures into digital information.“Most important to our future performance, we sharpened our focus on analogue with increases in dedicated research and development, sales support and manufacturing capacity,” said Rich Templeton, chief executive.He said TI expected year-over-year growth to accelerate in 2008 in its semiconductor operations.Fourth-quarter revenues were up 3 per cent on the same quarter in 2006. Sales of digital signal processors and high-performance analogue products were up 12 per cent.Compared with the third quarter, revenues were down 3 per cent due to the expected seasonal decline in sales of its famous graphing calculators.The company said it expected revenues of $3.27bn to $3.55bn in the first quarter and earnings per share in the range of 43-49 cents.Analysts were expecting first-quarter earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $3.41bn, according to Reuters Estimates.Tech blog: Electronic Arts pursues the casual gamer
666;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;I-mate hoists ‘For Sale’ notice;;I-mate has put itself up for sale after further problems with its suppliers resulted in a second heavy profit warning this financial year.The Dubai-based mobile phone maker said a main chip supplier, believed to be Qualcomm, had failed to supply manufacturers with the required volume of chips over the quarter.The same supplier also lost a recent court ruling over intellectual property infringements resulting in I-mate being unable to sell its full range of devices in the US, it said.The shares slumped 12¾p to a record low of 20¾p, a far cry from the listing price of 210p in 2005.I-mate forecast the impact on sales to be “material” in the final quarter to the end of March.Jim Morrison, chief executive, said that while I-mate had devices that were not dependent on the chip set, “it has a significant impact on the range of product we have to sell. We have no alternative but to review the strategic options for the company at this time”.The warning came less than a month after interim results and was the second significant downgrade to 2007-08 earnings. The shares halved a year ago when I-mate warned manufacturing supply problems would significantly hit earnings for the next two financial years.The group had raised £35m ($68.6m) on the market in 2005 for its mobile e-mail and phone device, occasionally dubbed the “MacBerry” after Mr Morrison’s Scottish roots.The group was founded by Mr Morrison, former head of technology development at 02 Mobile when it was part of BT. Nevertheless, I-mate has struggled and seen four financial officers in three years.FT Comment● With another disastrous warning, I-mate’s time on the public market appears to be coming to an end. The City has lost confidence and a sale seems the only viable option. After the first warning, I-mate was effectively restarting from scratch. With little record or brand to leverage, the cash pile will form the basis for valuation. But I-mate has been burning through its cash, which has fallen from $68.5m (£35m) in March to $53.5m in September. Cazenove estimated the latter equated to 22p a share. After further write-offs and delayed sales, next March’s figure will be lower still. There could be a premium for I-mate’s potential and relationship with Microsoft but it is unlikely to fetch more than 20p a share.

If Android (Google’s mobile phone software) is to have life he will need airwaves to ride on, and Verizon’s grand promise last year to open its network to all-comers still feels far too vague. Google must now show whether it is ready to put its money where its mouth is.Not many surprises jump out of the FCC’s list of 214 qualified bidders, not least because many are shell companies whose real backers are not immediately obvious. Qualcomm is there, as is Chevron (perhaps looking to create a network for remote oilfield monitoring.) Otherwise AT&T and Verizon lead the cast of wireless and cable companies that have jumped the FCC’s pre-auction hurdles.One name that failed to make the list: Frontline Wireless, a company backed by former FCC chairman Reed Hundt and venture capitalist John Doerr. This is a big loss of face for both men. Frontline used its considerable lobbying power to persuade the FCC to set aside part of the spectrum aside for a joint commercial/ emergency service network. Frontier itself planned to bid for this, but last week conceded that it had failed to raise the money to bid and was shutting up shop. Let’s hope the rest of this widely-anticipated auction fares better.
668;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2008-01-02T22:14:28Z;Wall St start to new year worst in 25 years;;US blue-chip stocks on Wednesday suffered the worst start to a new year in 25 years after an index of manufacturing fell sharply, raising fears that the US economy is slowing more than expected.Energy stocks were a lone bright spot as crude oil prices touched $100 a barrel, but the spike in crude accentuated selling of a broad range of transport and industrial companies. Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices. The shares fell 4.9 per cent to $25.35 and 4.8 per cent to $7.14 respectively. The PHLX semiconductor sector index lost 2.9 per cent to 396.34.Also in the chip sector Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $38.39 after it said it expected an “immediate short-term impact” from a court ruling that it must halt chip sales that infringe patents belonging to Broadcom. Broadcom gained 1.5 per cent to $26.52.Amazon outperformed after Citigroup told investors to buy the shares citing expectations of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures. The stock fell 5.7 per cent to $19.31.Shares in Industrial companies declined after the ISM report and as Citi downgraded Textron, the industrial conglomerate, to “hold” from “buy”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $66.81.Financials fell heavily as National City said it would slash its dividend by almost 50 per cent and that it planned to raise more capital to cope with credit market turmoil. The shares dropped 5.3 per cent to $15.59. The S&P investment bank index shed 3.5 per cent with Morgan Stanley, down 4.1 per cent at $50.95 and Lehman Brothers, 5 per cent weaker at $62.19.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, rose 7.3 per cent to $52.39, the best performer on the S&P, as gold prices surged to a record high.As oil prices rose, energy stocks benefited.

669;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm warns of injunction setback;;Qualcomm, the leading chipset supplier for mobile phones, warned on Wednesday its customers would suffer from court injunctions obtained by rival Broadcom.A federal judge in California ruled on Monday that Qualcomm should no longer sell chipsets for third-generation WCDMA phones that infringed a Broadcom patent for high-resolution video encoding.The injunction, with immediate effect, could affect handset-makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung, which import phones with Qualcomm chips, as well as Motorola, its main US customer.Qualcomm on Wednesday announced the availability of new WCDMA chipsets designed to comply with the ruling. It said it expected they would appear in handsets before the end of the first calendar quarter.Sanjay Jha, chief operating officer, told an analyst conference call that new customers had already started working with the products so would suffer minimal impact from the injunction.But he added: “Clearly, there is a short-term impact on existing customers from this transition.”Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said: “Other companies are going to use this court order to gain some competitive advantage, but this is not going to distract us…I’m confident we’ll overcome this latest challenge.”Qualcomm could seek a stay of the injunction and, failing that, appeal. The judge also issued injunctions regarding chipsets he said infringed two other Broadcom patents. But he allowed them to continue to be sold until January 31 2009, provided that Qualcomm paid royalties to its rival.Richard Windsor, communication equipment analyst with Nomura, said the rulings were substantially more severe than expected and estimates for Qualcomm were likely to fall.Separately, Sprint Nextel said on Wednesday it does not expect any delay to its plan to launch QChat, a walkie-talkie cell phone service, despite a court ruling against QChat developer Qualcomm, reports Reuters.”We’re pleased the judge did not issue an immediate injunction on the patent related to QChat technology and we do not anticipate any interruption and delay in QChat deployment due to this dispute,” Matthew Sullivan, Sprint spokesman, said.”We’re still assessing the impact but at this time we think all our handset providers will be covered by the sunset provision,” Mr Sullivan said.
670;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-12-20T21:50:20Z;Tech sector rallies after Oracle calms concerns;;"Wall Street stocks posted modest gains on Thursday with technology stocks leading the pack after strong quarterly results at Oracle helped allay fears of a slowdown in corporate tech spending.However, the major equities seesawed throughout the day after MBIA, a bond insurer, said it had billions of dollars in exposure to high-risk securities, stoking credit market fears.Financials were a weak point after Bear Stearns fell to a big loss and made more mortgage-related writedowns. Meanwhile, a gauge of future economic growth fell to its lowest level in two years and a measure of regional manufacturing activity contracted sharply.In a choppy session, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent in early trade, then fell into negative territory, before closing 0.5 per cent higher at 1,455.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 13,245.64, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.5 per cent at 2,640.86.“Nothing seems able to push the market up [much] because we have these daily torpedoes with respect to credit,” Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said.MBIA’s shares fell 26.2 per cent to $19.95 after it revealed $30.6bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations, including $8.1bn of high-risk securities known as “CDO-squared”.Fitch Ratings put MBIA on watch for a possible credit rating cut and gave the company four to six weeks to find $1bn to shore up its capital reserves. A downgrade of a top monoline like MBIA could trigger severe stress in credit markets and potentially huge losses on insured securities.“MBIA simply did not disclose arguably the riskiest parts of its CDO portfolio to investors,” an analyst at Morgan Stanley said. The cost of insuring MBIA’s debt soared.News of the disclosure came a day after Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on several bond insurers, including MBIA, to “negative” – meaning a downgrade is more likely – and cut one, ACA Financial Guaranty, to junk.Bear Stearns fell to a $854m loss in the fourth quarter, the first deficit in the investment bank’s history and much worse than analysts had anticipated.Mortgage-related writedowns totalled $1.9bn, $700m more than previously advised, and the company posted negative net revenue of $379m, compared with $2.4bn a year ago. The shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $91.42, but are down 44 per cent this year.Bear’s results followed a terrible quarter for Morgan Stanley, which also fell to its first loss after taking a total of $9.4bn in mortgage-related writedowns.There was better news from technology giant Oracle, which increased second-quarter profit 35 per cent to $1.3bn, helped by a jump in software licence sales. Revenues increased 28 per cent to $5.3bn.The results beat expectations and the shares rose 6.5 per cent to $22.10 after several analysts raised their target prices on the stock.Oracle’s results provided support to a range of large-cap technology stocks including IBM, up 1.6 per cent at $108.84, and Microsoft, 2.1 per cent higher at $35.52. Qualcomm, the wireless chip developer, rose 2.2 per cent to $39.12 after it raised its fiscal first quarter profit outlook.Technology was among the best-returning sectors this year, but confidence wobbled in recent weeks after Cisco’s chief executive cautioned about prospects for sales to financial companies. After the market closed Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handheld e-mail device, said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $370.5m.The shares closed up 4.8 per cent at $106.99 and climbed another 6.7 per cent after-hours.The transport sector had another disappointing day after FedEx, the logistics company that is seen by many investors as an
economic bellwether, rep-orted a fall in second-quarter earnings from $511m to $479m.While that beat expectations, the company’s third-quarter guidance was below analysts’ forecasts and FedEx also cut its fiscal 2008 capital expenditure forecast. The shares fell 1.1 per cent to $93.63.Retail stocks were also sold after Rite Aid, the pharmacy chain, posted a wider-than-expected $84.8m quarterly loss. The shares fell 31.7 per cent to $2.80."
671;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Trade commission rules in Nokia’s favour;;Nokia won a legal victory on Wednesday in its long-running cross-licensing dispute with Qualcomm, the biggest mobile phone chipmaker, after a US trade judge ruled it had not infringed on three of the chipmaker’s patents.Qualcomm had filed a complaint to the International Trade Commission - which determines whether imports unfairly injure US companies - in June 2006. It asked the ITC to ban the importation of the infringing technology, which controls signal power to mobile phones.The case has been part of the legal pressure exerted by Qualcomm to persuade Nokia to agree to licensing fees for Qualcomm-patented technology in 3G phones. Nokia has argued it should pay less than for previous generation handsets.Nokia has also countered with its own patent-infringement complaint to the ITC, but it was rejected.The companies’ cross-licensing agreement expired in April, but Nokia paid $20m in royalties in the second-quarter to cover payments. Qualcomm called it insufficient.Rick Simonson, Nokia chief financial officer, applauded Wednesday’s decision.He described it as important for the whole telecoms industry, saying Qualcomm was “stuck in the past”, trying to transfer its rights under the 2G CDMA technology to 3G’s W-CDMA, “where it is one contributor amongst many.”Qualcomm officials were unavailable for immediate comment.Qualcomm has said mounting legal fees will affect its profitability as it fights a number of patent cases with Nokia and its chip rival Broadcom.Wednesday’s decision could still be overturned by the ITC. Qualcomm said it would petition for a review, with a decision expected by next April.
672;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Mobile handset boosts TI;;Texas Instruments indicated a stronger-than-expected end to the year for mobile handset makers as it raised the lower end of its revenue estimates for the fourth quarter.TI, which makes a range of chips for mobile phones, said it expected revenues of between $3.5bn and $3.66bn in the fourth quarter, compared to its estimate of $3.4bn to $3.68bn given in October at its third-quarter results presentation.“Wireless customers were projecting [in October] that demand for the month of December would decline compared to October and November,” Ron Slaymaker, head of TI investor relations, told an analyst conference call Monday.“But now they can see the levels sustaining through the month of December.”TI’s biggest customer is Nokia, the number one handset maker.TI predicted in October the slowing down of a 3G phone programme by another customer, Ericsson, would be a second contributing factor to a seasonally weaker fourth quarter.Shares in TI rose nearly 5 per cent to $34.19 in after-hours trading on the improved forecast. The Dallas-based company’s position as the leading maker of mobile phone chips has been challenged this year by Qualcomm, as handset makers have sought to diversify in their choice of suppliers.The iSuppli research firm is putting Qualcomm ahead of TI this year with its prediction of a 24 per cent increase in mobile phone revenues to $5.6bn. It expects TI, which makes chips for a number of other industries, to record a 3.4 per cent decline in global semiconductor revenues. TI said Monday it expected earnings per share of 50-54 cents in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous range of 48-54 cents.
673;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-12-04T01:00:49Z;Taiwan betting on WiMax to win hotspot status;;Five young people are gathered in a cosy room in front of a big flat-screen television nursing mugs of coffee. But the group, engineers at D-Link, Taiwan’s largest networking gear maker, are not at home but at work.With tools and boxes with flashing green lights scattered on the couch and carpet, they are testing equipment for WiMax, an emerging fourth-generation mobile networking standard.While Taiwanese companies are the main suppliers of networking gear, with global market shares expected to reach between 80 and 95 per cent this year for products such as modems and switches, they have long been followers in terms of technology. The island’s government is betting on WiMax to change that.Asia was the earliest commercial adopter of the WiMax standard, with South Korea the first country to set up wireless “hotspots” thanks to heavy backing from Samsung. In Japan, mobile phone operators and their partners are jockeying to win two WiMax licences which will be awarded by the government by the end of the year. Taiwan has already handed out six WiMax licences and operators are due to start services by the end of 2008.It is far from certain whether WiMax and its backers – grouped around major industry players such as Intel, Sprint Nextel and Nokia – will prevail in making the technology the mainstream standard of the next generation of mobile broadband communications. However, Asia is investing heavily in WiMax research and infrastructure in the hope that its electronics makers can define technology standards, rather than just using those set by others.“That would help our corporate sector generate more income from intellectual property,” says Hsieh Ching-tarng, an official at Taiwan’s Committee of Communications Industry Development. Taiwan plans total investments of $664m (£322m) in WiMax development over the next two years.Companies such as Fujitsu and NEC in Tokyo, which have faced declining profitability in recent years due to intense competition from Asian competitors, are working to promote the usage of WiMax chips. Fujitsu has made a specific commitment to do part of the development work for its WiMax chips in Taiwan.In Taiwan, hardware companies such as D-Link, Zyxel, Gemtek and Alpha Networks would benefit from a shift to WiMax, according to a report by Merrill Lynch.Some analysts warn that it is too early to tell who will win the global battle to develop the next-generation mobile standard.Qualcomm, the chip design house that dominates third-generation mobile technology, is promoting its Ultra Mobile Broadband as a rival to WiMax.Sprint Nextel’s termination of an agreement with Clearwire to build a WiMax network in the US, dealt a blow to the technological standard. This was compounded by an announcement by Verizon, the US’s second-largest operator, that it would start trials for Long Term Evolution, its rival standard backed by a group of other operators and hardware vendors.Although WiMax technology is still under development, companies are already reaping benefits from the global push for a next-generation wireless standard. According to the Market Intelligence Center, an IT research group, Taiwanese companies will ship WiMax gear worth $159m this year, up from $22.6m in 2006.And since mobile WiMax technology was designated as a 3G mobile technology in October by the International Telecommunication Union – a big boost for the standard – Samsung in Korea has actively expanded its mobile WiMax device portfolio.Korea Telecom, the country’s largest fixed-line carier, and SK Telecom, the largest wireless operator, have been offering commercial mobile WiMax services since June 2006, and together have more than 83,000 subscribers enjoying multimedia communications on the move in the Seoul metropolitan area.“The WiMax gear business will experience enormous growth as we might see up to $75bn in global investment in WiMax networks between 2007 and 2012,” says Welber Chang, an analyst at Market Intelligence. He assumes that $3bn of that investment will be made by Taiwanese operators.
674;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-11-29T20:05:27Z;Verizon set to begin trials of 4G network;;Qualcomm and Intel were dealt a blow on Thursday when Verizon Wireless, the second largest US mobile phone operator, said it would start trials in 2008 of a rival fourth-generation network standard.Verizon is backing the Long Term Evolution standard, which is being developed by suppliers including Ericsson, Sony-Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola, Nokia-Siemens and Nortel, dubbed the Third Generation Partnership Project. This grouping also includes mobile operators Vodafone, China Mobile, Orange and T-Mobile.Qualcomm’s patents have dominated third-generation (3G) networks with their CDMA 2000 and W-CDMA standards and the company is pushing its Ultra Mobile Broadband as a 4G successor. 4G networks will offer much faster web-surfing speeds.To date, UMB has failed to attract the support of a big operator. WiMax, another competing 4G technology, backed by Intel, suffered a blow this month when Sprint Nextel, the US’s number three mobile operator, terminated an agreement to build a US national network with Clearwire Communications.LTE is an evolution of the Europe-centric GSM standard. AT&T, the largest US carrier, has said it expects to migrate to LTE from its GSM-based networks.Verizon Wireless’ current networks, both 2G and 3G, are CDMA-based, so the switch by Qualcomm’s biggest US customer to the rival GSM technology is a big blow to the chipmaker.Vodafone, which owns 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless, welcomed the move. It will allow the two companies to offer a unified service, resolving long-standing incompatibilities between the two operators.4G networks are not expected to be deployed until well into the next decade.Richard Lynch, Verizon’s chief technology officer, said LTE was part of the company’s vision of pervasive wireless connectivity linked to “a host of new devices and applications, and …embedded wireless in virtually every piece of electronics you buy”.Perry LaForge, executive director of the CDMA Development Group, said: “3G CDMA services will remain the dominant generation of mobile communications services long into the future.”Qualcomm could still hope to benefit from the wide-scale adoption of LTE through patents it acquired in the $805m acquisition of Flarion Technologies last year.www.ft.com/gapperblog
675;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-11-08T23:52:17Z;Qualcomm hit by Nokia fallout;;Qualcomm, the biggest mobile phone chipmaker, reported record sales and profits for its 2007 fiscal year but its forecasts disappointed Wall Street as it excluded possible revenues from Nokia.Qualcomm shares fell 8.5 per cent in extended trading in New York to $36.35.The San Diego-based company has been involved in lawsuits with Nokia in a number of countries over royalty rates for licensing Qualcomm patents for third-generation phones.The group said it had not been recording royalty revenues attributable to Nokia’s sales since April, pending a resolution of the dispute. No progress had been made, the company said.It estimated Nokia would have to pay the equivalent of 25 to 30 cents of diluted earnings per share in royalties in fiscal 2008 but excluded this from its guidance.Steve Altman, president, also criticised Broadcom, its wireless chip rival. The International Trade Commission imposed a ban on the US importation of Qualcomm’s 3G chips earlier this year after it found that they infringed a Broadcom patent.The two companies have been unable to reach a settlement. Mr Altman said Broadcom had criticised Qualcomm for high royalty rates but was asking for $6 a chip itself for the licensing of one patent.Qualcomm spent about $200m fighting legal battles in its fiscal year ending on September 30.It predicted that its total costs would increase by 4 cents a share in the current fiscal year as it also provided financial support to partners and tried to minimise disruption to them from litigation.The company reported fourth-quarter revenues of $2.31bn, up 15 per cent year-on-year, and earnings, excluding certain items, of $911m, or 54 cents a share, up 29 per cent. It also forecast first-quarter earnings of 50 to 52 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 53 cents.
676;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-11-06T21:15:37Z;Will Android be Google’s transformer?;;"Google and its 33 partners in the Open Handset Alliance are betting that together they can reshape the mobile phone industry by offering a free Linux-based mobile phone operating system and software ""stack"" dubbed Android.The alliance, whose members include leading handset manufacturers, chipmakers and mobile carriers, has big ambitions, but can it succeed where so many previous efforts have foundered?“The telecoms landscape is littered with failed or wobbly alliances and overlapping initiatives,” says Martin Garner, mobile practice leader at Ovum, the specialist telecoms consultancy. “Most of the players in the alliance have plenty of first hand experience in this and, being cynical for a moment, it costs a vendor very little at this stage to join the alliance and say nice things about it.”Yankee Group, a US-based research firm, says: “Taken alone, there is nothing fundamentally unique or new about the Alliance. It is reminiscent of other structures such as the Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) initiative, Mobile Services Architecture (MSA), and several Linux-oriented initiatives. “Indeed, among the big five global mobile handset makers – Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, LG Electronics and Sony Ericsson - Motorola alone has had some success delivering high-volume Linux-based devices such as the Ming, designed for the Chinese market and the recently launched RAZR II.Most mobile Linux initiatives have failed to attract the broad support of third party developers needed to ensure success in a fiercely competitive market dominated by a handful of well entrenched operating system suppliers with close alliances to both handset makers and mobile operators.Even in the small but rapidly growing smartphone market segment – likely to be the initial target for the Alliance hardware partners – Android will be competing against a formidable array of competitors including Nokia’s S60 mobile applications platform that runs on the Symbian operating system, Microsoft’s Windows Mobile platform which the US software giant has spent more than five years refining, and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry ecosystem.About 145m of the 1.1bn mobile phones sold around the world this year will be smartphones, according to estimates by Nomura. Of these, slightly more than half will run the Symbian operating system, with 10 per cent based on Windows Mobile and 26 per cent using Qualcomm’s Brew software. For now, Linux makes up only 5 per cent of the market.Uniquely however, the Alliance partners are promising that Android will be both ""open"" and free to developers and will include almost the entire applications-related software ""stack,"" less key technical pieces such as telephony protocol stacks, which are left to silicon vendors. In other words, Android is designed to be a complete off-the-shelf bundle of the critical software components including the core Linux ""kernel"" that smartphone manufacturers need to power their devices.If it plan succeeds, Android could pose a real threat to the existing smartphone operating system vendors. ”Clearly, this is a threat to Microsoft from the platform side,” said Charlie Golvin, a Forrester analyst. Mr Golvin believes the three main mobile operating systems will eventually be left standing: Symbian, a Linux software stack based on Android, and Microsoft’s Windows, though Windows will be largely limited to the enterprise market.Predictably perhaps, Scott Rockfeld, group product manager for Windows Mobile, disagrees. “[Will Linux cramp the market for Microsoft?] ”Absolutely not,” he says. “The entire pie is growing.” He notes that Windows Mobile sold 11m licences in the year to July, a figure he predicts will rise to 20m in the current 12 month period.”The Open Handset Alliance is a dream scenario, where everyone will work together, no one will be greedy and software will be free. It is not going to happen,” said Per Lindberg, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. “Motorola and Samsung are not really going to start sharing software. But what will happen is that Google’s search, maps, email and other applications will be pre-installed on a lot of phones.”Others point out that much of what Google has announced is reminiscent of Nokia’s efforts over the last few years with its Series 60 software which is open to third party developers and has enabled the mobile phone giant to attract an extensive developer ecosystem.Many analysts see Google’s mobile plans as merely fragmenting an already divided market further. But that itself could pose a challenge to Nokia. ”Nokia is the market leader - it is the preferred supplier to almost all operators. It will be impossible to maintain this position if the market fragments,” said Mr Lindberg.In addition, experts acknowledge that giving away the operating system for free will take out some of the cost of manufacturing a handset for Nokia’s rivals. It costs around $5 a handset for a Symbian or Microsoft operating systems, a small but not insignificant part of the price of making a phone."
677;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-10-26T00:37:05Z;Arm hit by dollar and Artisan problems;;Sales at Arm Holdings fell during the three months to September because of the weak dollar and slow business at an intellectual property company it bought three years ago, a deal that has faced considerable scepticism.Arm, whose microchip designs are used in about 98 per cent of the world’s mobile phones, said sales in the period were £62.8m, down from £64.8m a year ago and short of analysts’ expectations of £68m.Warren East, chief executive, blamed the dollar and the IP division, formerly know as Artisan.Arm bought Artisan for $913m in 2004. Artisan designs libraries of components used to make up computer chips. As chips become more complicated, with more information squeezed on to a smaller space, Arm believes more microprocessor makers will want ready-made components to speed up design.However, it is having to devote engineering resources to get Artisan ready for the next generation of smaller chips.Mr East “was absolutely confident that buying Artisan was the right thing to do. When we bought it, we said it would take four to seven years to position the business and we’re only two-and-a-half-years into the process.”Pre-tax profit in the period fell from £12.6m to £11.9m while earnings per share fell 0.1p to 0.6p. The shares dropped 4½p to 145p.FT Comment● Artisan is a big gamble. If Texas Instruments, Qualcomm or Broadcom can be persuaded to use Artisan’s library of components, the acquisition will be worth its price. But the pay-off remains unclear. In the meantime, the rest of Arm’s business stands to benefit from smartphones, which include more Arm-designed chips and generate more royalties. For investors who believe the iPhone is the start of a mass trend, Arm remains attractive.
678;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;TI warns of flat sales as competition bites;;Texas Instruments warned on Monday that sales of its wireless chips for mobile phones were likely to be flat in the fourth quarter as handset makers began to switch from single-sourcing of their chips.Texas Instruments has been the number one supplier of chips for mobile phones, but is being challenged for supremacy by San Diego-based Qualcomm and also faces competition from other US chipmakers, such as Broadcom and Freescale.In a third-quarter earnings call, Kevin March, TI chief financial officer, said its analog chip business, which covers a wide range of industries, would begin substantially to shape the company and be a driver of growth in the years ahead. It currently accounts for 40 per cent of sales.Mr March predicted a seasonal fourth quarter apart from sales of its wireless chips.He forecast these would be flat compared with the third quarter, when growth of around 8 per cent was normally expected.He said this would be partly because Sony Ericsson had begun to take chips from a second supplier. TI shares were down 3.5 per cent on the news in after-hours trading at $33.06.Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, said at an analyst conference call that TI could also benefit from this “supplier diversification” trend as it has become a second supplier itself.By the middle of next year, TI would be supplying higher-end chips to Motorola, the US mobile phone maker, he said, and although Nokia had announced some diversification, TI would not have a competitor there for its 3G chips until 2010.TI announced that third-quarter revenues fell 3 per cent from a year ago – when customers were building inventories – to $3.66bn.Earnings per share were 52 cents, 7 cents or 16 per cent higher than a year earlier.
679;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-10-22T19:53:13Z;Nokia and Qualcomm;;Nokia and Qualcomm are dipping their spoons into the murky soup of intellectual property litigation. They have brought multiple suits against each other in several countries, not to mention complaints lodged with the Federal Trade Commission and European competition authorities.These legal skirmishes can be seen as extended negotiations over what is, at heart, a fairly straightforward business wrangle. Qualcomm owns most of the intellectual property behind the CDMA mobile technology standard. Until April, Nokia paid a flat royalty rate – between 4 and 5 per cent of the average selling price of its phones – to use it. But for the next generation of technology, W-CDMA, Nokia argues that its contribution to the standard’s intellectual property was higher and Qualcomm’s lower. The Finnish company would like to pay less to Qualcomm – particularly as royalty fees at the old rate look likely to surpass $1bn next year as 3G phones continue to take off.Who will win? There is a degree of pot and kettle about the charges. Both companies have used aggressive business tactics in the past, but actual anti-competitive behaviour is hard to prove. Valuing intellectual property when there are multiple contributors and hundreds of individual patents is an art, not a science.So far, Qualcomm shares have suffered, while Nokia’s have not. This reflects in part the belief that the latter has nothing to lose by negotiating aggressively. Nokia has an option to renew its agreement with Qualcomm on the existing terms, meaning the worst case for it would seem to be merely the status quo. This may be too optimistic. Arbitration will decide whether Nokia’s use of Qualcomm’s technology constitutes the exercise of the option. But it could also revisit fundamental questions, such as whether the contract is still in force at all. Nokia could then be in danger of infringing Qualcomm’s patents – which carries the risk of substantial punitive damages in court. The soup may be spicier than anticipated.
680;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-25T22:03:02Z;Qcomm increases guidance after rise in sales;;Qualcomm, the world’s second-biggest maker of chips for use in mobile handsets, on Tuesday said that improved sales and a big tax break were likely to lead to higher-than-expected profits and sales in the fourth quarter.Shares in the company slipped 0.7 per cent to $41.33 in spite of the bullish update, indicating that some investors were expecting an even stronger performance amid a boom in sales of smart phones and other mobile handsets.Qualcomm, whose chip sets help power mobile phones made by Motorola, Samsung, and LG among others, said it expected to make a net profit of 64 to 65 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up from a previous estimate of 41 to 43 cents a share.It expected sales to be “at or slightly” above its earlier guidance of $2.15bn-$2.25bn for the quarter.Qualcomm’s financial statements indicated that the profits boost was largely due to a 19-cents-per-share benefit related to tax paid in prior years. But it also expected to benefit from better-than-anticipated sales of its Mobile Station Modem chips, which are used in third-generation or “3G” mobile phones.“We are expecting another successful quarter as worldwide demand for third-generation devices and services continues to accelerate,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, in a statement.Tuesday’s profits update comes two weeks after a US court stayed a ban on imports of some Qualcomm chips into the US.The ban, which threatened holiday sales of mobile handsets, had been imposed by the International Trade Commission, which ruled that Qualcomm’s chips had infringed on the patents of Broadcom, a rival chipmaker.Qualcomm, which is also involved in a long-running licensing dispute with Nokia, the Finnish handset maker, is seeking a broad cross-licensing deal with Broadcom in order to resolve the companies’ differences.Sales of smart phones have risen this year as consumers rush to upgrade to handsets capable of handling e-mail, web browsing and video as well as phone calls.Excitement in the smart phone market has been spurred by Apple, which has sold more than 1m iPhone mobile handsets since the phone made its debut in late June.Qualcomm’s chips do not feature in the iPhone, but Mr Jacobs has argued that the success of the iPhone could be good for the smart phone industry at large because it will force other handset makers to increase their pace of innovation.
681;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-24T07:39:24Z;Regulatory competition;;Sometimes regulators can seem a bit like gophers. A company or industry may think it has fully resolved an issue with one agency, but then another body can pop up with different demands. Microsoft’s nine-year battle with European Union competition officials over its Windows near-monopoly is a case in point.The software giant has spent years cultivating its home regulator, eventually convincing the US Department of Justice to settle its antitrust case on terms very favourable to Microsoft. But Microsoft’s charms have had much less impact in Europe, where the European Court of First Instance upheld a record €497m fine this week. The ruling this week drew catcalls from the DoJ, which said it could harm consumers “by chilling innovation”. The reaction underlined the growing split between President George W. Bush’s administration, which emphasises the fostering of new technology, and the EU, which sees more need to curb dominant players.Regulatory second-guessing of this nature is common in the US, where state officials often jump in when the federal government holds back. When federal regulators failed to act on accusations of biased Wall Street stock research, they created an opening for Eliot Spitzer, the former New York attorney-general, to wring the $1.5bn global settlement from 12 investment banks in 2002. In the 1990s, the states, rather than federal health programmes, took the lead in suing tobacco companies.The Microsoft ruling underscores the fact that a similar dynamic has developed internationally. The US routinely investigates overseas companies and recently began probing bribery allegations at BAE Systems after the UK government declined to do so. The EU’s competition commissioner has been giving US companies such as Intel, Rambus and Qualcomm a taste of the same medicine. These probes show that globalisation does not always result in less protection for consumers and competitors. Overseas regulators may be more sceptical of a company’s claims than agencies closer to home. Since multinational companies cannot afford to skip big markets, the strictest regulator generally holds sway.
682;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-19T03:42:52Z;Microsoft case reveals a regulatory gulf;;Even to seasoned observers of the European Commission’s nine-year antitrust battle with Microsoft, there must have been a strange sense of dislocation as the regulator’s 2004 ruling was finally upheld in court on Monday.Though most of the companies involved in that fight hailed from the US, the judgment was delivered in Luxembourg, drafted by an Irishman and read out by a judge from Denmark. The original Commission ruling was prepared by a Spaniard and handed down by Mario Monti, the Italian EU competition commissioner. He has since been replaced by a Dutch official, Neelie Kroes.Like so many other US companies before it, Microsoft can be in no doubt today that the biggest regulatory threat to its business comes not from the authorities in its home country but from the Brussels-based Commission. Indeed, while the principal US competition authorities – the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – have been highly reluctant to ­pursue big, dominant companies for abusing their market power, the Commission has repeatedly struck out against corporate behemoths on both sides of the Atlantic.Microsoft is not alone. Two months ago, the Commission issued antitrust charges against Intel, accusing the world’s biggest chipmaker of abusing its dominant position. It is also investigating Rambus and Qualcomm, two other US technology groups. A few years ago, Brussels even dared to go after that most American of companies – Coca-Cola.Though some of these cases have also been pursued through the US courts and examined by American regulators, the centre of gravity for antitrust enforcement has clearly shifted towards Brussels. Following Monday’s resounding victory for the Commission in the Microsoft case, that trend is almost certain to accelerate.Most antitrust lawyers agree that this divergence does not reflect differences in law. Maurits Dolmans, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb in Brussels who acted against Microsoft for a range of other US technology groups, says: “Legally, Monday’s court ruling makes clear that there is no divergence. It is true that the DoJ has been less energetic in pursuing abuses of dominance but that is a question of political choice, and not of legal divergence.”Douglas Melamed, co-chair of the antitrust division at Wilmer Hale in Washington and a former acting assistant attorney-general in the antitrust division at the justice department under the Clinton administration, says two factors have shaped the differing strategies.Mr Melamed says Europeans have a “regulatory culture” that tends to focus more on the set of facts in a case instead of establishing rules that companies use to guide their behaviour – a fact that makes Europeans more interventionist. While the EU puts pressure on companies that seek to exclude their rivals, the US focuses more on efficiency, Mr Melamed says.He says that these conceptual differences will not disappear if a Democrat is elected president in 2008, though he says he believes that Democrats will be more active than the Bush administration’s justice department has been.Stephen Kinsella, a Brussels-based partner at Sidley Austin who represents a pro-Microsoft software association called Act, says the US regulator’s attitude is very different today: “In the US we are seeing very little enforcement when it comes to dominance abuses. You very much see an attitude that says: ‘If you have got yourself into that position, good luck to you.’”However, analysts point out that the EU and US have moved much closer in most other areas of competition law enforcement. The Commission, for example, has emulated its US counterparts’ tough line against cartels, drastically increasing its recent fines for companies that participate in price-fixing agreements.In the field of merger reviews, the two sides have also closed ranks. The dramatic divergence six years ago when the Commission blocked GE’s takeover bid for Honeywell after it had won US approval is unthinkable today.“There has been a general trend towards convergence in a lot of areas, not least because the agencies talk to each other a lot more – and get on well,” says Mr Kinsella.
683;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-13T22:11:11Z;Handset makers welcome lift of chip ban;;Analysts and mobile handset makers welcomed a court decision that lifted a threat to holiday season phone sales in the US, caused by a ban on the import of certain 3G handsets.A federal appeals court on Wednesday issued a stay, pending an appeal, on a ban by the International Trade Commission on smartphones containing Qualcomm chips. The ITC had judged the chips infringed a patent of rival chipmaker Broadcom.Shares of Qualcomm rose 3.3 per cent to $39.12 on the news in midday trading. Broadcom shares rose 2 per cent to $36.09.The court did not stay a ban on Qualcomm importing its chips made abroad itself, but did find in favour of third-parties – the handset makers Kyocera, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sanyo, and wireless operators AT&T and T-Mobile.The judge in Washington said they could sell their handset in the US as they had demonstrated “a substantial case on the merits and the harm factors weigh in their favour”.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said the decision was positive for Qualcomm as its customers’ imports could now “continue unhindered through the upcoming critical holiday season”.UBS analysts said the decision potentially reduced Broadcom’s leverage in its long-running legal battle with Qualcomm if the ITC’s scope was reduced to just the chipmaker.Broadcom said that the ITC’s cease and desist order, barring Qualcomm from bringing its chips into the US, would still affect Qualcomm’s ability to provide support to its customers for essential services such as designing next-generation mobile handsets.South Korean handset makers also welcomed the appeals court ruling. Samsung and LG are key Qualcomm customers and were seen as the most likely victims of the ban.The International Trade Commission announced the ban in June after finding that Qualcomm had infringed a Broadcom power-saving patent.The two sides have been unable to reach agreement on compensation out of court.
684;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-13T20:42:57Z;Wall Street rally led by blue chips;;Wall Street stocks rose sharply higher on Thursday, buoyed by tentative signs of stability in money markets before next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve.Stocks also held up in the face of a new record high for the price of oil, as benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed above $80 a barrel for the first time.The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 per cent to close at 1,483.95, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite’s gain of 0.4 per cent to 2,601.06.As stocks rallied, equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, eased just 0.8 per cent.Financials were one of the best performing sectors in the S&P, while the top stock was Countrywide, up 13.9 per cent at $18.93, which more than reversed its losses earlier this week. The largest US mortage lender said it had arranged $12bn in additional secured borrowing capacity.Another sign that credit conditions were starting to stabilise was seen in the latest weekly data on the commercial paper market released by the Federal Reserve. Outstanding CP declined for a fifth successive week but the pace was much slower.“The decline is also the smallest since the CP tempest began last month,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“The notion that the moderation might signal the worst of the crisis is over is corroborated by anecdotal evidence of buyers beginning to re-enter, albeit on a very, very tentative scale, the CP market.”Lehman Brothers continued its recent rebound before third-quarter results next week with a rise of 4.6 per cent to $59.68. The bank’s shares have rallied nearly 13 per cent this week.The economic calendar picks up on Friday when retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. The information will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet next week to discuss monetary policy.Investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-percentage point easing.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major benchmarks on Thursday with a rally of 1 per cent to 13,424.88. A number of Dow components were in the news, led by General Motors, up 10 per cent at $33.29, after the United Auto Workers union indicated a willingness to help cut healthcare costs.McDonald’s gained 6.1 per cent to $54.30 amd set a record high of $54.68 after it announced a 50 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend to $1.50 a share. The company said this week that global same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent in August. The stock has rallied more than 10 per cent since Monday.Citigroup said: “Positive global momentum combined with shareholder friendly initiatives position McDonald’s well in a challenging market environment,” as it maintained a $58 target on the stock.Microsoftraised its quarterly dividend by a cent and the stock was up 0.8 per cent at $29.16.Merck was another Dow stock on the rise, with a gain of 0.4 per cent to $49.86 after Bank of America upgraded the pharmaceutical giant to a ‘buy’ with a price target of $57.Shares in Exxon Mobil were 1.1 per cent higher at $88.62, boosted by record oil prices. Other stocks in the news included, Target, up 2.7 per cent at $64.42 after the retailer said it might sell $7bn in credit-card receivables. Analysts at Citigroup said: “It is a positive that Target is taking steps to determine if there is additional value that can be returned to shareholders.“Bill Ackman’s 9.6 per cent stake in the company could have prompted management to take action, in our view.”Qualcomm rose 3.4 per cent to $39.17 after a judge halted an import ban on mobile phones containing the company’s 3G handsets. It represents a legal victory in the chipmaker’s patent dispute with rival Broadcom, whose shares rose 1.4 per cent at $35.87.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 4.2 per cent to $13.30 after it announced a collaboration with Ortho-McNeil, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, up 1 per cent at $63.11, for the treatment of various medical disorders.Biogen rose 1.1 per cent to $65.40, and reversed losses in early trade after UBS downgraded the biotech drug maker to “sell” and maintained a $58 price target.First Data closed a fraction firmer at $33.39. Investors focused on talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which engineered a $26bn buy-out of the credit card processor, could delay the sale of loans to fund that deal.The stock remained below the $34 a share buy-out price.
685;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Court puts hold on Qualcomm import ban;;A US appeals court on Wednesday halted an import ban on mobile phones containing Qualcomm’s 3G handsets, a legal victory in the chipmaker’s patent dispute with rival Broadcom.The court’s stay, pending appeal, would allow third parties such as LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sanyo and AT&T to import certain handsets into the United States.The judge on Wednesday agreed that the third parties had demonstrated “a substantial case on the merits and the harm factors weigh[ed] in their favour.”The International Trade Commission on June 7 imposed the ban after finding that Qualcomm had infringed a Broadcom power-saving patent. The two sides have been unable to reach agreement on compensation out of court.Qualcomm shares rose nearly 2 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement.”We are pleased that the court of appeals recognised the undeserved harm to parties who were not named in the lawsuit, and that our customers will continue to be able to introduce new products into the US marketplace during the appeals process,” Alex Rogers, legal counsel for Qualcomm, said in a statement.Qualcomm’s technology is included in all 3G handsets, meaning that a full ban on cellphones carrying its chips might potentially have hampered the take-up in the US of the next generation of wireless technology.
686;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm sees licensing as a way to end disputes;;Qualcomm, the world’s largest maker of chips for mobile phones, hopes to settle its multiple legal battles with Broadcom through a cross-licensing agreement, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Paul Jacobs said the US-based company was in talks with Broadcom, a rival chip maker, to resolve a series of legal disputes over patents and licensing practices.“There is no deal yet,” he said. “But Broadcom also wants to be in the chipset business and will need licences from us for that. So hopefully at some point there will be ground for a deal.”The remarks come after Broadcom received another victory in the two companies’ standoff on Tuesday after a US court ruled that antitrust claims brought by Broadcom against Qualcomm can go forward.That ruling follows a decision by the International Trade Commission to ban from the US market the sale of handsets containing certain Qualcomm chips, which Broadcom alleges infringe on its patents.Separately, Qualcomm is also in a bitter legal dispute with Nokia over cross-licensing.Qualcomm’s management has said that the legal battles could inflict considerable financial damage on the company.Mr Jacobs was in Taiwan to promote a common technology platform with HTC, the world’s leading vendor of smartphones running on Microsoft software.HTC said it would launch at least 10 products containing Qualcomm chips this year.The Qualcomm chief said these products should not experience problems in entering the US market because the handsets could either be sold through US carriers that have applied for licences with Broadcom or they could be protected through “workaround software” offered by Qualcomm to protect its customers.HTC, which started out as a contract manufacturer and began forcefully to push its own brand only last year, sells a large percentage of its handsets as custom-made devices for mobile carriers.Verizon, the US carrier that has already acquired a licence from Broadcom to get round the ITC ban, is one of its customers.
687;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-09-04T21:40:57Z;Metro offers $5.3bn for Leap Wireless;;MetroPCS Communications on Tuesday offered to acquire rival Leap Wireless International for $5.3bn in stock in a deal that would combine two of the fastest growing mobile carriers to create a new national carrier with over 6.2m subscribers.Both companies offer their customers unlimited calls in exchange for a flat rate service charge paid in advance and together they would rank as the fifth largest mobile carrier behind AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA.The launch of the unsolicited takeover also bid underscores that mergers and acquisitions activity has not entirely ground to a halt because of the turmoil in the credit markets.Dallas-based MetroPCS offered 2.75 of its shares for each outstanding common share of San Diego-based Leap which was spun out from Qualcomm, the wireless chip maker, in 1998.Based on Friday’s closing stock prices, that values the bid at $75.04 per share. But investors pushed Leap’s share price up by $10.97, or 15 per cent, on Tuesday to $83.47 , signalling their expectation that the offer price will have to be raised before a deal is struck. MetroPCS shares rose $1.36, or 5 per cent, to $28.65.The offer, which represents a modest 3.5 per cent premium over Leap’s previous closing price before the value to Leap shareholders of any synergies is factored in, was made in a letter to Leap’s board. ”Leap is reviewing the letter sent by MetroPCS and beyond that we don’t have any comment,” the company said. Mark Rachesky, Leap’s chairman, owns 17 per cent of the stock.”We believe now is the right time to combine our two businesses,” said Roger Linquist MetroPCS, chief executive, in a call with analysts. ”We see a compelling strategic rationale to bring together the two companies.”The proposed deal was broadly welcomed by investors and industry analysts who noted the two companies have similar strategies – both are focused on the fast expanding pre-paid market – and have complementary geographic footprints and customer bases.MetroPCS, which has more than 3.5m subscribers, and Leap, which has 2.67m subscribers, mostly serve less wealthy customers and have been growing very rapidly. Fifty-three per cent of the subscribers to leap’s Cricket-branded service are either Hispanic or African-American, compared with just 17 per cent of traditional wireless carriers.Analysts also noted that a merger should generate significant back-office cost savings. MetroPCS itself said it expected the merger to create synergies of about $2.5bn, worth an additional $12.34 per share to Leap investors, who would end up owning about 34.8 per cent of the merged company.While the possibility of a deal involving MetroPCS and Leap Wireless had been widely mooted, analysts suggested that the timing could reflect the upcoming 700Mhz wireless spectrum action due to take place in January.As a combined company MetroPCS and Leap, which will have licenses in virtually all the top 200 US markets, would be in a much stronger bidding position than as separate entities.The proposed deal also highlights that although private equity groups are finding it extremely difficult to finance new transactions that need to be financed with large debt packages, strategic buyers are looking for ways to capitalise on the absence of the buy-out groups by sealing long-contemplated deals.Reaction to the MetroPCS bid, with shares in both companies rising on the announcement, could encourage chief executives contemplating similar moves.
688;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Nokia raises pressure on Qualcomm;;Nokia sought to ratchet up the legal pressure on US rival Qualcomm on Friday, asking the US International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban handsets containing some Qualcomm chipsets from entering the US.The action by the world’s largest mobile phone maker marks a widening of a dispute already being fought in courts on both sides of the Atlantic, and comes in the wake of legal reversals suffered by Qualcomm over the past two weeks.By trying to capitalise on Qualcomm’s setbacks, Nokia is seeking to increase its chances of a favourable settlement of the long-running licensing battle between the two sides, legal experts said.“It’s a kind of ‘kick ’em while they’re down’ approach,” said Bob Yoches, a partner at Finnegan Henderson, a US law firm specialising in intellectual property. Qualcomm is “otherwise distracted and has a lot on its plate” in the wake of recent legal losses to US rival, Broadcom, as well as this week’s resignation of its general counsel, he added.Qualcomm last week failed in an attempt to persuade the White House to overturn a separate ITC ban on imports of some phones containing its chips. That case had been brought by Broadcom, over patents governing battery-saving technology.However, Nokia itself faces a possible bar on imports of its own GSM handsets in the US, following an earlier complaint to the ITC from Qualcomm. That case is due to be heard in September, potentially giving Qualcomm the upper hand as the two sides jockey for tactical advantage.On Friday, Nokia asked the ITC to investigate whether Qualcomm had engaged in unfair trade practices by infringing five Nokia patents in its chipset components for third-generation mobile telephones. “Qualcomm is using these patents without authorisation from us,” said Tero Ojanpera, Nokia’s chief technology officer. “We believe we have a very strong case here. Qualcomm’s actions show that they believe they can operate by different sets of rules than others in the wireless industry.”A licence agreement between the two companies expired in April after Nokia failed to persuade Qualcomm to slash the royalties payable for its chipset patents. Since then both sides have accused each other of infringing patents and not paying royalties and have sought remedies in courts.In the Broadcom case, Qualcomm is appealing the ITC’s ruling in the courts. Telephone service operators and handset manufacturers have also asked the ITC to stop the ban from taking effect while the appeal is being considered.
689;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-08-15T17:17:22Z;Two minds on injunctive relief;;On August 6 2007 the Bush administration decided to hold firm with the decision of the International Trade Commission in the long-standing Broadcom v Qualcomm dispute. As most IP aficionados know, the dispute arose when the ITC held that Broadcom was entitled to an injunction that would keep all infringing Qualcomm 3G phones out of the US. That decision highlights one of the central disputes of modern intellectual property law: should the field routinely borrow models of property law used for dealing with tangible objects, or should it be treated as a distinctive subject that should rely on a homegrown paradigm that is not parasitic on traditional property rights options.The decision of the ITC puts it on a collision course with the recent developments in domestic US patent law since the US Supreme Court’s enigmatic 2006 decision in Ebay v MercExchange, which cast grave doubt on whether injunctive relief should be granted routinely granted as a matter of course. The traditional view of patents held that it should follow the usual rule in real property cases, including those that allow a landowner to order an innocent builder to rip down an entire structure because of a modest incursion into his space: don’t like the result, buy out the injunction, was the attitude. After Ebay, that get tough attitude seems to have fallen out of favour, as courts have been chary about awarding injunctions: some form of compulsory licensing game has become the dominant game in town.Too bad, for this new domestic trend represents a trendy mistake, which maybe the ITC decision will help reverse. Think back to the parallel between land and IP. The key intellectual error of Ebay for patents has thus far been avoided in encroachment cases where one person builds something that sits in part on the land of another. The efficiency of legal rule is evaluated in part by looking at the bargaining difficulties that arise once the injunction is granted. On this score the injunction rule has fared poorly in the eyes of its critics because of the immense hold out problems that arise. But the experience in the field has indicated that the pressures to reach closure in this area are strong. The holdout scenario hurts both sides. The patentee gets no revenue for a period of time on a wasting asset. The potential user suffers the risk of massive disruption of services. Even if the potential range of prices and fees are large, it behoves both sides to settle fast. Just that happened when Research-in-Motion, which makes the Blackberry device, avoided the abyss by making its settlement with the plaitiff NTP.And this time round Verizon, which had been a Qualcomm customer entered into a deal with Broadcom that was announced shortly after the ITC decision was announced.On a second key component the injunctive rule fares well. The prospect of injunctive relief has desirable effects on the prior conduct of both the property rights holder and the potential trespasser or infringer. Thus, in the encroachment case, strong knowledge of the iron clad rule will have the desirable effect of reducing the number of workouts that take place ex post, by having neighbours make more accurate surveys. In the intellectual property world, boundaries are never as clear, but the same directional effects will be seen. Knowing that the axe will fall will lead people to steer safely clear of the boundary lines, or procure in advance - when the holdout power is negligible - the licenses needed to obviate the problem to begin with.One advantage of a strong property rights regime is that it avoids high stakes strategic behaviour. That is of course evident in the Broadcom ITC proceeding which moves in parallel with the huge donnybrook now taking place in the federal court. But the effects of the Ebay rule are not confined to big shot transactions. They also corrupt the licensing system for all sorts of midlevel transactions. The traditional law - which did not worry much about patent trolls - essentially held that the injunctive relief came as of right when the defendant practised the invention, licensed the invention to others, or warehoused the invention in order to make better use of some other patented invention within its portfolio.In the aftermath of Ebay we face this situation: should the injunction be denied to an owner against an infringer solely because the patent owner has yet to license the invention out to someone else? This happened in a case now on appeal to the Federal Circuit when the District Court Judge refused to grant Finisar an injunction against DirectTV after finding that DirectTV had infringed some key communication patents.Now note how the uncertainty over the injunction corrupts the primary license market. Why license anything for a price when an immediate infringement could deny the owner the right to exclude? The pressure on the patent holder to make a quick license is really great, for once an infringement takes place, it will be hard to put the genie back into the bottle. Exclusive licenses, now a common occurrence, could become an endangered species. Quite simply, a discretionary rule weakens market structures, and places far greater strains on the damage/compulsory licensing process than need be the case. There is nothing in an ITC decision that changes the posture in the domestic market. But the decision is a welcome reminder that the Bush administration seems to be aware, after painstaking investigation, of the long-term dislocation that comes from a system of weak property rights.Richard Epstein is a law professor at the University of Chicago and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
690;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Qualcomm lawyer resigns amid setbacks;;The general counsel of Qualcomm quit on Monday as the US chip technology company, which invented key parts of the 3G wireless standard, prepares for a legal showdown with European rival Nokia.The company said that Lou Lupin had resigned immediately but, unusually, gave no reason for the departure. In a statement, Paul Jacobs, the chief executive officer, credited Mr Lupin with having done much to shape Qualcomm’s technology licensing strategy, which accounts for more than a third of its revenue.Mr Lupin’s departure comes the week after Qualcomm suffered two setbacks in its broader legal campaign to assert its rights over the wireless technology used in the latest generation of high-speed wireless networks.In one case, which had been expected, the White House refused to overturn a ruling by the International Trade Commission to ban imports into the US of some handsets using Qualcomm chipsets.Separately, a district court judge delivered a stinging rebuke to Qualcomm’s legal team as he upheld a jury verdict from January that barred the company from enforcing two of its patents against US rival Broadcom. The judge said that Qualcomm had deliberately concealed information that was relevant to the case.The criticism could prove damaging as Qualcomm prepares for its biggest legal campaign yet, in its battle against Nokia and possible action from the European Commission, according to analysts.“It’s a legal precedent of a company that could have behaved extremely badly,” said Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura. The risk, he added, was “the damage that does to Qualcomm’s overall reputation, and how that might affect how judges and juries view the company in future cases that are far more important”.The upheaval in Qualcomm’s legal team comes at an important moment in its broader effort to assert its rights to 3G technology. While both of last week’s setbacks involved intellectual property disputes with Broadcom, the coming showdown with Nokia is considered far more important to its business, as well as the broader 3G technology landscape.The two companies failed to agree terms for renewing Nokia’s licence to Qualcomm technology in April, and the two have now embarked on a series of legal skirmishes that are expected to shape the final terms of a negotiated settlement, with actions to be heard in the UK and Germany this autumn.Qualcomm said Carol Lam, a senior vice-president, would replace Mr Lupin as acting general counsel pending a search for a full-time replacement. Ms Lam, a former US attorney for the Southern District of California, joined Qualcomm in February this year. She left her last job during the removal of a number of US attorneys that sparked criticism of US attorney general Alberto Gonzales.
691;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Nokia to outsource chip development;;Nokia, the world’s largest maker of mobile phones, is to stop in-house development of semiconductors for most of its mobile phones and outsource the business to third parties.The Finland-based company said the move would free an undisclosed sum for research into more complex chips needed for its advanced multimedia, internet-enabled handsets.Nokia will use four chipset suppliers – Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics. Chipsets are combinations of integrated circuits that operate together.The Finnish company also said it would licence coveted modem technology for the first time, so generating additional revenue.The decision to broaden its range of chipset suppliers and licence proprietary technology for high-speed WCDMA/HSDPA mobile phone chips will be an opportunity for chip companies such as STMicroelectronics and Broadcom to enter a new market.Only Nokia, Ericsson Mobile Platforms and Qualcomm are believed to have the technology to make cost-effective WCDMA/HSDPA chips.“We will have more players in the industry who will be total solution providers,” said Niklas Savander, Nokia’s executive vice-president for technology platforms.On Wednesday, Nokia shares closed 4 per cent ahead at €22.48 in Helsinki. Broadcom rose 9.8 per cent to $35.98 by the close in New York and STMicroelectronics shares were little changed at $16.91. Infineon rose 2.7 per cent to €11.36.However, Texas Instruments fell 0.3 per cent to $33.73 and Qualcomm slipped 0.3 per cent to $40.15.Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura, said: “This is the most negative news for Qualcomm, which makes excellent margins in WCDMA chipsets.”He added that the company will now face much greater competition and pricing pressure in the long-term.”Nokia’s move to broaden its range of chip suppliers is also negative for Texas Instruments, which has been Nokia’s sole supplier of 3G and Edge semiconductors but will now have to compete with others.Nokia plans to transfer 200 staff to STMicro.
692;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-08-07T21:07:33Z;Court hits Qualcomm on abusive practice;;Qualcomm deliberately hid information from a technology standards body and failed to reveal thousands of relevant documents in a legal proceeding, a US court ruled on Tuesday.The finding by a federal court judge in San Diego is highly embarrassing for the US chip technology company as it faces a widening series of patent cases.The allegations of abusive practice also come at a delicate time for the US company in Europe, where a number of chip companies and wireless handset makers have accused it of using aggressive tactics to overcharge for its technology used in the W-CDMA high-speed wireless standard.Chipmakers Broadcom and Texas Instruments, as well as handset makers including Nokia and Ericsson, have accused it in Europe of trying to charge excessive fees on the W-CDMA standard.In a statement, Qualcomm said it “acknowledges the seriousness of the court’s findings and reiterates its previous apology to the court for the errors made during discovery and for the inaccurate testimony of certain of its witnesses”.But the company added it “respectfully disagrees” that it intended to mislead the standards body or the court. It also said it would appeal against the court’s decision to throw out two of its patents that were linked to the work of the standards body.“Qualcomm has over the years been accused of co-opting standards and using the technology to fill its pockets with royalties,” said Smith Brittingham, a lawyer at Finnegan Henderson. “This [ruling] puts those sorts of efforts at risk.”The ruling upheld a finding of misconduct against Qualcomm earlier this year. The judge concluded that Qualcomm had deliberately concealed two of its patents from the industry standards body. By not disclosing technology in this way, it could have been in a position to charge royalties for its intellectual property at a later stage, benefiting from the widespread adoption ensured by the standards process.The decision could well encourage other critics of the company to fight harder to resist its efforts to levy royalties for its technology in other standards, said Mr Brittingham.
693;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-08-07T00:41:44Z;Qualcomm to appeal as ITC ruling stays;;The Bush administration on Monday refused to overturn a ban on imports into the US of certain mobile handsets, adding to pressure on Qualcomm to reach a settlement of its long-running and bitter patent battle with rival chipmaker Broadcom.The expected decision came two months after the nation’s International Trade Commission voted for the ban, which could affect a broad array of 3G handsets.The ITC ruled that Qualcomm had infringed on a Broadcom patent concerning energy-saving technology for handsets when their users roam on networks.Qualcomm said it planned an immediate appeal, probably on Tuesday, and that it would also seek a stay of the ITC ban pending the outcome.The appeals court seldom overturns ITC decisions, and few other avenues appeared open for Qualcomm, said Lyle Vander Schaaf, a former ITC lawyer. “Options for Qualcomm, other than settlement [with Broadcom], are going away,” he said.While White House support for ITC rulings is normally a formality, lobbying by both sides over the past two months, as well as Monday’s unusually detailed explanation of the decision by US trade representative Susan Schwab, point to the wide-ranging ramifications of the decision.Qualcomm’s technology is included in all 3G handsets, meaning that a full ban on cellphones carrying its chips might potentially have hampered the take-up in the US of the next generation of wireless technology.
694;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Brussels questions Intel’s tactics;;The European Commission on Friday accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in PC microprocessors, alleging it was offering its chips at below cost and inducing computer makers not to use those of Advanced Micro Devices.The Commission was providing the first details of charges sent to Intel on Thursday in a statement of objections – the result of a seven-year investigation of the world’s biggest chipmaker.Intel has until October 8 to respond formally. If it cannot convince the commission that its business practices were legal, it could face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its revenues, or more than $3.5bn, based on 2006 sales of $35.4bn.The Silicon Valley company is alleged to have given substantial rebates to PC makers, as long as they bought the majority of their central processing units from Intel.The Commission also alleged that Intel had made payments to induce a manufacturer to delay or cancel a product line featuring an AMD processor.To compete with AMD in the network server market, Intel is alleged to have offered microprocessors at below cost.A spokesman for the European Commission said: “The rebates offered by Intel were of such a quantity, of such an amount, that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost and we think that would be very bad for competition and bad for consumers who would be buying computers.”Bruce Sewell, Intel general counsel, said the Commission’s case was based on a complaint from a competitor rather than customers or consumers.“We are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that Intel’s conduct has been lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” he said.The Commission’s allegations relate to practices in a three-year period starting in 2003 and stem from a drawn-out investigation that began with an AMD complaint in 2000.“We’ve needed the time to get the supplementary information, the information from all parties concerned, to be able to send this statement of objections,” the Commission said.Mr Sewell said the allegations related to the past and that both Intel and AMD were now using price and discounts to compete.Intel had an 81 per cent share of the global microprocessor market in the first half of this year, compared with 11 per cent for AMD and 8 per cent for other manufacturers, according to iSuppli, a research firm.Antitrust officials have also been tied up with investigations of the effect of Microsoft’s dominant Windows operating system during the span of the Intel inquiry, as well as looking at another US company, Qualcomm, and its dominance of a cellphone standard.Intel will be closely watching a ruling, due in September, on Microsoft’s appeal against a €500m fine imposed in 2004.
695;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-07-26T03:50:51Z;Qualcomm undaunted by patent dispute;;Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker, reported record third-quarter earnings but said it would continue to be dogged by patent litigation.The San Diego-based company said quarterly revenues to July 1 rose 19 per cent year-on-year to $2.33bn, exceeding the analyst consensus of $2.26bn gathered by Reuters Estimates.Net income of $934m was up 29 per cent and pro-forma earnings per share of 55 cents beat analyst predictions of 51 cents. Qualcomm shares rose 3.6 per cent to $44 in extended trading in New York.Paul, Jacobs, chief executive, said it had been “another tremendous quarter” for the business, but Qualcomm had been unable to come to an agreement with rival chipmaker Broadcom in its principal patent dispute. Broadcom has won a ban from the International Trade Commission on the importation of new smartphones containing Qualcomm chips that the ITC judges to have infringed its patents. The Bush administration has until August 6 to decide whether to veto the ban.Mr Jacobs said Broadcom’s insistence on royalty-free rights for its customers to access important parts of Qualcomm’s patent portfolio was preventing any agreement. “Unfortunately, the next few months represent a crucial litigation timeframe and we can’t predict the outcome at present,” he said.Qualcomm gave a more optimistic forecast for its fiscal year, increasing its guidance on revenues from the range of $8.4bn-$8.7bn to $8.72bn-$8.82bn.The iSuppli research firm said on Monday that Texas Instruments was displaced by Qualcomm in the first quarter of this year as the number-one supplier of chips for mobile phones.
696;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-07-17T17:04:50Z;Why the US should ban mobile phones;;"President George W. Bush is facing a decision that could hit Americans where it really hurts: in the mobile phone pouch.The Bush administration must shortly decide whether to let America have a whole new generation of cellular phone toys – or insist they make do with their old handsets, for months or even longer. Deciding when to bring the troops home from Baghdad is a cinch by comparison: the peaceniks are already against him; this is no time to anger the iPhone crowd.So now, hard on the heels of the crisis that threatened to divide America from its BlackBerries, the US is facing another digital moment of truth: should the administration put politics above patent rights and override a legal ruling that will otherwise stop a new generation of mobile phones at the border? Or should the politicians stay out of it and let the legal authorities have their say: that new model phones that infringe a crucial chip patent should be barred from importation?Like so many other public policy crises of the modern world, this all started as a battle over intellectual property rights. Broadcom (supplier of chips for wireless phones) has been pursuing Qualcomm (a rival supplier) over a patent that stops mobile phones running out of power when they are out of network because they constantly search for one.The two are fighting it out in the federal courts, which are very slow. In the meantime, the much swifter International Trade Commission – which has parallel legal authority over patent cases if they involve imports – issued an order stopping imports of mobile phones that infringe the energy-saving patent (and that includes most of them).The ITC tried to limit the disruption by saying that mobile phones that were already sold in the US would not be affected, only new models would. But in a world where mobile consumers always want the latest trinket – and at a time when mobile companies are about to introduce a new generation of device – this could cause serious problems.Mr Bush has the power to stop the import ban from taking effect, and he has delegated it to the US trade representative, who has until August 6 to intervene. It is not an easy decision. Qualcomm has commissioned economists to say that the ban will cost US consumers and producers as much as $20bn – not counting the allegedly dire effects on US productivity of having only existing models of mobile phones to gab on. Plenty of congressmen have weighed in to say the harm will not end there: emergency personnel, it seems, also cannot function without the latest-model mobile. Unless the administration overturns the import ban, no American can feel safe – or so the argument goes.No administration has taken such action in a very long time. It is 20 years since the political branch overruled an ITC import ban, and it happened very rarely before then. ”Over the past two decades there’s been very little involvement by the political side of the government in what has become a very healthy and effective dispute resolution mechanism for IP holders. The injection of a political angle to it could be unsettling for companies looking for predictability,” says Smith Brittingham, an ITC expert at the law firm Finnegan Henderson. The president would be well within his rights to do so, but his job is to weigh the public interest – which includes not just the transient desires of those who covet a new cellular toy, but also the long-term effects of patent rights on American innovation.It is a tough balance. If the patent rights are too strong, the economy and the consumer suffer; if they are too weak, the same thing happens, but in a different time frame. The US Congress is also thrashing out legislation to strike a new balance between the rights of patent-holders and those who wish to invent things without tripping over other people’s patents. It is hard to know where the correct balance lies.Broadcom says that if the president overturns the import ban, he will have declared a “patent-free enforcement zone” that mobile phone companies can exploit to ignore intellectual property rights. Qualcomm says that is nonsense: it says the ITC had no authority to ban handset imports, since the handset companies were not even named in the Broadcom complaint.The dispute is Byzantine, but the stakes are high. The politicians should stay out of it. If they do – and the import ban takes full effect – the antagonists will doubtless settle. That should have happened long ago. In the end, this is a dispute about money. The market can fix it better than the politicians.patti.waldmeir@ft.com"
697;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-07-16T16:38:15Z;Mobile TV format hits crunch point;;A drive to spur Europeans to watch television on their mobile phones reaches a crucial point on Tuesday when Brussels backs one technology as a European Union standard for the service.Viviane Reding, EU media commissioner, could clash with parts of the telecoms industry when she picks the Nokia and Motorola-supported DVB-H format as the “strongest contender” for union-wide use.Mobile TV involves transmitting shows such as live broadcasts, news and sports directly to customers’ handsets, for a charge. It is a nascent industry, with commercial operations in just a handful of countries.Ms Reding will say that DVB-H, developed by an industry consortium, is the most widely-adopted of three technologies offering the service in the EU. Rival systems include one provided by US group Qualcomm, and DMB, widely in use in South Korea.Her call for a single standard is controversial because some industry members believe the market should be allowed to choose technologies. Some operators have invested in rival systems for mobile TV.Examples of existing services include Virgin Mobile’s offering in the UK using DMB-based technology, while Vodafone, T-Mobile and 02 plan to show mobile TV in Germany using the DVB-H system, according to a paper by Ms Reding.Brussels argues that a common format would avoid market fragmentation, and Ms Reding could force countries to adopt DVB-H as soon as next year.In a statement to be released on Tuesday, she will say a swift decision is needed because events such as next year’s European football championships and the Olympics could be pivotal in boosting mobile TV viewing.However, some companies are cautious about the service’s money-spinning potential, as they seek fresh revenues as traditional call-based businesses mature. They say customers need to be persuaded to pay for shows.A related factor that could influence the growth of mobile viewing is telecoms companies’ access to ultra­efficient radio spectrum that will be liberated in the next few years.Mobile phone operators in the EU are vying for use of the valuable resource once the union switches from analogue to digital television. The changeover is due to be completed in 2012.For now, the radio spectrum is the domain of television broadcasters, but telecoms groups say they could use it to offer cheaper and easier access to broadband internet services.The heads of Nokia and Vodafone last week warned that Europe risked falling behind other regions if it deferred until 2011 a decision about whether the radio spectrum should be used for anything other than broadcasting.By contrast, countries such as the US planned as soon as this year to auction some of this spectrum for mobile services.Mike Short, vice-president of research and development at Telefonica 02 Europe, said: “While mobile operators have the uncertainty, they can’t deploy anything until the spectrum is released.”
698;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-06-08T19:27:09Z;LG petitions US over Qualcomm;;LG, the South Korean handset maker, is asking the US courts to suspend a ban on imports of its high-end mobile phones that could damage its US business.LG is joining Qualcomm, the chipmaker, and telecoms operators AT&T and T-Mobile in petitioning the courts to suspend Thursday’s ruling by the US International Trade Commission to ban imports of third-generation mobile phones that contain chips by Qualcomm. The chips were deemed by the ITC to violate a patent held by rival Broadcom.LG relies heavily on the sale of Qualcomm-based phones into the North American market and is seen as one of the biggest losers from the ban. “The biggest hit will be on LG, which has the biggest exposure to the US CDMA market,” said Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura.Samsung, another key Qualcomm customer, is also likely to be hit. Motorola could also suffer as key future products, such as the new version of the Razr phone, are based on Qualcomm chips.US mobile phone operators Verizon Wireless, Sprint and AT&T will also be hard hit by the ban. Although the ban does not cover products currently on the market, it will stop the telecoms companies offering new high-end products to customers.The ban could, however, be a boost for Nokia and Sony Ericsson, whose mobile handsets do not use Qualcomm chips. Nokia has recently struggled in the US market, with sales of phones in the region falling 42.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2006.“This is definitely an opportunity that Nokia could use to its advantage,” said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight.Texas Instruments, whose chips compete with Qualcomm’s, could also see a pick-up in sales. Apple’s iPhone, which is due to be launched at the end of this month, also does not use the disputed chips, and could also benefit from Samsung and LG’s misfortune. High-end phones from the two Korean groups were seen as key competitors to the Apple phone, which could now enjoy a clearer run.The ITC order becomes final after 60 days, during which time it is reviewed by the Bush administration and can be vetoed by the president, although there are few precedents for this.
699;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
700;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-06-07T23:03:09Z;Qualcomm loses ruling on 3G phones;;A US federal agency Thursday banned the import of new models of third-generation mobile phones using chips made by Qualcomm, the world’s second-largest supplier.The International Trade Commission’s decision increased considerably the pressure on the San Diego company to settle with rival chipmaker Broadcom.The commission had found in favour of Broadcom that Qualcomm’s chips infringed its patent relating to power management – a battery-saving feature on mobile devices.The six-member ITC’s 4-2 vote follows a federal jury in Santa Ana, California, finding last week that Qualcomm had infringed three other patents owned by Broadcom.“This is certainly an order that will complicate Qualcomm’s life and make it very uncomfortable for its customers,” said Smith Brittingham, a lawyer at Finnegan Henderson and a former ITC senior investigative attorney.“In the light of this and the jury’s verdict, there’s a ball starting to roll down a hill that could make it end up considering a settlement.”Qualcomm’s key role in 3G technologies has put it at the centre of a series of legal disputes over what intellectual property it owns and how much in royalties it is entitled to charge.Nokia, the biggest handset maker, has balked at renewing a patent licensing agreement with the chipmaker this year, arguing its royalties are too high.“Qualcomm’s wilful and widespread patent infringement is particularly egregious and ironic in light of its historic practice of seeking unfair compensation for its own patent portfolio,” said David Dull, Broadcom’s general counsel, Thursday.The ITC decided on a limited exclusion order that would apply only to new models of phones imported from Friday. This compromise decision would “reduce the burden on third parties while affording meaningful relief to the patent holder”, it said.Its order becomes final after 60 days, giving time for review by the Bush administration.Qualcomm anticipated a ruling against it last week when it pre-emptively moved for the ITC to stay any order.Mr Brittingham said the agency had never stayed an exclusion order previously and Qualcomm’s probable next step would be to ask a federal circuit judge to issue a stay so that the ban could not go into effect until an appeal had been heard. An appeal could take up to two years.
701;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-06-07T19:44:00Z;Why Qualcomm cannot call it quits;;Qualcomm’s fight with Broadcom has echoes of Research in Motion’s battle with NTP, settled in March 2006 after four years of legal action.Rim paid $612m to end a patent infringement dispute with NTP that threatened to shut down its Blackberry service in the US.Qualcomm is now under pressure itself to settle with Broadcom, over infringing its patent for power management in 3G mobile phones.The International Trade Commission has ordered that the guilty chips in future phone models should be excluded from the US. However, the importation ban would hit not just Qualcomm, but handset makers such as Motorola and carriers such as AT&T, as well as consumers.Qualcomm is hoping President Bush will step in. It admitted on an analyst conference call today that a presidential veto of an ITC exclusion order is rare, but argued that a situation where so many third parties would be impacted was equally unusual.The San Diego chipmaker could spin this out longer with an appeal, but analysts asked why Qualcomm could not just reach a settlement now and put to bed its two-year dispute.“They are seeking terms that would be destructive to our business model, they are terms that we just cannot accept,” said Louis Lupin, general counsel.So it is not just about money, it seems. Rather, Broadcom brought the patent dispute in part to give itself leverage with Qualcomm on licensing its rival’s patents.Broadcom needs to licence Qualcomm’s W-CDMA technology to make its own 3G chips. Like others in the industry, notably Nokia, it has complained at the royalty rates charged by Qualcomm.It may want to tie a settlement over its power-management patent to a deal on lower W-CDMA royalties.But that would set a precedent Qualcomm would feel it could never afford.
702;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-05-24T21:36:33Z;Nokia hits back in Qualcomm dispute;;Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, on Thursday stepped up its legal battle over the level of royalties it pays chipmaker Qualcomm, announcing its first patent countersuit.The move increased the pressure from all sides on Qualcomm, which is also in dispute with rival chipmaker Broadcom and the subject of complaints by Texas Instruments and Ericsson, among others.It faces a decision from the US International Trade Commission on Friday on whether to ban the import of a class of cellphones using its chips.In the latest round of a series of legal cases spread across Europe and the US, Nokia said it had responded to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in Wisconsin last month, saying it was confident its products did not infringe two Qualcomm patents mentioned in the suit and asserting that both were invalid.In addition, it filed its first patent counter assertions for alleged infringement of six Nokia patents used in chipsets for 3G phones. It said it was seeking damages and an injunction against Qualcomm’s chipsets.“Over the past 19 months, Qualcomm has filed 11 patent litigation cases against Nokia seeking damages and injunctions,” said Rick Simonson, chief financial officer. “Nokia has now filed its first counter action to address Qualcomm’s unauthorised use of Nokia technology.”At the heart of the dispute is the expiry of a cross-licensing agreement between the two groups this year and their failure to agree a new deal. Nokia has objected to renewing the agreement on the same terms, with Qualcomm continuing to earn royalties of about 4.5 per cent of the cost of handsets containing its chips.Analysts estimate Nokia will soon be paying Qualcomm more than $1bn a year at current royalty rates.In the ITC case, Broadcom has asked for a ban on imports of cellphones using Qualcomm chips that infringe Broadcom patents. The commission found that Qualcomm infringed on a battery-saving patent. Qualcomm has argued that a ban would hurt consumers and carriers who depend on Qualcomm’s technology.The argument has spread to carriers. Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless, which depend on Qualcomm’s chips, are supporting its arguments, but AT&T and Deutsche Telekom this week urged the ITC to avoid a compromise decision.Additional reporting by Robert Anderson in Stockholm
703;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-04-01T21:40:57Z;Chips are down as laid-back chief faces legal storm;;"Silvered photogravure-style plates of text and drawings from patent submissions line a wall next to Paul Jacobs’ new office.All 33 of them represent patents awarded to the Qualcomm chief executive. They are a reminder of his engineering background and the achievements that led to him succeeding his father, Irwin, as head of the world’s second biggest mobile-phone chipmaker in July 2005, 20 years after the elder Jacobs co-founded the company.“Every so often, I will do a new project and these kind of mark all the different ones,” he says.There are technologies such as QChat and Push-to-Talk on the patent wall. A patent for a high data rate speech encoder proved significant in winning an important contract with the mobile operator Sprint. The Vocoder’s improvement to call quality was touted by Sprint in an ad featuring an audible pin-drop.“But it’s the latest baby that’s the one you’re most engrossed with,” he says.That baby is the MediaFLO live television service over mobile phones that Qualcomm has started providing to Verizon.Mr Jacobs would prefer to be occupied with such challenges than with the legal en­tan­glements that have beset his company as Nokia, Broadcom and other industry leaders have challenged Qualcomm patents and the royalty rates it charges for licensing them.The third of four sons, Mr Jacobs became employee number 31 at Qualcomm after earning a PhD in electrical engineering. He feels he has struck a balance between management and en­gineering experience, including taking charge of Qualcomm’s short-lived handset business at 34.Ten years later, his management style has an informality his fastidious father lacked – famously, he turned up for his chief executive interview in shorts. That attitude may be what the company needs to defuse some of the tension caused by the multiple legal challenges it faces.“I do try to present an atmosphere that is a little more laid back. At a time like this, with people attacking us, being calm, not getting all up tight, not yelling at people unless they need it, I think that works,” he says.When he speaks to the Financial Times on a sunny Southern Californian day at Qualcomm’s new headquarters in San Diego, the gathering storm seems far off.The company, which reported profits of $2.5bn on revenues of $7.5bn in its last fiscal year, has come to dominate the skyline, with more than a dozen buildings across the city and its name branding the stadium of the San Diego Chargers NFL team.The story began with Mr Jacob’s father Irwin, now 73, who thought he could change the world of telecoms by adapting a little-known military wireless technology called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for the mobile phone industry.There were many doubters, but winning the Sprint contract and success in South Korea, China and India saw CDMA become a significant challenger to GSM as a mobile standard in second-generation handsets.Qualcomm spent a large proportion of its revenues on research and development, which meant CDMA gained a dominant position in third-generation phones with the CDMA 2000 standard and the widely accepted W-CDMA standard it helped develop.But this led to complaints to the European Commission by com­petitors such as Texas Instruments, Nokia and Ericsson. They said Qualcomm was abusing its position and charging excessive royalty rates of about 4.5 per cent for W-CDMA chips.“It is kind of ironic if you think that the number one [mobile] chipset manufacturer, the number one handset manufacturer and the number one infrastructure manufacturer are pointing at us and saying we’re the dominant ones,” Mr Jacobs says.The complaints and other legal action also seemed timed to take advantage of any hiatus in leadership at Qualcomm. “When I took over, I felt like these religious wars of technology were going to be over and we’d all focus on opportunities, but it didn’t
take too long for my competitors to set me straight,” he says.His response has been a fierce legal defence of Qualcomm’s patents and practices. The company warned in January that it expected to pay more than $200m in legal costs in its current fiscal year.The biggest dispute will come to a head in the next few days, with Qualcomm and Nokia deadlocked over the terms of renewing a cross-licensing deal concerning their respective patents, which expires on April 9.“A lot of people think Armageddon’s going to happen on April 10, but I’m hopeful we can avoid that and a massive escalation, but it’s hard to know.”Litigation is likely if no agreement emerges, with Qualcomm expected to seek injunctions to prevent Nokia shipping mobile phones with chips that use its patents.At the new building, the mood is calm and spacious, the rooms insulated from the screaming jets of the nearby Miramar air base.In contrast to the cubicle culture of the world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, company policy is to give all engineers an office. “That’s been part of the Qualcomm culture all along and it comes from the recognition that our assets are not factories but our employees and their ideas. Having that kind of space for people so they can be contemplative and come up with the next new idea is important.”One building that stands out is the MediaFLO operations centre, combining TV editing suites with a network centre monitoring TV channels and broadcast towers around the country.Qualcomm, with no experience in the business, has spent $800m on setting up a nationwide broadcast network and recruiting content partners to provide a multi-channel TV service for mobile phones.With operators Verizon and Cingular now embracing the technology, the hope is that Qualcomm is priming the pump for a new market for its chips that enable television.Mr Jacobs is convinced of the project’s importance to Qualcomm. “If we don’t take those kind of risks then we are going to be commoditised ourselves.”Loosening the family tiesFew chief executives of public companies face the prospect of confronting their father as chairman of the board. Luckily for Paul Jacobs, such incidents have been few since he took over last year from Irwin Jacobs, his father and the co-founder of Qualcomm.“Everybody tells these stories about people who are founders in businesses having a very hard time stepping back and letting the new management team run things,” he says. “But it’s a testament to him that he has done that.”His father has backed him strongly in the face of the barrage of legal attacks Qualcomm has suffered from its rivals recently.“We have our arguments about things, but he realises that I’m running the company and he’s supportive of that and that’s not easy.”Qualcomm’s culture has also undergone a subtle change in the past year. The less formal son soon challenged Jacobs Snr’s rule that all key executives must wear a tie. “It was a very subtle thing that made you ask: ‘Am I a key executive?’ And all of us decided none of us were key on Fridays.”The day after the board elected him as his father’s successor, he arrived at work without a tie. “He kind of looked at me, and then all the other guys around the table, and you could see over time how different people took their ties off at different times through the transition period from March to July.“It was a very funny thing, and now if you have a board meeting with Irwin, you still wear a tie. It’s a sign of respect.”"
704;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm hopes to avoid Nokia conflict;;Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, says he hopes “Armageddon” can be avoided in a week’s time, when an all-out patent war could break out between the number two chipmaker for mobile phones and Nokia, the number one handset maker.A long-standing cross-licensing agreement between the two companies is due to expire on April 9 and failure to reach agreement on terms could lead to both taking legal action to block the sale of handsets that contain their intellectual property.“The two teams are pretty polarised. I’m hopeful that we can avoid Armageddon and a massive escalation but it’s hard to know,” he said in a Financial Times interview.Nokia is objecting to renewing the agreement on the same terms, where Qualcomm is understood to be earning royalties of 4.5 per cent of the cost of handsets containing its chips.Qualcomm is behind the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) wireless standard that rivalled GSM (Global System for Mobile) in second-generation phones and has become more influential in third-generation (3G) ones. Qualcomm also uses Nokia patent in some of its chips.Rick Simonson, Nokia’s chief financial officer, says Qualcomm’s patents play less of a role in the W-CDMA 3G standard and therefore its royalties should be lower.“You don’t want everybody to have 4.5 per cent royalty rates so that when you add it up the device has an unbearable tax on it,” he said.Qualcomm counters that the royalties are justified by the hundreds of millions of dollars it has spent on research and development that has enabled handset manufacturers to produce sophisticated and cost-effective phones.Nokia does have a unilateral option to extend the agreement until December, but that would mean continuing to pay the existing royalty rate.“There’s various degrees of disagreement over how the mechanics of that might work,” Mr Jacobs said.Richard Windsor, Nomura telecoms equipment analyst, said recently Nokia, with 40 per cent of the W-CDMA market, would soon be paying Qualcomm more than $1bn a year at current royalty rates.“For Qualcomm, the stakes are even higher as the industry will use the outcome as a yardstick for all future negotiations. We think that Qualcomm is fighting for its survival as losing to Nokia will punch a massive hole in its business model,” he said.
705;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-03-19T15:12:38Z;Nokia files lawsuits over chip royalties;;Legal wrangling between technology giants Nokia and Qualcomm has intensified after the Finnish mobile phone maker filed two suits claiming the US company’s patents in Europe had expired.Nokia is hoping a victory will mean it no longer has to pay Qualcomm royalties for chips made by the US company that it uses in Nokia mobile phones sold in Europe.Yesterday’s move carries particular significance as it comes amid protracted and heated negotiations between the two companies over the renewal of a broader technology licensing agreement.This agreement expires on April 9 and involves global fees that Nokia pays Qualcomm for the use of its technology in all its mobile phones, running to tens of millions of dollars a year.The two companies are fighting in and out of court over the renewal, with Nokia demanding the fees be reduced and Qualcomm trying to maintain them at existing levels.Nokia’s decision to challenge the viability of Qualcomm’s patents in Europe is an aggressive ploy to pressure the US company to settle before April 9, people close to the situation said.Qualcomm supplies chips for mobile phones based on CDMA, a widely-used US mobile technology, and is also a supplier of chips based on W-CMDA, which is popular in Europe.The US firm has filed a complaint against Nokia with the US International Trade Commission alleging the Finnish company infringed its patents and has also taken legal action in the US.The latest skirmish appears linked to last week’s agreement between Qualcomm and Broadcom, a US rival, over patent-related issues, which allowed the two to avoid a series of lengthy, expensive and potentially damaging trials over the issue.Nokia filed its suits in Germany and the Netherlands and hopes the case will be referred to the European Court of Justice, a process that could take several months.
706;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Qualcomm raises forecasts amid handset growth;;Qualcomm, the number two maker of chips for mobile phones, on Tuesday raised second-quarter revenue and profit expectations – a sign it could be gaining ground on market leader Texas Instruments.Qualcomm said it expected revenues of $2.1bn to $2.2bn, up from estimates of $2.0bn to $2.1bn for the quarter ending April 1, and earnings per share of 48 to 49 cents. Previously it expected 42 to 44 cents.The San Diego-based company said its figures were based on the shipment of 60m to 61m Mobile Station Modem chips for phones, compared with its previous estimate of 55 to 57m units.Qualcomm shares closed up 4.25 per cent in New York at $41.83. Texas Instrument shares fell 2.61 per cent at $31.74.TI updated its first-quarter outlook on Monday by narrowing the range of its forecasts and trimming the top end. It predicted revenues of $3.07bn to $3.22bn, compared with the previous range of $3.01bn to $3.28bn. Profits per share of 29 to 33 cents were narrowed from earlier forecasts of 28 to 34 cents.The numbers disappointed investors, but Merrill Lynch analysts said the news represented a buying opportunity ahead of an industry upturn.Joe Osha, semiconductor analyst, predicted back-to-back sequential growth of 10 per cent or more over the next two quarters for TI.He said concerns about possible market share losses would not be a factor this year. Nokia, TI’s main customer, has been looking to diversify its supplier base, but TI has been diversifying its customer base, most notably with Motorola.Qualcomm has pioneered the CDMA mobile phone standard that has competed with the GSM standard in second-generation phones and is becoming dominant with 3G handsets. It said royalties being paid in its second quarter for CDMA licences suggested 91m CDMA phones shipped in the last quarter at an average selling price of $214, compared with estimates of 82m to 86m units at $217.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said Qualcomm’s estimates reflected strong growth in chipsets and handsets as operators deployed 3G WCDMA and CDMA2000 mobile broadband around the world.
707;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Mobile TV chip rivals step up standards battle;;The battle between two rival standards for delivering television to mobile phones heated up on Monday with announcements by Qualcomm, the chipmaker, and Nokia, the handset maker.San Diego-based Qualcomm said it had signed an agreement to deliver mobile entertainment and information services to AT&T (formerly Cingular) in the US, using its MediaFLO television technology.The deal means Qualcomm has won the support of the two biggest US carriers for its technology – it signed up Verizon Wireless in December 2005.Nokia supports the open DVB-H standard for mobile TV and announced a handset based on this at the 3GSM mobile conference in Barcelona. The Nokia N77 will be available in the second quarter in Europe, where DVB-H has won the greatest acceptance.Qualcomm maintains its proprietary MediaFLO technology is superior to DVB-H.“It gives fast channel switching, you are basically holding a remote control in your hand,” Gina Lombardi, president of MediaFLO USA, told the Financial Times.“The picture quality and the battery life is also great – this was designed for mobility from the ground up, whereas DVB-H has morphed into that.”However, Frost & Sullivan, the research firm, predicted this month that the DVB-H market would grow from $60m in 2006 to $2bn in 2010, with it offering a better delivery system for video than other technologies.Qualcomm announced a chip on Monday that supported both MediaFLO and DVB-H, as well as the lesser known ISDB-T standard.The chipmaker also said it had successfully completed a second set of technical trials for MediaFLO with BSkyB, the broadcaster, in Manchester.While Qualcomm pushes its solution in the UK and Japan, the chipmaker faces competition at home where rivals Crown Castle and Hiwire are building DVB-H networks.Verizon is due to launch its V CAST Mobile TV service in the current quarter on the MediaFLO network, while AT&T’s service is expected to be available in late 2007.
708;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2007-01-24T23:26:08Z;Qualcomm warns of escalating costs;;Qualcomm, the second-largest cell phone chipmaker, warned on Wednesday it faced escalating legal costs and reduced profits after failing to make any progress in its royalty dispute with Nokia.A cross-licensing agreement that allows the number-one handset maker to use Qualcomm’s technology expires on April 9 and negotiations between the two sides on an extension had not even come close to a resolution, Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an earnings conference call.This could mean Nokia not paying royalties on patents after April 9, while Qualcomm would lose its rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia patents.Qualcomm said this could take 4 to 6 cents off its diluted earnings per share in its fourth quarter ending in September. It also expected to pay more than $200m in legal costs this fiscal year. “This is more than we previously estimated but these attacks go to the heart of our business model and we feel quite strongly it is money well spent,” said Steve Altman, president.He said there had been an orchestrated attack on Qualcomm by a group known as Project Stockholm that included the number one handset, infrastructure and chipset makers in Nokia, Ericsson and Texas Instruments. A major objective was to decrease the royalties they pay to Qualcomm.“The current environment represents an unprecedented level of attacks on our business,” he said, adding the company felt it was unlikely it would resolve its dispute with Nokia by the deadline.Qualcomm has come under attack through the courts and complaints to government bodies such as the European Union over the royalties it charges for its CDMA technology.Qualcomm shares were 2 per cent higher in after-hours trading at $39.46.
709;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Motorola shares fall on sales warning;;Shares in Motorola, the second largest mobile phone maker after Finland’s Nokia, fell by as much as 12 per cent in early trading on Friday after the US company warned that “an unfavourable geographical and product-tier mix of sales” meant sales and earnings in the fourth quarter would be lower than expected.The shares fell by $2.20, or 10.7 per cent, to $18.35 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after sinking as low as $18 earlier in the session – their lowest level since July 2004.Motorola’s disappointing outlook dragged down Nokia and chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and Qualcomm.The warning, issued on Thursday after the US markets had closed, triggered downgrades for Motorola from analysts who said that while unit sales remained strong, fierce price competition in the fourth quarter had driven down average selling prices.Motorola said it sold about 66m handsets during the quarter, up 23 per cent from the third quarter of 2006 and 48 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2005.However, analysts said that Motorola had cut prices of many of its most popular handsets in the run-up to the holiday season to maintain market share.Motorola’s popular but ageing Razr phone and the Q smartphone were among the handsets hardest hit, analysts said. Demand for the KRZR K1, the successor to the Razr, had been lower than expected.Motorola now expected to earn 13-16 cents per share on sales of $11.6bn-$11.8bn (£6bn-£6.1bn), down from estimates of $11.8bn-$12.1bn. The figure includes about 10 cents in charges.“We are very disappointed with our fourth-quarter financial performance,” said Ed Zander, chief executive.Motorola gave few details of the causes of the shortfall, other than saying the problems were in its mobile devices segment. Fourth-quarter results for both the networks, enterprise and connected home segments are expected to meet or exceed internal expectations at the start of the quarter.

Uncertainty over the economy and interest rate policy has buffeted sentiment for stocks, outside of technology, in the first week of trading this year.“Stocks don’t seem to have the robust feel they showed during the fourth quarter,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. He expects equity volatility to continue rising as the debate over the economy and Federal Reserve policy plays out.The S&P 500 settled 0.1 per cent, or 1.74 points, firmer at 1,418.34. Of the 10 major index groups in the S&P, information technology led gains, with a rise of 1.8 per cent, while energy fell 1.9 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent, or 6.17 points, to 12,480.69.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.3 per cent, or 30.27 points, higher at 2,453.43. The Philadelphia semi-conductor index rose 1.8 per cent, repairing some of its 2.6 per cent decline in 2006.Among the leaders in tech, was Intel, whose shares jumped 4 per cent to $21.17 on hopes of higher earnings. QualComm gained 4.5 per cent to $39.15, while broker upgrades helped boost Amgen 4.3 per cent to $71.33.Cisco shares reversed an early decline to trade 2.6 per cent higher at $28.46 after the company announced that it had purchased e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.The 9 per cent slide in oil prices this week kept the energy sector under pressure, with Exxon Mobil down 1.9 per cent at $72.72 and Chevron off 1 per cent at $70.28.But the big news in the sector was from ConocoPhillips. Its shares slipped
3.1 per cent to $66.07 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.On the up was Altria Group, which set a 52-week high for the second consecutive day on expectations of solid fourth-quarter earnings this month.The stock rose as high as $87.87, before closing $87.65, up 1.3 per cent.In earnings news, Monsanto posted fiscal first quarter 2007 net income of
16 cents a share, beating a forecast of 10 cents.But shares in the seed company fell 1.7 per cent to $50.79 as it said full-year results would fall shy of analysts’ forecasts.Choppy trading infused the retail sector as same-store sales for December were a mixed bag.According to Thomson Financial, 22 companies beat estimates, while 24 missed their forecast sales last month. Wal-Mart rose 0.5 per cent to $47.78 as it confirmed that sales rose 1.6 per cent last month. Shares in Costco rose 2.3 per cent to $54.07 as it beat sales estimates. Target rallied 0.7 per cent to $57.59."
711;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-12-26T23:18:00Z;Media groups aim to ring up sales to mobiles;;Media companies including News Corp’s MySpace and Viacom’s MTV Networks plan to cash in on the booming mobile phone market by offering a growing array of content and services.The emphasis on selling content to mobile phone users, who are expected to pay either via monthly subscription fees or through fees for using data services on their phones, is also important for mobile carriers such as Cingular, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel as they look for ways to expand.Mobile carriers in the US, as elsewhere, hope that the increasing use of premium data services will offset pressure on their revenues from competition for voice calls.However, there will be a tussle among media groups and mobile phone carriers about which side controls the relationship with consumers and how revenue is shared.“The mobile business model is going to be somewhat fluid,” said Chris DeWolfe, co-founder and chief executive of MySpace, in a recent interview. “And it will be different in every country, with some having more advertising-based applications and some charging a small monthly fee.”However, media and content companies believe that mobile phone users, who are used to paying extra for text messages, ringtones and mobile games, may be more willing to pay for services than internet users who expect to access online content for free.This month, MySpace, the world’s largest social networking site, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, signed a deal with Cingular, the biggest US carrier, to allow users to edit and view their profiles and post photos as well as send and receive messages.Last month, Viacom’s MTV Networks created a centralised group to try to increase its participation in the mobile phone business. This group will develop ringtones, games, videos and other material based on its various brands to sell to mobile phone carriers. MTV’s push reflects a broader realisation among media companies that mobile phone services could form an important component of evolving digital businesses.It is a global phenomenon. MySpace is also in talks with European and Asia carriers, for example.MTV has deals in place with all the big carriers and claims to be the leading supplier of video content to mobile phone carriers – publishing more than 600 clips and 30 hours per month in the US.US mobile carriers including the “big four” networks – Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit – are in the midst of rolling out their 3G networks and are hoping that the fees on mobile video and TV services in particular will help to pay for their network investments.Analysts, many of whom remain unconvinced that premium-priced mobile TV services will succeed, believe 2007 will be a crucial year for mobile video in the US.They point out that Sprint Nextel plans to begin a dedicated mobile video service in the first quarter based on Qualcomm’s Media Flow technology.
712;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Shift to telecoms as Agere and LSI link up;;LSI Logic’s $4bn merger with Agere Systems and two significant acquisitions by Qualcomm on Monday highlighted consolidation in the semiconductor industry and a shift of focus towards telecommunications.Silicon Valley’s LSI said it would combine with the Pennsylvania-based Agere Systems in an all-stock transaction, with LSI shareholders owning 52 per cent of the merged company and its name being preserved.San Diego’s Qualcomm acquired the Bluetooth chip division of RF Micro Devices for $39m and bought Airgo Networks, a Silicon Valley wireless chip start-up, for an undisclosed sum.Private equity groups have also become involved in the sector. Freescale Semiconductor, a big supplier of chips for mobile phones spun off by Motorola two years ago, accepted a $17.6bn takeover bid in September from a group including Blackstone, Carlyle Group, Permira Funds and Texas Pacific Group.Intel admitted defeat in its ambition to penetrate the mobile phone market in June, selling its cell-phone processor division to Marvell Technology for $600m.Marvell will now face a bigger rival as LSI seeks to exploit Agere’s mobile-phone chips and relationship with Samsung while expanding its own hard-drive chip business. Marvell has a 40 per cent market share in hard-drive controller chips for servers.LSI and Agere combined had revenues of $3.5bn in the 12 months to September 30 and a workforce of 9,100. Agere’s stockholders will receive 2.16 shares of LSI for each of theirs, worth $22.81 for each Agere share, for a total of about $4bn. The offer amounts to a 23 per cent premium to Agere’s closing price on Friday.LSI shares closed down nearly 14 per cent, or $1.44, at $9.12 on Monday.Qualcomm’s purchase of Airgo could prove a significant addition to its extensive communications patent portfolio.Airgo developed a technology known as Mimo (multiple in, multiple out) for transmitting data faster wirelessly using an array of antennae. Mimo is the basis for the 802.11n wi-fi standard being incorporated in the latest computers.Analysts at Merrill Lynch said they thought Qualcomm’s main motive in buying the division was to beef up its high-speed portfolio and develop faster Bluetooth chips.Qualcomm shares closed 3.16 per cent, or $1.15, higher at $37.50 on Monday.
713;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-11-22T19:12:38Z;Nearing the magic billion;;"This is a golden year for the cellphone industry and all who sail with it.
More than a quarter of a billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in the third quarter, according to today’s figures from Gartner, and with the holiday season ahead, there must be a chance of hitting 1bn this year for the first time.
Sales of 251m in Q3 were up 21.5 per cent on last year and Gartner raised its full-year forecast to 986m units, with 281m forecast in Q4.
For chipmakers, it has been nothing but good news for the likes of Texas Instruments, the biggest supplier of chips for cellphones, and Qualcomm.
But this may be the best of times as slower growth lies ahead, according to Informa Telecoms & Media. It predicted last month annual growth of around 16 per cent this year will have declined to 3 per cent by 2011, when 1.255bn phones will be sold.
""The growth in developing markets such as India, China and Latin America is impressive but we are not seeing the same levels of phone take-up per capita,"" said Dave McQueen, Principal Analyst.
""With handset sales in saturated developed markets being much slower and reliant on replacement of old models, the net effect is a major slowdown in overall rate of growth from next year.""

But he said he did not recommend that an order banning Qualcomm chips in the US should also cover mobile phones made by other companies.Qualcomm shares were 2.8 per cent higher on the news at $37.27 in midday trading in New York, while Broadcom shares fell 2.8 per cent to $28.76.The judge ruled that Qualcomm had not infringed two other Broadcom patents. His decision is subject to review by the full commission and can then be challenged in the federal appeals court.Last week, a judge in San Diego tried unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the the chairmen of the two companies. Irwin Jacobs of Qualcomm met Broadcom’s Henry Samueli for more than five hours but they failed to reach a deal on extensive patent disputes that include allegations of theft of company secrets and anti-competitive actions.Court cases and complaints to regulators are also taking place in New Jersey, Europe and South Korea.Broadcom is appealing a New Jersey antitrust case that was thrown out in August due to insufficient evidence. It is also one of six chip and cellphone makers that complained to the European Commission last year, alleging anti-competitive practices by Qualcomm in charging royalties that were too high for its patents.Qualcomm is the number two maker of chips for cellphones behind Texas Instruments.

719;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-09-19T17:19:16Z;Alan Cane: Trolls control the rickety-rackety bridge of intellectual property;;For some, the latest Sony Ericsson mobile phone is a miracle of miniaturisation. Comprising 3G phone, camera, media player, music player and Bluetooth wireless connection, it crams all that technology into the dimensions of a conventional handset.But for those of a legal bent, the device, and others like it, have the appearance of a paper mountain: the stack of cross-licensing agreements and licences the manufacturer has had to agree with contemporaries and competitors to use technologies it does not own.Qualcomm, for example, a small US-based company, holds many of the basic patents to third generation mobile phone technology and is entitled to royalties from 3G phone manufacturers.This pattern is common across the technologically-based industries: the pace of progress is such that few companies can own all the technology they need to create their products and therefore must cross-license or pay royalties to the patent holder. In earlier days, manufacturers would agree cross-licensing deals that meant little cash changed hands.Things are different today and inevitably consumers are paying higher prices than would otherwise be the case. Bird & Bird, the international legal firm, calculates that “royalty stacking” – the cumulative cost of all the licences involved – may amount to as much as 30 per cent of the sales value of a product such as a mobile phone or a personal computer.There is therefore considerable disquiet about the activities of “patent trolls” – an expression coined by Peter Detkin when he was assistant general counsel for Intel Corporation. These are companies that own patents they have neither developed nor intend to use to create products – but from which they attempt to extract a revenue stream in the form of royalty payments from genuine manufacturers.They frequently raise substantial warchests to buy patents in the open market. Even worse, there are “patent trolls with attitude”: companies that participate in or monitor standards-setting processes without revealing, until it is too late, that they hold patents essential to the standard. (”Essential” is an interesting concept. Who is responsible for making the judgment that a patent is essential? And are there ways to work around apparently essential patents?)The cost to a company that is successfully sued for patent infringement can be serious, especially in the US where juries set the figure and are empowered to inflict triple damages: “You cannot guess what the figure is going to be,” says Katharine Stephens of Bird & Bird.Joe Beyers, Hewlett-Packard’s top intellectual property executive wrote recently that patent trolls: “Wield the power to bring the companies that actually make and sell products to their knees,” warning that a troll can seek an injunction on a company’s product shipments even though it, the troll, has neither customers nor market share to lose.Where standards are involved entire industries can be put at risk. The reason is that standards, even when less than perfect, are critical for progress in technology: they ensure that multiple vendors are all singing from the same songsheet.When a standard is agreed, the companies involved invest time and money in creating manufacturing facilities and writing software suites. The cost of unpicking all this and starting afresh can be prohibitive. A troll holding a previously undisclosed but valid and essential patent to some part of the standard can therefore hold an industry to ransom.So trolls are becoming notorious and the legal profession in Europe and the US is looking for ways to curb their activities. US politicians, for example, want to see laws to prevent “exorbitant” patent infringement settlements.But although troll activities could be regarded as reprehensible and an abuse of the innovation process – reaping where they have not sown – the fact is that they are doing nothing wrong. Patents are property and can be bought and sold. There is nothing wrong with holding an asset from which you hope to profit.And some companies, through no fault of their own, are unable to make conventional use of their patents. Rodime, for example, a brilliant Scottish hard drive manufacturer, held a number of important patents but could not compete with the larger US drive makers. It lived off royalties for years before transforming itself into the gaming company Sportech in the early years of the century.It would help, of course, if some test could be devised to distinguish the trolls from companies such as Rodime. But in the end, the question is not whether trolls are entitled to royalties from licensing their patents, and to damages from their infringement, but at what level payments should be set.In law, the watchword is “Frand” – fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory. The problem, it seems, is that there is considerable confusion over just what this means in cash terms. It may take a high-profile court case or three for sensible guidelines to be set.But until this happens, high technology companies tramping over the rickety-rackety bridge of intellectual property rights will have good cause to fear the troll beneath, and consumers will continue to pay more than is necessary for their products.

722;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
723;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Alcatel eyes Nortel’s UTMS network;;Alcatel, the French telecoms equipment provider, unveiled plans to buy Nortel’s UMTS cellphone network unit for $320m on Friday, aiming to become the world’s third-largest supplier of 3G wireless technology.The deal underlines Alcatel’s ambition to gain scale in a fast-growing market, building on its planned merger with US rival Lucent, which must be approved by a two-thirds majority of shareholders on Thursday. Marc Rouanne, Alcatel’s head of mobile communications, told a conference call the transaction would also strengthen the group’s position in mature Western European mobile markets – previously a weakness – and increase its R&D capacity.Under the non-binding agreement, Alcatel would buy the UMTS radio access business with related assets including its product portfolio, patents and contracts to serve an additional 14 customers. The sale of Nortel’s 3G unit will enable the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker to simplify its business and focus on next generation 4G wireless broadband and other high-growth businesses.“Nortel is sharpening its focus on the markets in which we intend to lead,” said Mike Zafirovski, who was brought in as Nortel’s chief executive to rejuvenate the company after an accounting scandal. “Our UMTS access business lacks the scale and momentum needed to become profitable.”Nortel’s combined GSM and UMTS businesses generated about $2.8bn in revenues in 2005, when it recorded a pre-tax loss of $4m.A Lucent profit warning in July triggered a slide in both its shares and those of Alcatel and cut the value of their merger by about 20 per cent. Since then, speculation has grown that Alcatel’s shareholders might seek a renegotiation of the share exchange rate on which the offer is based. Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel’s chief executive, this week answered criticisms from Proxinvest, a French investor advisor, which had argued shareholders should reject the merger.“It is not possible to change the terms of the merger,” he said in an interview with Les Echos, the FT’s sister paper, calling it “absurd to extrapolate the last quarter’s results over 10 years” and defending corporate governance plans that would allow the 68-year-old to remain in post for a relatively long time.Institutional Investor Services, the US shareholder advisory firm, recommended that investors approve the $10.4bn acquisition, arguing that the expected synergies and increase in scale offset a “degree of scepticism”.However, Clara Van der Elst, analyst at Standard & Poor’s, said the chance of shareholders rejecting the deal at next week’s meeting had risen to “something just short of 50:50”.The transaction underscores the strategy adopted by the former Motorola senior executive, who has set his sights on refocusing the company on growth markets and rebuilding its reputation as an engineering powerhouse and technology leader.Nortel has identified three core business areas for growth: next-generation mobile systems, so-called “enterprise transformation”, and services and applications. Much like its partnership with Microsoft announced in July, the sale of the 3G business to Alcatel is seen as another key step in this strategic shift.“With next-generation mobility, we see an opportunity to change the game by applying our networking expertise and technology innovation to significantly alter the economic paradigm of mobility solutions in the future,” said Mr Zafirovski who also emphasized that Nortel remains committed to the mobile telecommunications infrastructure business and to the development of 4G systems based on emerging technologies.Nortel currently has about 10 per cent of the UMTS 3G market, while Alcatel has about 4 per cent and Lucent Technologies, which is mainly focused on the rival CDMA technology developed by Qualcomm has another 2 per cent. Market leaders Nokia and Ericsson have in excess of 30 per cent market share each.

There’s not a lot of catalytic news this week,” he said.Mr Dow downplayed the importance of comments by Mr Moskow. “I don’t think anybody is viewing this as any change in Fed posture.”Electricity generator Mirant said shareholders had tendered enough shares for it to proceed with its 43m share buyback programme.

725;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Samsung cheers Sprint Nextel’s WiMAX plans;;"When Sprint Nextel, the third largest US wireless carrier, announced plans last week to roll out a new broadband wireless network based on so-called WiMAX technology, the loudest applause came from a group of Samsung executives sitting near the back of the room.Samsung is one of three technology partners for Sprint Nextel, which plans to spend up to $3.5bn over the next two years building the new 4G network, which is expected to be available to about 100m Americans by the end of 2008.The other technology partners are Intel, the US chipmaker, and Motorola, the US mobile phone maker, which, like Samsung, have invested heavily in the development and promotion of the Mobile WiMAX (802.16e) standard that will form the technological backbone of the new network.For all three, Sprint Nextel’s decision represents an important validation of the broadband wireless technology as well as a valuable business opportunity. But for Samsung, and KiTae Lee, president of Samsung Electronics’ telecommunications network business, who was on stage with Gary Forsee, Sprint Nextel’s chief executive, the decision was particularly sweet.Samsung, which developed a version of WiMAX dubbed ""WiBro,"" helped Korean Telecom became the first the first wireless carrier to deploy the technology commercially when it launched a mobile WiMAX service in five neighbourhoods in and around the capital Seoul earlier this year.“The KT service proves mobile WiMAX works,” says Hwan Chung, vice president of Samsung’s Mobile WiMAX marketing group in Samsung’s telecommunications network business unit.Samsung demonstrates the service, which supports download speeds of between two and four megabits per second and costs $30-a-month, in a vehicle using a laptop PC equipped with a WiMAX data card. Aside from basic features like broadband web browsing and search, the service supports mobile video conferencing and multimedia services.“Korea is an ideal test bed for new technologies like WiMAX,” says Mr Chung, who spends much of his time travelling overseas these days promoting the technology and Samsung’s expertise in its deployment.Aside from the Korean WiBro services, Samsung is involved in WiMAX trials and ""pre-commercial"" deployments in Europe, the Middle East, South America, Japan and now North America.In the US, Samsung will provide Sprint Nextel with dual-mode phones that will work on the wireless carrier’s existing network and the new WiMAX network. Along with Intel and Motorola, Samsung will also build the network infrastructure.“Sprint Nextel customers will be able to experience a nationwide mobile data network that is designed to offer faster speeds, lower cost and greater convenience and enhanced multimedia quality,” said Mr Forsee.Among the key advantages of WiMAX over competing 4G technologies is that since it is an internet protocol-based technology, the chips that support it are expected to be relatively inexpensive. It also uses precious wireless spectrum extremely efficiently.“The WiMAX technology to be deployed in the network is expected to offer a cost per megabit and performance advantage that reflects a substantial improvement in the comparable costs for current 3G mobile broadband offerings,” said Sprint Nextel.That in turn should enable carriers and new entrants like cable companies and satellite operators who are weighing the technology, to offer wireless broadband at relatively low cost.Sprint Nextel for example, says prices will be considerably less than the $60-a-month it currently charges subscribers for unlimited access to its 3G EVDO (Evolution Data Optimised) network.The mobile carrier plans to deploy WiMAX in the nationwide 2.5Ghz spectrum that it owns. Barry West, Sprint’s chief technology officer, said the US carrier evaluated a number of competing technologies before selecting WiMAX, including Flarion’s Flash-OFDM technology acquired last year by Qualcomm, and IPWireless’ UMTS-TDD technology, but said neither were “good fits”.By selecting WiMAX, Sprint Nextel has also positioned itself to leapfrog domestic competitors. “I believe Sprint Nextel’s decision to deploy mobile WiMAX as the 4G network technology will set a milestone in the US telecommunications industry’s history and contribute to further advancements in wireless technology,” said Mr Lee. “Mobile WiMAX-based services will create a new paradigm shift in wireless services and improve consumer lifestyles.”"

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange’s semiconductor index has risen more than 7 per cent in the past three days.Broadcom leapt 8.9 per cent to $30.38 on news that the International Trade Commission had extended by 50 days an investigation into the alleged infringement of a Broadcom patent by wireless technology group Qualcomm.Qualcomm was not adversely affected, instead jumping 6.7 per cent to $37.83 following bullish comments by Merrill Lynch.Another chipmaker, Xilinx, announced late on Tuesday that it had uncovered no evidence of fraud in its stock options grants. Its shares rose 10 per cent to $22.71.PMC-Sierra gained 9.5 per cent to $6.11 after a Taiwanese company said it would use PMC processors for its internet telephony service.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 9.85 points, at 1,295.43, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6 per cent, or 34.53 points, at 2,149.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent, or 96.86 points, at 11,327.12.However, Merrill Lynch’s Mary Ann Bartels sounded a cautionary note about recent gains in equity markets.“We continue to believe that while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are positioned for a rally that could carry these indexes to or through their May highs, the technical underpinnings for the rally are weak,” she said.“The possibility exists that the highs for the year and the bull market are in, and that a cyclical correction that could approach 15-20 per cent has begun, with the Nasdaq at risk for a 25-30 per cent pullback.”The only main sector to show weakness was oil, which sank as crude fell to its lowest level in six weeks. Chevron tumbled 1.4 per cent to $65.11, and Hess dropped 2.2 per cent to $49.20.Energy’s one bright spot was coal, which steamed higher after television stock commentator Jim Cramer said the sector was poised for a bounce. Peabody Energy leapt 7.1 per cent to $47.83 and Arch Coal rose 5 per cent to $36.42.Lower oil buoyed transport stocks. United Parcel Service added 4.5 per cent to $72.13, and the S&P airlines index had its best day in a month, with Continental Airlines gaining 6 per cent to $24.50.In spite of data showing a slowdown in new housing starts for July, homebuilders rallied. The stocks were boosted by a fall in 10-year bond yields to four-month lows. Pulte gained 5 per cent to $29.75, while Toll Brothers added 3.9 per cent to $25.49.
727;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Texas Instruments sees growth for wireless chips;;Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, provided some good news for the semiconductor and mobile phone industries on Monday, reporting strong growth in sales of wireless chips.TI, the biggest maker of chips for cellphones, met analysts’ second-quarter expectations of earnings of 47 cents a share or $739m from continuing operations and revenues of $3.7bn. Revenues were up by 24 per cent on a year earlier and profits up 34 per cent.Its shares rose 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading to $28.85 as its outlook also matched Wall Street’s expectations.It scotched fears of a slowdown in the cellphone market with predictions of seasonal growth in its third quarter and revenues of $3.63bn to $3.95bn and earnings per share of 42 to 48 cents.Rich Templeton, chief executive, described it as another excellent quarter.“All regions of the world showed strong revenue growth from a year ago,” he said.“Revenue from our wireless semiconductors grew 27 per cent, including more than 70 per cent growth in 3G.“Going into the third quarter, our backlog of orders is up and our outlook is for seasonal growth.”Sales of TI’s high-performance analogue semiconductors grew 32 per cent and it reported more operators were adopting GSM cellphone technologies rather than CDMA. TI is the leading GSM chip vendor, while its US rival Qualcomm licenses and manufactures CDMA chips.Ron Slaymaker, TI vice president, told analysts its results had been helped by the performance of three of its biggest customers – Nokia, Motorola and Sony Ericsson – who had reported strong revenue growth from handset sales.TI also makes chips for its patented Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology for digital TVs and reported revenues grew 34 per cent on a year earlier.Overall orders going forward were worth $3.91bn, up $302m on the previous quarter.Semiconductors make up the bulk of TI’s business, accounting for $3.5bn of revenues in the second quarter. Its calculator business recorded sales of $192m, up from $74m in the previous quarter as retailers began to stock up for the back-to-school season. Revenues from the Sensors and Control division were excluded from the figures after its sale on April 27.
728;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Intel warns as sales drop 13%;;Intel admitted on Wednesday it was unlikely to make its revenue forecasts for this year after the world’s largest semiconductor maker saw sales fall 13 per cent in its second quarter.The Silicon Valley company struggled with sliding demand and falling prices for its microprocessors to beat its lowest expectations of second-quarter sales of $8bn by just $9m, down from $9.2bn a year ago.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said 2006 revenues were now likely to be lower than forecast in April. He predicted sales of $8.3bn to $8.9bn in the third quarter and perhaps a 10 per cent increase in the fourth quarter.This suggests sales of $35bn for the year, 7 per cent less than the $37.6bn previously expected and nearly 10 per cent lower than in 2005.Intel has been suffering from soft demand for personal computers and loss of market share to its rival Advanced Micro Devices.“But I do think [this quarter] is as bad as it gets, business trends are showing improvement,” said Apjit Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Intel is introducing a new generation of processors for servers, the desktop and notebook PCs over the summer that should lift average selling prices and boost sales.“In 2006, we are delivering the strongest line-up in the industry, with many of these new products shipping ahead of schedule,” said Paul Otellini, chief executive.He told an analyst conference call that Intel was well positioned for the second half, although pricing had become more competitive.Intel hopes to win back market share from AMD with the new chips.It can make major cost savings as the latest chips are made with smaller 65nm circuitry, but AMD and Intel are locked in a price war that is damaging both.Second-quarter profits of $855m, or 15 cents a share, beat analyst expectations of 13 cents but were down 57 per cent on the $2bn recorded a year earlier.Intel has begun a restructuring programme to improve profitability, selling off its mobile phone chip business and announcing redundancies for 1,000 managers.Mr Bryant said more decisions would be taken over the next two months to take down spending and the headcount of its 100,000-strong workforce.Qualcomm, whose business is focused on making cell phone chips and licensing its technology, reported a 15 per cent jump in profits to $643m on Wednesday and a 44 per cent increase in revenues to $1.95bn in its third quarter.But its shares fell 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $34.75 as it predicted a weaker fourth quarter than Wall Street expected.Intel shares were flat at $18.47.
729;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-27T22:27:30Z;Verizon Wireless to upgrade 3G network;;Verizon Wireless, the mobile carrier jointly owned by Verizon Communications of the US and Britain’s Vodafone, announced plans to upgrade its current 3G network using technology supplied by Lucent Technologies.Seperately, Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment group that is in the process of acquiring Lucent, said its had signed a deal to supply Bell South with WiMax wireless broadband equipment for test deployment.Verizon Wireless said it would deploy the new ‘EV-DO Revision A’ technology developed by Qualcomm, the US mobile telecoms technology group, throughout its nationwide network. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The new technology, a software and hardware upgrade to Verizon’s existing EV-DO network infrastructure, will enable Verizon Wireless to introduce a range of new services such as enhanced push-to-talk, messaging, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).“EV-DO Rev. A is a robust technology that will allow us to provide our customers with new services that blend voice, data, video and multimedia applications,” said Ed Salas, vice president of network planning, Verizon Wireless.Meanwhile Bell South, the third largest US telecommunications group, said it would test equipment developed by Alcatel of France based on an emerging wireless broadband technology called WiMax. The agreement comes four months after Alcatel conducted the industry’s first live demonstration of the newly ratified WiMAX 802.16e standard.BellSouth, the first major telecom provider to commercially launch wireless broadband using pre-WiMAX technology in the US, will begin lab trials next quarter based on Alcatel’s Evolium WiMax equipment. “Alcatel believes that broadband wireless access technology offers important strategic value to carriers looking to deliver the high-speed, high-quality services that their customers expect wherever they are,” said Hubert de Pesquidoux, president of Alcatel’s North American activities.It proponents, which include Intel, the US chipmaker, claim WiMAX will enable carriers to offer a cost effective fixed, nomadic or mobile wireless broadband services in areas where DSL is unavailable for technical or economical reasons. It will also enable new carriers to offer alternative ‘last mile’ voice and broadband access services in competition with established cable and telcomms operators.
730;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-27T17:10:37Z;Intel sells communications business;;Intel has finally admitted defeat in its attempts to become a major player in the mobile phone market, selling its communications and applications processor business to Marvell Technology for $600m.The world’s biggest chipmaker has achieved the dominant position in supplying microprocessors for personal computers, but it has been no more than a niche supplier in mobile phones, where chips from its US rivals Broadcom, Freescale, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments hold sway.The sale announced on Tuesday is the first indication of the restructuring taking place at Intel. Paul Otellini, chief executive, announced in April a 90-day strategic review of the company’s operations that would “leave no stone unturned” and would particularly scrutinise loss-making parts of the corporation.While Intel will not break out numbers, the communications division is believed to be unprofitable. Marvell is expected to take on the “vast majority” of its 1,400-strong workforce and will pay $600m in cash, although Intel has the option to take $100m in stock of its Silicon Valley neighbour, which specialises in storage and communications chips.Marvell will acquire Intel’s Xscale technology, including the “Hermon” processor that powers the Blackberry 8700 device. Its “Bulverde” processor is used in the Palm Treo smart phone, the Motorola Q and other devices.Intel began its assault on the cellphone market after it acquired the technology in 1998 in a complicated deal with Digital Equipment Corporation. This also included its IXP network processor business, which is also understood to be up for sale, with private equity groups appearing to be the most likely buyers.Intel has no plans to abandon its successful wi-fi business that has enabled wireless internet access through its Centrino mobile platform for notebook PCs. It is also continuing to support a new wireless standard that would give broad wi-fi coverage known as Wimax.“We are still big proponents of wi-fi and Wimax, but with cellphones, we decided this was a better fit for Marvell,” said Robert Manetta, Intel spokesman, on Tuesday.Intel shares were up 0.2 per cent in midday trading on the news at $18.32, while Marvell’s fell 13.4 per cent to $44.92.

733;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-22T19:27:25Z;Lex: Handset wars;;Joint ventures usually collapse into recriminations at some point, but four months may well be a record. Nokia’s abandonment on Thursday of its CDMA handset deal with Sanyo, only announced in February, says much about the perils of such combinations. It also suggests that CDMA, one of two main mobile protocols, faces some difficulties.Mobile phone standards fall into two camps. The first is CDMA, championed by Motorola, Samsung and LG and mainly used by operators in the US, South Korea and Japan. The second grouping is GSM and its broadband equivalent WCDMA. This is backed by Nokia and Ericsson and is ubiquitous in Europe, dominant in emerging markets and present in the US.Sceptics suggest that Nokia’s withdrawal is really a decision to abandon a standard which it has never capitalised on. There is truth in this. Nokia’s share of 2005 handset sales of 33 per cent falls to perhaps 10 per cent in CDMA. It faces tougher competitors and has a testy relationship with Qualcomm, which owns many key patents.Yet for the world’s biggest handset maker in effect to withdraw from a standard is not a sign of that standard’s good health. CDMA’s share of global subscribers is flattish at about 14 per cent. CDMA enticed operators in Korea and Japan because it offered a quick upgrade route to 3G. Emerging markets operators have different priorities. CDMA handsets are perhaps a fifth more expensive than GSM. CDMA operators in key markets such as Brazil, India and China have struggled to gain market share.Notwithstanding Motorola’s efforts to build up its presence in India and China, CDMA now risks becoming a US, Japanese and Korean technology. For Nokia, a withdrawal from the standard outside the US makes sense, but the real question is whether it can afford to stop offering handsets to two of the big four US networks. It has said it intends to participate “selectively” in the US CDMA market. But rather like joint ventures, half-measures rarely bring long-term success.
734;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Nokia cancels Sanyo venture;;"Nokia, the Finnish telecoms company, has terminated a proposed joint venture with Sanyo, the Japanese equipment manufacturer.The two announced in February that they wanted to unite their CDMA mobile handset businesses to create a company to challenge Samsung, the Korean mobile phone group.But the combination of an uncertain future for CDMA technology in major emerging markets as well as the thin profit margins available prompted the Finnish
company to call off talks. “We feel it would not be in our best interests to make an agreement that proved to be less beneficial than originally anticipated,” said Kai Öistämö, executive vice-president.The termination of the Japanese venture marks the second major strategic move in a week by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s new chief executive, following a €20bn ($25bn) merger of its systems business with Siemens.A Nokia executive, who declined to be named, said the company had been planning to use the Sanyo JV to supply three key emerging markets – India, Brazil and China – with its low-to-mid-end handsets.But he said that since February major operators in India and Brazil had revealed they planned to move away from CDMA handsets and use rival GSM technology instead, while China’s future direction remained uncertain.These countries took this decision because there is a wider range of handsets available on GSM and they are generally cheaper, undermining Nokia’s strategy for the venture.The Finnish company is also understood to have become increasingly frustrated with paying fees to Qualcomm, the US company, which owns most of the patents to CDMA technology.“In addition to an already financially prohibitive CDMA ecosystem, recent developments may indicate the CDMA emerging markets business case is looking more challenging,” it said.The collapse of the joint venture is a blow to Sanyo, which was last year rescued from a financial crisis by a Y300bn ($2.6bn) capital injection from financial institutions.“The Nokia joint venture was the only hope for Sanyo,” said Hideki
Watanabe, analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo. “Sanyo no longer has any growth business.”Nokia is the world’s largest manufacturer of GSM handsets, selling 34 per cent of the 795m handsets sold in 2005, but has struggled to match that success in CDMA."
735;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Trials under way but the stakes are high;;With a history littered with glorious failures – such as WAP – and surprise successes – such as SMS – mobile phone carriers are keen to avoid any expensive mistakes.This means the stakes are high for mobile TV, while its success is far from guaranteed.Outside South Korea and Japan, true mobile TV broadcasts are mostly in trial mode or the initial stages of development.The industry concern is understandable. While most of the trials have been successful, some surveys have indicated that most phone users are not keen on the idea of watching TV on their handsets.Mobile TV has been a hit in South Korea, but it has previously adopted other internet and mobile services more enthusiastically than the rest of the world.One of the biggest potential nightmares concerns which technology to adopt to deliver television services to mobile customers.The list of mobile TV technologies is long and riddled with confusing abbreviations: there are almost as many as there are countries in which mobile TV is being rolled out.So network operators, keen to find new revenue streams as the voice business matures, are facing tough decisions about when and how to upgrade their networks – with the cost possibly running into hundreds of millions of dollars.TV-like services on mobile phones are already available in many countries, usually over a 3G network, but these are mostly limited to streamed video downloads rather than “broadcasts”, and the basic 3G network can only support a limited number of users in the same area at the same time.Jim Brailean, co-founder of mobile streaming technology company PacketVideo, says there needs to be a shakeout of the competing systems soon. “I don’t think it will hold back services, but people need to make decisions,” he says. Alan Harper, group strategy director at Vodafone, says his company will continue providing TV over 3G for some time, but will probably have to make a decision over which technology to adopt within a year to 18 months.By then, he reckons, the standards landscape will be less cluttered and more will be known about how customers will use mobile TV. “It’s hard for the mobile industry to know which way to go yet, because it’s very early days,” he says.The technologies fall into two categories: incremental upgrades, offering a cheaper but limited way to begin rolling out mobile TV, and the more comprehensive, expensive standards.The cheaper and simpler options are based on existing 3G technology such MBMS and its variant, TDtv. IPWireless, the company behind TDtv, says that the cost of adding its technology to each handset is only about $10.T-DMB, which runs over the digital radio spectrum, also falls into the lower-cost category. A Samsung-backed T-DMB project has been well received in South Korea since it launched there in December, and is broadcasting World Cup matches in several German cities free of charge to owners of new T-DMB phones from Samsung and LG.However, most of these cheaper options will only support a few channels and T-DMB, with its roots in broadcasting technology, makes it difficult to charge for content.On the more expensive and high-end side, the main rival standards are Qualcomm’s proprietary MediaFLO and DVB-H, which is backed by several big equipment heavyweights including Nokia, Texas Instruments, Intel and Crown Castle.In football-mad Italy, DVB-H services went live just ahead of the World Cup. Telecom Italia, the largest mobile provider, and 3 Italia are already broadcasting to compliant handsets from Samsung and, in the case of 3, LG handsets. Vodafone in Italy plans to launch a service.DVB-H is considered “future-proof” but requires big, expensive network upgrades and operates in a spectrum range that is treated in widely varying ways in different countries.MediaFLO, meanwhile, is a proprietary approach from Qualcomm that has signed up Verizon Wireless in the US and is conducting trials in Japan and the UK with BSkyB.There are problems inherent in both of these high-end standards. In the UK there is uncertainty about the status of DVB-H spectrum and a possibility that it may not be made available until next decade.As for MediaFLO, the world’s leading handset maker, Nokia, has a history of legal battles with Qualcomm and is focusing on the non-proprietary DVB-H.Qualcomm has responded with plans to develop a phone chip that will support several other standards alongside MediaFLO, and Philips Semiconductor, a supporter of DVB-H, is also keeping its options open on some standards such as a T-DMB-based system, which is used in the UK by BT and Virgin Mobile.Then there is the question of the business model, which is closely tied to the technology question because the telecoms and broadcast industries tend to favour different systems.Television evolved with public funding and advertising revenue, but on mobile TV the one is non-existent and the other in its infancy.Dave McQueen, principal handset analyst at Informa, says that too many factors are unresolved for it to be possible to predict confidently how the standards landscape will evolve.“The main problem is the cost of building the networks. Who pays? The network operator, the broadcast operator? And how much can you charge people?“The business model is not clear,” he says.
736;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-21T09:29:15Z;Alan Cane: World Cup forces mobile television out of the lab;;"The UK has become the world’s test-bed for video-to-go. More accurately, it has become the testing-ground for engineering trials of digital television broadcast to mobile devices, according to Mike Short, chairman of the international Mobile Data Association.World Cup football in Germany this month, however, may force the technology out of the laboratory and into the commercial arena.Two UK field trials have taken place in the past few months. The first, involving BT in collaboration with Virgin Mobile, showed that consumers were prepared to fork out up to £8 a month for a package of channels.A second, run by the mobile operator O2 with the commercial station NTL Arqiva, found that people watched for up to three hours a week, averaging 23 minutes a session at home as well as on the move.Which seems oddly counter-intuitive. Why should anyone choose to watch TV on a tiny screen using earphones when many homes these days boast thin, widescreen televisions in the parlour? It’s an intriguing question, but then the results of the two trials must seem doubly strange to those who regard mobile TV as of questionable value.More UK trials are in prospect including a collaboration between BSkyB and the US semiconductor company Qualcomm in the first European trial of a technology called “MediaFLO”. Two weeks ago, a group of UK and South Korean companies including Arqiva, BT Movio, Radioscape, Factum, LG Electronics and Samsung announced a trial to take place in London to demonstrate the relative merits of different technological approaches.Broadcasting television programmes to mobile devices is already a reality in South Korea where 600,000 receivers have been sold since December. The technology has also gone live in Germany, spurred into action by the proximity of the World Cup.Frontier Silicon, a UK-based electronics group which is a world leader in receiver modules for digital audio and video says it has shipped more than 1m integrated circuits for incorporation into mass market mobile phone handsets for mobile TV services in South Korea, China and Germany.Industry watchers agree that mobile TV is on the move. David McQueen, a senior analyst with the consultancy Informa Telecoms and Media, argues that the World Cup will kick-start mobile TV growth: “By the 2008 Olympics [in China] we will all be prepared to watch TV on our phones and by the 2010 World Cup, the infrastructure will be mature and one-in-13 mobile phone users worldwide will own a mobile TV handset,” he says.It is significant that Radioscape, the company which has supplied the UK’s commercial radio stations with the technology to enable them to play out digital audio, has started to close deals with Chinese broadcasters.This suggests that China will be well prepared for digital video broadcasting by the time it hosts the Olympics.The research arm of the Canadian bank CIBC has little doubt that mobile TV is about to come into its own: “We believe the mobile food chain has reached critical mass,” it says, concluding that all the necessary pieces are now in place. “We expect commercial activity to move from Korea where it started in 2005 to the US in 2006 and Europe and other regions in 2007 and thereafter.”All of which looks like good news for handset manufacturers and network operators. The need to acquire digital video-enabled handsets will help drive the replacement cycle while the apparent willingness of subscribers to pay for TV content should help sustain operators’ income and satisfy their search for ways to drive up average revenue per user.Questions of broadcasting standards and spectrum allocation will need to be resolved, however.There are at least four standards in play: DVB-H, a derivative of Europe’s terrestrial broadcasting technology and used in the 02/Arqiva trial; MediaFLO, a proprietary technology developed by Qualcomm of the US; T-DMB, a technology in use in South Korea; and DAB-IP, which transmits radio and television signals over the internet.Inevitably, it looks as if each of these standards will be accepted in some markets. Just as with mobile phones, there seems little hope of achieving a world standard, despite the efforts of the International Telecommunication Union, whose regional conference closed last week in Geneva.Analysts such as CIBC think that DVB-H is the best positioned standard worldwide, with companies such as Philips of the Netherlands, Texas Instruments and Motorola of the US and NEC of Japan, as well as Truespan Semiconductor of the US, Siano of Israel, Dipcom of France and Frontier Silicon of the UK, all working on DVB-H chips.The World Cup, however, seems likely to form the best test-bed for what many think is the next killer application for mobile phones."

740;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-11T20:12:47Z;Cellphone crusader to divide and conquer;;Almost a year after becoming chief executive of Qualcomm, Paul Jacobs is finding himself playing the unwanted role of crusader, fighting for the cellphone standard his father and predecessor spread around the world.“It’s different from what I expected,” says Mr Jacobs. “I came into it thinking, ‘OK, the holy wars [over standards for mobile telephony] are over, we’re going to go out and make peace with everybody and we’ll figure out how to build partnerships.’“And then a few months into it, we’ve got a couple of interesting things going on.”Mr Jacobs’ first challenge is that the European Commission, which has been arguing with Microsoft about the software company’s competitive position, might turn its attention to Qualcomm. Competitors and customers have complained the licensing fees for Qualcomm’s WCDMA technology for third-generation phones are excessive.The second challenge is that Nokia, the biggest handset maker, is in litigation with Qualcomm as part of legal manoeuvres before a cross-licensing arrangement expires next year.The issue could even force Mr Jacobs to split up a company that he and Irwin Jacobs – founder, chairman and his father – have built up to a market capitalisation of $73bn.The rival standards for third-generation mobile telephony – WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) and CDMA 2000 – owe much to Qualcomm research. They also echo the earlier-generation battle between Qualcomm’s CDMA and the GSM (Global System for Mobile) standard for market share across the world.Behind the litigation, the dispute with Nokia is focused on Qualcomm continuing to be able to incorporate Nokia’s GSM patents in its chips and for Nokia to likewise use CDMA patents in its phones as they try to straddle the two markets.Mr Jacobs seems ready to play the same card his father considered when the cross-licensing deal was last negotiated in 2000 – he may split the company into separate licensing and chipmaking entities. That way, Nokia would lose the leverage of being able to block Qualcomm products that it says are infringing Nokia patents.But it is unlikely he would go that far. “There’s huge synergy between having those two businesses together,” he admits, anticipating a settlement with Nokia. “We’re in discussions with them. Somehow, we’re going to end up resolving those discussions.”Qualcomm is also in litigation with fellow communications chipmaker Broadcom, with at least six suits and countersuits filed against each other. In addition, the Korean Fair Trade Commission has visited Qualcomm’s offices in Seoul after a complaint by a Korean company.But the complaints by Nokia, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Ericsson, NEC and Panasonic to the European Commission represent a more serious threat. They are rooted in Qualcomm succeeding in getting its technology accepted as a key part of Wideband CDMA – the standard that Europe decided in the 1990s to adopt for third-generation phones.Qualcomm expects 96m WCDMA phones to be sold worldwide this year, with more than half being bought by Europeans. The handset and chip makers allege Qualcomm is charging them excessive fees to license its technology while offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm.“They’re trying to renegotiate,” says Mr Jacobs. “Somebody said what happens with intellectual property licensing is that, in the beginning a manufacturer is happy about it because they get into a new market. As the market matures, they start looking at it as a cost. So then they’re unhappy about it.”He also feels that competitors saw an opportunity when he succeeded Irwin Jacobs as chief executive on July 1 last year.“I feel fairly strongly that some of our competitors looked at the fact that we were going through a management transition and timed this in the thought that we would all get distracted, and the fact of the matter is we have not.”Revenues were up 34 per cent year-on-year for the March quarter at $1.83bn and profits rose 11 per cent to $593m. Qualcomm shares are up more than 30 per cent since he took charge.And despite painting himself as the reluctant crusader, there are signs that Mr Jacobs is relishing future standards battles. Qualcomm has acquired Flarion, a company that extends its expertise in OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), which could be the foundation of fourth-generation mobile.It is also investing in a television delivery service for mobile operators named MediaFlo, which will compete with the DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handhelds) standard in the US and Europe.But Mr Jacobs argues that technology will ultimately resolve the debate over standards rather than governments or the courts, thanks to the regular doubling of transistor capacity described by Moore’s Law.“Moore’s Law has allowed us to put so many different radios into the chipset that all these standards battles become sort of moot,” he says.“The phone will just deal with it, and deal with it in a way that the consumer doesn’t have to worry about all this.”
741;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Qualcomm braced for EU probe into fees;;Qualcomm, the company behind the CDMA mobile phone standard, is bracing for an investigation of its licensing fees by the European Commission, prompted by complaints from handset makers and rival chipmakers.Qualcomm is being scrutinised by the same team in Brussels that investigated Microsoft and Intel, which dominate PC operating systems and microprocessors.The San Diego-based company has achieved a similar position of influence over the mobile phone industry and its opponents are hopeful that a formal investigation is imminent over what they say is its refusal to license patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.“We gave in a response [to the complaints], so it’s a little bit of a waiting game now,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, told the Financial Times. “I guess I won’t be surprised if there’s an investigation.”Legal advisers to Texas Instruments and Broadcom, the two chipmaker complainants, say the conclusion of a Microsoft appeal against a Brussels decision that it abused its dominant market position means the Commission can now turn its attention to Qualcomm.Qualcomm’s opponents alleged last October that it had reneged on a commitment it made in the 1990s when Europe decided to move from the GSM system to adopt W-CDMA for third-generation (3G) mobile phones – a wireless standard partly based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology.TI, Broadcom, Nokia, Ericsson, NEC and Panasonic all complain Qualcomm has failed to honour a promise to license its technology on reasonable terms – levying the same royalty rate on W-CDMA as its own 3G brand – CDMA 2000 – when its intellectual property is a much smaller proportion of W-CDMA.Mr Jacobs said the royalty rate was a low single-digit percentage. It was justified by the company’s research and development that Qualcomm had carried out to develop a technology that had created a competitive market for other companies to make profits.He said an investigation would not have a big effect on the company he was willing to protect the company by breaking it up if needs be.
742;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-06-11T16:44:15Z;Full interview transcript: Qualcomm’s Paul Jacobs;;The Financial Times talks to Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm - the world’s second-biggest maker of cell-phone chips - about the future of 3G technology, new standards and issues surrounding licensing and royalties.FT: Where are we on 3G? What happens in the next two, three years?Paul Jacobs: So we’re at that inflection point where the ramp is starting to happen. So we’re already seeing high-end phones that were GSM phones being made with WCDMA. People are stopping making the GSM high-end phone and now we’ve got to get the prices down to where the mainstream phone is WCDMA also. And then it’s you know –FT: And what’s the price differentiation? I mean how far does the price come down?Paul Jacobs: Yeah we’re hearing it’s getting to the €130 or below kind of range. Then it’ll be the mid-tier phoneFT: What are the main sort of cost factors in that price being narrowed down?Paul Jacobs: I mean we’re doing additional integration. And there’s more components, suppliers and things like that. But the biggest thing that’s driving our price down I mean is just competition.FT: How much are your royalties a factor in pricing issue?Paul Jacobs: The royalty rate itself is low single digit percentages. The competition that we’ve enabled by collecting those royalties, doing the R&D and spreading that out. Let’s say we have 60 licensees. You know that’s actually driving the price down much faster than anything else. And if you go back and look at the historical data on CDMA 2000 for example, the price declined as volume goes up much faster in CDMA 2000 than any other technology. And it’s because competition caused that to happen. Now if you’re a large manufacturer that’s not a dynamic you love. So Motorola, Nokia, Erickson. They don’t like it. Because it used to be that the large manufacturers were the guys who could afford to do the advanced R&D. So fundamentally they have the market almost to themselves. They had a lot of seller power. And now because we have enabled a lot of competition that advantage - that competitive advantage they had has been diminished. So they have to look for other areas to innovate in. Which I think is the right thing to do. Motorola is doing well because they you know they innovated the RAZR, the SLVR and all these other phones that they are working on. But Ed [Zander] likes to beat up on us about the royalty rates.FT: How should we think about this as being fair and reasonable in licensing terms? Because that’s obviously the sort of principal that seems to be at stake here.Paul Jacobs: So the best way to me is to figure fair and reasonable is we have 130 licensees all from fairly sophisticated companies. We did those licenses at a time where we had less patents than we have now. A lot less market power. So for those companies to come back now and say we had some power over them that was abused seems a little strange to me. So let me explain what’s going on actually.So the standard process in Europe actually works by means of you get the same votes - you get the number of votes based off of the amount of revenue that you ship into Europe. So if I’m a large manufacturer shipping into Europe then I can stick my IP into the standard. Whether or not it’s fundamental.FT: So based on today’s revenue share when the standard is set..Paul Jacobs: Right. So they can load up lots of patents in there. And then they say “Okay well let’s count the patents.” Well if I have control of the voting rights I can stick all sorts of patents in there. And when I come to count I’m going to have more. So that’s why they say it ought to be proportional to the number of patents. But it you know – it’s sort of like saying if I take a car do I have the intellectual property on how the engine and brakes work? Or do I have the intellectual property on the ashtrays? You know it’s – there’s a difference between the quality of patents as opposed to the quantity. And quality can vary significantly. Because in the patent – sorry in the standards process there are certain things that are fundamental to how the technology is done. And there’s other ones where it’s just a choice that was made when you were making the standard. So you know format the bits this way. Or do this or that. I mean it’s not really fundamental. It’s just a choice. So I mean if you say “okay I have 40 of the patents on how we twiddle the bits,” whereas some innovative company who doesn’t chip a lot into that market has a couple of patents on how the system really works. Who’s got more valuable IP? I would argue that the company that actually did the innovation has the more valuable IP. But these guys try and change the argument around to say “oh we ought to cap royalties. We ought to count patents.”FT: So what do you think is going on now? What’s your analysis? Is this just an attempt by – reduce their cost?Paul Jacobs: Yeah they’re trying to renegotiate. I mean I forget who it was. Somebody said this recently – somebody said what happens with intellectual property licensing is that in the beginning a manufacturer is happy about it because they get into a new market. As the market matures they start looking at it as cost. So then they’re unhappy about it. So we’re sort of in that phase now where people are trying to claim that we did something untoward to get this to happen. But what really happened was we went out there with basically the entire world telling us our technology wouldn’t work. And spent billions of dollars of innovating or productizing and evangelizing. Doing all this work to get the technology deployed. And sort of hard to imagine people coming back now and saying “oh you didn’t create value. You’re charging too much for the value.” So the percentage royalty rates that we’re charging – I mean they’re low single digit percentages. So this is not like we’re trying to get most of the value of the phone or something like that. These types of royalty rates, these small percentages are in other products as well. It’s just this has been sort of blown up into such a big thing.FT: How does this get resolved do you think? Did you have any discussions with the regulators?Paul Jacobs: There’s ongoing dialogues. We gave in a response and now we’re sort of waiting to hear. So they’re going through that process. So it’s a little bit of a waiting game now.FT: Do you think now that the Microsoft thing is kind of wrapping up that the EC will look at it now. Do you feel that there is an investigation in it?Paul Jacobs: I guess I won’t be surprised if there’s an investigation. But I think the facts are going to show. I mean these facts that I’m telling you about in terms of causing the price decreases to happen faster, causing there to be increased competition. All of that stuff is fact and it can be demonstrated. So if there’s an investigation that stuff will come out.FT: Do you think it will affect you as a company if you had a Microsoft style investigation going on in Europe or you don’t see it getting to that sort of proportions?Paul Jacobs: I don’t – I have a hard time exactly saying relative to what happened with Microsoft. I mean they’re clearly in a different position than we were in. And I think that we were able to also engage in the process a little broader than maybe that they had. And explained our point of view. But yeah. Certainly people will have to pay attention to it. I mean they’re doing that already. But it’s not going to stop us from focusing on what we do best which is innovative and get the new products out.And I feel fairly strongly that some of our competitors look at the fact that we were going through a management transition and timed this in the thought that we would all get distracted. And the fact of the matter is we have not been distracted. I mean you look at our results we’ve been very focused on execution.FT: And your rivals say you’re trying to dominate 4G as well…Paul Jacobs: I would like to see Qualcomm technology in every generation of systems. And I would say that I believe strongly that our engineers make the best technologies. And as we look forward into the next generation of technologies I think we’ll make the best technology there as well.FT: And do you think that will be CDMA based or are we looking at OFDM?Paul Jacobs: Either. I mean it could be either. I mean you know there’s a lot of people looking at OFDM because when they think about next generation technologies they want much larger bandwidths. And from a complexity standpoint what you can build in a chip today given today’s technology – if you go to a very wide bandwidth then you should use OFDMA because it’s a little less complex. But then if you look even farther out then they say okay well CDMA is actually the optimal technology from an information theory point of view. So if you have a system for example where you’re actually processing with many antennas. You essentially connect all the cell sites together, jointly process information. CDMA turns out to be the best technology in that kind of a system.. So I think things will go back and forth.I mean I am not necessarily wedded to a particular interface. And in fact we have tons of different interfaces in the phone right now. Clearly we have a great position in terms of 3G because nobody believed CDMA would work when we were making it work.FT: The Flarion acquisition. Was that for OFDM or you already had your own OFDM capability there?Paul Jacobs: We had our own. But we didn’t have a running wide area system. So those guys had an existing wide area system. And they had some other technologies. And they had some nice OFDM stuff. So it made out portfolio broader. But we – yeah we already had our own work underway.FT: And so you’re riding two horses in terms of WiMax ________?Paul Jacobs: Actually we’re riding – it’s kind of funny. We’re riding a couple of horses right now in the sense of technologies that we’ve developed or Flarion’s developed. So we have the flash technology that came from Flarion that’s continuing to be marketed out in the world. We didn’t buy them to kill that. We bought them because we wanted to provide another choice to operators. So they’re out there deploying that with various people.And then we have this 802.20 standards body. Where we actually submitted the stuff that was being worked on in Qualcomm pre-Flarion. So that’s actually gone in there. That’s underway. And then there’s the long-term evolution stuff that’s going on in the WCDMA standard body and we’re actually participating in that as well. So there’s a bunch of things – bunch of tracks going on. I would say the two that are the closest to systems – I mean flash is a system already. And 802.20 is almost – we’re just about ready to start showing that off.FT: Nonetheless is there a risk that your opposition from other parts of the industry will limit your IP longer term? Is there something you need to do to build bridges with these companies?Paul Jacobs: Okay. So first of all most of the industry is actually with us as against opposed – I mean we have 130 licensees. So you know six companies and some of them have very vested interests as competitors came out against us. But in terms of being able to get our technology out in the market I absolutely care about being a good partner. And I think that one of the things we spent a lot of effort on is going out to the operators. Particularly in Europe where we hadn’t had much presence with them. We’ve helped them build out their network. Optimize their network. We help them define services. Define which parts of the standards they ought to use you know to converge among different operating companies. And so forth. t.FT: With MediaFLO are you picking another standards battle - with DVB-H - and how that’s taking hold?Paul Jacobs: I think they picked it with us. [Laughter] .Yeah. So we’re actually looking for partners in other parts of the world. We have a planning company in Japan also. That’s actually working with the government to get spectrum allocated there. And it’s kind of interesting. It’s sort of lucky coincidence. But the possibility exists that the same spectrum that we actually have in the United States could become available in Japan as well. Which would be nice. I mean – it can run another spectrum as well. So yeah we’re actually out around the world talking to people.One of the things that happened with DVBH is that there was a design decision that was made early on, which was the leverage off DVDT terrestrial standard. And because of that they had constraints on the design. Which made it less optimal for a mobile system. So the time to switch channels is longer, for example. The battery life isn’t as good. They didn’t have some of the extra communications techniques that we use, like digital communications theory techniques. So our system from a performance standpoint is significantly better. And that’s why actually we’re getting traction.I mean there is a nice thing from DVBH. If you’re running a DVB signal as a broadcaster you can slot a DVBH signal in there as well. So I think that’s going to happen. And in fact what we announced recently is we’re building a chip called the Universal Broadcast Modem. And it will just adapt to whatever technologies are out. I kind of look at this these days you know Moore’s Law has now allowed us to put so many different radios into the chip set that all these standard battles become sort of moot. I mean the phone will just deal with it. And it will deal with it in a way that the consumer doesn’t have to worry about this.So I think that’s the solution to all the political battles. We’ll continue to push out. Okay we believe this technology A or B or C. these technologies are the best ones from a performance standpoint. But we know that sometimes that isn’t how people choose the standards. So if a carrier wants something else then we’re going to try to be the technology supplier to them. And we’ll supply that technology too.FT: But the MediFLO you’re building out an entire infrastructure here.Paul Jacobs: We’re doing that in the U.S. Yeah.FT: Will it be the same in Europe or will you have to partner?Paul Jacobs: We’ll partner. Everywhere else in the world we’ll partner.FT: Right. The cost –Paul Jacobs: It’s not actually the cost – it’s more because broadcast is so politicized. Almost everywhere in the world you have to have a local player on your side. You can’t. It’s very very difficult to come in as an outsider and get the rights. Or you know really be able to penetrate that space. It’s much – I mean it’s sort of a non-starter if you’re not partnering.FT: Where are you in terms of the roll out?Paul Jacobs: Well we’re pushing towards having the network ready by the end of the year. Verizon’s going to make the service launch decision. because they obviously have to do marketing and they’ve got to get the handsets out. So they’ll make the actual decision about when the launch is to consumers. But you know things are moving along. I would say to me the biggest issue we’re facing right now is we have some rulings that we need out of the FCC and we’re just trying to get through that process.FT: That’s in terms of spectrum?Paul Jacobs: What happens is that when you put up a new TV station you have the rules for how much interference you can cause to other existing TV stations. We’re just trying to get those rules applied to MediaFLO. So it seems like it should happen. But there’s you know various interests groups. Broadcasters on one side. Us on the other side. So that whole thing is playing out right now.FT: Going forward how much do you want to be depending on royalties, licensing and the chips?Paul Jacobs: It’s kind of been a 60-40 split. Where the revenues of the chip business have been the 60. But the profits have been the 40. And vice-versa for the licensing business. I would say that as WCDMA continues to roll out and our market share – you know we said we have a market share target of 50% for the chipset business. And we’re below that right now. Although we haven’t said exactly how far below. I mean clearly the licensing business will generate a disproportionately larger share going forward.FT: And it makes sense long term to have these two sides together, than licensing alone?Paul Jacobs: What’s interesting – what happens is so say we come up with you know an idea. That idea generates you know patents for the licensing business and products for the chipset business. They both go to the handset manufacturer. So what happens is if you can imbed the technology in the chipset, get it to the handset manufacturer. Now the market – all of a sudden the patent’s become valuable. If you can’t get that out into the market then okay you have patents but what’s it worth? So there’s huge synergy between having those two businesses together. They both kind of come from you know the initial idea. And they go to market in a synergistic way. And like I said the licensing business causes there to be more companies out there that you can sell to.So I want to keep the company together. We considered restructuring the company to protect the licensing business. If it comes down to that and that’s the best way to enhance shareholder value then that’s what we’re going to do. But we expect that we’re going to be able to keep the company together.FT: How would that affect the licensing?Paul Jacobs: Well if there’s no leverage on the licensing business because there’s no products to pursue or no injunctions to get or whatever. That’s pretty hard to put pressure on .FT: That would be the ultimate – you have to push the opposition because the logic of keeping it together would be so strong.Paul Jacobs: I much prefer to keep it together. Let’s put it that way. I mean we’ve looked at splitting the company back in 2000. So –FT: Why back then?Paul Jacobs: We were going – we were having a negotiation with Nokia at that time. And basically we had to go to that before they realized that they were going to lose any leverage they had over us at all. And back then they ended up signing the agreement.FT: Have you considered it since 2000?Paul Jacobs: Only now because we’re back in April of 2007, we’re going to be back negotiating the license terms of Nokia again. So you know if it turns out that way we’ll deal with it. But you know but I don’t, I don’t think it’s in their best – they realize before it wasn’t in their best interest. And we had a lot less intellectual property back then. I think now they’ll see it the same way now. But we have to – we have disagreements about business issues right now. We’re in discussions with them. Somehow we’re going to end up resolving those discussions. There’s probably going to be you know a bunch of back and forth. It’s clearly some litigation that’s going on right now. So stuff will happen in between now and then.FT: And that’s April 2007?Paul Jacobs: Is the day we need to renegotiate. Yeah.FT: Once again how long have you been CEO?Paul Jacobs: It’s almost a year. July 1st will be a year. So you know what? It’s different from what I expected. I thought – I came into it thinking “okay the holy wars are over. We’re going to go out and make peace with everybody. And like we’ll figure out how to build partnerships.” And then a few months into it you know we got a couple of interesting things going on. So that’s been a little different. But I’d say from the ability to continue to innovate and execution of the chip business, I mean that’s been great. And also just the ability to go out to the operators and make friends with people. I’m actually now friends with some of these guys who before wouldn’t have even known who we were or heard Qualcomm always in the negative sense.So all that stuff has been really good. And I continue to feel like the opportunities are great. I mean there’s – everyday I come in there’s some new thing that we think “oh the phone can do this new thing.” And okay. Now how do we put this all together. That stuff’s good. Real good. You’ll see some really interesting stuff came out of the company. And the company’s energized. I mean people feel good about it because they see that we’re executing well. And they see the opportunity is ahead of us. So people are very motivated to come to work when you’re in that kind of situation.

A retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lowerA retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lower, while the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors bounced back. Stocks in focus included Target, Abbott Laboratories and Qualcomm.“The sell-off in commodities is a welcome relief,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “Commodities have been going up up up, and now it looks like normal profit-taking.“There’s some follow-through after the blood-letting of last week. But some of the background is improving. Bonds are up, and the dominant trend for the market remains up, but we have to recognise that economic growth is slowing down, which is healthy.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, or 3.26 points, at 1,294.50, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 5.26 points, at 2,238.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 47.78 points, at 11,428.77.Target was one of the day’s biggest fallers.

744;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-05-11T21:06:22Z;Lex: 3G intellectual property;;"Investors are sceptical about 3G. After years of hype, only one in 10 global mobile users actually have 3G phones. Still, the spat between Nokia and Qualcomm over intellectual property suggests 3G has come of age.Qualcomm pioneered CDMA technology, but missed out on the 2G boom, which was largely based on the rival GSM standard. In 3G, however, its position is outstanding, with critical patents owned for both standards (CDMA2000 and WCDMA), which it licenses to handset and component manufacturers. Licence revenues should reach $2.6bn in 2006, of which half should be from 3G.Qualcomm’s model has benefits. Unlike GSM patent owners, it has no conflicts of interest with handset makers. For a fee, anyone should get access to the IP it owns or has aggregated. However, the question is whether that fee, of say 4 per cent of a handset’s price, is fair. Qualcomm says that it has amicable agreements with 130 manufacturers. Still, Nokia, NEC, Ericsson, Panasonic and Texas Instruments all claim that Qualcomm overcharges and discriminates against some chipmakers.These critics say that Qualcomm’s share of WCDMA IP is lower than for CDMA2000, while its royalty rates are the same. Qualcomm disputes this, but offers no other analysis. Financial metrics suggest massively excessive returns. Operating margins at Qualcomm’s IP division exceed 90 per cent. It is entitled to an economic return on its high risk investment. However, IP operating profits of about $2.4bn this year compare embarrassingly well with cumulative research and development spending of $4.6bn over the past decade.In spite of the evidence, Qualcomm exhibits the confidence of the ascendant. Rightly so. The absolute effect on prices to end users is too small to spark consumer outrage and regulators could take years to act. By that time, even the 3G boom may have come and gone.- Click here to add your comments

745;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-05-08T12:23:26Z;Samsung to expand non-memory chip business;;Samsung Electronics, the world’s second largest chipmaker, on Monday said it would invest Won290.9bn ($314m) in building new production facilities for non-memory chips.The announcement comes as the South Korean company is struggling to cope with falling prices of memory chips, especially those used in mobile digital consumer products.Samsung said it was making the investment “to meet growing market demand and boost price competitiveness”.Non-memory chips, called system LSI, contributed only 11 per cent of Samsung’s semiconductor sales in the first quarter. But the company is trying to expand the business and turn it into one of its 13 designated future “growth engines”.Aggressive investment in digital segments has allowed Samsung to quickly catch up with bigger overseas rivals. The company said last year it aimed to double its annual revenue by 2010 by increasing the number of its products that are leaders in terms of market share from the current eight to more than 20.Samsung won its first major non-memory chip deal in November - to supply non-memory chips to Qualcomm, the US mobile technology company. But competition is intensifying in the market, which is dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United Microelectronics.Analysts said Samsung’s ample cash reserves, estimated at about Won10,000bn, allowed the chip-maker to continue its aggressive investment strategy. Samsung said last September it would invest Won25,000bn in its semiconductor business by 2010 to generate cumulative sales of Won200,000bn.Chipmakers are required to continually engage in huge capital spending to cut production costs as the industry advances into nanotechnology.Samsung last month said it suffered a 25 per cent drop in first-quarter operating profit, hit by falling prices of memory chips and mobile phones. Samsung is the leading global producer of memory chips, mobile phones and flat panel displays.Samsung shares closed up 1.55 per cent at Won655,000 on Monday, outperforming a 0.78 per cent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.
746;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-05-04T21:31:21Z;Microsoft calls up Qualcomm for smartphone pact;;Microsoft has signed a deal with Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, that will make it easier and quicker to build advanced smartphones running Microsoft Mobile Windows operating system.Under the agreement, which could help Microsoft boost its share of the smartphone operating system market, Qualcomm will build support for the Windows Mobile operating system into its next generation Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chipsets.Microsoft has been putting increasing effort into its attempts to establish Windows Mobile as one of the leading smartphone operating systems alongside rivals such as Symbian, the Palm operating system and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry device platform.The deal with Qualcomm could significantly reduce the time it takes to design and develop a new Windows mobile-powered smartphone, because it will remove much of the custom development work device makers previously undertook to build 3G Windows Mobile devices using Qualcomm chips.As a result, it should help phone makers to develop more affordable, feature-rich Windows Mobile powered phones, while also providing users with extended battery life and enabling them to run a broad range of familiar Windows business and entertainment software applications.“Having support for Windows Mobile on Qualcomm’s MSM chipsets will bring a familiar software experience to the next generation of smaller, lighter phones with more appealing form factors,” said Sanjay Jha, president of Qualcomm’s CDMA technologies division.The new Qualcomm chips supporting Windows Mobile 5.0 are due to begin shipping in the second half of 2006 and are expected to begin appearing in new smartphones next year.Qualcomm is the second-largest mobile chip supplier after Texas Instruments and the leading supplier of chips used in mobile handsets built around CDMA (code division multiple access) technology.After a relatively slow start, demand for Windows Mobile-based smartphones and converged communications devices has been growing strongly over the past 18 months.Today there are 47 device makers shipping Windows Mobile devices with 115 mobile operators in 55 countries. Gartner, the US-based market research firm, estimates that sales of Windows Mobile-based smartphones will reach 64.5 million by 2009.“We know that mobile operators are eager to attract and retain subscribers with an affordable portfolio of Windows Mobile-powered devices,” said Pieter Knook, senior vice-president of Microsoft’s mobile and embedded devices division. “More and more of their customers want capabilities such as mobile e-mail and Office productivity programs in a familiar and easy-to-use software experience.”
747;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-05-03T17:41:15Z;Qualcomm forecast shows strength of mobile market;;Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker, on Wednesday signalled the strength of the handset market as it raised its earnings forecast for the current quarter.The company, the second-largest maker of mobile phone chips after Texas Instruments, said profits of 32-34 cents per share were expected for the quarter ending on June 25, up from its previous prediction of 30 to 32 cents.“The increase in our guidance reflects stronger than expected new orders for our very low-tier chipsets as well as increased demand for 1xEV-DO [3G] chipsets,” said Dr Paul Jacobs, chief executive, ahead of Qualcomm’s analyst meeting in New York today.About 60 per cent of handset sales growth comes from emerging markets, accounting for the strong sales of low-priced chips. US operators are also upgrading services to high-speed wireless such as 1xEV-DO, enabling features such as video streaming and music downloads over phones.On Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported sales of all types of chips rose 7.3 per cent in the first quarter to $59.1bn. But it said the growth was driven by very strong sales of mobile phones, with unit sales up 31 per cent from the first quarter of 2005 and expected to reach 1bn this year.The average semiconductor content of a mobile phone is now about $41 per unit, according to the iSuppli research firm.The SIA said that replacement cycles for phones declining from an average of 26 months to 18 months along with robust demand in China were two factors behind the growth.“China now has approximately 410m cell phone subscribers,” said George Scalise, SIA president. “It is adding new subscribers at the rate of 5m a month, and Chinese consumers appear to be choosing high-end phones with increased functionality.”Qualcomm said its sales for the quarter could be “at or slightly above the high end of prior guidance” of $1.77bn-$1.87bn, a range that represents a 30-38 per cent increase in revenues on a year ago. It said shipments of its Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chips were now expected to be 53m-56m from 50m-53m.The higher earnings numbers inferred higher chipset operating margins, according to UBS analysts, who raised their revenue expectations for the quarter to $1.88bn and earnings by 1 cent a share in a research note.
748;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
749;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-04-19T23:08:16Z;Intel profits drop by a third;;Intel’s profits fell by a third in its first quarter, and gross margins are expected to drop below 50 per cent in its second, as the world’s biggest semiconductor maker struggles in the face of slowing PC growth.Intel’s earnings report, its worst since the bursting of the technology bubble, contrasted sharply with those of Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and that of Texas Instruments a day earlier. The trio of chipmakers is focused on a booming mobile phone market, and reported rising profits.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said Intel believed PC growth rates had “moderated over the course of the past few quarters, leading to slower chip-level inventory reductions at our customers and affecting our revenue in the first half of the year.”He announced revenues of $8.94bn and earnings per share of 23 cents – in line with analyst estimates that had been revised down after Intel issued a revenue warning in March. This compared to sales of $9.43bn a year earlier and profits of 35 cents a share. Intel reported first-quarter gross margins of 55.1 per cent, compared with its expectations in January of 59 per cent. It blamed lower microprocessor revenues and higher inventory write-downs.The company has suffered from its customers not requiring chips they had earlier ordered as demand for personal computers slowed – leading to inventory build-up. It has also been losing market share to its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices.There is worse to come in the current quarter – Intel said revenues were expected to be between $8bn and $8.6bn, below normal seasonal patterns. Gross margins would fall to about 49 per cent as it sold more of its cheaper processors and suffered higher costs. Intel is introducing more powerful and efficient chips based on a new micro-architecture in the coming months. Mr Otellini said the new processors would set the stage for a “strong second half”.However, this will not make up for the poor first-half performance – 2006 revenues are expected to be 3 per cent down on 2005 after a three-year run of double-digit sales growth. Intel shares were nearly 1 per cent higher in after-hours trading at $19.75.Qualcomm reported a 34 per cent rise in revenues year-on-year and an 11 per cent rise in profits.Freescale also reported higher sales and profits, while Texas Instruments had experienced a 42 per cent increase in profits in its first quarter.
750;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;AMD moves into Intel’s turf;;Intel’s stranglehold on the computer microprocessor market was loosened further by its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in the first quarter as it reported market-share gains in a new generation of chips.AMD opened the technology hardware earnings season on an optimistic note for the industry, with profits well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations at 38 cents a share, compared with an analyst consensus of 30 cents gathered by Thomson Financial.But its comments did not augur well for erstwhile bellwether Intel, which reports next week along with other major US chipmakers Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Freescale.“AMD had another great quarter,” said Bob Rivet, chief financial officer. “Building on our positive momentum, we believe we once again gained dollar market share based on strong customer demand for AMD64 single and multi-core processors.”The move to computing that addresses 64-bit instead of 32-bit memory and from single-core to dual-core processors has been driving sales for Intel and AMD, which share the market for the dominant “x86” family of microprocessors.In a Merrill Lynch report released last week entitled “Looking into the Q2 Abyss”, semiconductor analyst Joe Osha said Intel’s results next Wednesday would “probably be the worst set of results and forecasts that the company has delivered since the bursting of the bubble”.He cited excess inventory, pricing pressures and AMD’s long-held lead in processor technology for servers as raising short-term and long-term doubts about Intel’s ability to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.AMD shares closed 3 per cent higher at $35.42 in New York and were flat in after-hours trading. Intel’s fell 0.2 per cent to hit a 52-week low of $19.12.Intel still supplies the processors in four out of every five PCs made globally but AMD’s market share has increased significantly of late – rising from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent from the third to fourth quarters of 2005.Last month, Intel issued a first-quarter sales warning, in part blaming further market share loss.
751;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;S Korea anti-trust regulator raids Qualcomm;;South Korean anti-trust regulators raided the Seoul offices of Qualcomm, the US wireless chipmaker said on Wednesday, apparently to investigate claims that?the San Diego-based firm had abused its market dominance.The raid is the latest in a string of actions against American technology companies operating in Korea, including Microsoft and Intel, with the competition watchdog saying it is trying to ensure Korean IT companies have the chance to grow.Officials from the Fair Trade Commission searched Qualcomm?s offices in Seoul on Tuesday but did not explain why, said Oh Jae-ha, a senior director at Qualcomm?s Korean unit.?They didn?t mention anything specific ? they said they just wanted to investigate Qualcomm?s business practices,? Mr Oh said. ?Your guess is as good as mine.?The FTC declined to confirm that it had raided Qualcomm.Qualcomm supplies chips to South Korean mobile phone manufacturers including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Analysts say Qualcomm collects royalties of 5.25 per cent on local handset sales and 5.75 per cent on exports from Korean manufacturers, but there have been reports of friction between Qualcomm and the mobile phone makers over these fees.Qualcomm licences code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, the second most widely used wireless network standard in the world after global system for mobile communications (GSM). Although CDMA is the standard in South Korea, Samsung and LG Electronics export GSM phones. In November, Qualcomm and Samsung signed an agreement under which the Korean company makes Qualcomm?s chips used in CDMA cell phones on a contract basis.The action against Qualcomm follows the FTC?s unannounced visit to the Seoul offices of Intel, the world?s largest chipmaker, in February over alleged unfair business practices against Korean hardware makers.Microsoft last month appealed the FTC?s December order that the US software maker should separate its Media Player and instant messaging programmes from its operating system. The commission also fined the company Won33bn for abusing its dominant position in the South Korean market.The FTC on Wednesday said it had established an advisory group to check whether Microsoft was complying with its order. The group, comprising professors, a lawyer and a business executive, would guarantee ?fairness and legitimacy? in Microsoft?s compliance with the antitrust ruling, the watchdog said.?
752;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-03-29T21:33:52Z;Wall Street rallies as tech stocks shine;;The bulls regained the upper hand on Wall Street on Wednesday as the market rallied sharply from Tuesday’s interest-rate driven sell-off.The Nasdaq Composite led the charge, surging 1.5 per cent to 2,337.78, with a flurry of positive broker notes and good news from Apple Computer luring investors back into technology stocks.The Amex computer hardware index jumped 2.1 per cent while the Amex semiconductor index climbed 2.5 per cent.Sun Microsystems, the computer server maker, was among the top gainers. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $5.25 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock by two notches from “underweight” to “overweight”, citing an improved financial outlook.Qualcomm and other wireless technology companies, including Motorola, also benefited from an upbeat new coverage note from Cowen & Co. The broker gave the two companies an “outperform” rating, saying the outlook for the global handset market was positive this year. Qualcomm rose 2.8 per cent to $51. Motorola gained 3.8 per cent to $22.77.Google, which will join the S&P on Friday, rose 4.7 per cent to $394.98. Apple, which is facing a class-action lawsuit that claims iPods cause hearing loss, jumped 6.2 per cent to $62.33 after it released a software upgrade that allows users to set a maximum volume limit on iPods.Red Hat failed to capitalise on the upswing. Its shares lost 2.2 per cent to $28.19 after the Linux computer software distributor’s second quarter guidance failed to meet investors’ lofty expectations.Interest rate sensitive stocks such as financials, homebuilders and industrial blue chips recovered, buoyed by growing expectations that US economic and corporate profit growth would withstand the ill effects of rising interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent higher at 11,231.94 while the S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent to 1,302.89.Elsewhere, news that Boston Properties and Kimco Realty were set to join the S&P 500 index drove shares in the real estate investment funds up 6.9 per cent to $96.87 and 6.8 per cent to $41.40 respectively as fund managers adjusted their portfolios to track the index.“The increased reit weighting in the S&P 500 means fund managers(both in the U.S. and abroad) have to pay additional attention to this once overlooked sector, which should expand valuations in the short-term,” said Steve Sakwa, analyst at Merrill Lynch.The S&P real estate index rose 1.8 per cent, with ProLogis up 2.3 per cent at $54.65 and Vornado Realty up 2 per cent at $97.43, among the other reits to advance.Other movers included General Motors, which fell 2.6 per cent to $22.15 after disclosures in the carmaker’s delayed annual report sparked fresh investor worries and led Standard & Poor’s to say it might downgrade the company’s credit rating further.Ameritrade shot up 9.4 per cent to $20.96 after the online broker raised its quarterly earnings forecasts thanks to surging customer trading volume
753;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-03-27T21:24:25Z;Wall Street slips but telecoms advance;;The possible merger between Lucent and Alcatel of France continued to keep alive investor interest in the telecommunications equipment sector on Monday.Prudential and Lehman Brothers both maintained their “overweight” rating on the stock, with with analyst Inder Singh of Prudential praising the economics of the potential deal. He said it “makes even more sense today than it did in 2001”, when a similar attempt fell through.Shares in Lucent, which jumped more than 8.5 per cent on Friday, gained another 0.7 per cent to $3.08.Speculation that more consolidation in the sector might be ahead helped lift shares of other network equipment makers. Qualcomm traded 0.7 per cent higher to $49.71, JDS Uniphase climbed 0.5 per cent to $4.05 and Ciena rose 1.6 per cent to $5.23.The sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index put on 0.1 per cent to 2,315.58, however the broader market lost ground as the mood turned cautious with the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day interest rate-setting meeting.Maury Harris, an economist at UBS, said the fact the meeting was the first to be chaired by Ben Bernanke raised the the potential for a surprise, but the chances of one actually happening were slim.“We believe one of the chairman’s goals initially is to stress continuity with the Grreenspan era, minimising volatility in the market associated with a change in leadership,” he said.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 11,250.27, while the S&P 500 also eased 0.1 per cent to 1,301.61.Housebuilders put in a strong performance, with Toll Brothers rising 2.8 per cent to $35.30 after Wachovia upgraded the housebuilder from “market perform” to “outperform”.Wachovia said it believed the worst news for Toll the company was behind it. “A uniquely strong competitive position relative to small high-end custom builders led us to believe that Toll Brothers’ shares should outperform over the next six to 12 months,” analysts said. “Shares remain inexpensive in our view.”The move gave other large housebuilders a boost, with Ryland rising 0.9 per cent to $71.49 and Lennar climbing 0.7 per cent to $60.33.Metal stocks were in focus after Citigroup issued a bullish note on the sector, raising its forecasts substantially for copper and nickel and more modestly for aluminium and gold.Metal producers Inco, Alcan and Phelps Dodge were all upgraded. Inco added 0.8 per cent to $49.46, Alcan gained 1 per cent to $45.76 and Phelps rose 2 per cent to $76.61.Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, rose 1.6 per cent to $24.64 after an upgrade from broker Lehman Brothers.There were contrasting fortunes among pharmaceuticals. Santarus rose 4.8 per cent to $6.55 after the drugmaker said regulators had approved a tablet form of its Zegerid heartburn drug.Encysive Pharmaceuticals fell 49.3 per cent to $4.60 after the Food and Drug Administration requested further trials of its hypertension drug Thelin, saying it had concerns that must be satisfied prior to granting approval.
754;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm rides on European wireless wave;;The rapid growth of Europe’s high-speed wireless communications market, following years of delay, contributed to a 25 per cent increase in revenues at Qualcomm in the final quarter of last year.However, despite a strong run-up in its stock price in recent months on hopes 2006 will see a much wider uptake of so-called 3G services, the US wireless technology company did not increase its financial guidance for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in September.With average selling prices (ASPs) of handsets falling as more manufacturers enter the 3G market, profit margins from its chips and licensing businesses could decline in the second half of this year, Qualcomm said. It added that an aggressive push to expand sales of chips for handsets based on the older CDMA technology in India and China, where prices are lower, will also contribute to the lower margins.Falling prices, however, are likely to boost sales of handsets, company executives said, supporting Qualcomm’s revenue outlook. “As we bring the APSs down we break into a new range of handset models,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive officer.Qualcomm said that the rapidly falling prices of 3G handsets in Europe should also help support its defence against a complaint lodged with the EC by several big European technology companies accusing it of charging excessive royalties for its technology. Qualcomm sells its own chipsets for use in mobile handsets and also licenses other manufacturers to use of its technology, which is used in all forms of 3G.In the latest quarter, sales volumes of WCDMA handsets – one of two forms of 3G – rose 24 per cent, with sales in Europe up 51 per cent, Qualcomm said. With competition from more manufacturers, average selling prices of WCDMA handsets fell 10 per cent, to $372, it added. Prices for low-end handsets dropped much faster, declining from $217 to $141, the company said.In the latest quarter, Qualcomm’s chips business reported a 19 per cent increase in revenues to $1.033bn, while its higher-margin licensing business rose 41 per cent to $564m. Overall revenues, at 1.74bn, were marginally lower than Wall Street expectations, though pro-forma earnings came in slightly higher thanks to tighter control on operating expenses.Reported net income rose 21 per cent, to $620m, or 36 cents a share.
755;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2006-01-23T23:26:28Z;Alliance formed to promote mobile TV;;Nokia, Intel, Motorola and other wireless equipment makers have formed an alliance to promote an emerging technology standard for delivering live TV to mobile phones.The partners said they would work together to develop and spread the use of DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld) – an open standard for broadcasting TV on wireless equipment – through a group dubbed the Mobile DTV Alliance.Texas Instruments and Crown Castle International, the US cell tower operator that is building a DVB-H network in the US, are also members of the alliance.The formation of the alliance represents a serious challenge for Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, that is backing a rival proprietary technology called Media Flow.DVB-H and Media Flow technologies will enable mobile carriers to provide video content to subscribers without overloading their 3G wireless networks.Mobile operators and video content providers in the US and elsewhere hope that delivering mobile TV and other video content to mobile phones will provide them with a new revenue stream. In the US, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which operate 3G networks based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology, are expected to adopt Media Flow. Mobile carriers in Australia,Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and UShave been testing DVB-H technology.
756;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-12-27T22:04:09Z;Muslim investors top 2005 faith funds table;;In a year when the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has nudged up barely 5 per cent, investors would have done better by investing according to the principles of the Koran.Among the small but rapidly growing band of faith-based mutual funds, the main US Muslim fund has beaten funds run according to the principles of the Catholics, the Mennonites, the Presbyterians, and the evangelical Christians. In fact, with the $100m (£58m, €84m) Islamic Amana Growth fund posting a 22 per cent return for the year, they have pretty much beaten everyone, according to data provided by Lipper.Amana Growth and its sister fund, Amana Income, avoid investing in any company that derives more than 5 per cent of its revenue from alcohol, tobacco, pornography, gambling or the sale of pork. It sold stock in Albertson’s, a grocery chain, when alcohol sales began to edge close to 5 per cent of revenue. The Koran’s ban on money lending also eliminates most financial institutions. Morningstar, the fund tracker, notes that Amana keeps stock turnover low because the Koran warns against speculation. Apple, Qualcomm and Adobe are big holdings.Another small fund aimed at the large US Muslim community, the Allied Dow Islamic index, has reaped only 6.9 per cent for the year. It invests 80 per cent of money in various Dow Jones Islamic indices, with the remainder actively managed.The Timothy Plan, which appeals mainly to evangelical Christians, has a clutch of funds that avoid alcohol, tobacco, gambling, abortion, pornography and also any companies that advertise on shows which feature sex or violence. Its biggest, the Large to Midcap Value Fund, has scored a return of 17.5 per cent, this year after underperforming for some time.Among the rest of the pack, the Ave Maria Catholic Values fund - the flagship of four Ave Maria funds which hold a total of $400m - has returned 6.3 per cent for the year. It avoids investing in companies that facilitate abortion, donate to Planned Parenthood, are involved in pornography or offer same-sex partner benefits. That last requirement eliminates about 200 of the 500 companies in the S&P.New Covenant, the Presbyterian mutual fund which, with $2bn under management, is the heavyweight of the faith-based world, and MMA Praxis, the mutual fund arm of the Mennonite Church, have performed largely in line with the market. Both have more in common with socially responsible investing, avoiding companies that make firearms or that cause environmental damage as well as screening out gambling and alcohol-related companies.The tiny Vice Fund - which actively invests in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and so on - has returned less than 5 per cent.
757;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-12-08T23:04:08Z;Intel lowers Q4 revenue expectations;;Intel, the largest semiconductor manufacturer, disappointed the market on Thursday as it lowered the top end of its expectations for fourth-quarter revenues.In a mid-quarter update, Intel said it expected sales of between $10.4bn and $10.6bn, narrowing the previous range of $10.2bn to $10.8bn.Capital spending was forecast to be below the midpoint of previous expectations of $5.9bn, plus or minus $200m. Gross margins were still estimated at 63 per cent, but plus or minus a point rather than two points, and all other expectations remained unchanged, it said.On Thursday, Intel shares fell 2.9 per cent in after-hours trading to $24.95 on the news.Analysts polled by Thomson First Call expected Intel to produce on average sales of $10.6bn and earnings of 43 cents for the fourth quarter. A number had predicted in recent days that it would raise revenue expectations.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, told an analyst conference call that Intel was suffering from a shortage of the chipsets that accompany its processors and had been forced to turn to third-party manufacturers to fulfil demand.“We are seeing reasonable expectations for consumption around the world,” he said.The Silicon Valley company earns most of its revenues from processors for servers, desktop PCs and notebook computers.Earlier in the day, Qualcomm, a chipmaker focused on the mobile phone industry, had set an optimistic tone: it said in an update that its revenues were expected to be at the high end of the $1.67bn to $1.77bn it had estimated earlier for the quarter ending this month.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said this reflected “higher handset ASPs [average selling prices] due primarily to strength in [3G] WCDMA handset shipments in Europe.“We see several European operators being particularly aggressive this holiday season with their 3G offerings.”National Semiconductor, the leading provider of power management chips for handheld devices, reported a 21 per cent rise in quarterly revenues year-on-year to $544m and profits of 32 cents per share.
758;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Verizon to offer high-quality mobile TV;;Verizon Wireless, the second-largest US mobile carrier by subscribers, said it would begin delivering high-quality, TV-style video content to subscribers using a new network and service called MediaFlo under construction by Qualcomm, a US-based mobile chip developer.The US carrier, which has built its existing wireless network using Qualcomm?s CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology, is the first US carrier to commit to the MediaFlo network ? designed to offer wireless carriers a relatively low-cost way to deliver high-quality video services to subscribers.?MediaFlo USA?s network will allow us to provide compelling real-time multimedia services to wireless customers,? said John Stratton, Verizon Wireless?s chief marketing officer. The joint venture between Verizon and Britain?s Vodafone group is clearly hoping that by adopting MediaFlo it can leapfrog its rivals in the deployment of mobile TV ? one of the hottest emerging markets in the US and Europe.The decision also represents a significant boost for Qualcomm, which has invested heavily in the MediaFlo technology, and has acquired the radio spectrum required to deploy it through its MediaFlo USA unit.It could, however, signal the start of a standards battle between MediaFlo and a rival multicasting technology called DVB-H backed by Nokia and others. In the US, Crown Castle, a cell tower operator, and Nokia have been building a network based on the technology.Qualcomm and Verizon Wireless said they initially planned to launch mobile TV services over the MediaFlo network in about half the markets already covered by Verizon Wireless?s EV-DO broadband network.?Using the MediaFlo technology and network, Verizon Wireless will be able to offer its customers a real-time TV-like experience on their wireless phones unlike anything available on the market today,? said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm?s chief executive.
759;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-11-22T18:52:32Z;Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm: Where Asia leads, the rest follow;;San Diego-based Qualcomm has championed 3G for longer than many in the wireless communications industry.The company behind CDMA cellular technology, widely used in Asia and North America, has more recently made significant inroads in GSM-based markets, especially Europe. Qualcomm’s chipsets can be found in a wide range of UMTS 3G devices, including mobile data cards but also in a growing number of phones.Dr Paul Jacobs, who took over as CEO of the company this year, says the industry is only now bringing together all the elements that will bring 3G – and the accompanying data-based services – into the mainstream.“The phones are becoming good now,” he says. “They are the right size, the right cost and the right features. Operators are now seeing 3G as a core part of their business, rather than the icing on the cake.”For Dr Jacobs, this means moving away from promoting data as a service in itself to explaining what it can offer to mobile subscribers. But it is also about using 3G to make better use of radio spectrum, cutting the cost of voice calls and so driving up mobile phone use, especially among consumers.“This is the year when operators are finally saying they will make the push for 3G, he says. “Previously, they did not really have their marketing plans together, or if they did they were around features such as video calling, which are interesting but not compelling.”Dr Jacobs points to the success of the strategy adopted by Hutchison with its network 3: as a newcomer, the operator quickly realised that it was competitive bundles of voice minutes, rather than hi-tech services, that would convince consumers to switch to its network.Hutchison’s strategy has worked because it is voice calls above all else that drive consumers and business users to buy a mobile phone. For Dr Jacobs, voice remains the “killer application”.Take-up of other services will grow as better – and better-priced – handsets come to the market. “Look at something like the video camera [in a mobile phone] – that has become more interesting,” he says. “The stills camera was the first piece, then came the video camera. The quality has improved, phones have more memory, and we are starting to see the capabilities of the networks improve.”Dr Jacobs believes that video-enabled phones could prove as successful as camera phones already are. But handsets that compete with camcorders, even at the low end, pose some challenges for network operators. “Operators are good at getting information from the network to the device,” he says. “But getting information from the device to the network will be as important.”In Asia, Dr Jacobs has also witnessed the early adoption of both TV-out and gaming on mobile handsets. He expects both features to become mainstream, and to drive the use of data services. “Every new technology shows up in Asia first,” he says. “Consumers in Asia are willing to pay more for their phones.“A lot of the services there require an extra piece of hardware that adds to the cost, power consumption, or size of the phone.” European and North American consumers are somewhat more conservative.Asian manufacturers were the first to add TV connections to their phones, and it is a feature that consumers in the region do use. “It starts because you have pictures or videos and you can take your phone out to show them to somebody. Qualcomm, through its MediaFlo subsidiary, has also made a substantial bet on mobile TV.“But then you put applications on the phone, and you can use it as a games controller. It is much cheaper than a games console. The phone will be the games console for the rest of the world,” he says.The latest mobile handsets can already play high-speed, action-rich games and let players compete with each other across networks. Jacobs expects to see wireless connections to TVs and other home entertainment gear via 802.11n or ultra-wide-band radio.“The phone is no longer limited to a two-and-a-half inch screen,” he says.
760;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Groups push for action on intellectual property;;Vodafone, T-Mobile, Telefónica and other large telecoms groups will on Tuesday demand an overhaul of the way Europe’s main telecoms standard-setter deals with intellectual property rights.The groups’ criticism is directed at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the body responsible for standardisation of information and communication technology in Europe. ETSI’s biggest success to date has been the creation of the GSM mobile phone standard, but more recently the body has been attacked for its allegedly lax rules on intellectual property rights [IPRs].The telecoms groups have now tabled a proposal for today’s general assembly of ETSI members warning that the body’s current IPR rules leave companies exposed to “unsustainable” and “excessive” demands for royalties. They even warn that the “benefits of standardisation are being eroded”.The European Commission has already demanded that ETSI tighten its rules to ensure that none of its members can pull off a so-called “patent ambush”.The practice usually involves companies trying to turn their patented technology into an industry standard without telling other companies about their patent claim. If their technology is accepted as a new standard, companies can then demand royalties from other groups forced to use the patented technology.Last month, Nokia and other leading handset makers formally complained to Brussels about Qualcomm, the US mobile chipmaker. They alleged that Qualcomm had unfairly used its patents on third-generation technologies to squeeze excessive royalties and licensing deals out of the industry.Vodafone and its allies want ETSI to improve its policies so as to avoid similar disputes in the future. They suggest that IPR terms should be agreed before a standard is even set, and argue in favour of putting a cap on the “maximum royalty payment from individual IPR users to the combined IPR holders”.Their proposal, seen by the Financial Times, states: “Cumulative patent royalties/‘patent stacking’ can raise the licence burden to an extent unbearable to our industry.”It adds: “IPR licence fees have become a commercial issue that is limiting the industry’s ability to continue to drive down costs. The issue has the potential to limit competition through direct and indirect impact on pricing.”Vodafone and the other groups point out that the problems outlined in their proposal not only affect third-generation, but technologies such as MP3 and copy protection.The proposal’s other sponsors are Alcatel, Hutchison Europe, Orange, Portugal Telecom, Research in Motion, SFR, Swisscom, TDC, Telecom Italia, Telenor and TeliaSonera.
761;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Qualcomm sues Nokia over 12 patents;;A patent war involving leading mobile phone and chip makers intensified on Monday, with Qualcomm announcing it was suing Nokia for infringement of a dozen of its patents.The move by the US mobile chip maker appeared to be a response to last month’s complaints to the European Commission by Nokia and five other companies that Qualcomm was being anti-competitive in refusing to license its patents to the industry on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.” Qualcomm said it filed suit on Friday in a federal court in San Diego alleging infringement of 11 of its patents and one owned by its subsidiary SnapTrack.“We have been discussing a number of issues with Nokia for some time, including the fact that we have essential GSM patents for which Nokia is not licensed,” said Louis Lupin, Qualcomm general counsel.“Until recently, we had been led to believe that these issues might be resolved co-operatively and amicably,” he added.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note that Qualcomm was “playing hardball.” “This appears to be an aggressive counter to Nokia’s complaint . . . we believe today’s suit . . . signals [Qualcomm’s] view that they have a strong case in these matters,” they said.Nokia said it had not yet seen the full complaint so could not comment on its “substantive aspects”. But it said it was “disappointed” with Qualcomm’s decision to resort to legal action, claiming that the US company had not even attempted to hold any licensing negotiations.“Qualcomm has a duty to license those patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Qualcomm has not provided Nokia with any proposed terms for a licence in compliance with its obligations,” it said.Analysts believe that intellectual property rights disputes in the mobile phone arena are on the rise as falling prices for the equipment increasingly put margins under pressure.“All this does is underline the importance of intellectual property in this business,” said Ben Wood, a mobile handset analyst at Gartner.The suit refers to patent infringement through the use of Qualcomm’s Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology.
762;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm reports sharp gains;;"Strong growth in worldwide mobile phone shipments helped Qualcomm, the leading US wireless technology group, report sharp gains in fiscal fourth quarter revenues and net earnings on Wednesday.Qualcomm’s CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) chips power mobile phones sold by Verizon and Sprint Nextel in the US and a growing number of other carriers around the world. The company has also invested heavily in the WCDMA technology found in many 3G handsets. Net profits jumped to $538m, or 32 cents a share, compared with $393m, or 23 cents a share in the same period a year ago on revenues that grew by 40 per cent to $1.56bn.Looking ahead, the California-based company also forecast continued strong growth citing higher-than-expected handset shipments in the US and Brazil in particular.As a result Qualcomm said it expects revenues to rise by between 18 per cent and 25 per cent next year. Profit excluding some costs in the fiscal first quarter will be 36 cents to 38 cents on sales of $1.67bn to $1.77bn, Qualcomm said.""Our record financial results reflect the accelerating migration to CDMA throughout the world,"" said Paul Jacobs, chief executive. “As of September 2005, there were approximately 159 operators offering third generation services in 71 countries with over 200m subscribers.""Mr Jacobs said Qualcomm had made gains in both the markets for handsets based on its CDMA chips which now account for about a quarter of all the handsets sold worldwide, and in the market for 3G phones based on the WCDMA standard which generate royalties for Qualcomm. However that success has brought its own challenges.Last week six telecoms equipment makers, including Ericsson and Nokia, called on the European Commission to investigate Qualcomm accusing the company of using its patents on 3G technology to shut out competition.On Wednesday Mr Jacobs said Qualcomm has yet to receive the formal complaint but said the company wholeheartedly rejected the accusations that its licensing practices were unfair and that it had stifled innovation.“These suggestions are factually and demonstrably incorrect,” he said adding, “We are looking forward to the opportunity to shed some light on this.”"

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent at 2,120.30.On Thursday, the S&P 500 had been on track for its worst monthly performance since December 2002, at a loss of 4.1 per cent. However, the subsequent recovery cut its monthly loss to just 1.8 per cent. The Dow lost 1.2 per cent in October and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent.“This is the start of an end-of-year rally. Stocks are reasonably priced and they are good value in terms of projected earnings,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.Data on Monday showed that the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, came in at just 0.2 per cent in September, helping to allay fears that inflation was rising. However, higher energy prices pushed the headline rate to 0.9 per cent.M&A talk helped the market, with Placer Dome surging 20.8 per cent to $19.95 as Canadian rival Barrick Gold submitted a hostile $9.2bn bid, or $20.50 a share, for the gold miner.Retailer Saks rose 8.9 per cent to $18.15 as it sold 142 to Bon-Ton Stores for $1.1bn. Bon-Ton jumped 20.4 per cent to $20.05.Vaccine maker Chiron gained 1.7 per cent at $44.14 as Switzerland’s Novartis upped its offer for the shares of Chiron it does not already own from $40 a share to $45.Oil refiner Valero Energy rose 5.8 per cent to $105.24 as underlying third quarter earnings came in at $4.37 a share, more than double last year and 14 cents ahead of forecasts. The outlook for the fourth quarter was “outstanding”, Valero added.Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum also reported a doubling of third quarter earnings on the back of higher energy prices, helping the shares firm 2.6 per cent to $78.88.Wal-Mart rose 4 per cent to $47.31 on expectations of October’s same-store sales being 4.3 per cent higher than last year, while Caterpillar rose 3 per cent to $52.59 as it eyed compound annual earnings growth of 15-20 per cent a year until 2010. Apple Computer rose 5.7 per cent to $57.59 as it said its iTunes online service had sold a million videos since launch on October 12.But Kellogg fell 4.9 per cent to $44.17 as the cereal maker reported falling margins despite beating third quarter profit forecasts.Wireless technology company Qualcomm slipped 3.2 per cent to $39.76 after a Merrill Lynch downgrade.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, rose 4.8 per cent to $13.50 on a Lehman Brothers upgrade. With oil prices falling, Continental Airlines rose 7.1 per cent to $12.95, SkyWest firmed 4.5 per cent at $29.31 and Alaska Air gained 5.1 per cent at $31.53.
764;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-10-28T19:36:37Z;Qualcomm rivals take case to EU;;Nokia, Texas Instruments and other leading makers of mobile phones and the chips that power them have formally complained to Brussels that Qualcomm, the US mobile chipmaker, has unfairly used its patents on 3G technologies to squeeze excessive royalties and licensing deals out of the industry.US chipmakers Broadcom and Texas Instruments, and Ericsson, NEC, Nokia, Panasonic Mobile Communications have each filed complaints to the European Commission requesting it investigate Qualcomm and take action to stop its alleged anti-competitive conduct.Qualcomm holds patents on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology that have generated billions of dollars in royalties. It is seeing worldwide adoption of its own next-generation CDMA2000 technology and the WCDMA standard it played a large part in creating. It earns royalties from both.In a statement, the companies said Qualcomm had refused to license patents to chipset competitors on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms” while “offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm”.They also said Qualcomm’s royalties on WCDMA were “excessive and disproportionate”, given that Qualcomm charged the same rate for CDMA 2000, despite less of its technology being used in WCDMA.“Major telecommunications equipment companies on three continents are standing up and saying that Qualcomm’s business practices are unfair, uncompetitive and ultimately illegal,” said David Dull, general counsel at Broadcom.Analysts said the unexpected coalition exposed the sector’s fears that Qualcomm could take the lion’s share of the spoils from the development of next-generation technologies.Maurits Dolmans, partner at Cleary Gottlieb, the law firm representing Nokia, said Qualcomm’s practices were keeping the costs of 3G technology prohibitively high, and were ultimately hurting consumers purchasing next-generation handsets.“The amounts are very significant – possibly in the billions of dollars,” he said.Broadcom has already made a separate complaint in the US legal system, but has gathered a wider coalition to take the issue to the European Commission, Europe’s leading antitrust authority.The company said on Friday: “Qualcomm cannot comment at this time.”The Commission invariably takes months to scrutinise the legal arguments and facts of a case after receiving a complaint.
765;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Qualcomm acquires Flarion Technologies;;Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker whose technology dominates 3G handsets, on Thursday moved to strengthen its fourth-generation position with the acquisition of Flarion Technologies for up to $805m.Flarion holds patents and makes equipment for OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) technology, which promises data speeds at least 10 times faster than current third-generation phones.While Flarion has held OFDMA trials in South Korea, the US and Europe, the standard is still being developed and full-scale commercial deployments are at least three years away, analysts said.Qualcomm's patents for CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology are reaping it billions of dollars in royalties and its W-CDMA and CDMA 2000 technology have been adopted by 3G operators around the world.“We have also been working on OFDMA for a number of years internally,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive.Combining Qualcomm's internal development staff with Flarion's 110 engineers would give the company the strongest team in the industry, he said.Qualcomm is betting operators will want to use OFDMA to serve mobile video to consumers and its MediaFLO subsidiary is using a version of the technology to develop a mobile network television service.Qualcomm said it had been in on-and-off talks with Flarion, which is based in New Jersey and partly owned by Cisco Systems, over the past few years.Flarion had been developing mobile broadband equipment since 2000.Qualcomm said it would pay $600m in stock and cash and an additional $205m over the next few years if certain milestones were achieved.Tal Liani, analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a note on Thursday predicting the acquisition, said the real benefit of the deal would be for Qualcomm's chip division as current GSM, W-CDMA and future OFDMA technologies would need to co-exist together on mobile phones.“We see the need for dual-mode or even triple-mode chips to power advanced OFDM devices. Qualcomm, as well as other chip vendors, will have to master OFDM to design such chips and we believe therein lies the rational,” he wrote.The deal is expected to be completed in October, creating $10m in costs and diluting 2006 profits by 3 cents a share. Flarion was advised by Evercore Partners and Qualcomm by Morgan Stanley.
766;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-07-27T07:51:30Z;No longer flights of fancy as airlines roll out mobile options;;Air travel can be mind-numbing. And that may explain why passengers have not made a big deal about being “off line” during flights. But technology and regulatory changes are making it likely that internet and even cellphones will become ubiquitous during flights.Limited on-board communications exist. Those neglected seat-back phones, such as Verizon’s Airfone, have been in planes for years. Webmail and short messaging are also available on many aircraft, especially in the US. But high tariffs, low bandwidth and an awkward form factor have discouraged uptake.The first big innovation was Connexion by Boeing, an on-board Wi-Fi service with high-speed wireless internet access. Launched 14 months ago, the Boeing subsidiary uses a five megabit satellite link to offer stable, abundant bandwidth at low prices. A competing service is under development by OnAir, a consortium that includes Airbus. OnAir will also enable travellers to use their own GSM phones for voice calls.But current usage rates appear low. “I’ve heard that Lufthansa is less than pleased with uptake of Connexion,” says Henry Harteveldt at Forrester Research. Connexion by Boeing is available on 100 flights per day on six airlines, although the number of flights served should double by the year-end.Mr Harteveldt believes broadband internet will be a must-have for all airlines. “It will be as essential to an aircraft as a coffee maker by 2008 or 2009,” he says.And Connexion does have happy customers, claiming satisfaction rates of 93 per cent. “I was pretty jazzed by the service on a flight to Copenhagen,” says Brad Smith, a marketer for a Washington software company. “I felt like I was in the office and didn’t lose any of my work day.”“The highest barrier is awareness,” says Laurette Koellner, president of Connexion. One way that the company hopes to drive usage is through partnerships with Wi-Fi roaming aggregators, such as T-Systems and Boingo.The next frontier in in-flight communications is cellphone use. Banned for safety reasons, regulators seemed satisfied that the service can be made safe. The technology is also ready with solutions available from Ericsson, Siemens and Qualcomm.The biggest barrier to use is likely to be social. “I can see major cases of air rage as a result of cellphones,” warns Mr Harteveldt. The leading US association of flight attendants is adamantly opposed to them. Forrester advocates on-board call boxes that could be rented to place calls. Demand for voice calls appears limited.“Only 16 per cent of air travellers are interested in voice. Most want data and messaging,” says Mr Harteveldt.But OnAir claims customers on short haul flights are more interested in voice calls. “These flights are part of the business work day and the ambiance is different. Voice is more accepted,” says George Cooper, chief executive. But if passenger demand is ambiguous, what is in it for the airlines?Connexion and OnAir believe the availability of in-flight communications will lead customers to choose one airline over another. “Business travellers are not going to stay in a hotel without internet access. We want to translate these expectations to the aircraft,” says Mr Cooper.Airlines could also use broadband connectivity to get out of the in-flight entertainment business, says Mr Harteveldt.By providing a fat data pipe, airlines could “outsource” entertainment to the passenger, eliminating the hefty licensing fees they pay for content as well as binning the servers that weigh up to 1,000 lbs. Lighter planes mean lower fuel consumption or additional passengers – money saved or gained.One early step is Singapore Airlines’ plan to use Connexion for live television on some flights. Users will be able to watch channels such as BBC World on their Wi-Fi laptops. The TV service will be available to all Connexion-equipped planes later this year.It remains to be seen whether sales will be sufficient to offset the high investment to equip planes with in-flight communications. Forrester estimates that the total cost of installing Connexion by Boeing is around $500,000 per plane. OnAir claims its solution will cost significantly less. Besides the on-board hardware, Connexion and OnAir must lease satellite capacity and patch together a terrestrial network. “The top entry barrier in this business is building the worldwide network,” says Ms Koellner.The cost of these systems is why US airlines are looking at a less expensive air-to-ground (ATG) alternative. Rather than using a satellite link ATG provides a direct radio link between the plane and the ground network.An ATG network offering several megabits of bandwidth would need to be deployed as a stand-alone system, says Paul Guckian at Qualcomm, the telecoms vendor. “To cover the entire US and service all of the 5,000 planes in flight at any one time would require just 100 to 200 base stations.”Another disruptive technology is voice over IP. If high-quality broadband is available on planes, nothing prevents a passenger from bypassing costly roaming tariffs using a VoIP client such as Skype to make free calls.“This is not something we actively market but, yes, it works,” says Ms Koellner.
767;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-07-25T22:45:43Z;TI tops up dividend on strong sales;;Texas Instruments underlined the bullish mood among chipmakers by promising a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend together with continuation of its stock buyback programme.The second-largest US semiconductor company will pay a quarterly dividend of 3 cents a share from October, up from 2.5 cents.The board also authorised a new $2bn share buyback programme following a quarter in which TI invested $1.3bn in its own stock.Announcing second quarter earnings in line with Wall Street expectations, Rich Templeton, chief executive, said TI was benefiting from strong demand from manufacturers of consumer electronics.The company specialises in digital signal processing and analogue chips used in mobile telephones, music players and other electronic gadgets.The figures followed good financial results last week from chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom.Intel on Monday announced that it had selected Arizona as the site for a new chipmaking plant expected to cost about $3bn and create 1,000 new jobs.However, TI, despite the strong outlook, kept its capital expenditure forecast for this year unchanged at $1.3bn.Intel last week increased its capex forecast by $300m to $5.9bn.In the three months to June, TI achieved revenues of $3.2bn, unchanged from last year. Sales gains in some sectors were partially offset by disposals.Net income was $628m,or 38 cents a share, upfrom $441m or 25 cents a share.Earnings were boosted by a one-off tax benefit equivalent to 6 cents a share.Mr Templeton said growth in new orders left TI well placed to deliver “solid growth” in the current quarter. Semiconductor orders were $2.9bn, 7 per cent higher than a year ago.The company forecast earnings of 31-35 cents in the three months to September on revenues of $3.3-$3.56bn. Analysts were forecasting earning of about 32 cents.Optimism was underpinned by an improved performance from TI's Digital Light Processing (DLP) business, which makes chips based on proprietary technology that power big-screen televisions.Slower than expected growth of sales of DLP-based TVs in the fourth quarter of 2004 caused TI to slow production of DLP chips to prevent a build-up of inventory. Mr Templeton said the process of reducing inventories was now complete.TI stock gained 1.16 cents to $31.76 following the announcement, which came after the close in New York. The shares started this year at about $25.
768;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm earnings beat forecasts;;Increased demand for third generation mobile phone handsets enabled Qualcomm, the communications chipmaker, to beat Wall Street earnings expectations for its fiscal third quarter and raise its guidance for the full year.Although revenues were unchanged at $1.3bn in the three months to June, net income was $560m, or 33 cents a share, up from $486m or 29 cents.On a pro-forma basis excluding investment gains and other one-off items earnings per share were 28 cents. Analysts had forecast earnings of about 25 cents.The stock gained $1.29 to $37.38 following the announcement, which came after the close in New York.Qualcomm developed much of the technology behind the CDMA-2000 standard for third generation mobile telephony that is used widely in the US and Asia. It's technology is also incorporated into the alternative W-CDMA standard around which 3G services are being built in Europe.As well as selling chips and chipsets to phone manufacturers, Qualcomm earns royalties by licencing its technology to other chipmakers.“We are projecting continued acceleration in [3G phone] shipments towards the end of 2005 and beyond,” said Paul Jacobs, who this summer took over the role of chief executive from Irwin Jacobs, his father.For the current quarter, Qualcomm now expects earnings of 28-30 cents on revenues of $1.43-$1.53bn.In the only dark spot, Qualcomm cut full-year estimates for phones based on W-CDMA technology to 45 million from 50 million citing weaker than expected demand in Europe.
769;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm goes on attack over patents;;Qualcomm launched a counter-attack in its legal battle with Broadcom, claiming that its US communications chip rival had infringed on seven patents related to third-generation mobile phones and wi-fi networking.In a suit filed in San Diego, Qualcomm is seeking damages and an injunction preventing Broadcom from selling chips based on the GSM industry standard for 3G telephony.Broadcom this month launched a suit claiming Qualcomm was abusing its position as patent holder over technology, incorporated into GSM and other 3G standards. Qualcomm dismissed that suit at “meritless”.
770;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Sprint offers new 3G broadband service;;Sprint, the third largest US mobile network operator, began offering a new 3G broadband wireless data service to customers and said the service would be available in business districts and airports in 34 markets this month.The mobile internet service, based on a technology called EV-DO (evolution data-optimised) will compete directly with the 3G service launched in 2003 by Verizon Wireless, the second largest US mobile operator, using the same technology.Both Verizon Wireless and Sprint both operate networks based on Qualcomm’s CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology that competes with GSM-based systems including the Cingular Wireless network in the US.Sprint, which is in the process of acquiring Nextel Communications for $35bn, said it plans to provide the service initially in 14 broad market areas covering a population of about 92m this quarter.It plans to expand availability to cover 143m people by the fourth quarter and 150m potential customers in 60 major metropolitan markets early next year.The new 3G service is expected to support average access speeds of between 400kbps (kilobits per second) and 700kbps - or roughly ten faster than its current CDMA 1xRTT network.The US wireless carrier will offer customers a range of monthly data plans including a $40-a-month basic plan for up to 40Mb of data and a $80-a-month fee for unlimited access – the same as Verizon Wireless.Sprint plans to introduce EV-DO mobile phones and applications for consumers and business customers in the fourth quarter.Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group, currently offers the 3G service in about 50 markets and plans to extend coverage to reach about150m potential subscribers by the end of this year.Cingular Wireless, a joint venture between SBC Communications and BellSouth, plans to offer 3G broadband data services based on a rival technology in about 15 to 20 markets by year end.Like mobile carriers elsewhere, US operators are counting on 3G data services including mobile email, TV and video clips to offset the continued erosion of voice revenues. Sprint’s wireless data revenue grew by 14 per cent in the first quarter and represented approximately 10 per cent of customer service revenue.
771;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-07-05T18:46:08Z;Broadcom attacks rival over 3G mobile prices;;Broadcom has opened a new front in its legal battle with Qualcomm, alleging that its rival in the communications chip business is unfairly driving up the cost of third-generation mobile phones.In a complaint filed in the district court of New Jersey, Broadcom said Qualcomm was breaking federal antitrust law by failing to license its 3G technology “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.Qualcomm said it was looking into the complaint but believed it was “without merit”.The suit revolves around the use of code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology, developed largely by Qualcomm and used as the basis for mobile phone services offered by a number of US network operators. A wideband version of the technology, W-CDMA, is incorporated in the international UMTS standard for 3G services.When the UMTS standard was drawn up in the 1990s, Qualcomm agreed to license W-CDMA on fair and reasonable terms. Broadcom alleges that it has breached this undertaking by offering favourable terms to companies that buy its chips instead of simply licensing the technology.“Qualcomm's monopoly in CDMA technology has increased the price of cell phones in the US and we are hoping that the courts will prevent the same thing from happening with the next generation of 3G cell phones,” said Scott McGregor, Broadcom chiefexecutive.In a separate suit filed in May, Broadcom charged Qualcomm with several violations of its patent portfolio.Qualcomm has been aggressive in defence of its intellectual property, suing a number of companies over their use of CDMA.Last month, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected Qualcomm's claim that Texas Instruments had violated the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies.
772;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Mobile phone chip dispute deepens;;A patent dispute between two leading cellphone chipmakers intensified on Monday with the US International Trade Commission launching an investigation.Broadcom said in a statement that the ITC would look into whether its rival Qualcomm had engaged in unfair trade practices by importing baseband processor and other cellphone chips that infringed Broadcom patents.Qualcomm makes many of its products in Taiwan before importing them to the US. Broadcom is seeking a permanent ban on the importation of such products.Broadcom had filed two complaints with the ITC a month ago. At the same time, it filed similar suits in a federal court in California, where the two companies are headquartered.The court action cited the infringement of 10 Broadcom patents and sought unspecified damages. Qualcomm has yet to respond publicly to its rival's allegations.Analysts have characterised Broadcom's actions as an attempt to raise its profile in a market dominated by Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. The company says it held months of fruitless discussions with Qualcomm over royalty payments for its patents.The dispute centres on chipsets for high-end phones using the latest technologies including 3G, Bluetooth, WiFi, voice over IP and multimedia processing. Broadcom is also focusing its action on the baseband processor, one of the highest value chips in a mobile phone.The company said its ITC case had been referred to a judge who would schedule a hearing and make an initial determination, expected to be issued early next year. A final decision should follow in the second half of 2006.
773;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-06-09T20:29:57Z;Greenspan makes little impression on Wall St;;The latest assessment of economic growth and inflation prospects from Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, led to moderate gains on Wall Street on Thursday, led by technology shares.The broader market advanced in moderate trading volumes. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 10,503.02, while the S&P rose 0.5 per cent to 1,200.93 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8 per cent to 2,076.91.The labour department reported before opening that initial jobless claims last week fell by 21,000 to 330,000, near economists’ expectations. Much of the attention remained on Mr Greenspan, however.The Fed chairman said the US economy was on a “reasonably firm footing”, and indicated that the central bank would continue to fight inflation by raising interest rates at at “measured” pace.Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry handheld devices, fell 5 per cent to $73.55 after having hit a wall in its attempt to settle a patent dispute.Merrill Lynch analysts raised their 2006 revenue forecast on Google, saying it expected the company to continue benefiting from growth in the paid search format. Google shares were up 2.4 per cent to $286.31.Elsewhere in technology shares, Intel was up 2.2 per cent to $27.70 ahead of the mid-quarter update from the world’s largest semiconductor company, due after the close. The market looks to Intel’s news to shed light on the outlook for demand for technology and the end products powered by its chips. Intel said it expected sales to reach the higher end of its estimated range.Shares in H&R Block reached a 15-month high in morning trade after the tax and financial consulting company said it would split its stock, increase dividend and forecast results above analysts’ estimates. By the close, H&R Block was up 10.9 per cent to $56.18.In bid news, the shares of Niku rose 25.2 per cent to $20.66 in one of the leading performances among Nasdaq stocks, after Computer Associates said it would take over the software company for $350m in cash. CA was virtually unchanged at $27.01.On a less upbeat note Delphi, the auto parts group, saw its shares lose 4.9 per cent to $4.46 after announcing its treasurer’s resignation. It was one of the worst showings on the New York Stock Exchange, as Visteon, a competitor, fell 1.3 per cent to $6.72.Among telecommunications stocks, Qualcomm eased 1.1 per cent to $36.54 after a court ruled Texas Instruments, a rival, did not break licensing agreements with the company. TI shares inched up 0.5 per cent to $28.03.Shares in American International Group, the biggest US insurer by capitalisation, rose 1.1 per cent to $55.55 after Maurice Greenberg resigned as chairman. Mr Greenberg earlier this year stepped aside as chief executive of the insurer.
774;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
775;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Broadcom seeks injunction in IP war;;Broadcom, the semiconductor company, is seeking an injunction preventing Qualcomm, its larger rival, from selling a wide range of mobile phone chips that it claims infringes its patents.The litigation opens a new front in the intellectual property war between chip companies trying to secure a share of the likely profits from sale of third-generation mobile phones.Qualcomm has been involved in protracted litigation against Texas Instruments, which it claims broke the terms of a licensing agreement by selling chips based on its CDMA technology.Broadcom's action relates to technology used to combine voice services in a single 3G handset with digital video, digital audio, Bluetooth, data storage and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) capabilities.In addition to seeking an immediate injunction, Broadcom is asking the District Court for the Central District of California for unspecified damages.It has filed a separate action with the US International Trade Commission alleging that Qualcomm has acted unfairly by importing chips that infringe on its patents.“Qualcomm has not recognised the value of our intellectual property,” said Scott McGregor, Broadcom's chief executive. Qualcomm declined to comment.While litigation between chipmakers is common, analysts said Broadcom was being unusually agGressive by seeking an immediate injunction. Charlie Galvin, an analyst with Needham & Co, described the move as “a bit shocking” in a research note to clients.David Rosmann, Broadcom's vice-president for intellectual property litigation, said the request for an injunction was likely to be heard within a few weeks.The ITC case should go to trial in the early months of next year, he said, with the district court case heard later in 2006 or early in 2007, unless a settlement is reached in the meantime.
776;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-04-21T20:45:27Z;Dow records biggest jump in two years;;US stocks surged yesterday as positive earnings reports lifted shares a day after two of the leading US indices hit fresh year-lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 2.1 per cent to 10,218.60, its best single-day performance in more than two years. The S&P 500 rose 2 per cent to 1,159.95, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5 per cent to 1,962.41.A steep drop in jobless claims, falling oil prices, and an upbeat manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also gave Wall Street a boost.Gains strengthened throughout the day in spite of a warning from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, that rising deficits could cause the US economy to stagnate.In spite of the day’s gains, US indices were still down substantially from monthly highs.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said that, with bulls and bears locked in an increasingly volatile tug-of-war over investor sentiment, the market’s short-term fortunes may hinge on whether the indices can break through critical upward resistance points today. “If they fail here and this rally doesn’t succeed, it’s going to become more apparent that the bears are correct.”Motorolasurprised analysts with a 13.6 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The mobile handset maker also raised its second-quarter guidance. Shares in the company rose 6.7 per cent to $15.93Transport finished higher after UPS, the express shipping company, reported higher first-quarter profits and forecast stronger growth this year. UPS shares rose 4.9 per cent to $70.56Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, fell 4.3 per cent in spite of higher earnings amid concerns about food safety in China.

We have reflected that in our revised forecasts,? said Mr Jacobs, who is due to step down as chief executive on July 1. The post will be taken by Paul Jacobs, his son.Qualcomm cut its 2005 revenue forcast from $5.8-6.3bn to $5.5-5.7bn.Earnings per share excluding ?strategic investments? in smaller technology companies are expected to be about $1.12, compared with prior guidance centred on $1.18.In the three months to March, Qualcomm posted revenue of $1.4bn, a 12 per cent increase.Net income increased by 9 per cent to $532m. Earnings per share were 31 cents.Excluding strategic investments and one-off items, earnings were 29 cents, up from 27 cents and two cents higher than Wall Street expectations.Qualcomm finished the quarter with $8.3bn in cash and other liquid assets, up from $6.6bn a year ago.The company last month increased its quarterly dividend from 7 cents to 9 cents and doubled the size of its share buyback programme to $2bn.
778;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-03-11T20:38:37Z;The real scandal at Boeing is not sex;;"Granted, we do not know the full salacious details. But you have to wonder whether Boeing's board of directors overstepped the mark by firing flirtatious former chief executive Harry Stonecipher. The corridors of corporate America would be half-deserted if every office romance met with such a harsh response.Economics tells us that it is the duty of managers to maximise value for shareholders while remaining within the law. What they get up to in their private lives should be of no concern - as long as it is legal and does not interfere with their work.Since the tryst with a female Boeing executive that led to Mr Stonecipher's departure was by all accounts consensual, there is no question of harassment or other legal nasties. And since Boeing stock has soared since he took the controls in 2003, shareholders cannot complain.Ah, but what of the potential for conflict of interest? Again, it is hard to find grounds for dismissal. We know the CEO did not try to influence the career or remuneration of his lover.Besides, big companies are riddled with actual and potential conflicts. Barely an eyelid was batted this week when Qualcomm, the wireless technology company, anointed the son of Irwin Jacobs, founder and current CEO, to follow in his father's footsteps. And what of Xerox, where Tom Dolan, president of the copier company's services business, reports to his sister, Anne Mulcahy, the chief executive?Shocking as it seems, these situations can be managed. No, l'affaire Stonecipher was about morals. The CEO lost his job because he is a married man, a father, a grandfather and, to cap it all, nearing the end of his seventh decade. Rather than leaving it to Mr and Mrs Stonecipher to debate rights and wrongs behind closed doors, Boeing's board felt compelled to pass judgment.You do not need to be a louche libertarian to worry about companies imposing their moral standards on individuals. The detailed rules and regulations that govern interaction between the sexes in the American workplace were designed ostensibly to protect women from harassment. But Vicki Schultz, a feminist legal scholar at Yale, sees a broader attempt to sanitise the workplace - to scrub offices and factories clean of sexuality.This makes her uneasy for three reasons. First, it is unrealistic. Sex, like work, is part of life. Second, it smacks of Taylorism, the doctrine of ""scientific management"" that tends to view workers as somewhat imperfect machines. Third, and perhaps most seriously, focus on the sexual misconduct of individuals has diverted attention from the systematic discrimination that continues to exclude women from large swaths of the economy.Who cares that Boeing's male CEO slept with a colleague and used the company e-mail system to express his ardour? The real scandal is that, after four decades of struggle for equal rights, only two of the company's 12 executive officers are women and 95 per cent of its aircraft are flown by men.The writer covers US management issues for the FT"
779;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-03-08T23:17:36Z;Wall St slides after TI narrows guidance;;Wall Street stocks slid on Tuesday after a disappointing earnings update from Texas Instruments put pressure on semiconductor shares.By the closing bell, the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.8 per cent to 2,073.55. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 1,219.40 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,912.62.The slide, which followed a mixed performance in the previous session, cast a further pall over a burgeoning rally that had appeared to be gathering strength late last week amid a fall-off in oil prices and an upbeat jobs report.The prospect of a slowdown in earnings and concerns about the sustainability of the US trade deficit have kept stock market gains in check this year, disappointing market watchers who had been hoping the sharp rally that closed out 2004 would continue through early 2005.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the market’s lacklustre performance was surprising given recent upward revisions to estimates for key economic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and business capital spending. “The fundamental things that drive performance have improved,” he said. “At some point you are going to see this market doing better as people recognise that the business conditions are better than expected.”Narrowed earnings guidance from Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, provided much of the downward momentum. TI shares fell 3.8 per cent to $26.34. Other chipmakers also suffered. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, slipped 1.2 per cent to $24.80. Qualcomm, TI’s chief rival, gave back 2.9 per cent to $36.29 following Monday’s 5 per cent rise. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which tracks a basket of chip stocks, drifted 1.4 per cent lower to 435.44.McDonalds led shares in food groups lower. The fast food chain fell 2.1 per cent to $33.48 after it reported February same-store sales up just 1.6 per cent – its worst performance since 2003. Kroger, the grocery chain, fell 4.9 per cent to $16.85 after its quarterly losses widened.Las Vegas Sands, the casino and conventions group, weighed in with its maiden set of quarterly results following its meteoric initial public offering. LVS shares, which shot up more than 60 per cent on their first day of trading in December, fell 4.9 per cent to $47.35.The mergers and acquisitions buzz continued as Circuit City, the electronics retailer, rebuffed a takeover bid from Highfields, the Boston hedge fund, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent.Johnson Controls, the maker of car interiors, rose 3.2 per cent after it raised its second quarter guidance.Energy stocks were among the leading gainers as the price of oil resumed its climb above the $54 mark. Sunoco rose 2.1 per cent to $105.25.
780;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-03-07T21:52:33Z;Tech stocks help Wall St as blue-chips sag;;Wall Street closed mixed on Monday after an upbeat report from the chip sector boosted technology stocks but failed to breathe life into the Dow Industrials.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,090.21, and the S&P 500 edged up 0.3 per cent to 1,225.31. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped fractionally to 10,936.86.Blue chips had eked modest gains for much of the day, but the performance turned sour late in the afternoon as stocks pulled back from 3½-year highs.The surprise ousting of Boeing’s chief executive left investors scratching their heads as to who would pick up the reins at the aerospace group.Mergers and acquisitions were also in the spotlight following news of multi-billion-dollar deals in the defence and banking sectors.Although bullish investors cheered the falling price of oil, the late afternoon slide left the Dow marking time after last week’s sharp rally, which brought blue chips within striking distance of the 11,000 mark – a level last reached in mid-2001.Boeing, the US aerospace giant, fell 0.1 per cent to $58.30 after the company ousted Harry Stonecipher as its chief executive. Boeing said an internal investigation had revealed an inappropriate relationship bet-ween Mr Stonecipher and an unnamed female executive at the company.Two big acquisitions attracted much of the remaining attention. In the defence sector, United Defense Industries, a maker of armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, surged almost 26 per cent to $73.35 after it agreed to a $4.2bn takeover by the US arm of BAE Systems, the British defence group.Meanwhile, Capital One Financial Group, the US credit card company, fell 2.7 per cent to $76 after it announced a $5.3bn takeover of Hibernia, a Louisiana-based bank. Hibernia shares jumped more than 21 per cent to $32.24 on the news.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Smith Barney, said the recent string of deals was likely to continue as companies took advantage of their strong cash positions.“Companies have such enormous cash flow . . . You don’t even have to go to the pension fund any more,” he said, referring to the source of cash for many deals during the corporate raider days of the 1980s.Semiconductors rose after Qualcomm, the maker of computer chips for wireless devices, raised its profit outlook. Qualcomm rose 5.3 per cent to $37.39.Texas Instruments, the computer chip and pocket calculator maker, advanced 1.8 per cent to $27.37 ahead of an earnings update.Elsewhere, Delphi, the auto parts group, was among the biggest laggards on the S&P 500. Its shares fell 5.7 per cent to $5.15 after an analyst downgrade.
781;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-03-07T18:34:30Z;CDMA uptake lifts Qualcomm;;Shares in Qualcomm gained 5 per cent in early trading on Monday after the semiconducter company said sales of third-generation mobile phones based on its proprietary CDMA technology were stronger than expected.Qualcomm said handset manufacturers had shipped 51-52m CDMA-based phones in the three months to December, against previous estimates of 46-49m units.Irwin Jacobs, chairman and chief executive, said sales of 3G phones based on ?wideband' CDMA, or WCDMA, were especially strong in Europe.?During the December quarter, WCDMA handset shipments in Europe appear to have outpaced Japan for the first time,? he said.Phones based on WCDMA and other competing 3G technologies enable network operators to offer higher-margin services to subscribers, such as music and video downloads. The rate of uptake is critical to Qualcomm's growth prospects.For the current quarter, Qualcomm reduced slightly its revenue guidance but said profits would be higher than Wall Street expectations.The company is expecting revenues of $1.35-$1.4bn in the three months to March, an increase of 14-18 per cent over last year. Earnings per share will be 26-28 cents, against previous forecasts of 25-27 cents.The company's earnings guidance excludes the impact of a number of smaller businesses grouped by the company under ?strategic initiatives?. On a GAAP basis, earnings will be 25-27 cents.Shipments of mobile phone chips are now expected to be 36-37m units for the quarter, at the top end of the company's earlier guidance.Qualcomm stock gained $1.75 to $37.25 following the announcment, recouping some of the ground lost this year. The shares have slipped from $44 in January as investors have worried about rate at which mobile phone consumers would switch to 3G and the competitive position of WCDMA against rival wireless technologies.
782;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Markets Overview: US and Asia gain but Europe sticks;;Wall Street and Asian markets on Monday continued to build on the gains seen at the end of last week on the back of strong US jobs data, but the going was harder in Europe.After sweeping to three-and-a- half year closing highs on Friday, US shares maintained their momentum on Monday helped by good news in the technology sector and mergers and acquisitions activity.At mid-session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent higher at 10,980.82, with the 11,000 mark firmly in its sights. The S & P 500 was up 0.6 per cent at 1,228.88. Nasdaq was the best performer in percentage terms, rising 1.4 per cent to 2,100.20. Nasdaq’s gains were helped after Qualcomm, the wireless technology company, raised its profit forecast, whereas the firing of Boeing’s chief executive held back gains on the Dow.However, Europe failed to reach new 33-month highs, with continuing high oil prices and profit-taking proving to be among the bearish factors weighing on sentiment. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended fractionally lower, down 0.59 points at 1,106.99.The index has risen 6.3 per cent so far this year, easily outpacing the rise in US shares.Ian Scott, at Lehman Brothers, noted that US-based investors have been heavy buyers of European stocks so far this year, with flow data suggesting their purchasing rate had picked up from last year when they bought a record $51bn of European equities. “The US stance is at odds with the caution towards equities shown by European institutional and retail investors,” he noted.Japanese shares enjoyed their eighth consecutive day of gains, their best run since August 1999, taking the cumulative gain over the eight day period to 3.7 per cent. Asian shares outside Japan also fared well, reaching their highest levels since August 1997.Despite, Monday’s sluggishness, optimism after last week’s gains was not hard to find. Anais Faraj at Nomura noted that world markets - as measured by the FTSE All-World index - had just breached a major resistance level set in July 2001. After a period of consolidation, he expected the market to advance further, testing highs last seen in May 2001. “The world is undergoing a “global Goldilocks” scenario in which productivity will outpace inflation for many years to come. Thanks to a business cycle that is not merely synchronised but also broader and deeper than many expect we now see an extended period of non-inflationary growth,” he said.Abhijit Chakrabortti at JP Morgan said equities were likely to continue to outperform bonds, continuing the trend seen the start of the year. “Equities enjoy the support of a strong and stable growth outlook in the US, robust corporate health, (and) low real interest rates. ““Bonds will struggle against the headwinds of the consistent Fed tightening we expect, a likely slowdown in Treasury purchases by Asian central banks in a more stable dollar environment, and slowing demand for US Treasuries from US domestic banks as the yield curve flattens and corporate borrowing picks up.”Oil prices fell slightly, partly due to warmer weather in the US and Europe. US light crude was trading at $53.25 at mid-session on Nymex, down 53 cents on the day, but still at four month highs. Nymex crude peaked at $55.67 in October.The dollar rebounded on the view that Friday’s falls in the wake of the US jobs data had been overdone. The greenback firmed 0.25 per cent to $1.3201 against the euro, 0.4 per cent to Y105.18 against the yen, and 0.4 per cent to $1.9164 against sterling.Coffee hit a five-year high, with prices benefiting from the perception that demand will outstrip supply this year.
783;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-03-02T23:46:17Z;Intel chases larger share of mobile market;;Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, has detailed a triple-pronged assault on a mobile phone market it has so far failed to crack, with new chipsets, flash memory products and further development of the WiMAX standard on the way.Sean Maloney, head of its recently formed Mobility Group, told the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Wednesday that its first chipset for third-generation phones to ship in volume codenamed Hermon would appear this year.Rivals Texas Instruments and Qualcomm have dominated the cellphone market. Craig Barrett, Intel chief executive, said at the forum that this was the one major sector where Intel needed to improve.Intel has been more successful with ?NOR? flash memory chips that retain data in mobile phones after they are switched off. It has regained market leadership from AMD over the past few quarters and announced its newest flash memory family codenamed Sibley would feature chips with 512MB of memory ideal for storing digital photos and music.?The reason we have been successful over the past nine months is not price cuts, it's technology,? Mr Maloney said.Intel has also been championing WiMAX technology, which is an extension of wi-fi, allowing broadband internet connections over a much wider area.WiMAX is seen as a possible threat to the business models of mobile operators who have spent billions on 3G licences, but its development and deployment is trailing that of 3G by at least two years.Mr Maloney said the number of engineers working in the industry on WiMAX had grown tenfold in the past year while members supporting its development in the WiMAX Forum had grown from 46 to 244. WiMAX trials by carriers had grown from two to 15 and were expected to reach 75 by the end of the year.?The current specification is portable and there are some in the community that want to push it to the next level,? he said. ?The $64,000 question is whether it will replace 3G and the answer is no. By the time it's out there, [3G] will be deployed in a lot of countries and you will see WiMAX coming along and overlaying it.?
784;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-01-21T22:36:14Z;Overview: Bourses fail to shrug off sluggish start to year;;"The post-new year hangover continued to haunt equity markets this week.A number of earnings warnings from the US, crude oil back above $48 per barrel and the prospect of higher interest rates in the world's biggest economy appeared to be the main areas o f concern. Although headline consumer inflation in the US fell in December, the core rate was stable at an annualised 2.2 per cent.Economists were sanguine: ""The news will do little to change expectations of a Fed hike at the beginning of February, but at the same time it confirms that the Fed has no reason to pa nic,"" said Mitul Kotecha at Calyon.""There is no reason for the Fed to pick up the pace of rate tightening, particularly when employment growth remains so mediocre,"" said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. There were f ew such concerns in the UK however, as retail sales figures for December yesterday revealed the biggest monthly decline since 1981. The 1 per cent month-on-month fall in sales had a limited impact on the equities market in London, however, as Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, pre-empted the report at a speech on Thursday evening.Mr King said that too much weight should not be put on one month's figures, and that the real high-street Christmas story might not be known until Easter.""In other words, the MPC will avoid a knee-jerk reaction to the data,"" said Philip Shaw at Investec.But that did not stop currency markets reacting abruptly. Sterling dropped a cent against the dollar to $1.8614, but by midday in New York it had bounced back to $1.8696.European stocks continued their volatile January, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the week little changed at 1,047.74 and marginally higher on the year.But equity traders in New York for a third week were unable to kickstart any enthusiasm. Putting fears of higher interest rates aside, they had a number of disappointing corporate res ults and earnings guidances to digest. These included Motorola, Ebay and Qualcomm. Ebay fell nearly 21 per cent on the week, while Qualcomm fell 10.5 per cent.""We expect a transition to a sideways movement in the coming months, in an environment characterised by a vulnerable dollar and a slowing earnings dynamic,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, econ omist at HVB.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent by the New York close on Friday to 10,392.99 and was down 1.6 per cent on the week, and 3.6 per cent lower since the beginning o f the year.The Nasdaq, not surprisingly since Ebay, Qualcomm and Motorola are all listed there, bore the brunt of the sell-off. It fell 0.6 on Friday to 2,034.27 and remained 2.6 per cent down o n the week and 5.7 per cent lower since January 3.With most equity strategists predicting gains this year, few believed that this was anything but a bad start. Anais Faraj at Nomura put it down to the ""three witches"" of the Iraq elec tion on January 30, the Opec meeting in Vienna, which starts on the same day, and the G7 meeting that begins on February 4.""This is in addition to the ebb and flow of earnings news as America's fourth-quarter reporting season reaches a climax. Nor should we forget the FOMC's policy announcement on Februar y 2,"" said Mr Faraj. ""Yet underpinning all this uncertainty is clear evidence of strong cyclical fundamentals and a healthy earnings outlook.""Data this week were largely second-tier, and fairly benign, yet in this environment the dollar managed to trade higher during the week.Key to this move were data from the US Treasury showing foreign investment in November hit its highest for nine months, with net inflows up to $81bn, from $48.3bn in October.By midday in New York, the dollar stood at $1.3015 against the euro, up around 0.5 per cent on the week.Adding to the pressure on equities was a move higher for crude prices, with Nymex WTI crossing the $48 per barrel threshold once again. Worries over heating oil supplies as the US nor th-east prepared for an icy spell, and the latest data on growing demand from China, meant speculators were wary of carrying short positions into the weekend."
785;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-01-20T21:59:25Z;Overview: Cautious tech groups send shivers through market;;"Fears that the technology sector was heading for tougher times kept world stock markets firmly on the back foot on Thursday.Disappointing earnings and guidance from Ebay and Qualcomm in the US and a sharply reduced profits estimate from Sony of Japan depressed sentiment, with markets shrugging off a weaker oil price for the second day running.After a significant sell-off on Wednesday, Wall Street was broadly lower as investors reacted to a downbeat reading of a regional manufacturing survey by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve.By the end of the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower, the S&P 500 index slipped 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index fell back 1.3 per cent.Shares in Ebay, the online auctioneer, fell 19 per cent in morning trading, while Qualcomm, the wireless technology group, saw its shares drop 8 per cent.Adding to the gloom was guidance from Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, suggesting profits in 2005 would be at the low end of estimates due to higher interest rates.Sony's profit warning came after the market close in Tokyo, but the Nikkei 225 Average was still down 1.1 per cent on the day.European markets were unable to withstand the downward trend and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed 0.4 per cent lower.Among the heaviest fallers were Nokia - following a profits warning by one of its suppliers - and Ericsson, the Nordic telecommunications equipment groups. Rolf Elgeti, chief European strategist at ABN Amro, said he expected European markets to pick up when investors switched their focus to European earnings reports from US ones.""Consensus forecasts are lower for European companies than for US ones. And there's more potential for margin improvement in Europe because companies have more scope to cut costs even if top line growth is slowing,"" Mr Elgeti said.ABN Amro predicts European equities will post returns of just under 10 per cent this year. However, S&P said downgrades by its European analysts had outpaced upgrades by a ratio of two-to-one over the past four weeks. ""A similar pattern exists among the consensus, and this is viewed as a bearish signal for equities,"" it said.The dollar extended recent gains, reaching a two-month high against the euro, as investors remained convinced that US interest rates were heading higher in the wake of recent economic data. Sentiment towards the greenback was also helped by expectations that a number of large US companies would take advantage of a tax break to repatriate foreign earnings.By mid-session in New York the dollar was trading at $1.2962 against the euro and Y103.13 against the Japanese yen. Investors kept a close eye on President George W. Bush's inauguration speech for clues as to future budget and tax policy, but nothing substantive emerged.However, strategists say the dollar's fate will partly depend on whether a credible effort is made to cut the massive budget deficit in the US.""We expect the [dollar's] pace of decline to be moderate in 2005 as the new US Congress looks set to take steps and stabilise the budget deficit,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.Oil prices fell after a bigger-than-expected build in US inventories. Brent crude fell 39 cents to $44.32, while Nymex futures were down 64 cents at $46.91 by the end of the trading session in New York.Gold moved lower, ending the day in London at $422.50 per ounce."
786;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2005-01-20T17:21:50Z;The Short View: Bad start to year for tech sector;;"The fourth quarter results season is only in its earliest stages. But already the main area of concern has been identified; the technology sector.A downbeat first quarter outlook from Qualcomm, the wireless technology group, on Wednesday night was accompanied by eBay, the online auctioneer, missing earnings estimates and followed a lacklustre statement from Motorola, the mobile phone manufacturer. To add to the gloom, one of mobile phone giant Nokia’s key suppliers, Perlos, issued a profits warning.There seem to be two main areas of concern. The first is that consumers worldwide may be losing their appetite in certain product areas. Mobile phones is the most obvious but it was also worth nothing that consumer electronics giant Sony issued a profits warning, citing falling prices for key products.The second problem is a slowdown in Asia, which is a key part of the global technology supply chain. There have been a number of worrying signs, including a weak survey of Japanese corporate expectations, a slackening of the pace of Chinese imports and a decline in manufacturing activity in Hong Kong.Technology stocks had a poor first half in 2004 but then enjoyed a strong rally in the last few months of the year. Valuations are still high, despite the long bear market of 2000-03; many Nasdaq stocks trade on price-earnings ratios of 35-40 while eBay’s historic p/e, before Thursday’s sell-off, was not far short of 100. That indicated considerable optimism about the long-term growth prospects for the technology sector.Ben Rogoff, a technology fund manager at Polar Capital, says that “investors had positioned themselves for a very good fourth quarter and the results have been rather mixed. Christmas sales were a bit disappointing.” But he points to the contrast between the success of Apple, which has the sought-after iPod and Sony which may be suffering from the declining popularity of minidisc players and video cameras.Similarly, Rogoff says Chinese demand may be lower in some areas but have improved elsewhere. “They seem to be preparing themselves from the next generation of technologies and have stopped buying some of the older stuff.”"
787;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Qualcomm earnings get 3G mobile lift;;Qualcomm, the chipmaker that invented the CDMA mobile phone standard, reported $1.4bn in sales in its first quarter, driven by the growth of third-generation mobile networks.The figures were in line with guidance revised upward last month and market expectations. Earnings per share of 30 cents were also in line with consensus.Comparisons with the previous year were complicated by a new revenue recognition policy for royalties, adopted from the fourth quarter, but first quarter net profits of $513m were up 46 per cent year-on-year by one measure.Qualcomm increased its earnings guidance for the year from $1.15-$1.19 per share to $1.16-$1.20. It maintained its guidance of $5.8bn to $6.3bn in sales and for the CDMA phone market to be in the range of 218m-228m units in the calendar year.Irwin Jacobs, chairman and chief executive, told the FT that Qualcomm was benefiting from consolidation in the US mobile market.?Cingular and AT&T Wireless as a combined company can more efficiently roll out 3G and that will put pressure on Verizon,? he said.?Sprint and Nextel [merging] is very positive for us Sprint has started to roll out EV-DO [high-speed data services] and that will support Nextel, while we have been working with Nextel on Push-To-Talk services and that can be rolled out on both networks.?Qualcomm said WCDMA its 3G CDMA standard contributed 32 per cent of royalty revenues from its September quarter shipments and would continue to drive the company's results.Research and development in the first quarter to December 26 rose 52 per cent on a year earlier to $228m due to theincreased headcount needed to develop products that supported multimedia applications, high-speed wireless and different networks.For the second quarter, Qualcomm said it expected sales of $1.35bn$1.45bn and earnings per share of 25 to 27 cents. Under its new accounting method, its royalty revenues would be based on reports from licensees on sales of equipment in the previous December quarter when it anticipated 46m-49m shipments of phones containing its chips and software.
788;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Sprint unveils $3bn plan to roll out 3G;;Sprint, the third largest US mobile phone network operator, has announced details of its plan to spend $3bn over the next three years to upgrade its network infrastructure and roll out third-generation services.The move reflects the accelerating pace of 3G network upgrades by the leading US mobile operators, which, like their counterparts in Asia and Europe, believe the high-speed wireless data services enabled by the technology will help offset declining average revenues per user from traditional mobile voice services.As part of the rollout, Sprint signed three-year deals with its current equipment suppliers Lucent Technologies and Canada's Nortel Networks and extended its contract with Motorola to the end of 2006.Lucent said its contract with Sprint would be worth more than $1.5bn over three years and Nortel said its portion of the agreements would be worth about $1bn while Motorola said its contract extension would be worth about $450m.As with other leading telecoms equipment suppliers, all three have been counting on new 3G rollouts to help spur revenue growth following the recent telecoms downturn.Among the US carriers, Verizon Wireless, the second largest carrier that, like Sprint, has built its network around Qualcomm's CDMA technology, leads in the deployment of 3G technologies.Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon, the largest US telecoms group, and the UK's Vodafone, has launched its 3G service based on a technology called EV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimised) in the main US metropolitan markets.Sprint, which will also use EV-DO technology, said in June it would add the high-speed data technology to its network in US metropolitan areas next year. The company said on Tuesday that the 3G portion of the upgrade would cost $1bn. The US carrier is expected to announce shortly those markets that will be first to get the new services.Sprint shares closed down 22 cents to $22.84 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, where Motorola shares closed down 1.64 per cent at $18. Lucent stock closed down more than 2 per cent at $3.79 and Nortel closed the trading day up 1.63 per cent at $3.73.
789;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Market Overview: Markets brough down to earth after post-election euphoria;;Financial markets bore the hallmarks on Thursday of a partygoer on the morning after the night before, as Wednesday's post-election euphoria gave way to a sober assessment of the myriad problems facing President George Bush's new administration.But while stocks and the dollar struggled, gold broke higher, clearing $430 an ounce for the first time since August 1988. Bullion's rise was spurred by strong demand from investment funds seeking safe havens as the dollar sank to 8½-month lows against the euro.US crude oil futures dipped in morning trade, consolidating Wednesday's gains which came in spite of rising US inventories. December crude slipped 28 cents to $50.60 a barrel, with news that Kuwait had postponed a capacity increase, putting a floor under the price.Wall Street lacked the conviction of Wednesday's rally, with blue chips held back by mixed sales reports from big-name retailers. And the technology sector was under pressure as investors registered disappointment with the previous day's earnings target set by wireless technology company Qualcomm.By midsession, and with the outlook looking rather less rosy than just a day earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent higher but the Nasdaq Composite 0.1 per cent easier.Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley believed the new administration faced the proverbial cold shower - “a wake up call that cuts through campaign rhetoric and focuses on the heavy lifting that lies ahead. And America will wake up ... with the most daunting economic agenda it has faced in a generation,” he added.Mark Cliffe at ING Financial Markets noted that as in 2000, President Bush had promised fiscal restraint in his latest campaign.“Now re-elected, that is a promise that is likely to suffer a similar fate, at least in 2005. Although many economists are crying out for action to curb the Federal budget deficit, which hit a record $413bn in the fiscal year that ended on September 30, and 2005 would seem to be a good point in the electoral cycle to do so, more immediate political imperatives suggest that this is unlikely.”Tobias Lekovich at Citigroup Smith Barney was equally downbeat. “The market may not end up being as happy with a Bush Administration as investors may assume,” he said. “Our biggest concern for the equity market is earnings, with estimates still too high for the [current] quarter and 2005.”European equities fell from six-month highs after mixed earnings reports from the banking sector. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed xx per cent lower.Tokyo was higher as President Bush's re-election lifted carmakers that had been depressed by worries about US currency and trade policies.Other Asian markets slipped from Wednesday's six-month highs, hit by high oil prices and profit-taking.
790;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2004-11-04T17:13:55Z;Bourses lower on profit-taking;;Profit-taking dragged European shares off six-month highs on Thursday as the sense of relief at the swift outcome of the US election proved short-lived.By the close, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 0.4 per cent at 1015.32.Technology shares ran into a fresh burst of selling, as sentiment towards the sector was undermined by a negative outlook statement from US semiconductor group Qualcomm.The FTSE Eurotop IT subindex, which has lost about a quarter of its value over the last eight months, fell another 1.7 per cent. Germany's Infineon shed 1.4 per cent to €8.50, Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics fell 1.4 per cent to €14.66 and ASML, the Dutch equipment manufacturer, fell 0.8 per cent to €11.14.Qualcomm, which specialises in wireless technology, suggested that 2005 might get off to a slow start for handset shipments before improving later.Among the European handset makers, Alcatel gave up 2.5 per cent to €11.44, Ericsson fell 2.3 per cent to SKr21.40 and Nokia lost 0.9 per cent to €12.25. The latter also said it saw slowing mobile phone growth next year.There were also some disappointing numbers from Business Objects, the French-US software group. The company said late on Wednesday that revenues from software licence had totalled $105.7m in the third quarter, well short of market forecasts. The shares plunged 17.2 per cent to €16.57.Banks also remained a focus for the market as the sector's third-quarter reporting season continued. BNP Paribas fell 0.7 per cent to €54.15 after its figures broadly met expectations but failed to excite the market.Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein warned that earnings per share growth at the French bank in 2005 “could slow to a crawl” as it downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold”.Dutch financial group ING, meanwhile, unveiled a sharp rise in overall profits although investors were concerned about results from banking operations.The shares fell 1.6 per cent to €20.78.Credit Suisse did a little better, rising 1.2 per cent to SFr42.55, after the bank's earnings beat forecasts and it said it was confident of a “good” full-year result.HVB, Germany's second-biggest bank, also edged ahead after it confirmed it was scrapping its full-year profit goal after reporting quarterly net profits that were just a fraction of estimates.The shares, which fell sharply earlier in the week, yesterday finished 1.6 per cent higher at €15.60. Dieter Rampl, chief executive, said the bank would achieve a “noticeable improvement” in profitability in 2005 both in Germany and overall.There was more pain for shareholders in Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, as investors showed further disquiet at the company's landmark wage deal. The stock, which dropped 3 per cent on Wednesday, fell another 1.3 per cent to €34.60.The accord froze pay for its west German staff until 2007 in return for job security until 2011.Merrill Lynch reiterated its “sell” recommendation on the stock. In a research report, analyst Stephen Reitman said: “There is no denying that any deal that cuts VW's costs is interesting, but we cannot escape the feeling that VW has conceded or traded away too much in terms of job security to the union.”Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugs group, rose 2.2 per cent to DKr301 in the wake of news earlier in the week that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's Norditropin growth hormone drug for use on adults.
791;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Qualcomm says 2005 ?could get off to a slow start?;;Qualcomm, the chipmaker that invented the CDMA mobile phone standard, reported fourth-quarter profits in line with expectations on Wednesday but suggested 2005 could get off to a slow start for handset shipments before improving later in the year.The company reported net profits of $393m or 23 cents a share for the quarter to September 26 and forecast 24 to 26 cents a share for the current quarter.Irwin Jacobs, chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times that 2004 had been an ?extraordinarily good? year for mobile phone sales.?A lot of things are happening now, W-CDMA networks are rolling out a little later [in calendar 2005] but hopefully picking up some momentum in the course of the year.?Qualcomm estimated the CDMA phone market would total 218-228m units in the 2005 calendar year. It has estimated 170m-176m for this year. It anticipated average selling prices for CDMA phones would increase 5 per cent in the current fiscal year to around $215.The San Diego-based company expects sales, excluding its strategic initiatives, to be between $5.8bn and $6.3bn in the current year - an increase of 16-26 per cent and diluted earnings per share of $1.15-$1.19.Sales in the fourth quarter were hit by a new revenue recognition policy. Qualcomm is now reporting its royalty revenues as they are recorded instead of its previous practice of estimating royalties ahead of their receipt.Sales were $1.1bn for the quarter, up 28 per cent year-on-year, but down 17 per cent on the previous quarter due to the accounting change. Diluted earnings per share of 23 cents were down 21 per cent sequentially.Qualcomm, whose standard is dominant in the Americas, achieved a breakthrough in Europe last month - when Siemens became the first handset manufacturer there to include its W-CDMA chips in its 3G phones. Dr Jacobs said yesterday other makers were testing its chips in their phones.?The developments in Europe are key and also in this coming year, China should be making decisions on its 3G technology.?China currently has 26m CDMA subscribers.Qualcomm said on Monday it would spend $800m developing a new US wireless network to deliver video and audio to 3G phones.Dr Jacobs said it had been inspired by similar networks developed in South Korea and would enable easier downloading of content. But he said the venture was non-core and would eventually be spun off.
792;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2004-10-19T22:25:29Z;Qualcomm to sell chips to Siemens;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, is to begin selling chips to Siemens for use in the German company's 3G handsets.The deal represents a breakthrough for Qualcomm, which pioneered CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology and has been seeking to sell its next generation 3G chips into the European handset manufacturing market.Siemens, the world's fourth-largest mobile phone maker, currently buys all the chips for the three 3G phones it has launched from Freescale Semiconductor, spun off from Motorola this year.The deal with Qualcomm is non-exclusive, so Siemens will be free in future to buy chipsets for 3G phones from Freescale or other suppliers. But the German handset maker said it planned to launch 3G phones running on Qualcomm chipsets in the second half of next year.Qualcomm, which also collects royalties whenever 3G phones based on the W-CDMA or CDMA 2000 technology standard are manufactured, already provides 3G chips to 21 mobile device manufacturers.Its customers include Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, the South Korean handset makers that are among the fastest growing mobile phone manufacturers in the world, but it has struggled to gain a foothold in the European market.Alan Brown, analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm, said: ?This is positive for Qualcomm because in the past they have been kings in their own domain of CDMA 2000 [the US wireless technology]. But they are now moving into the territory that was GSM [the mobile standard adopted across Europe].?Qualcomm shares closed down 1.8 per cent at $42.80 on Tuesday.
793;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2004-10-19T06:32:28Z;Is extra intelligence a dumb plan?;;"For subscribers, the mobile phone that impersonates a portable TV set or an instant news service could be gimmick or gold dust. Mobile phone operators are hoping for the latter. The success of so-called “smart phones” - tiny computers which can be used to make voice calls - is likely to prove critical to their efforts to raise the average monthly revenue per subscriber (arpu) from its present level of about £24 in the UK to a figure which will rapidly recoup their investment in 3G phone licences.Smart phones, of which about 25m are expected to be sold this year worldwide compared with 600m conventional GSM handsets, are the key to exploiting the full potential of the 3G networks. The bit that gives them their intelligence, the operating system, comes from a variety of manufacturers. Symbian is market leader with 15m phones already in use, but Microsoft, Qualcomm and various companies offering Linux are also in the frame. The world’s largest chipmaker Intel, Nokia and Symbian have in the past four weeks agreed to work together to create standard chip sets for smart phones.To judge from the wealth of software and hardware now on offer to complement the first models such as Sony Ericsson’s Symbian powered P910, smart phones could soon have more functions than there are blades on a Swiss Army knife. Operators, however, are engaged in a deadly guessing game: which are the applications which will tempt users to spend a little more each month, so jacking up that all-important arpu.And there are concerns, amply illustrated in a recent Capgemini study, that while phone manufacturers add complexity to compete with each other, users simply want a cheap phone that works well and reliably. So what do you want your phone to be today?MOBILE PUBLISHER - MACROMEDIAFlash Lite is Macromedia’s mobile take on its well-known Flash technology for websites - it’s what makes text swirl across the screen. The Lite version, loaded into the handset, provides much the same effect. It’s already being used by NTT DoCoMo and T Mobile.Now Macromedia is launching an information service called Flash Cast. Content providers will use its authoring tools to develop multimedia content. Operators will offer the service - it could include, for example, world news, horoscopes and the latest football scores.Subscribers will subscribe for the channels they want to see - the direct comparison is with pay-TV. Conventional WAP services are stuck in the dark ages by comparison.YOUR LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHIC - SHOP SCALADOYou may already have a camera built into your phone, but with software from the Swedish company Scalado, designed to create, edit and manage high resolution images (up to three megapixels), you can also have a mobile photoprocessing studio.Pierre Elzouki, Scalado’s business development manager, points out that even the best phones are short of memory and image-processing power, and so phone pictures are rarely of high quality. Scalado’s software “engine”, which can be downloaded to the phone, takes over image management, reducing, it claims, the amount of memory required by a factor of 50 while improving the speed of image manipulation by up to 10 times - eye candy for phone makers who want to offer quality photography as a selling point.The software allows you to play with the images in a variety ways, adding the look of an oil painting or creating the kind of illusion made by distorting mirrors.THE CINEMA IN YOUR POCKET - NVIDIAA new silicon chip devised by Nvidia, the US company behind the image processing chips in many PCs and games consoles, will make it possible to view movies on your phone.The new chip, catchily named the GoForce 3D 4500, is the company’s first move into 3D imaging on hand-held devices. Essentially it relieves the phone processor chip of the burden of working out how to display 3D moving images on the screen, allowing very fast processing. Prototypes are capable of playing movies with remarkable fidelity.A key feature of the chip is a mechanism which conserves battery life by turning off power to parts which are not being used. Nvidia chief executive Jen-Hsun Huang says: “It consumes almost no power. The hand-held revolution is really happening.”Nvidia expects to announce deals with smart phone manufacturers shortly.A GLOBAL NAVIGATOR - TELMAPThe phone as navigational aid is an obvious application, already exploited by companies such as Webraska of France and PTV of Germany. A comparative newcomer to the mobile phone field is Telmap, an Israeli company with expertise in digital mapping. It provides directions and routes using a combination of diagrammatic maps on the screen of the phone, together with voice instructions and text. It can be installed in a car, but it can also be used on the street by pedestrians.A key element is the company’s data compression technology which enables maps and directions to be downloaded rapidly to the phone from Telmap’s computers in Israel, the US and the UK. The company has agreements with a range of partners including Navteq, Mapit and MapData Sciences who provide the geographic data; the system includes a worldwide database of restaurants, hotels, theatres and cinemas and places of interest.AN ELECTRONIC WALLET - VIVOThe UK may be moving towards “chip and PIN”, but ViVO Tech, a Silicon Valley group, anticipates there will be market segments where its “contactless technology” will be of value. Vivo customers will simply wave their phones near a special reader to make a payment. “People prefer to wave their phones over the reader than to point at it,” says Jorge Fernandez, ViVO chief executive.All the major card companies are testing the system - a collaboration between the US company and Philips - with Mastercard likely to be the first to deploy it on a large scale. A key point is that the reader is compatible with most POS systems, so retailers should not have to upgrade their terminals."

795;QCOM;Qualcomm Inc;2004-09-16T23:06:14Z;Wall St inches higher as data give support;;"US stocks levitated modestly in low volume on Thursday, helped by economic data and a retreating oil price, as investors remained reluctant to leave the sidelines and a warning from Nortel Networks weighed on sentiment.As only 1.1bn shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent to 10,244.49 while the broader S&P 500 index added 0.3 per cent to 1,123.50 by the close. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.4 per cent to 1,904.08.While benign to favourable economic data offered the background to a possible rally, market participants have warned that the observance of the Jewish New Year on Thursday and Friday will take many Wall Street workers away from their desks and lead to lower volumes.This coincides with quadruple witching, or the simultaneous expiry of futures and options on equities and indices, a quarterly event that tends to accentuate volatility in the market.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We have a big expiration, high oil and a Jewish holiday that are all going to put a dent in activity, we're going to have to plod through the day.""Like many other market watchers, he noted a slower than expected resumption in market activity following the summer months, blaming it on uncertainty about the US presidential election and an unclear picture of the economy.Nortel Networks shares fell 7.9 per cent to $3.50 after the largest telecommunications equipment group in North America warned that third-quarter revenue would shrink from the previous quarter and its full-year results would underperform the industry.The news came amid concern about the strength of spending on technology and telecommunications equipment in particular and broader worries over business investment in the US.Mr Hogan suggested that pessimism about IT spending was overblown and noted that corporate America ""has boatloads of cash on balance sheets …they're going to simply have to upgrade obsolete IT equipment"".3Com shares closed flat at $4.32 ahead of the networking company's quarterly results, due out after the close.Delta Air Lines fell 2.2 per cent to $4.01 on news that the carrier's auditors had expressed doubt about its ability to continue operations for a variety of reasons, including the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing. The news prompted a credit rating downgrade for Delta's debt by Fitch.The airline sector index, which has declined recently after US Airways filed for its second bankruptcy in two years, was 1 per cent higher.The ripples of US Airways' filing were seen outside the sector as Electronic Data Systems said the carrier's bankruptcy could undermine its earnings. Recent reports also said that EDS could suffer from General Motors opening bidding for IT work currently done by EDS. Shares in the IT services provider were up, however, by 1.1 per cent at $20.10.Qualcomm was 0.4 per cent lower at $40.40 on news that Credit Suisse First Boston had downgraded the stock in a broader analysis of the wireless sector.Economic data offered some support to the bulls, as weekly jobless claims rose less than expected, according to the labour department, which said the report was unaffected by the hurricanes Charley and Frances hitting the south-east of the US. In addition, the consumer price index reflected the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy as it rose 0.1 per cent last month amid the tumble in fuel prices. The core index that strips out volatile food and energy prices was also 0.1 per cent higher, in line with expectations.High fuel costs prompted Swift Transportation to warn of lower than expected profits, sparking a downgrade by Bear Stearns. The trucking company's shares lost 10.9 per cent to $16.28.JB Hunt shares eased 1.7 per cent to $36.46 and Yellow Roadway edged up 0.9 per cent to $45.16."
