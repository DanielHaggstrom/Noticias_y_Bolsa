0;BLL;Ball Corp;2017-06-07T10:49:08Z;Anglo American appoints industrialist as chairman;Stuart Chambers is notable for his involvement in the sale of several UK companies;Anglo American on Wednesday announced its new chairman would be Stuart Chambers, an industrialist who has been involved in several big disposals including the sale of UK chip designer Arm.Mr Chambers, 61, the former chairman of Arm, will join Anglo as a non-executive director in September and replace Sir John Parker as chairman in November.Sir John has been chairman for eight years, with the latter part of his tenure being dominated by a commodities slump that forced Anglo into a shrink to survive strategy focused on mining just three natural resources: copper, diamonds and platinum.Anglo returned to profit last year after a rebound in commodity prices, and the company said in February it could retain assets it previously declared it did not want to, including iron ore and coal businesses in South Africa.“Anglo American has emerged from the commodity price downturn more resilient and with a renewed sense of purpose, both strategically and in terms of the role it plays in society,” said Mr Chambers.Mr Chambers will have to develop relations with Anglo’s newest shareholder, Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, who in March agreed to pay about £2bn for an 11 per cent stake in the company.Mr Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta Resources and now Anglo’s second-largest shareholder, said last month he had no intention of trying to merge the two companies.While Mr Chambers was chairman of Arm, it was sold to Japanese internet and telecoms group SoftBank for £24.3bn last year.He was also chairman of UK drinks can maker Rexam, which was bought by US rival Ball Corp in a £4.3bn deal last year.He was also the chief executive of UK glassmaker Pilkington when it was sold to Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006.He was then named president and chief executive of Nippon in a rare example of a westerner running a Japanese company.Mr Chambers has also served as a non-executive director at UK engineer Smiths Group and British retailer Tesco.Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, said Mr Chambers had led and chaired “major global businesses with many parallels to our organisation, in areas such as manufacturing process and technology-led innovation”.But it was Mr Chambers’ record of selling businesses that attracted the most comment from analysts and investors.Analysts at Investec said: “Our tech analyst considers Arm to be one of the best companies he has ever covered, so at least some of this must reflect on Stuart. But we hope it is not portentous that Stuart was the chairman of Arm and Rexam when both were taken over!”An Anglo shareholder said: “Anglo needs someone who can think outside the box and examine the merits of a break-up. The new chairman’s CV suggests he doesn’t shy away from selling businesses.”But people familiar with the selection of Anglo’s new chairman said the top priority was to find a candidate with international business experience who had chaired a FTSE 100 company.“Selling big companies was not one of the criteria” said one of these people.The appointment of Mr Chambers comes at a time of change for some of the world’s biggest mining companies.BHP Billiton is expected to announce a new chairman in the next month, with non-executive directors Ken Mackenzie, Carolyn Hewson, Lindsay Maxsted and Malcolm Broomhead seen as contenders for the role.Rio Tinto is also looking for a new chairman to replace Jan du Plessis, with Sam Laidlaw, former chief executive of Centrica, tipped as the leading candidate for the role.Additional reporting by Kate Allen
1;BLL;Ball Corp;2016-02-18T18:34:47Z;Ball ready to can assets to score Rexam;Big divestitures needed to comply with antitrust rules;"A new leader in global drinks can making may soon be crowned — but the realm it will inherit is looking smaller than once hoped.One year since Ball Corp unveiled a £4.4bn takeover of its UK-listed rival Rexam, to form the world’s largest maker of metal drinks containers, the US industrial group is preparing to sell off a significant number of assets to secure the deal.To comply with competition rules in places such as Europe and Brazil, Ball is likely to sell assets that produced combined revenues of $2.5bn in 2014.That is far above the threshold of $1.6bn in revenues that Ball specified as a potential deal-breaker when it announced the takeover — although its figure referred to potential US and European disposals. Ball is currently seeking approval for the deal from US competition authorities.“It’s a lot of divestitures. They have to sell [assets equivalent to] 40 per cent or potentially more of what they’re acquiring — that’s a big deal,” says Mark Wilde, analyst at BMO Capital.According to people familiar with the plans, the assets for sale generated $420m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation last year. That amount is equivalent to more than one-fifth of analyst expectations for the two groups’ total in 2016, according to Bloomberg data.Despite the size of the disposals needed, Ball’s management has been unwavering in its commitment to the transaction, according to people close to the deal. Its move for Rexam will merge two of the three leaders in the global canning industry, giving the combined company significant scale.According to estimates by analysts at Baird, the new entity would have almost half the market share in North America; 39 per cent in Europe; and 57 per cent in Brazil. It would also own a superior portfolio of manufacturing facilities that combines the companies’ complementary geographical footprints.“Rexam has better exposure to the more growing geographies and specialty cans,” says Chip Dillon, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. “The growth and future is multiple can sizes and varieties, as opposed to the standard can.”For example, the UK group is strong in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and the Middle East, while Ball has a presence in China, Vietnam and Myanmar. A greater geographical spread could help offset the decline of sweet carbonated drinks in Ball’s home US market, as well.Pressure to consolidate has also intensified from customers. Since the Ball-Rexam tie-up was announced a year ago, AB InBev launched the world’s biggest brewing takeover with a £71bn bid for its rival SABMiller.“This merger is both offensive and defensive,” argues Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. “They see customers getting bigger . . . and the point is to make sure they won’t get bullied by them in the long term”.People close to Ball have argued that a deal will allow the merged company to pass along some of the estimated £300m in annual cost savings to its customers, which will include drinks companies such as PepsiCo, AB InBev and Red Bull. But others have questioned whether a reduction in competition can be good in the long term.Last month, Ball agreed to sell off 10 European factories — most of its metal beverage packaging operations there — as well as two Rexam plants. Two plants will be sold in Brazil and final clearance from the US Federal Trade Commission is expected before the end of June, subject to further divestitures. Such will be the size of the disposals that they will instantly rank as the third biggest competitor in the sector.Recent progress with regulators seems to be winning over investors, who are displaying increased confidence that the deal will complete: the spread between Ball’s offer price and where Rexam shares are trading has narrowed from around 13 per cent in October to just 3 per cent this week.And the price of walking away remains steep. A break fee payable to Rexam is equal to about 7 per cent of the deal value, or around £300m — higher than the usual amount acquirer’s commit to in deals.“High break-fees like this are there when the target cannot see its way through the regulatory process,” say analysts at Olivetree Securities. “This is a classic example. Rexam has done a good job protection its shareholders given the likelihood of a complicated antitrust process.”Along with US approvals, a remaining concern is how much value Ball can extract from its disposals. Smaller rivals and private equity funds are circling. Buyout groups as Apollo and Onex already own assets in adjacent industries, while other firms including Blackstone and CVC would like to enter the market.“The wild card is the multiple [of earnings] they will get for the plants they’re going to sell,” says Mr Wilde.Additional reporting by Joseph CotterillRestructuring costs and expenses related to its takeover by Ball Corp led to a drop in earnings at Rexam last year, write Michael Pooler and Peter Campbell. Although sales rose to £3.93bn, at the FTSE 100 manufacturer, pre-tax profit fell by more than one-quarter to £250m amid “difficult trading conditions”.These included higher energy costs in Brazil and the “commoditisation” in North America of speciality cans — which are often used for energy drinks and sell at a premium.In what were set to be its last annual financial results as an independent company, the group also struck a cautious outlook.“Looking ahead, the environment remains challenging but we continue to expect low single-digit growth in global can volumes,” said Graham Chipchase, chief executive. “Customer pressure and competitor actions are reducing market prices in Europe.”Rexam booked a £44m charge relating to the reorganisation of its European beverage can business. Costs of £29m were incurred as a consequence of the proposed acquisition by Ball, while another £20m will be paid out to employees as incentives following the deal."
2;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-12-09T18:37:50Z;US companies turn to Europe’s debt markets;Eurozone’s easy money drives growth in reverse Yankee issues;US tyremaker Goodyear Dunlop sold a €250m eight-year euro-denominated bond on Wednesday — its first such deal in four years — as US companies raise record amounts in the eurozone.The sale was the latest example of a reverse Yankee — euro-denominated debt issued by US companies.US companies have been the biggest issuers of euro bonds by nationality this year. Last week Ball Corporation, an avionics and packaging company, issued euro and dollar bonds to fund its acquisition of Rexam, a UK drinks maker.“Given the recent [US] disruption, the European market looks more positive,” said Henrik Johnsson, head of the Emea debt syndicate at Deutsche Bank.Diverging monetary policy has reduced the cost of issuing debt in euros as the European Central Bank continues to ease while the Federal Reserve is expected to increase its main interest rate from near zero this month.Previously companies would issue debt in euros and convert it back into dollars. But the strong dollar has increased the cost of doing this.Many reverse Yankee issuers have significant euro-denominated cash flows and so have a “natural hedge” against exchange rate movements.The sell-off in the debt of US commodity companies — particularly in the energy sector — had been damaging for dollar credit, said Mr Johnsson. “As a matter of investor psychology, you’re not seeing losses in significant portions of your portfolio every day in Europe. It’s the same with fund flows, Europe is consistently receiving inflows.”Market participants expect the trend to continue into next year as successful deals demonstrate the depth of Europe’s markets. US companies have also issued a record amount in dollars, however.US issuers accounted for 22 per cent of euro-denominated debt issued in 2007. Over the next two years this fell to 6 per cent and reached a record 4 per cent low in 2011. This year’s record total of €65bn represents 21 per cent of the eurobond market.Eric Cherpion, head of the global debt syndicate at Société Générale, said the “granularity” of the reverse Yankee market had increased. Big deals were the norm before the financial crisis [with] a handful of large US issuers like General Electric, General Motors and Ford, whereas now the market has a lot more smaller names.“It has moved from a Dow Jones to an S&P 500 universe.”
3;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-11-30T17:24:29Z;Ball to sell €1.5bn of bonds to fund Rexam deal;Acquisition of UK group will create biggest drinks cans manufacturer;Ball Corporation could be forced to sell off more assets than originally anticipated to satisfy competition concerns over its £4.3bn takeover of Rexam, the UK drinks can maker.US-based Ball announced on Monday that it would sell approximately €1.5bn of bonds denominated in euros and dollars to partly fund the cash portion of the deal.But the company also said that antitrust authorities from the EU, US and Brazil were pushing for it to divest can production facilities with total annual revenues of about $2.5bn.Both companies made clear from the outset that the creation of the world’s biggest drinks can manufacturer with $15bn in annual revenues would raise regulatory issues and likely require disposals in some regions. But a question mark hung over exactly where those disposals would take place and the amount that would be necessary to raise.Ball said possible divestitures under discussion with regulators in the US and EU covered assets with combined sales greater than a threshold of $1.58bn agreed with Rexam when the deal was first unveiled in February.Above this level, a pact between the parties would allow Ball to withdraw its offer— although this would trigger a break payment to Rexam of £302m, equivalent to 7 per cent of the deal value.Ball said it could not specify the final amount of required disposals as negotiations had not concluded, and that it had not yet made a decision whether to invoke the break clause.The company expects the deal to close in the first half of 2016, following regulatory approval.Ball added that talks were under way with potential buyers for the assets and that it had identified annual cost savings higher than the $300m first outlined for the combined entity by its third year of operations. This will be achieved through a mixture of reducing back-office expenses, lowering purchasing costs and cutting logistics and warehouse charges.The European Commission is market testing a package of divestments proposed by Ball and has extended its review deadline to January 22.Ball said the timing and terms of its debt sale would depend on market conditions and other factors. It is paying 610p a share for its smaller rival, of which two-thirds will be in cash and the rest in shares.Banks acting as joint bookrunners on the bond issuance are Goldman Sachs, Deutsche, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Mizuho Securities and Rabo Securities.
4;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-10-01T16:35:15Z;EU raises competition concerns over Rexam takeover;Asset sales likely for regulatory approval of merger between biggest two drinks can makers;"Brussels has formally raised competition concerns with Ball Corporation over its proposed £4.4bn takeover of Rexam, increasing the likelihood of asset sales in Europe to smooth the way for a deal to combine the world’s largest drinks can makers.It is now up to Ball to propose a fix that satisfies the issues outlined by the European Commission as part of its in-depth antitrust investigation into the merger.Analysts had predicted that Ball, an industrial conglomerate that also makes space satellites, would be required to sell some of its businesses for regulatory approval to acquire Rexam, a smaller British rival. They are the biggest and second-biggest beverage can manufacturers, respectively.“From an early stage the competition issues were clear. The assumption is they will have to dispose of some of their assets,” said Caroline de La Soujeole, of brokerage Stifel.The commission and Colorado-based Ball would not comment on the specifics of the objections or possible outcomes.The parties must reach agreement by a Brussels deadline of December 9 for the deal to pass. Ball said it was still confident of concluding the transaction in the first half of 2016.European Union regulators launched a probe in July as they said a tie-up between the two companies, which supply groups such as Coca-Cola, Heineken, AB InBev and Carlsberg, would create an entity controlling two-thirds of production plants in the bloc.This triggered fears of a lack of competition that would drive up the prices of drinks cans and aluminium bottles for trade customers and ultimately consumers. Significant investment is required to build a factory, erecting what authorities see as a barrier to entry in the sector.Rexam and Ball together would control about 61 per cent of the market for drinks cans in North America, according to analysts. In Europe, the combined company would have a market share of about 69 per cent, and about 74 per cent in Brazil.Ball has said it could back out of the deal if antitrust regulators required it to sell assets generating more than $1.58bn in turnover. In the event of the deal not going through, a break fee of up to £302m would be payable.Similar competition investigations are under way by regulators in Brazil and the US, where the Federal Trade Commission made a second request for information in April.Rexam’s board recommended a cash and shares offer at 610p a share, comprising 407p in cash and 0.04568 shares in Ball. The deal would create a powerhouse with annual revenues of $15bn and values Rexam at £4.4bn; Ball would also assume about £1bn worth of Rexam’s debt.Rexam reported pre-tax profits of £343m last year, up from £339m in 2013, which it described as a good performance in a difficult year. Its shares rose 4.5p to 528p."
5;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-07-20T19:41:27Z;Global drinks can merger faces European competition probe;Brussels fears price impact of Ball’s £4.3bn agreed deal for Rexam;Brussels has launched an in-depth investigation into the agreed £4.3bn takeover of Britain’s Rexam by Ball of the US, amid fears that the combined powerhouse could force up prices in the drinks can market.“Many of us buy drinks in cans — they are convenient and used everywhere,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition policy. “It is therefore very important that the commission makes sure that Ball’s takeover of Rexam does not restrict effective competition and so risk price increases that could be passed on to consumers.”The European Commission said the combination of Ball and Rexam — the world’s largest drinks can makers supplying customers such as Coca-Cola and Heineken — would create a company controlling two-thirds of Europe’s production plants. Due to the significant investment required to build a plant, which could make competition difficult, the takeover was “likely to result in price increases for customers and ultimately for consumers”.The commission said it would examine “in particular … the importance of having a sufficiently wide network of production facilities across the European economic area and the barriers to entry and expansion”.Some 61bn cans were filled in Europe last year, according to the European Can Makers Association, in a global market of 300bn. A combined company would deliver sales of about $15bn and control about 69 per cent of the European market for drinks cans, analysts estimate. It would also claim 61 per cent in North America, 74 per cent in Brazil, and 40 per cent globally. Regulators in the US and Brazil are also examining the takeover.Ball said on Monday that the announcement of an in-depth investigation by the EU was not expected to alter the takeover timetable of concluding the deal in the first half of 2016. “We are exactly were we thought we would be at this stage of the regulatory process,” said a person close to the company.Competition authorities are expected to demand disposals in the US, Germany, Brazil and the UK. However the two companies have said that if asset sales representing more than $1.58bn are required, Ball has the right to walk away.People close to the situation suggested that this was not expected, despite the concerns voiced by the EU’s competition commission. A break fee had been built into the deal which would require Ball to pay 7 per cent of the total value of the deal — equivalent to about £300m — if it decides to walk away.Analysts at Baird Equity Research said in a note responding to news of the investigation that disposals of $2bn were likely to be required but the implication was that this would not scupper the deal. “We remain positive on the deal, which will be financially and strategically accretive once completed,” the note said.The commission said it would decide by November 25 whether its competition concerns were founded.
6;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-04-23T23:00:51Z;The Nasdaq — going nowhere for 15 years;Almost any other equity investment would have been a smarter bet;This was the day that many market-watchers thought they would never live to see: the day the Nasdaq Composite index closed at a new all-time high.The last time it did so was on March 10, 2000, at the top of arguably the single most grotesque bubble in stock market history. Within a month it had fallen by more than a third.The valuations the Nasdaq hit at that point were so extreme that many assumed it could take a lifetime to get back to a new high. This was not unreasonable. US stocks at that point were more overvalued by sensible long-term metrics than at any other point in history.Nasdaq stocks looked more expensive even than industrial stocks had done before the Wall Street Crash in 1929 — and it had taken until 1954 for them to set a new high.In history’s other great bubble, Japanese stocks peaked on New Year’s Eve 1989. A quarter of a century later, Tokyo stocks remain almost 50 per cent below that peak.So the recovery of the Nasdaq is genuinely remarkable and is backed, hearteningly, by truly remarkable corporate performance. Apple, still a year away from the launch of the iPod in March 2000, leads the pack. It appeared in the dotcom era to have decisively lost its war with Microsoft. But since then it has gained 4,200 per cent while the Nasdaq has been flat. Its extraordinary success — achieved with profit multiples that still make it look cheap — is the single biggest factor in Nasdaq’s recovery.But buying the Nasdaq at its last peak would still have been a terrible idea. Scarcely any equity market anywhere has fared worse. Even Argentina’s Merval index, despite the disasters of default and devaluation in the interim, has gained 135 per cent.Those who dared to be contrarian would have trounced those who jumped into the hot stocks of the Nasdaq. According to Bloomberg data, five stocks in the S&P 500 have risen more than 1,000 per cent since then. For those who could not foresee the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and missed out on Apple, there was always the Ball Corporation, which makes cans, VF Corporation, which makes jeans, and CSX Corporation, a railroad. All were industries that appeared to be in terminal decline 15 years ago.
7;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-03-11T12:47:38Z;Real Domino effect will be higher investment in digital printing;Brother pays premium to discourage bidding war;Domino Printing Sciences appears to be reaching its own “sell-by” date as a listed company.In the City, the group has been so low-key it makes Rexam seem positively flamboyant. But just as the drinks can group attracted attention from halfway around the world with a bid of £4.3bn from US rival Ball, so the printing group has been identified as desirable by Japanese group Brother, which is prepared to pay £1bn in cash to snap up its digital, barcode and expiry date expertise.Unsurprisingly, the Domino board is recommending the offer of 915p a share, which comes with the bonus of the 14.76p-a-share final dividend. A scheme of arrangement to win shareholder approval shortens the timescale for any other interested party to make an alternative offer.Yet Brother is paying the sort of premium that would discourage others from joining in even if the process lasted a year and a day. Though Domino’s shares closed well above the offer price at 941p, that offer is still 27 per cent above Tuesday’s close.In multiple terms it is also generous, valuing the group on a forward p/e of about 24 times. Analysts at Barclays say that in 2004 UK printing group Lynx was bought by Danaher for a price equivalent to a p/e of 20 times. And that was after the US group had won a bidding war against ITW.Although Brother and its putative new division both have the word “printers” in their business models, they are in such different parts of the market that the Japanese group is not even talking vaguely about cost synergies. It is simply a move to buy some growth.Investment bankers hope the deal will renew M&A interest in FTSE 250 industrial engineers and similar. Xaar, the profit-warning-hit industrial printer, has already been mentioned as a possible target. More imaginative speculation reaches as far as Spectris, which makes electrical equipment.But this hope is expressed every time a mid-cap industrial receives a bid, and is realised less often. Instead, the real impact may be felt further afield. If Brother’s deep pockets can fund the UK group’s expansion in the fast-growing digital printing market where its size has held it back so far, then its large US rivals, Danaher and Dover, may need to step up their own investment plans to defend their market positions. Still, cheaper than launching a counterbid.Negative energyCairn Energy has been highlighting how senior Indian politicians recognise the “negative impact” of retrospective taxation on investor sentiment.Meanwhile, investors have been making their own negative impact on the oil explorer’s value after the group received a $1.6bn tax bill from New Delhi. Cairn’s share price closed 16 per cent lower on Wednesday, at 153.7p.No wonder the Scottish group sounds sore. Its response is not to turn to the all-too-familiar terrain of the Indian courts in which other multinationals have contested tax claims, but to navigate the uncharted waters of the UK-India investment treaty.This treaty says that, if the two sides cannot agree within six months, then the dispute goes to an international panel of three wise persons to reach a majority verdict. One arbitrator is appointed by each side, and the two then agree who the chairman should be. The president of the International Court of Justice acts as backstop, just in case there is no outbreak of amity and sweet reason.For both parties, however, the most damaging feature of this tax bill is its element of surprise. It goes against the trend of recent ministerial comment, suggesting that such public statements are not a reliable guide to the government’s views. As such, it exacerbates the unpredictability that is already part of the problem.For Cairn, it raises the question: what was the point of months’ of engagement by executives with the Indian authorities?Cairn insists that the Indian government can have recourse only to its Indian subsidiary, rather than the group as a whole. Even so, its current inability to sell its $700m stake in Cairn India, which analysts had pencilled in for this year, is bad news enough. When Arun Jaitley, India’s finance minister, visits the UK this week, he should be glad he is travelling to London, not Edinburgh.Boohoo’s buyback“So last year,” is rarely a term of praise in the fashion world. Certainly Boohoo.com seems to have little time for last spring’s styles. The online retailer raised £50m when it floated in March last year. Now it wants authority from shareholders to buy back up to 10 per cent of the share capital because it feels it has too much cash — £54m — sitting about on the balance sheet.At Wednesday’s closing share price — less than half the group’s debut value — a 10 per cent buyback would amount to £30m. That is more than half the amount it raised just 12 months ago and would reduce the free float that is not extensive now at 53 per cent.A buyback would be one way of boosting earnings per share. But investors should ask the management why this admirable aim cannot be achieved by investing the cash more heavily in the business.alison.smith@ft.com
8;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-02-19T08:07:04Z;Rexam agrees £4.3bn offer from US rival Ball;Deal to unite biggest drinks can makers faces antitrust hurdles;Rexam’s board has recommended a cash and shares offer from US rival Ball Corporation, a deal that would create a powerhouse in the production of drinks cans with annual revenues of $15bn.Ball will pay 610p a share for the smaller UK-based manufacturer, comprising 407p in cash and 0.04568 shares in Ball.Since advanced talks between the world’s largest drinks can makers were revealed earlier this month, shares in Colorado-based Ball have risen to the point that the current offer is equivalent to 635p per share in Rexam.The deal values Rexam at £4.4bn and Ball will also assume about £1bn worth of Rexam’s debt.But the transaction is expected to face a thorough review from competition authorities in both the EU and the US. It is not expected to be completed until the first half of next year.A combined company would control about 61 per cent of the market for drinks cans in North America, according to analysts. In Europe, Rexam and Ball would have a combined market share of about 69 per cent, and about 74 per cent in Brazil.Ball said it could back out of the deal if antitrust regulators required it to sell assets generating more than $1.58bn in turnover. In the event of the deal not going through, a break fee of up to £302m would be payable, it said.The two companies sought to ease concerns among investors who questioned whether the deal would get past antitrust authorities.John Hayes, chief executive and chairman of Ball, said: “We’ve spent a significant amount of time evaluating the regulatory issues, and we believe there is a clear route to obtaining the approvals.”Graham Chipchase, Rexam chief executive, said: “The Rexam board would not have accepted that offer unless there was a clear route to get this approved.”“The brewers are consolidating as well. They’re becoming quite powerful . . . Our customers are big enough to look after themselves,” he added, noting that some of the drinks groups manufacture their own cans, which reduces the power of can makers.Analysts believe Ball would be required to sell assets in all regions to address competition concerns. US-based Crown, the third-largest beverage can maker with a global market share of 19 per cent, could be one of the main beneficiaries of any asset sales.A deal would make strategic sense because of complementary manufacturing footprints. Rexam, which produces about 60bn cans a year for drinks companies including PepsiCo, AB InBev and Carlsberg, is strong in emerging markets such as Russia and India, while Ball has a presence in China, Vietnam and Myanmar.Mr Chipchase said Rexam had consulted with all of its customers and there was widespread approval of the deal because of the “geographic benefits” of an “optimised footprint”.Ball said the combined company would have revenues of about $15bn and 22,500 employees. News of the deal came as Rexam reported full-year pre-tax profits of £343m, up from £339m in 2013, which it described as a good performance in a difficult year.Mr Chipchase said there would be a range of retention measures to keep people in place after the merger, but added: “It’s far too early to speculate on my future.”“It’s about ensuring the beverage can industry is sufficiently strong so it can reinvest in capex . . . and innovation.”
9;BLL;Ball Corp;2015-02-05T19:04:16Z;Ball in talks with Rexam over £4.29bn bid;Deal between two of the world’s biggest can makers would face regulatory scrutiny;Ball Corporation of the US is in talks to buy Rexam, the UK-based drinks can manufacturer, in a £4.29bn deal that would create a powerhouse in the production of cans for beverages including soft drinks and beer.Shares in Rexam jumped as much as 29 per cent to 575p on Thursday after it confirmed a cash-and-share offer from Ball, valuing the London-based company at 610p a share. The offer consisted of two-thirds cash — £2.85bn — and the remainder in Ball shares.However, any deal between the two largest beverage can makers would have to result in large-scale asset sales across several regions to appease competition authorities, seen to be the main obstacle to a potential takeover.Rexam, which disclosed the terms of the possible deal, said “discussions on other matters are continuing” and stressed that a formal offer was far from certain.A combined company would control about 61 per cent of the market for drinks cans in North America, according to analysts. In Europe, Rexam and Ball would have a combined market share of about 69 per cent, and about 74 per cent in Brazil.“They are going to have to divest so much to get this through the antitrust authorities,” said Chip Dillon, analyst at US-based Vertical Research Partners.Both Rexam and Ball control around 21 per cent of the global 300bn can market. A beneficiary of any asset sales could be US-based Crown, the third largest beverage can maker with a global market share of 19 per cent.Analysts said a deal between the two groups made strategic sense because of complementary manufacturing footprints. Rexam, which produces about 60bn cans a year for drink companies including PepsiCo, AB InBev and Carlsberg, is strong in emerging markets such as Russia and India, while Ball has a presence in China, Vietnam and Myanmar.Stolid performance means the City would feel guiltily relieved to see drinks can maker go, says Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingThe British canmaker has also been expanding its foothold in the Middle East. In January, it completed the purchase of a majority stake in UAC, a Middle East beverage can maker.A combined group would also appeal to the world’s biggest drinks companies who would prefer to negotiate packaging contracts with one global player and pay lower prices.Mr Dillon said a strong US dollar and Rexam’s decision to become a pure-play beverage can maker is likely to have made it more attractive as a target. The British company sold its healthcare packaging division last year for £490m to focus solely on making drink cans.“There’s no heavy lifting of having to divest non-core assets,” he said.Confirmation of the talks came as Ball reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Colorado-based Ball, which has a market capitalisation of $8.9bn, has until 5 March to make a firm offer or walk away under UK takeover rules.Shares in Rexam closed the day up 20 per cent at 538p, while shares in Ball were up 9 per cent $72.48 in afternoon New-York trading.
10;BLL;Ball Corp;2011-11-17T16:26:20Z;Rexam: focus on the core;Disposal of personal care unit would benefit largest maker of drinks cans;Those who aim at nothing are sure to hit it. It is an old management adage advising against diversification for the sake of it. Rexam appears to be taking it to heart. After selling its closures business earlier this year for $360m, the world’s largest maker of drinks cans says it might sell its personal care division. A disposal would strengthen its balance sheet and keep Rexam focused on its core business. The question is what chief executive Graham Chipchase would do with the proceeds.The £3bn company, which has its roots in the old Bowater paper and packaging empire, has been a nice little earner so far this year, outperforming the FTSE All-Share index by about 8 percentage points. But the personal care unit has been a poor performer, helping to shave 2 per cent off organic profit growth at the plastic packaging division in the first half, against growth of 12 per cent in the drinks cans division, which accounts for 80 per cent of group sales. Disposing of the unit makes sense.Shareholders should not expect an immediate deal, however, given the poor state of the markets. But news that the move was being considered pushed Rexam’s shares 6 per cent higher at one point on Thursday, so investors clearly like the idea. Mr Chipchase could use the proceeds to cut Rexam’s net debt, which stood at £1.4bn at the end of September. At that level it is twice the group’s reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – high, but within the group’s target of £1.2bn to £1.5bn. There is also the prospect that proceeds could be used to make a bolt-on acquisition, or be returned to shareholders.It is a nice dilemma for a company to have in difficult times. Rexam’s shares trade at 10 times earnings, a modest discount to competitors such as Ball Corp and Crown Holdings. Until there is more news on the disposal front, that looks about right.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
11;BLL;Ball Corp;2011-08-03T13:57:40Z;Rexam lifted by stay-at-home drinkers;;Booming demand for beverage cans in Europe helped offset weakness in the North American market as packaging specialist Rexam improved profits on steady sales.Graham Chipchase, chief executive of Europe’s biggest supplier of drinks cans, said sales volumes had been boosted as UK consumers switched from drinking in pubs to consuming beer at home, while the growing popularity of beer compared with vodka in Russia had also helped turnover.“The trend towards home consumption and people drinking less in pubs definitely suits our canning business,” he said. Meanwhile GDP growth in Russia and other eastern European territories was also lifting can consumption from low levels.Sales volumes in Europe rose by 7 per cent, slightly ahead of the market, prompting Rexam to consider expanding capacity in both Finland and Russia.However, North America was more mixed as Rexam was hit by the loss of contracts last year and a 4 per cent fall in the soft drink and beer beverage can market during the interim period.Mr Chipchase said Rexam expects to recover much of the 14 per cent fall in volumes in North America - where it competes against fellow market leaders Ball and Crown - by 2013.“In the US, we have been taking capacity out - we have as well as others” Mr Chipchase said. He added that Rexam would protect its ability to handle increased volumes as it won back business. Demand for speciality cans - such as small slim cans used by customers including Red Bull - continued to improve as the standard cans market slackened.Consolidating its US market position, alongside taking advantage of expected market growth in Europe and Latin America and other emerging markets remained central to Rexam’s fortunes, he said. “Europeans use on average one and a half cans a week - in the US it is one can per head per day,” Mr Chipchase said.During the period Rexam worked along with niche drinks makers to help launch Sunlover, a so-called “tan in a can” skin-conditioning drink containing beta-carotene and Aspire, a cranberry-flavoured slimming aid that claims to be the first calorie-burning soft drink in Europe.During the interim period, Rexam agreed the sale of its plastic lids business, representing about a third of its plastic packaging business, for $360m. Completion of the sale will leave plastics accounting for about a fifth of Rexam’s turnover, with beverage cans generating 80 per cent of revenues.But the FTSE 100 company has said it remained committed to maintaining its presence in plastic packaging. It is retaining two-thirds of its plastics business, including divisions that concentrate on pharmaceutical packaging and personal care, which produces fragrance pumps, lipstick cases and parts for air fresheners.Pre-tax profits rose to £132m in the six months to June, up from £102m last year, on flat turnover of £2.3bn. An improved interim dividend of 4.7p (4p) is payable from earnings per share of 15.1p (11.6p) as £95m of free cash flow helped nudged down net debt to £1.6bn.Shares in Rexam rose 21.1p, or 6 per cent to 374.9p on Wednesday, valuing the company’s equity at £3.1bn.In a note on Wednesday, broker Oriel increased its full-year profits forecast by £20m to £440m. It maintained a “buy” stance on the stock, arguing that Rexam, which has been trading recently on a prospective p/e of about 10 times, was better value than Ball and Crown, which are rated at a 25 per cent premium to their UK-listed peer.
12;BLL;Ball Corp;2011-06-20T22:00:44Z;Rexam to sell plastic lid business for $360m;;Rexam, Europe’s leading beverage can maker, has agreed the sale of its plastic lid-making business for $360m as it hinted at further efforts to reduce its debt.The business, acquired as part of its $1.57bn acquisition of US-based O-I Plastic Products in 2007 from Owens-Illinois, will lead to the proportion of turnover generated by Rexam’s metal cans business rising from about 70 per cent to more than 80 per cent.But the FTSE 100 company said it remained committed to maintaining its presence in the plastic packaging arena. It is retaining two-thirds of its plastics business including divisions that concentrate on pharmaceutical packaging and personal care, which produces fragrance pumps, lipstick cases and parts for air fresheners.Rexam signalled its intent to dispose of its “closures” division by including it as a discontinued item in its results to December 2010.Graham Chipchase, Rexam’s chief executive, pointed to the problems of low margins suffered by the business when he unveiled improved results in February. In particular, the business has been hit by a decline of nearly 30 per cent in the sales volumes for the tops of plastic water bottles in the US.A decision to sell the business, which generated underlying profits of £22m on sales of £343m in 2010, led to Rexam taking a further impairment charge of £179m last year, pushing it into a £117m loss.Rexam is taking a further £25m charge this year on the agreed sale to trade buyer Berry Plastics, which is backed by private equity firm Apollo, for £225m.Barclays Capital advised Rexam on the sale, which is expected to complete in the third quarter subject to regulatory approval.Rexam has retained part of the business, producing so-called “high-barrier food containers”, which will be absorbed into its personal care plastics division.The net proceeds will be used to reduce net debt, which stood at £1.68bn, down from £1.83bn, at the end of 2010.The company said on Monday: “Over the past two years the company has bought back some €62m of its €700m 2013 medium-term notes and may continue to make further repurchases of these notes and other senior bonds going forward.”The deal could lead to Rexam ending the year below its self-imposed target of £1.5bn in debt, and towards the bottom end of its preferred range of 2 to 2.5 times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. In July 2009, Rexam, launched a rights issue aimed at raising £350m to trim debts and protect its investment grade status.Kevin Lapwood, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said he was no longer pencilling in year-end net debt at £1.35bn as the amount raised by the sale was “ahead of expectations”. But he estimated Rexam was still set to lose at least $200m following disposal of the business over the course of its ownership.Rexam shares, up 12 per cent over the year, slipped by 10½p to 367.1p on Monday. Mr Lapwood maintained a “buy” position, arguing that Rexam’s shares, which are valued at a prospective p/e multiple of less than 11 times, were trading at an “unjustified” 30 per cent discount to its US peers Ball Corp and Crown.
13;BLL;Ball Corp;2010-09-20T19:09:17Z;FTSE at highest level in nearly five months;;Rexam was a top performer in a strong London market on Monday amid renewed break-up speculation.Shares in the beverage can maker rose 3.7 per cent to 313¾p after Merrill Lynch said that if management failed to improve performance, investors would get restless.“Going forward, if the company is not able to execute, it is not out of the question that shareholders push for more aggressive change, which could include a bigger restructuring, a split-up of the company, or a potential sale,” said analyst Ross Gilardi.On trading, Merrill saw a recovery in Russia, where Rexam has a near monopoly but has struggled in recent years. Carlsberg, its key customer in Russia, is likely to benefit from a state clampdown on illegal vodka.Merrill valued the stock at 270p in a worst-case scenario, against potential long-term upside to more than 500p if management can achieve a similar rating to US rival Ball Corporation.The FTSE 100 pushed to its highest level in nearly five months, gaining 94.09, or 1.7 per cent, to 5,602.54. Volume was thin, however, with just over 1bn blue-chip shares traded across the main exchanges against a daily average of 1.6bn.BP was the focus among the oil companies, with the shares rising 2.1 per cent to 411¼p, after saying its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico was “effectively dead”. The rest of the sector found support as oil rallied for the first day in five, with B shares of Royal Dutch Shell up 2.3 per cent to £18.52 and BG Group ahead 2.9 per cent to £11.14.Product testing group Intertek was 3.6 per cent higher at £18.53 after SGS, its Swiss peer, delivered a four-year strategic plan that set ambitious sales targets and flagged up an increased pace to its acquisition strategy.Seymour Pierce analysts said a bid for Intertek from SGS could not be ruled out, though others argued that the testing market was already highly fragmented and bolt-on deals were more likely than mergers.Among the property companies, Segro edged up 2.1 per cent to 269¼p after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its European “sell” list on valuation grounds.Hammerson rose 3.3 per cent to 395¼p on news that the group was in talks to sell its Bishops Square development in east London, which is majority owned by Oman Investment Fund, for about £550m.Carnival led the Footsie risers, up 5 per cent to £24.89, ahead of Tuesday’s third-quarter results.Bid speculation provided a few features among the mid-caps.Wellstream, the oilfield pipe maker, added 5.5 per cent to 609p amid renewed talk that it could be a target for Saipem, its Italian peer.Price comparison site MoneySupermarket gained 4 per cent to 86¾p on continued talk of predatory interest from a US website operator.The Restaurant Group rose 0.8 per cent to 267p as UBS pushed the caterer as a possible bid target. Mitchells & Butlers, up 0.9 per cent to 297p, looked to be a credible potential bidder, it said.Heading up the loser board, Hikma Pharmaceuticals dropped 5.2 per cent to 726p after Numis Securities said the group was overly reliant on colchicine, a treatment for gout, which US regulators may pull from the market “any day now”.Better than expected half-year sales are “largely due to sales of an unapproved product, colchicine, where Hikma has scaled up while its competitors have scaled down following the launch of an approved version with supposed exclusivity,” it said.Halfords lost 4.6 per cent to 441p after Redburn Partners downgraded the retailer to “neutral” ahead of interim results due early in October. “We increasingly worry that weak retail sales trends mean profit estimates, short and medium term, are pitched too high,” it said. “For a stock where consistent over delivery versus estimates has been a key attraction, the likely need for expectations to be adjusted down will probably overshadow the ongoing attractions of the franchise and a modest valuation.”Sterling Energy dropped 38.9 per cent to 78½p after tests at its Sangaw well in Kurdistan showed gas flows had been quickly replaced by water.In response, Oriel Securities cut its rating on the Kurdish explorer from “buy” to “hold” and warned further drilling into deeper zones could also disappoint.Fellow Kurdistan explorer Gulf Keystone Petroleum added 15 per cent to 157½p on reports that it was looking to move from Aim to the main market. That valued the loss making company at £1bn.Rockhopper Exploration climbed a further 12.4 per cent to 472p as investors continued to digest Friday’s flow test data from its Sea Lion prospect in the waters off the Falklands. Canaccord Genuity said the find was worth 441p a share.Encore Oil was marked 2.8 per cent higher at 92½p in the wake of a bullish presentation from Sterling Resources, operator of the Cladhan field in the North Sea. Traders reckon Cladhan is capable of producing 15,000 barrels of oil per day and there could be 200m barrels of oil in place, although this could increase when details of further drilling are announced.Avocet Mining put on 13.7 per cent to 158p after reporting positive drilling results from its prospect in Burkina Faso. “The results show that the area is highly prospective and that the company is well on track to double its reserves,” noted Collins Stewart.Petroneft added 4.4 per cent to 47¼p after the Siberian explorer issued a positive operations update.Analysts said Petroneft would probably be able to book reserves from the Ledovoye field by year-end, up to a possible 15m barrels, or 20 per cent of its existing reserves base.Clipper Windpower fell 4.4 per cent to 47¼p after warning of a funding strain. But the wind turbine company said it was in talks with UTC, its biggest shareholder, about a possible takeover.
14;BLL;Ball Corp;2008-07-28T22:17:14Z;Financial fears push London lower;;Financial stocks led the market lower with Lloyds TSB under pressure after a leading broker suggested its dividend was in jeopardy.Lloyds reports half-year figures on Wednesday and is expected by analysts to announce a maintained interim dividend of 11.2p a share. But Cazenove was telling clients on Monday that the dividend was unsustainable and the final payment, due next year, would be cut by 40 per cent.Simon Pilkington, analyst, said: “As the probability of a recession grows, in our view management can only avoid a capital issue by cutting the dividend and slowing balance sheet growth.“We will review our estimates after the results but given the changed economic environment we believe that it will become untenable for Lloyds to maintain its dividend.”Lloyds ended the day 3.9 per cent lower at 318¼p.It was a grim day for the banking sector as investors cut positions ahead of the results from Lloyds and HBOS, down 7.3 per cent to 287½p, which reports on Thursday. HBOS was put under pressure by comments from José Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chief executive of rumoured bidder BBVA. He said the Spanish bank was focused on organic growth and the integration of its US banks.Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays gave up 5 per cent to 338¾p, while Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 4 per cent to 206¼p as traders locked in profits. Since hitting a 10-year low on July 15, the FTSE All-Share banking index has risen 17 per cent.The FTSE 100 finished 40 points, or 0.8 per cent, lower at 5,312.6, pulled down by the financials and a warning from Joachim Faber, the head of Allianz Global Investors, that stock markets had the potential to fall by a fifth and were likely to reach their lows only in the first half of next year.The London market would have fallen further had not a strong performance by mining stocks, again in demand as the “sell financials/buy commodities trade” was put back on.Antofagasta led the way for the miners, rising 7.1 per cent to 540p, followed by Vedanta Resources, up 5 per cent to £18.52, and Kazakhmys, 4.6 per cent stronger at £13.63.The FTSE 250 fell 151 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 8,716.7. Trading volumes were pitiful, with just 2bn shares traded, against 3.2bn on Friday.Rexam, the largest manufacturer of drinks cans, was marked 6.6 per cent lower at 352p ahead of Wednesday’s half-year results.Last week, US rival Ball Corp warned of the impact of rising rail and freight costs on profits and many traders feel Rexam could make similar comments with its results.Rolls-Royce, down 4 per cent to 355¾p, was out of favour after a profits warning from Ryanair and a UBS “sell” note. The broker was concerned more airlines would mothball aircraft and Rolls-Royce could take further provisions for customer financing exposures.A JPMorgan downgrade to “underweight” left Sage, the accountancy software group, off 3.4 per cent at 194.2p. The broker told clients: “Sage gets 58 per cent of revenues from the US and UK, the two key areas that are seeing economic slowdown”.J Sainsbury bucked the weak market trend, rising 2 per cent to 323½p after the Qatar Investment Authority announced a raised holding of 27.2 per cent.Among the mid-caps, pub companies were hit by a flurry of profit taking. Mitchells & Butlers, which had gained 36 per cent from its lows on July 16, closed 9.5 per cent lower at 239½p, while Punch Taverns, up by 25 per cent in the same period, finished 7.2 per cent weaker at 250p.Barratt Developments added 6.8 per cent to 105½p on the back of a push from Numis Securities. Chris Millington, analyst, setting a 175p target price, said Barratt was trading on the lowest valuation in the sector in spite of being more secure with regard to banking facilities and trading far better than many of its peers.Aegis, the media buying group, was in focus late on as clips of 4.5m shares changed hands. Aegis eased 0.9 per cent to 105½p, while Rentokil Initial fell 4.2 per cent to 67¾p as traders reflected on the fact that the group has net debt of £1.1bn against a shrunken market value of £1.2bn.
