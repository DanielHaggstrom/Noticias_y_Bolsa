0;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-11-10T11:16:21Z;Independent US oil producers increase hedges for 2017;Companies look to support cash flows and investment even if prices weaken;US independent oil producers have taken advantage of the recent bump in crude prices to lock in future revenues, building up derivatives positions for 2017.In third-quarter earnings reports over the past three weeks, several US exploration and production companies said they had hedged significantly more of their expected oil sales for the coming year than they had done at the equivalent point of 2015 in preparation for this year.The additional protection from hedges will support cash flows and investment plans even if crude prices continue to weaken, helping to sustain US oil production.Devon Energy, Cimarex Energy and Murphy Oil are among companies that had no hedges a year ago for 2016 production, but are now using futures and options to guarantee some of their income for next year.Other companies, including Oasis Petroleum and Denbury Resources, that used derivatives to hedge for this year, have put in place higher levels of protection for 2017.David Hager, Devon’s chief executive, told analysts on a call last month that its hedges would help the company cover its planned capital spending from its operating cash flow.He said: “Hedging significantly more helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we’ll have in 2017.”Opec ministers’ announcement in September that they intended to cut the cartel’s production helped drive oil prices higher, and benchmark Brent crude hit a peak of more than $53 per barrel last month.Prices have since slipped back, as it became clear that Opec’s members were struggling to agree how to implement the plan, but the temporary bump created opportunities for producers to hedge on more attractive terms.The total volume of oil committed in short positions held by producers, traders and users — a rough guide to production companies’ hedging — last month hit a five-year high at about 608m barrels, more than double its level at the previous low point in September 2014.Philip Verleger, an energy economist, said US oil companies had cut their costs to the point that they could lock in profits for the coming year even though futures prices were lower now than they were a year ago.“They rely on technology to increase yields and they don’t gamble on prices,” he said. “It’s a manufacturing business.”Roger Jenkins, chief executive of Murphy, said the company had traditionally not done much hedging but had now become more active.For its gas production in the Montney shale of western Canada, Murphy has hedged about 50 per cent of its expected sales to lock in returns. Mr Jenkins said the company’s gas wells would break even at any price above C$2.10 ($1.57) per thousand cubic feet, and benchmark US gas is about C$2.80 per thousand cubic feet.Other companies that have made use of derivatives continue to do so. Pioneer Natural Resources has hedged about 75 per cent of next year’s production and Whiting Petroleum has hedged about 49 per cent. For both companies, those are about the same proportions as at the equivalent point last year.The downside of hedging, however, is that it can mean giving away some or all of the upside if prices rise. Some US exploration and production companies, often the larger and financially stronger ones, including EOG Resources, Hess, Noble Energy and Continental Resources, do not hedge.
1;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-08-28T16:27:59Z;Cost reductions help US shale oil industry pass first real test;Companies respond to price plunge with dramatic cost-cutting;The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote, “That which does not kill me makes me stronger.” It could be the motto of the US shale industry.Ever since the shale boom started, there have been critics arguing that it was all too good to be true. Sceptical analysts warned that the industry would collapse like a house of cards if oil and gas prices fell.This summer has brought the strongest evidence yet that they were wrong. Since prices began to fall two years ago, some shale producers have wilted, and dozens have folded. Many others, however, have been tempered by adversity. The second-quarter earnings statements from US exploration and production companies earlier this month showed some remarkable cost reduction numbers — not aspirations, but achieved results. Pioneer Natural Resources said it had reduced its production cost per barrel by 26 per cent since last year. Devon Energy said costs were down 40 per cent from their peak.Some of the fall came from lower prices in the supply chain. Pioneer’s contracts for steel tubes and cement ran out last year, and its new contracts cost 30-35 per cent less.Other cost reductions arose from internal innovations in well design, drilling and completions. EOG Resources, for example, is saving money by running drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same site simultaneously. Continental Resources said it had cut the time needed to drill a well in the “Stack” shale oil area of Oklahoma by 44 per cent since last year.The cost cuts achieved by driving down suppliers’s rates could be reversed in a recovery, as staff, rigs and pumps for hydraulic fracturing are put back to work. Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, the oilfield services group, argued last month that its businesses serving US shale producers “will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages”.But savings achieved through efficiency gains will be permanent. Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, told analysts that about 80 per cent of its savings in the Permian Basin of west Texas came from improved well design and drilling techniques, lower materials costs and enhanced logistics.The savings mean that US shale reserves, which a few years ago were in the upper-middle section of the global cost curve, now include some of the world’s lowest-cost sources of new oil, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company.Meanwhile, the view that shale production will always need a sustained inflow of capital is fading, as companies cut spending to live within their means. In the second quarter, 58 leading E&P companies covered by Bloomberg reported total capital spending that was just $2.7bn greater than their operating cash flow, compared to a $9.7bn deficit in the equivalent period of 2015.Falling costs have made it possible for activity to rise even as spending has shrunk. As Mr Lesar puts it, the industry is “getting back to business”.Last week there were 316 rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil, up 68 from the low point in May, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.This increase has come even though US crude has never been above $52 per barrel though that time, and at one point was below $40.In 2015, the recovery in rig use had a false start. It got going when US crude was about $60 per barrel and evaporated as oil slipped lower in the second half of that year. The cost cutting done since then means that this year’s upturn is more likely to be sustained.The pressure on costs and capital spending remains intense. US crude production dropped by 800,000 barrels per day between April 2015 and May 2016, and is still in decline. Companies including Marathon and Continental have indicated that US crude needs to recover to about $60 before they would be happy to make the investments they need to increase production. Pioneer and EOG, which are projecting robust growth at prices around $50, are unusual.However, the fall in US oil output is now gentler than seemed likely in the spring. Some companies, including ConocoPhillips, Continental and Pioneer, have even raised their guidance for expected production.The shale oil industry, born at the end of the last decade, has still not yet been through a complete cycle of rise, fall and recovery. With no precedents, there was inevitably uncertainty about how it would respond, and that has not been dispelled completely. But the industry has now faced its first real test. So far, it is passing.ed.crooks@ft.com
2;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-07-26T04:00:45Z;Dismal delivery puts big oil and gas energy projects at risk;The majors can no longer afford delays or cost overruns on ‘megaprojects’;Oil companies have tens of thousands of employees, tens of billions of dollars in reserves, and decades of experience in running large investment projects.Yet time and again big oil companies prove themselves incapable of completing their projects on time and on budget.In 2009 Chevron’s Gorgon, a liquefied natural gas project in north-west Australia, was expected to cost $37bn and start production in 2014. It has ended up costing about $54bn and came on stream this year. Soon after it started, it suffered a gas leak that meant production had to be shut down.Kashagan, a $50bn oil development in the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan, took nine years to move into production after it was given the go-ahead in 2004.Within weeks of celebrating first oil, the international consortium running the project was forced to shut it down after corrosive gas was discovered to be leaking from pipelines.Royal Dutch Shell, one of the companies in the consortium running the project said in March that the group expected to restart production around the end of 2016.Those are far from isolated occurrences. A study of 365 oil and gas “megaprojects” by Ernst & Young, the professional services firm, found 64 per cent faced cost overruns and 73 per cent were behind schedule.Of the 20 largest, only seven were being delivered in line with the budget approved when the final investment decision was taken. Three were running 75-100 per cent over their initial budget, and the average cost overrun was 23 per cent.Analysis published in June by McKinsey, the management consultancy, showed eight recent large oil and gas projects had ended up costing more than twice as much as originally estimated.“The industry has got a real problem,” says Chris Pateman-Jones of Ernst & Young. “Projects are becoming larger and more complex and more challenging . . . Even if they were to hit their targets, they could still be uneconomic.”Such analysis illustrates the quandary facing the oil majors such as BP and Chevron, challenged by the boom in shale oil and gas production from their smaller, nimbler rivals in North America and by state-controlled rivals in resource-rich countries. Their fortunes are also threatened by policies to cut carbon dioxide emissions that are curbing demand for fossil fuels.Yet with oil prices low and capital spending plans slashed, the prices of oil services and equipment are falling. So, this could be a good time to start spending on projects that will come into production as oil prices recover.But such a strategy will only pay off if those projects are completed efficiently. “To reap the benefits of investing in these large projects at the bottom of the cycle, it’s critical that the operators deliver them on time and on budget,” says Angus Rodger of Wood Mackenzie, the research company. “The industry’s recent record at delivering major projects has been dismal, so that needs to improve.”Even before the oil price crash of 2014, large developments were falling out of favour because of rising costs and declining profits across the sector. In 2007-13 there were about 40 large projects approved by the oil and gas industry worldwide each year, Mr Rodger says. Last year there were just eight, and this year there are likely to be about 10.Chevron has signalled a shift away from large projects towards smaller investments, including in shale in North America.But even those that do have shale reserves find it hard to compete with their smaller, more agile rivals such Devon Energy and EOG Resources, which have made all the running in the industry. In shale, bigger is not better.If projects cannot be made more efficient, they may never get off the ground.For big oil companies, projects such as deepwater oilfields or liquefied natural gas plants will continue to be critical to their future.There are steps that they can take to improve the economics of those investments, some of them learned from other industries.One is to use new technologies to cut costs. 3D printing, for example, can reduce the need for large inventories of parts to be kept or delivered to projects that are often in remote locations. Another is better contract design that gives suppliers an incentive to hold down costs.“The history of the industry is that there has been an adversarial relationship between operators and contractors not because they are bad people, but because the business incentives set it up that way,” Mr Pateman-Jones says. “I think we will move to much more effective ways of delivering projects.”If projects cannot be made more efficient, he adds, then they may never get off the ground. “If I were investing in some of these really big projects, I would be questioning whether they really made sense over a long period of time.”

The dollar also gave up ground after rallying in recent days, supporting commodities.Traders and strategists were nonetheless cautious on the rebound in stocks, warning that while the losses of the past two days were extreme — the S&P 500 lost nearly $1tn of value in Friday and Monday’s rout — more volatility was likely ahead with the second-quarter ending on Thursday.“It is just simply a technical rebound in response to a very sharp sell-off,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “I have been cautioning people that it is probably shortlived and we may see a pullback.”Traders also said a covering of short sales contributed to the move higher on Tuesday.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent to 2,036.09 while the Nasdaq Composite was 2.1 per cent higher. The CBOE’s Vix, a measure of implied volatility for the S&P extended its drop and fell below 20 — its long-term moving average.“The Vix pulling down toward 20, stabilisation in European equity markets and . . . stabilisation in gold or oil [are the right signs],” Mr Frederick said. “But you need a few days before you say there is an opportunity here.”Among energy companies, ExxonMobil rose 2.3 per cent to $90.91 while Devon Energy gained 6.6 per cent to $35.99 and Marathon Petroleum was up 8.4 per cent at $35.70.Bank stocks, which have been hard hit over the past few sessions, also rose on Tuesday. The financials sector of the benchmark index added 2.5 per cent with Citigroup up 5.1 per cent at $40.44, Bank of America adding 4.3 per cent to $12.70 and JPMorgan gaining 3.3 per cent to $59.52.Banks have been pressured as market participants have dialled back tighter interest rate policy expectations from the Federal Reserve in the wake of Brexit and ensuing market turmoil. Sharply lower US Treasury yields worry investors as low rates squeeze margins for banks.Technology shares also rebounded on Tuesday after coming under recent pressure given their natural cyclicality and exposure to Europe. Microsoft was up 2.1 per cent to $49.44.Utilities companies were the laggards, up just 0.3 per cent. As the broader market sold off, utilities had outperformed due to expectations of lower interest rates remaining for an extended period. In spite of selling on Tuesday, high dividend paying companies such as utilities are expected to remain in favour.Meanwhile, Lending Club, the embattled peer-to-peer lender, gained 7.2 per cent to $4.61 on news that it would cut its staff by 12 per cent. The group has also named a new chief executive after the departure of Renaud Laplanche in May over allegations of loan mis-selling and an undisclosed personal interest in a fund. However, an ongoing review, whose results were revealed on Tuesday, found that there had been further improprieties at the company.
4;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-06-06T20:30:40Z;Devon rises on near-$1bn divestiture move;US stocks climb as energy and materials sectors lead the way;Devon Energy shares climbed on Monday after the energy group unveiled nearly $1bn in asset sales as it looked to bolster its balance sheet.Oklahoma City-based Devon, along with many other companies in the sector, has divested assets to raise cash as revenues declined sharply as a result of the drop in crude oil prices that began in mid-2014.While the price of West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, has climbed to the $50 a barrel level recently, it sits at less than half of the peak reached in 2014.Indeed, Devon logged a net loss of $3.1bn in the first quarter, its sixth consecutive quarterly loss, according to data from Bloomberg. As a result of the weaker operating metrics, Devon was under more pressure to protect its credit rating.“Combined with other recent asset sales, we have now announced $1.3bn of gas-focused upstream divestitures,” said Dave Hager, Devon chief executive. “As we’ve said previously, proceeds from these tax-efficient transactions will be utilised to further strengthen our investment grade financial position.”The move announced on Monday included the divestiture of upstream assets in east Texas, the sale of non-core positions in the Anadarko Basin’s Granite Wash area and overriding royalty interest across 11,000 net acres in the northern Midland Basin.Devon’s shares jumped 4.7 per cent on Monday to $37.59. They are still down by about 41 per cent over the past 12 months.The broader energy sector also posted a strong performance on Monday as the price of US crude oil climbed by 2.2 per cent to $49.69, a 10-month high.Among the gainers were oilfield servicing group Halliburton, which rose 4.8 per cent to $44.91, and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which gained 3.2 per cent to $18.57.Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson’s shares were in the red after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the motorcycle maker to “neutral” from “buy”.“Our dealer checks over the last two weeks suggest that foot traffic has been mixed if not weak in the first two months of [the second quarter],” said Patrick Archambault, Goldman analyst.Mr Archambault also cautioned over “concerns about long-term brand relevance” and “demographic headwinds” that could weigh on the Wisconsin-based company.Harley’s shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $45.08, bringing their decline over the past 12 months to 17 per cent.Best Buy shares also fell after Hubert Joly, chief executive, said in a regulatory filing after the closing bell on Friday that he had reduced his stake in the electronics retailer by 43.8 per cent.Mr Joly sold about $12.8m worth of stock on June 2 for “diversification of his portfolio”, the regulatory filing said, adding that “he continues to exceed his officer stock ownership requirement with holdings of approximately $40m in vested and unvested [Best Buy] shares, stock units and options”.Best Buy shares fell 3.2 per cent to $31.33.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had gained 0.5 per cent to 2,109.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.6 per cent to 17,920.3, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,968.7.The energy and materials sectors led the way higher while the utilities sector lagged behind.
5;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-05-25T20:46:46Z;Intuit shares stumble on growth concerns;Energy sector performs strongly as US oil prices approach $50 a barrel;Intuit shares fell on Wednesday, eroding much of their 2016 gains, as worries about slowing subscriber growth for the group’s online accounting software overshadowed stronger than expected quarterly results.The California-based company said the number of subscribers to its QuickBooks Online service, which allows small businesses to keep track of financials through the cloud, rose 44.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.4m in the quarter to the end of April. However, that represented a decline from the 49.5 per cent, and 56.8 per cent, growth in the previous two quarters, respectively.Investors may have been “fixated” on the cooling subscriber growth, and concerned about whether Intuit could meet its target of 2m to 2.2m QuickBooks Online subscribers by the end of the financial year ending in July 2017, said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS. However, Mr Thill noted that he still saw the group’s goals as “very achievable”.Intuit’s hopes to shift users to its cloud-based software instead of its PC-based applications echoes many other companies in the software industry, such as Adobe, who are working to transition users to an online version of its image-editing suite.Intuit’s success has helped drive the shares about 8 per cent higher this year. However, they declined by as much as 5.1 per cent at one point on Wednesday in spite of overall results topping Wall Street estimates. It later pared some of those losses, closing down 2.1 per cent at $105.02.Net profits climbed in the April quarter to $1bn from $501m in the same three-month period in 2015. Sales climbed 7.9 per cent to $2.3bn, beating expectations of $2.26bn. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes certain items, of $3.43, also eclipsed estimates of $3.21.Tiffany shares retreated early in the day after the jewellery maker reported its steepest sales drop in nearly six years and lowered its full-year earnings guidance range.Weak tourist spending and the strong dollar were once again to blame for the weaker than expected results.“As expected, this was a difficult quarter in terms of both sales and earnings growth. We faced numerous challenges, including continued pressure from foreign tourist spending in Europe, the US and Asia, particularly in Hong Kong,” Frederic Cumenal, chief executive officer, said.For the three months to the end of April, sales fell 7.3 per cent year-on-year to $891.3m. That was the group’s sixth consecutive quarter of revenue decline and was the biggest sales drop since the second quarter of 2010. It was also well below the $915m that the market had expected.Net income for the period fell 16.6 per cent to $87.5m, or 69 cents a share — ahead of forecasts of 68 cents.Still, the company warned that it now expected full-year earnings per diluted share would drop by a mid-single digit percentage from 2015. It had previously predicted earnings to stay flat or fall by up to a mid-single digit.Tiffany shares later regained ground, ending the day flat at $63.89. The shares have fallen 16.3 per cent in the year to date.Looking at the markets more broadly, the energy sector was the top performers as US oil prices approached $50 a barrel. Devon Energy, an oil exploration and production company, climbed 5.7 per cent to $36.44, while oil major Chevron added on 1.6 per cent to $101.77.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,090.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 0.8 per cent to 17,851.5 and the Nasdaq Composite had advanced 0.7 per cent to 4,894,9.
6;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-03-31T18:46:50Z;US shareholder votes on climate change hit record;Exxon and Chevron face proposals from investors at their annual meetings;US companies are facing a record number of shareholder votes on climate change related issues at this year’s annual meetings, as pressure from investors has grown and regulators have become increasingly sympathetic.Proposals include calls for ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest US oil groups, to lift their limits on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, rather than investing in projects that could be made unprofitable by restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.Both companies’ investors will also be able to vote on whether the companies should provide assessments of the impact on their business of policies to limit global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius — the objective agreed by almost 200 countries at the Paris climate talks last December.Other oil and gas groups including Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy, two of the larger US independent producers, face proposals to break the link between executive pay and the growth in their reserves.Environmental campaigners seeking to highlight the potential impact of climate change on investors have been making increasing use of shareholder proposals at oil and gas companies’ annual meetings — even though they often win very little support.A record 94 proposals relating to climate change have been filed with US companies this year, according to As You Sow, a campaign group.Companies can prevent shareholder proposals from coming to a vote if they secure approval from the US Securities and Exchanges Commission. But, in recent years, the regulator’s staff have become increasingly unwilling to grant those approvals, known as “no action letters”, for climate-related proposals.This year, the SEC has rejected 11 attempts by companies to keep those resolutions from coming to a vote, and accepted just six, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute.“There has been a convergence of views on the SEC staff that climate is a significant policy issue,” said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, the law firm.“So, increasingly, managements have been unable to exclude climate-related shareholder proposals on the grounds that they relate to the ordinary business operations of the company.”There has been a convergence of views on the SEC staff that climate is a significant policy issueShanna Cleveland of Ceres, another group that works with investors on environmental and social issues, said that since the Paris accord “the SEC is having to take more seriously investors’ interest in climate risk”.The SEC does not provide a detailed statement of its grounds for accepting or rejecting requests for no action letters.However, one piece of evidence that its staff’s views are shifting is that this year it insisted that Exxon should allow shareholders to vote on the proposal that it should allow higher dividends and buybacks.As Exxon’s lawyers pointed out in correspondence with the SEC, it was allowed to exclude what was substantially the same proposal last year.A similar resolution was put to a vote at Chevron last year, and won support from investors speaking for just 3.2 per cent of Chevron’s shares.
7;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-02-25T19:22:39Z;Oil sector aims for profits at $50 crude;Industry hopes cost-cutting will generate returns with prices set to stay low;Outside the energy industry’s premier conference in Houston this week, a qualified petroleum engineer, immaculately dressed in suit and tie, has been holding up a sign saying: “Please hire me!”He has been a victim of the sector’s worst downturn for three decades, one of the 95,000 people who have lost their jobs in the US oil industry since 2014. The odds are against him. Oil companies are working to put in place lower cost bases that will enable them to survive in a world in which crude prices could remain at about $50 per barrel for many years to come. Two years ago John Watson, chief executive of Chevron, observed that “$100 per barrel is becoming the new $20”. He meant that the cost of finding and extracting oil had risen so much that companies like his needed a markedly higher crude price to achieve the same profitability that had been possible at significantly lower levels a decade earlier. Today, it seems that $50 is the new $100. As Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, warned executives at the IHS CERAWeek conference on Tuesday, producers of higher-cost barrels “must find a way to lower their costs, borrow cash, or liquidate”. Oil is a cyclical business, and there is a general consensus in the industry that current prices of about $34 per barrel for internationally traded Brent crude are unsustainably low. But oil executives are not expecting a rebound to anything close to the prices of $100-plus that seemed barely adequate only two years ago. The US shale oil industry, which helped precipitate the collapse in oil prices with a debt-fuelled production boom, is in dire financial straits. Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, the two largest producers in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, one of the heartlands of that boom, said this week they were stopping bringing any new wells into production in the region. When prices do pick up again, however, industry executives say activity will recover and production can start to rise again. It may take time to come back, depending on investors’ enthusiasm for committing fresh capital, but shale could act as a long-term cap on prices. David Hager, chief executive of Devon Energy, an independent production company, says that at $55 to $60 oil, “the vast majority” of US shale fields are economically viable. Others put the number rather higher. Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, another leading independent, suggests oil would need to be $60 to $70 for US shale production to grow. No one, however, is talking about $90 or $100. Everyone in the industry is going to have to learn to compete at prices influenced by US shale. And given the uncertainties involved — the US shale business is so new, it has still not yet been through one full cycle of growth, downturn and recovery — it makes sense to take a cautious view of how far prices can rebound. As Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, puts it, the upturn will come, “it’s just you can’t bet on it coming quickly . . . You’ve got to be prepared for it taking a little while longer”. At BP, they are preparing for the company to be able to cover its capital spending and its dividend payments from its cash flows with oil at about $50. Last year, BP said it was aiming for that break-even at $60 oil, but Lamar McKay, the newly-promoted deputy chief executive, says executives believe they can “probably do a bit better than that”. Some of BP’s cost reductions come from driving down the prices charged by suppliers, but about a half to two-thirds, says Mr McKay, come from “self-help”: efficiency improvements including job cuts. BP has announced it is losing 7,000 jobs, and Mr McKay says that he expects to go “quite a bit beyond that” by the end of the year.BP’s proposed Mad Dog 2 oil project in the Gulf of Mexico has been redesigned, for example, to make it less expensive, and now the company is haggling with suppliers to make the economics work before it commits to the investment. Other companies are making similar moves. Bespoke engineering, customisation and bureaucratic management structures are being jettisoned, to be replaced by standardised designs and leaner organisations. Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, is aiming to cut the price needed for its US shale oil operations to break even from $90 per barrel in 2014 to $50 in 2018.“It’s a revolution in a company like ours,” says Torgrim Reitan, Statoil’s head of development and production in the US. “To set up the right agility and accountability so that we can move quickly.” Marvin Odum, the head of Royal Dutch Shell’s US business who announced his departure this week, says the company has a similar approach for its North American shale oil and gas operations.“The cost structure is coming down in a very sustainable way,” he adds. “As we get down into the low 50s and now into the 40s in terms of the break-evens . . . in the sweet spots [shale is] a globally competitive resource.” The industry has been here before, not too long ago. In late 2008 and early 2009, oil prices were also in the low $30s, and there was talk about a reset of the oil companies’ cost bases and ways of working. But then oil rapidly rebounded. “I barely remember it,” says Mr McKay. “The fundamental change that’s necessary in the behaviour of vast numbers of people — operators and contractors alike — didn’t have time to take root . . . It sobered everyone up for a moment, and then the party started again.” He thinks those same mistakes may not be made again.“This feels more fundamental,” says Mr McKay. “The surprise of 5m barrels per day of US shale, and the speed with which that was brought on: that’s a fundamental supply and demand issue that’s got to be worked out.”

The principal factor behind the loss for 2015 was an $18.2bn pre-tax writedown of Chesapeake’s assets, to reflect those lower prices.The company’s operating cash flow dropped 56 per cent to $2.3bn last year.That cash generation fell short of Chesapeake’s capital spending of $3.2bn in 2015, raising concerns about the sustainability of its finances.Chesapeake’s shares have dropped 86 per cent in the past year.But Chesapeake on Wednesday played down suggestions that it was exploring a possible bankruptcy, saying that it was working on debt exchanges and other moves to reduce its borrowings, and had hired specialist lawyers to advise on that.The results were received positively by the markets, with Chesapeake’s shares rising nearly 23 per cent to $2.69 by the close of trading in New York.However, Jonathan Wolff, analyst at Jefferies, said in a note that Chesapeake’s financial distress was “becoming even more clear and more dire”, and described the company’s cash burn as “alarming”.Chesapeake’s move to cut its capital spending follows other US independent exploration and production companies such as ConocoPhillips, Continental Resources and Devon Energy, which are planning similarly steep reductions in their budgets.The cuts raise the prospect that the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US, which has already slumped since 2014, will fall further this year.Chesapeake said the slowdown in drilling would lead to its production falling by up to 5 per cent this year, excluding the effect of asset sales.Chesapeake said it had a $4bn borrowing facility of which only $77m had been used. It added it expected that credit line would be renewed at a “really strong” level when it was determined with lenders in April.The company added that it planned to repay bonds that reach maturity next month. It would also continue moves it has been making to buy back its debt, taking advantage of the depressed prices of its bonds.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.
11;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2016-01-20T22:51:14Z;Energy stocks follow sliding oil price;Big banks hurt by concerns over Fed’s rate rise timing;The energy sector fell further on Wednesday as US crude oil prices slid to their lowest level since September 2003.The S&P 500 energy sector dropped 2.9 per cent, far deeper than the 1.2 per cent drop for the broad S&P 500 index. The decline brought the sector’s 2016 loss to more than 14 per cent.Among the biggest decliners in the sector were oil exploration and production companies. Devon Energy tumbled 8.05 per cent to $21.59, while Murphy Oil lost 3.11 per cent to $15.87. Williams Companies, a large energy infrastructure company, dropped 6.4 per cent to $14.77, but eased by the close to finish 1.84 per cent down at $15.49. Chevron, one of the biggest US energy companies, fell 3.10 per cent to $78.98.Materials companies also struggled. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, fell as much as 10.1 per cent to $3.59 a share — the lowest level in more than 15 years — but bounced back to close up 2.78 per cent at $4.07.Many large banks performed poorly on Wednesday amid growing concerns that global financial market turmoil could cause the US Federal Reserve to slow its plans for raising interest rates further this year. Banks favour higher rates since it boosts the return they can generate on loans.JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, fell 2.63 per cent to $55.51, Bank of America lost 3.86 per cent to $13.69 and Citigroup declined 3.46 per cent to $40.49.Twitter, the social media company, was another notable decliner at one stage, but its shares rebounded to close 4.13 per cent up at $17.38.The stock is trading well below its $26 initial public offering price from November 2013, and at a fraction of its lifetime high of $74.73 struck that year.Shares in Square, a mobile-payments company run by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, recovered their losses to close up 0.21 per cent at $9.49.IBM also faced heavy selling after the technology company issued a downbeat profit outlook for 2016. It has struggled to offset declines in its legacy computing units as it shifts into the era of cloud computing. Its shares closed down 4.88 per cent at $121.86.Netflix, one of 2015’s high-fliers, came under pressure after the video streaming site posted disappointing US subscriber growth figures in its quarterly results released after the closing bell on Tuesday. The shares rallied by the close to finish down 0.14 per cent to $107.74.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,859.48, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed about 1.5 per cent to 15,769.86 and the Nasdaq Composite nudged down to 4,471.12.
12;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2015-10-01T17:34:05Z;EOG Resources climbs on energy comeback;Big gainers are companies betting on America’s shale oil boom;After suffering in the past quarter, it was not all bad news for the energy sector as the fourth quarter began. Among Thursday’s big gainers were companies that have bet on America’s shale oil boom.EOG Resources, one of the biggest names in the industry, saw its shares climb as much as 4 per cent, helping bring down its year-to-date fall to 20 per cent by markets close.Smaller names rode the wave higher as shares in Apache advanced 1.4 per cent to $39.72 while those in Devon Energy rose 1.8 per cent to $37.75.The S&P 500 energy sector remained static in choppy trading on Thursday, slightly outperforming the broader stock market. That represents a sharp change in sentiment from the third quarter, where the sector shed more than 18 per cent.An early rally in crude oil futures helped propel the gains after the price of crude fell more than 20 per cent last quarter. US crude oil rallied as much as 3 per cent before pulling back gains to a 0.8 per cent loss.Energy majors, which have more diversified operations, benefited, but enthusiasm soon faded. ExxonMobil and Chevron, both blue-chip companies, zigzagged between gains and losses and settled 0.4 and 0.6 per cent lower at $74.05 and $78.40 respectively by close.The rally comes just a day after the US Department of Energy said American crude oil supplies jumped by some 4m barrels last week.Stocks remain at the most elevated level for this time of year in at least 80 years. Adding to potential headwinds for the sector, Morgan Stanley said this week it expected technological advancements would help companies continue making money at lower prices, meaning supplies could remain elevated for some time.General Motors climbed 2.2 per cent to $30.67 after it reported a 12 per cent increase in September auto sales. That considerably exceeded estimates of an 9.3 per cent sales jump.Apple dipped 0.7 per cent to $109.58. The decline came after DigiTimes, a tech-industry newspaper, cited unnamed sources as saying the world’s biggest technology company had trimmed smartphone chip orders for the fourth quarter.That comes just days after Apple said it sold 13m of the latest iPhones within three days of their launch.Separately, Apple said on Thursday that James Bell, a former chief financial officer at Boeing, was elected to join the firm’s board.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Twitter tumbled 8.4 per cent to $24.67.Traders digested a report that Jack Dorsey, its co-founder who has been serving as interim chief executive, would be permanently placed in the top spot. Mr Dorsey also leads Square, a mobile payment provider.The report said he would remain in both posts — which would represent an about-face by Twitter, which previously said it was only interested in a chief who was committed to the company full time.The utilities sector was the biggest laggard — a turnround from the third quarter where it was the only big sector to post a gain.Utilities are preferred for their dividends and frequently utilised by investors who wish to take a defensive stance. With many investment banks calling for gains in the final quarter of the year, traders may be positioning for a more bullish market environment.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,923.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 16,272.01 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 4,627.08.
13;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2015-03-05T20:25:08Z;Buoyant ExxonMobil bucks sector’s gloom;World’s largest energy group uses downturn to put itself in a stronger position than its rivals;"Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is showing every sign of being that rare individual: an oil executive who is happy about low crude prices.His cheerful demeanour at the company’s presentation to analysts in New York on Wednesday contrasted with the grim mood of much of the industry following the 50 per cent fall in oil since last summer.With US production resilient in spite of the price collapse, and global demand growth anaemic, the market was unlikely to recover any time soon, Mr Tillerson suggested. Jack Williams, senior vice-president in charge of production operations, said that when Exxon looked at possible investments in US shale, it concentrated on scenarios with oil prices of $40 to $60 per barrel: close to today’s $52.Like other oil producers, Exxon is taking a hit to its profits. Its earnings per share this year are forecast to be about half the $7.60 it made in 2014.Unlike many other producers, though, Exxon, the world’s largest energy group, is not at any risk of going bust or being taken over. It can use the downturn to put itself in a stronger position relative to competitors.The company’s resilience was on display on Tuesday, when it raised $8bn from a bond issue, increased from the $7bn originally marketed because of strong demand. The company is one of only three US groups with a triple A credit rating — higher than that of the federal government — and it can borrow very cheaply.It also went into the downturn with stronger cash generation than most rivals. Free cash flow came to $17.9bn in 2014, compared with Chevron’s $2.6bn, which included $5.7bn of disposal proceeds.As a result, Exxon is under much less pressure to cut spending than smaller exploration and production companies, which are coming under varying degrees of financial strain. Although Mr Tillerson likes to say that Exxon invests “through the cycle”, it does not entirely ignore market fluctuations. Capital spending is being cut by 12 per cent for 2015 compared with last year’s level, and Mr Tillerson acknowledged the company would be “tactically resequencing” some of its investment plans.However, the company has retained its target from last year of producing 4.3m barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017.Exxon’s display of stability is striking when set alongside the 30 to 40 per cent capital spending reductions generally announced by small and midsized exploration and production companies.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingBeing able to keep spending at rates that others cannot, as Mr Tillerson put it, “provides us a whole lot of different kinds of opportunities” in two main areas: cutting costs and acquiring assets.On costs, Exxon’s executives expect to be able to pay less for drilling rigs and other oilfield services, and also for materials such as steel. Oil prices above $100 per barrel increased activity and stoked cost inflation, squeezing the industry’s returns. Now that process is starting to go into reverse.“The organisation is only now beginning I think to test that broadly in terms of what are we going to be able to capture,” Mr Tillerson said. While some might be one-off savings, he added, and not available in a year’s time, it might also be possible to embed some cost reductions for longer periods.On acquisitions, Exxon’s possibilities are almost limitless, and potential sellers are already getting in touch. Valuations look more attractive to a buyer now than they did a year ago. Mr Tillerson’s comment that “there really is no limitation on what we might be interested in or considering” in terms of possible deals suggests he is prepared to be ambitious. He also talked about wanting to keep financial capacity in reserve for when the right opportunity came along.While a bid for BP is not impossible, most analysts think it unlikely because of the political sensitivities of such a deal and uncertainty about the UK group’s liabilities stemming from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research in a note on Wednesday suggested Exxon would be most interested in a US-focused midsized oil company, and identified what he called “key potential targets” including Hess, Continental Resources, Devon Energy, Apache and Anadarko Petroleum.Timing will be a concern. Exxon agreed to pay $41bn including debt for shale gas and oil producer XTO Energy in 2009, at a time when gas prices were roughly double what they are today, and Mr Tillerson will not want to make the same mistake twice. But a deal at the right price would be a way to boost growth, which has been a problem for Exxon for more than a decade. The longer oil prices stay low, the more inclined sellers will be to compromise on valuations.Mr Tillerson advised the world to “settle in” for a period of low oil prices. The relaxed image suggests it is a prospect that he is looking forward to."
14;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-12-09T18:08:39Z;US shale industry faces endurance test after Opec rejects cuts;Cartel’s refusal to cut oil output turns screw on US crude producers;"When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US’s largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo’s chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionWhile all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company’s assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMore than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you’re underperforming your peers, and you’re not in the core of the play, it’s not going to be so good for you”.The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it’s not important right now’,” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stayWhen Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn’t start going down.”"
15;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-11-12T12:18:20Z;US shale pioneers circle the wagons;Price war in oil market forces shale industry to reassess positions;"If there is “price war” in the oil market, as Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq’s oil minister, has suggested, the US shale industry is refusing to take flight at the first sound of gunfire.As the International Energy Agency, the watchdog backed by developed economies, said on Wednesday, the fall in oil prices by more than 25 per cent since June is set to cause a cut in investment by US shale companies.Some that have not yet decided their 2015 capital spending budgets have said that they are reassessing their drilling programmes. A few that had already set out spending plans have in the past couple of weeks announced cuts. So far, though, they look like tactical withdrawals to concentrate their efforts where they will be most effective, rather than admissions of defeat.Activity is already starting to slow. There were 1,568 rigs drilling for oil onshore in the US last week, 41 fewer than in mid-October, according to Baker Hughes, the oil services group.That figure is likely to fall further over the coming months. Halcon Resources, which operates in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Bakken of North Dakota, said on Monday it planned to run just six rigs next year, compared with the eight it is running now and the 11 it had previously planned for 2015. Other leading shale oil companies have announced reductions in their capital spending plans: Continental Resources cut its 2015 budget from $5.2bn to $4.6bn; Rosetta Resources said it would spend about $950m next year, down from $1.2bn in 2014; and ConocoPhillips said it planned to spend less next year than the $16bn it is spending this year.Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, has made a bet that the recent pullback in oil prices will be shortlivedSee belowOther companies have suggested they are likely to follow suit. EOG Resources, one of the most successful shale oil producers, said at the time of its third-quarter results last week that it planned to ensure that its capital spending plus its dividend payments were in line with the cash flow it has coming in, and that would probably mean reduced activity in some areas.The pressure on shale producers is not so much profitability as liquidity. William Thomas, chief executive of EOG, said last week that even if oil fell to $40 the company could still earn a 10 per cent return in some areas, including the Bakken and the Eagle Ford shales.Pearce Hammond, an analyst at Simmons & Co, says that rate of return calculation is less important than another critical question: “How much cash do you have going out the door to drill the wells, and how much do you have coming in?”Debt has fuelled the shale boom, as producers outspent their cash flows and needed to borrow to fund investment. As prices fall, the companies that borrowed too much will find themselves under strain.The bond markets have already started to reflect some nervousness, with yields on junk bonds in the energy sector rising to their highest level in more than a year.Sean Sexton, an energy specialist at Fitch, the rating agency, says that last year he was surprised by how investors’ enthusiasm for oil companies’ debt was such that even low-rated companies were able to borrow at rates below 6 per cent. Now that discrepancy appears to be being corrected.Nevertheless, although oil prices at present levels of about $75-$80 for US crude will put pressure on some marginal companies, others should be fine, even if they still need to borrow to fund their drilling, Mr Sexton says.“They may have to pay a bit more in interest costs, but it’s not like they’re not going to be able to go to the market and raise money.”Pioneer Natural Resources, another shale oil producer, showed last week that the equity market was still open as a source of funds, announcing a planned share sale to raise $1bn to help finance its investment plans.While the debt and equity markets remain supportive, shale drilling activity is likely to ease off rather than collapse.Although they may be drilling less than they had expected, oil companies will also be focusing on maximising the production from the rigs they are using.John Richels, chief executive of Devon Energy, told analysts on a call last week that the company expected to cut the number of rigs it had running in the Mississippian region of northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, described as an “emerging” business, and to shift them to more productive areas.Companies are also constantly pushing to use their rigs and other equipment more efficiently.Hess, one of the leaders in the Bakken shale, said in a rare presentation to analysts on Monday that it had cut the cost of each well there to $7.2m in the third quarter, down from $9.5m two years ago.Chesapeake Energy, founded by shale entrepreneur Aubrey McClendon but under new management since last year, said last week that it had cut its capital spending by 60 per cent from $14.2bn in 2012 to an expected $5.7bn this year, but had still increased production from its continuing businesses by 12 per cent in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the equivalent period of 2013.It is this sort of improvement that encourages shale producers to continue to project growth in output.Devon is talking about 20-25 per cent growth in its oil production next year, with capital spending about the same as this year, while EOG is projecting “double-digit” growth to 2017, if US crude stays at about $80. Continental is projecting growth of 23-29 per cent in its output next year, and Pioneer expects 16-20 per cent each year to 2016.These growth rates are based on annual averages, and these companies have been growing rapidly during 2014, so the comparisons with the end of this year will be less impressive.The companies’ predictions will not necessarily be fulfilled; it is important for them to show their investors they are still growing, so they have a temptation to err on the side of optimism. The IEA expects the impact of falling investment to show up not immediately, but in a decline in production in the “medium term”.Still, if the statements of the shale industry’s leaders are even broadly accurate, it looks as though oil prices may have to go significantly lower before US oil production starts to fall.Gambling with house moneyAs the oil price has been falling, many US shale executives have emphasised that they have a safety net in hedging strategies using futures and options that will protect their revenues against further falls in the crude price for the next year or two. Not Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources.He has decided to do without a net, announcing last week that the company had sold all of its hedges, for this year, 2015 and 2016, to raise $433m. If the oil price does fall further, Continental will face the full brunt of it.As Mr Hamm, who is the founder of one of Continental’s ancestor companies, owns about 68 per cent of the shares, he is taking a gamble principally with his own money.He is also betting the way he always has. He has long argued that any significant drop in oil prices could not last for long, and on a call with analysts last week he repeated the company’s “belief that the recent pullback in oil prices will be shortlived.”He added: “We feel like we're at the bottom rung here on prices, and we'll see them recover pretty drastically, pretty quick.”Like many in the US oil industry, Mr Hamm sees the long-term trends, with demand rising as hundreds of millions of people in emerging economies raise their standard of living, and constraints on supply in many parts of the world, especially the Middle East, and concludes that crude prices are likely to head higher.A couple of years of weaker prices, with slower production growth from shale companies, could be a good thing to allow global demand to “catch up” with the supply boom in the US, he said.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionHowever, the oil market is always tricky to predict, and has recently become more volatile after years of relative stability.Mr Hamm this week had some good news on his divorce settlement for his ex-wife Sue Ann, which was set by an Oklahoma court at $973m; significantly less than the multiple billions that some had expected, and about 7 per cent of his net worth.His decision on hedging could end up having a much more significant effect on his fortune."
16;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-11-11T00:38:52Z;Continental Resources chief ordered to pay ex-wife $973m in divorce;Continental Resources chief to pay 7% of $14bn net worth in settlement, a court in Oklahoma ruled;Harold Hamm, one of the most successful billionaires to have made a fortune from the US shale boom, must pay his ex-wife about $973m in a divorce settlement, or about 7 per cent of his estimated $14bn net worth, an Oklahoma court has ruled.The decision came as a relief to investors concerned that the divorce might force Mr Hamm, chief executive, to sell a large proportion of his 68 per cent stake in Continental Resources, one of the leading US shale oil producers.The marital property alimony award to Sue Ann Hamm, who Mr Hamm married in 1988, is one of the largest divorce settlements on record, but is less than some had expected, and will involve a lien being held on just 20m Continental shares, or about 8 per cent of Mr Hamm’s stake.Ms Hamm filed for divorce in May 2012, but there has since been a drawn-out legal battle over the division of assets. There was speculation when the divorce was announced that Mr Hamm might have to hand over half his fortune.Continental said in a statement: “This private matter has not, and will not have any impact or effect on the Company’s business or operations”, adding that it was subpoenaed and required to respond to subpoenas, “and we objected to many of them”.The decision is subject to appeal.Judge Howard Haralson at the Oklahoma County district court said in an 80-page ruling that in reaching his decision on the division of the couple’s assets, he had taken into account factors such as “the parties’ connection to and use of the property,” and “the parties’ efforts in acquiring the property”.Indications of Mr Hamm’s eminence in the industry and his political ties – he was a supporter of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 – were provided by the witnesses who gave evidence at the trial, including Larry Nichols, co-founder of Devon Energy, the first company to have significant success with shale production, and Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School and a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President George W Bush.Many of the documents submitted in evidence in the case have been sealed, but the judge’s ruling gives some insight into Continental’s history.Ms Hamm, a lawyer, joined the company in 1989 and worked there off and on for another two decades, including for a period as head of crude oil marketing. The judge’s ruling noted that there was no evidence of her owning any assets when she married Mr Hamm, or of her acquiring any separate property during the marriage.The judge said Mr Hamm should pay Ms Hamm, who is reverting to her previous name of Sue Ann Arnall, $323m by the end of the year and a further $650m in $7m monthly instalments.She is also taking possession of the couple’s marital home on the outskirts of Oklahoma City, valued at $4.7m, and a ranch in California valued at $17.5m.Mr Hamm took two horses from the ranch, called Star and Uno, and also secured some guns, books and pictures from the marital home that he had requested “in the last minutes of the trial,” according to the judge’s ruling.However, the judge refused to grant him a geode rock with quartz crystals that he had requested but Ms Hamm also wanted.

18;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-10-14T12:46:22Z;Falling oil price raises questions on viability of shale;Energy companies struggle to generate sufficient cash to cover their capital spending;Plunging share prices for US oil and gas companies in recent days have highlighted a potentially decisive factor in the looming crude price war: investor confidence.On Monday, shares in Goodrich Petroleum, a small oil and gas producer, fell 30 per cent, making it the day’s most spectacular casualty, but much larger companies were hit too. Continental Resources was off 5.1 per cent, Hess off 5.8 per cent and EOG Resources off 6.8 per cent. Most of them recovered a little on Tuesday morning, and Goodrich was up more than 7 per cent, but all were below the levels at which they had started the week.After three years of what was described by Christof Rühl, former chief economist of BP, as an “ eerie calm” in the oil market, volatility is back.Saudi Arabia’s apparent willingness to let crude prices fall to damage its competitors will test the capital markets’ support for US producers. It is shaping up to be the North American industry’s toughest examination since the shale revolution started to revive US oil production in 2009.Bob McNally, a former White House official and now head of Rapidan Group, a Washington-based consultancy, argues that rather than reining in production to support oil prices at about $100 per barrel, Saudi Arabia can easily afford to let them drop for a while.A rough calculation indicates Saudi Arabia would lose only a fraction – between $10bn and $20bn – of its nearly $750bn in foreign exchange reserves were it to let oil prices fall to $80 per barrel for a year, he says.“When it’s needed, the Saudis are not going to be the ones that cut production,” adds Mr McNally.“Recent comments by Saudi officials imply that if anyone has to cut, it has to be the Americans.”With internationally traded Brent crude at below $88 a barrel – a four-year low – and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate at below $85, down from over $107 in June, most US shale production is still profitable, analysts say.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, estimates the majority of US shale production will break even at $75. The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday steeper drops in the price of oil are needed for US shale and other unconventional energy production to take a meaningful hit.If prices continue to fall, however, the pressure on the industry will grow. The smaller and midsized oil and gas companies that led the shale revolution have been running at a cash flow deficit for years. Capital spending has exceeded companies’ operating cash flows.The steep decline in production from shale wells – it can drop 60 per cent or more in the first year – means that companies have to keep drilling merely to maintain their output, let alone increase it.If the funds for drilling dry up, then production will fall quickly and the US oil boom will go bust.As recently as August, analysts were forecasting that next year the leading US shale oil and gas producers would, as a group, be covering their capital spending from operating cash flows. Now that prospect is receding.Many producers use derivatives to shield them from the risk of falling prices. Pioneer Natural Resources, for example, reported in August that it had bought options to sell in 2016 54,000 barrels of oil a day – about 65 per cent of its oil production in 2014 – with an average floor price of $85.83 per barrel.Philip Verleger, an energy economist, argues the use of futures and swaps made the US shale boom possible, because the smaller companies that led the revolution were able to secure financing only because they had hedged themselves against commodity price risk.Selling oil at those floors would still mean lower revenues than the prices prevailing earlier this year, though, and the companies are not hedged forever. If prices keep falling for longer than a year, then the pain will worsen.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionIf oil had stayed at $100 per barrel, all of the main shale producers would have been able to cover capital spending from cash flow within two or three years, according to Phani Gadde, analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Below $90, between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of these producers will still be outspending their cash flows.The years of cash deficits have piled up the industry’s debts. High-yield bonds issued by energy companies rated at B- or lower total $75bn, up from just $16bn in 2009, according to Fitch, the rating agency.To be able to continue drilling, US shale companies will have to be able to convince investors that it is worth committing more debt and equity capital to the industry.Mr Verleger believes the economics of US shale will continue to look relatively attractive. The producers that are more at risk, he argues, will be some members of Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, such as Venezuela, and the oil sands of western Canada.Statoil, the Norwegian state-controlled energy company, said last month it was putting an oil sands project in Canada on hold for at least three years because rising costs had made its economics look unattractive, especially given limited pipeline capacity for transporting the oil out of the region.If lower prices now stop some future production in Canada and possibly other countries including the US, that could lead to higher prices in the long term, and for Saudi Arabia any short-term pain it may suffer now would be worthwhile.However, Paul Sankey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, cautions that it is hard to calibrate the effect of these price moves precisely. If too much production is knocked out and demand continues to grow, the oil market could tighten again quickly, he says.“The risk for the Saudis is that they overdo it, and end up with $150 oil on the other side.”
19;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-09-29T16:29:34Z;Sumitomo’s US shale oil foray turns sour;Writedowns associated with Texas project nearly wipe out year’s earnings;Sumitomo Corp of Japan has drawn a line under its disastrous two-year foray into shale oil in the US, with writedowns connected to the project almost completely erasing its full-year earnings.On Monday, Sumitomo, the fourth biggest of Japan’s trading companies by market capitalisation, said that an impairment loss of Y170bn ($1.6bn) on a “tight oil” project in west Texas would form the bulk of Y240bn of charges for the fiscal year to March 2015.It also flagged a Y30bn charge on coal-mining assets in Australia and a Y50bn impairment on an iron-ore mining project in Brazil.Combined, Sumitomo said the losses would cut its full-year profit forecast by 96 per cent, from a projected Y250bn to Y10bn. That would mark the 95-year-old company’s worst result since a Y23bn loss in the 1998 fiscal year, when it paid fines to atone for a copper-trading scandal that rocked world markets two years earlier.“Even by the standards of trading companies, this is not good,” said Ben Wedmore, co-head of Japan equities at Mirabaud Securities, part of a Geneva-based private bank, drawing parallels to Mitsui & Co’s costly exposure to BP’s blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. “This was [Sumitomo’s] biggest investment in oil by far, and it has gone wrong.”Sumitomo was among the most aggressive in ramping up investments in resources in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident of March 2011, which spurred imports of oil, coal and liquefied natural gas into the world’s third-largest economy.In August 2012, the company announced that it had struck a deal with Devon Energy of Oklahoma to pay $340m in cash for 30 per cent of a project in the Permian Basin, saying it would supply another $1bn to fund most of the cost of drilling wells.Tight oil involves the extraction of crude oil from rock formations using similar technologies as in shale gas extraction.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionYet on Monday, Sumitomo said it had decided to sell roughly three-quarters of its acreage, triggering the loss on the assets and the agreement to fund their development. “It is difficult to extract the oil and gas efficiently,” the company said, adding that it could not “expect as much production to recover the investment”.Other Japanese trading companies have taken big writedowns as shale bets have soured. Itochu Corp, the third largest trader by market capitalisation, has written down about four-fifths of the Y78bn it paid in 2011 for a 25 per cent stake in family-owned Samson Investment of the US.Separately, Sumitomo said on Monday that it would stop operations at its Isaac Plains coking-coal mine in Queensland, Australia, by the end of January, as prices languish amid a global glut.Sumitomo had flagged trouble with the Bowen Basin-based project – a joint venture with Vale, the Brazilian miner – in May, as it took a Y28bn writedown on an asset for which it had paid A$430m two years earlier.Sumitomo’s management and monitoring of risks “is not necessarily working well”, said R&I, the Japanese credit rating agency, as it cut its outlook on the company, rated double A minus, to negative from stable.Sumitomo is due to announce its first-half results on October 31.
20;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-07-02T17:32:06Z;US oil and gas explorers impress;;While international exploration and production companies have been underperforming in recent years, some of their US counterparts have been impressive.There have been good returns for some investors in the US E&P sector, but they had to be in the right companies at the right time.The US shale revolution has been a story of technological progress, and as in any such period of rapid advance, it made a big difference whether or not you had the right technology as well as market position, including the right access to resources through lease agreements.It was the smaller and midsized independent E&P companies such as Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy that pioneered the first shale gas boom, and similar entrepreneurial companies such as EOG Resources and Continental Resources that led the subsequent opening up of shale oil.As is often the case, however, the standard-bearers of the revolution were not always the ones that benefited most. By creating additional supply, the shale boom knocked away the support under North American natural gas prices, hurting the profitability of companies that made most of their income from selling gas.Chesapeake, for example, embarked on rapid debt-fuelled expansion under Aubrey McClendon, its chief executive until last year. Since then, his successor Doug Lawler has been working to clear up the mess. The shares have risen 57 per cent in the past five years, lagging well behind the S&P 500 index, which has more than doubled over the same period, rising 113 per cent.Devon, which has had a less dramatic record, has similarly underperformed the index, its shares rising 47 per cent.However, companies that were less reliant on gas production, and moved more quickly into oil, have done much better. EOG’s shares are up 244 per cent in the past five years – more than double the rise in the S&P 500, while Continental’s are up more than fivefold, rising 470 per cent. Among the gas specialists, the lowest-cost operators of the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania are among the best performers, including Cabot Oil & Gas, up 347 per cent in five years, and Range Resources, which is only up 110 per cent, in line with the wider market, but has still outpaced several of its peers.The outlook depends largely on what happens to the oil price. If turmoil in the Middle East and other regions continues to keep oil prices high, then the US oil-producing E&P sector will continue to thrive. If the price drops sharply – because of an abrupt slowdown in demand in China, say – then the US industry will be in for a rough ride. Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental, has warned that at $70 per barrel much of the present US shale oil industry would not be economically viable.
21;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2014-05-07T14:00:49Z;Rising gas prices lift shale producers;;Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy, two of the largest US shale gas and oil producers, reported sharp increases in profits thanks to the surge in North American gas prices this year.The companies also benefited from shifting their operations towards more lucrative production of oil and natural gas liquids such as propane.At Chesapeake, which is the second-largest gas producer in the US, earnings were significantly higher than analysts had expected, with underlying net income more than doubling to $405m in the first quarter, up from $183m in the equivalent period of 2013. The underlying income excludes items such as changes in the value of derivatives contracts and unrealised investment gains and losses.Earnings per share on that basis were 59 cents, almost double the 30 cents reported for the first quarter of 2013, and well ahead of the average of analysts’ forecasts, which was 48 cents.The crucial factor in that performance was a jump in the price at which Chesapeake sold its gas, from $2.13 per million British thermal units in the first quarter of 2013 to $3.27 per m BTU in the equivalent period of this year. The cold weather sent gas prices soaring, especially in the north-eastern US, and Chesapeake had space booked on pipelines to enable it to serve some of the most profitable markets, including New York.The company has also lifted its crude oil production by 6 per cent over the year to 109,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, and its natural gas liquids production by 55 per cent to 84,000 b/d.The benefit of increased production of those higher-margin sales was offset by a fall in the price at which Chesapeake sold its oil, which dropped almost $10 per barrel to $85.08. However, the company has also been cutting its costs, reducing its production expenses 8 per cent to $4.73 per barrel of oil equivalent.Doug Lawler, Chesapeake’s chief executive who took over last year after his predecessor Aubrey McClendon left following a clash with the board, described it as a “defining quarter” for the company, showing “tangible improvements in the company’s growth profile and financial performance”.At Devon, underlying earnings also more than doubled, rising 103 per cent to $547m in the first quarter, ahead of expectations. Devon similarly benefited from a 54 per cent increase in the price of its gas sales to $4.33 per m BTU. It was also boosted by rising oil output, which accounted for more than half of its revenues from production in the quarter.Devon has a disposal programme under way, but oil production from the fields it is retaining rose 21 per cent to 176,000 b/d, led by growth in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Permian basin of west Texas.

In a surprise move this week, Brazil announced that Saab’s Gripen would become its next fighter jet, sending the Swedish company’s shares nearly 30 per cent higher and the company’s bigger French and US rivals home empty-handed, writes Carola Hoyos.The $4.5bn contract to supply 36 fighter jets is the biggest export contract that Saab has ever won and extends its fighter jet production life to 2023.Gripen beat France’s Rafale, built by Dassault, and the F/A-18 Super Hornet built by Boeing of the US.Successive French presidents lobbied Brazil over 15 years to buy the Rafale. The jet fighter was long viewed as favoured over the Gripen. Boeing was also believed to be ahead of its Swedish rival until revelations that the NSA had spied on Brazil’s leaders soured relations and dashed its chances, according to analysts and people close to the deal.But one person close to the deal said the Brazilian Air Force had “always wanted Gripen”.Many who had followed the contest since 1998 had expected Brazil to delay the purchase for another two years because of the slowdown of the nation’s economy.But its Mirage fighter jets were getting so old and expensive to maintain that they needed to be grounded, prompting the decision.Gripen helped seal the deal with its lower price tag and willingness to transfer technology to Brazil and allow much of the fighter to be built there.BP in $1.1bn Brazil writedown
BP has announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar deals and has said it made a “significant” discovery in the US Gulf of Mexico. But the good news was offset by a $1.1bn writedown following poor results from a well off the coast of Brazil, writes Guy Chazan.Also this week, a former BP engineer became the first person from the company to be convicted for an offence related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.A jury in a US federal court in New Orleans found Kurt Mix guilty on one count of obstruction of justice, based on his deletion of a text exchange with his BP supervisor regarding the flow-rate from the stricken Gulf of Mexico well. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.The first big deal BP announced this week was a $16bn agreement with Oman to develop a huge “tight” gasfield, Khazzan.Also last week, a BP-led consortium fired the starting gun on a $28bn gas development in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea, known as Shah Deniz 2. The gas will be brought into the heart of Europe through pipelines stretching across Turkey and Greece into Italy.Meanwhile, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, BP said it had made a “significant” oil discovery in its Gila prospect.But a well drilled off Brazil – Pitanga – turned out to be a duster. As a result, BP said it was relinquishing the block where the well was drilled, which it acquired as part of a $7bn deal with Devon Energy in 2010, and writing off a total of $1.1bn.GSK shakes up sales practices
GlaxoSmithKline this week unveiled plans to scrap individual sales targets for its marketing employees around the world, as part of efforts to remove incentives perceived as encouraging inappropriate prescribing, writes Andrew Jack.The idea, building on a programme already rolled out in the US in 2011, is to link bonuses to broader company-wide financial targets and individual performance of representatives in provide information of value to doctors.No wonder Jeff Bezos wants to build delivery drones. Amazon workers in Germany have gone on strike over higher pay and the right to collective bargaining. Drones won’t want to unionise. Better yet, they won’t mind when Amazon says, as it did of its German workers: “Some have not even properly finished school.”Separately, the UK-based pharmaceutical group aims to scrap payments made to external doctors to give talks on its behalf to their peers, and to stop funding their travel and expenses conferences. AstraZeneca and some other companies have taken similar moves.The moves come as GSK seeks to reform after paying a record $3bn regulatory fine last year in the US, and to conclude a probe over alleged bribery in China.They follow recent legislative efforts in the US and France to increase transparency over the size of payments made by companies to doctors against a backdrop of concerns over the practice. In the US alone last year, 12 companies paid doctors more than $1bn.GSK and other drug companies have also announced voluntary plans to step up disclosure of payments in other countries.Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive, insisted that the reforms were not a response to the situation in China, but reflected a broader shift in society’s attitudes and a reflection of the need to meet doctors’ and healthcare systems’ expectations.Ex-SAC portfolio manager convicted
US prosecutors won their 77th insider trading conviction when a New York jury found a former SAC Capital portfolio manager guilty of trading securities after learning confidential earnings information, writes Kara Scannell.Michael Steinberg, the former portfolio manager and friend to SAC founder Steve Cohen, is the fund’s seventh former employee to be guilty of illegal trades.Mr Cohen, who was sued by securities regulators for failing to supervise his employees, has not been charged with insider trading.

Fans of the shady lawyer Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad will have to turn to the video streaming site for the first look at the upcoming spin-off series Better Call Saul. But there will be no binge viewing – Netflix’s rights only allow it to show each episode internationally immediately after its US broadcast.The conviction bolsters the reputation of Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan who was on the cover of Time magazine as the man busting Wall Street. It also comes as Mr Bharara finds himself in the unusual position of defending his office after criminal charges were filed against an Indian consular officer for allegedly filing false statements to US authorities to gain a visa for her housekeeper.US authorities continue to investigate corruption on Wall Street.Mr Steinberg was convicted of trading in advance of Dell and Nvidia earnings, which made more than $1m in profits for the hedge fund.Next up for prosecutors is Mathew Martoma, a former SAC money manager, who is due to face trial on January 6 on a charge of trading drug company stocks in advance of negative clinical trial results. He has pleaded not guilty.House of Fraser talks to Galeries Lafayette
British retailer House of Fraser is in advanced talks to be acquired by Galeries Lafayette, the French department store chain, the Financial Times revealed this week, writes Andrea Felsted.The family-controlled French retailer is in exclusive talks with House of Fraser, and has exclusivity until the end of January.Don McCarthy, chairman, is looking for a price tag of at least £450m from a sale, according to some people familiar with the situation.The talks come as House of Fraser prepares to float on the London Stock Exchange early next year, in a move that could value the retailer at £350m.House of Fraser is expected to run a dual-track process while the talks with Galeries Lafayette continue. It has hired Rothschild to manage the process, and has been holding a beauty parade for advisers over recent weeks. Appointment of banks to advise on the float is expected shortly.House of Fraser and Galeries Lafayette both declined to comment.A deal with Galeries Lafayette would end House of Fraser’s informal efforts over the past two years to secure a buyer.Mike Ashley, who controls Sports Direct, last year looked at buying a minority stake in House of Fraser, but this came to nothing. House of Fraser has also previously held talks with Qatari investors.However, news of the talks came at a tough time for the department store sector.

23;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2020-04-25T23:30:01+0000;Oil & Gas M&A: empty pipeline;One big, expensive deal does not make a trend;Hope should not spring eternal when it comes to oil and gas deals. A transaction last week – Devon Energy’s $6bn acquisition of high-quality energy assets in the Eagle Ford area of Texas – has sparked hopes of a dealmaking revival. Yet persistently low natural gas prices and years of excessive investment have forced more disciplined capital allocation among onshore-focused energy producers. So despite the pricey terms Devon agreed to in this deal, it is hard to imagine more tie-ups at such valuations being struck in such a conservative climate.One approach to developing energy resources is to bet on exploring in unproven areas and hope that it works out. Devon took the opposite tack in the deal, buying $6bn of mostly oil assets from private equity-backed GeoSouthern Energy. The assets include 83,000 acres in the Eagle Ford shale deposit. Those assets produce just 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but 400m barrels are estimated to be recoverable. And most of that qualifies as proved reserves. Output is to ramp up quickly.As such, Devon’s purchase price is just 2.5 times estimated 2015 operating cash flow. But as certain as the oil beneath the earth may be, it is not cheap to get to it. Credit Suisse estimates that Devon will need $6bn in capital expenditure over six years. The deal boosts Devon’s net asset value by about 5 per cent, about as much as its shares rose after the announcement.Another measure of the high price paid is the value put on the known but undeveloped acreage acquired. Morningstar calculates that the price per acre is $50,000, exceeding previous highs of about $30,000.Apart from the Devon deal, US oil and gas transaction volume has slowed considerably. And while the GeoSouthern terms are not quite the home run that management has depicted, Devon’s bosses have run their business well enough to pull off an aggressive if modestly profitable acquisition.The dearth of other landmark transactions confirms that this is quite an accomplishment.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
24;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2013-11-20T00:09:02Z;Devon nears $6bn deal for GeoSouthern;;Devon Energy is close to buying GeoSouthern Energy in a $6bn deal that will accelerate the US group’s shift away from gas and into more lucrative oil production, according to people familiar with the situation.The purchase of its smaller rival will give Devon, which has a market capitalisation of more than $25bn, significant exposure to the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas, one of the heartlands of the US oil boom of the past four years.Devon operates one of the largest exploration and production businesses in North America, averaging output of 691,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first nine months of the year.GeoSouthern, based near Houston, was the largest privately held US producer of oil and related liquids in the first half of this year, according to IHS data, rising from fourth place last year.It is a leading producer in the Eagle Ford shale, with leases in the region’s most productive areas.The acquisition of GeoSouthern, whose investors include private equity group Blackstone, would mark Devon’s second deal in as many months. In October, it agreed to combine the bulk of its US pipeline and processing assets with those of Crosstex Energy to form a new midstream business.The deal extends Devon’s strategy to cut its reliance on natural gas production, which has been hit by a collapse in prices over the past five years. The company has been reallocating resources away from gas and into oil and natural gas liquids such as ethane, which account for just 40 per cent of the group’s output by energy content but about 60 per cent of its revenues from production.The acquisition could also redeploy some of the $4.3bn in cash that Devon holds, $3.6bn of it offshore, following the sale of its international and Gulf of Mexico businesses in 2010.Devon said in a call with analysts earlier this month that it expected to be able to bring $2bn of that cash into the US at a highly favourable tax rate of just 4 to 6 per cent before the end of the year.Devon’s shares rose 5 per cent to $62.77 after the news emerged of the prospective deal, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Devon and Blackstone refused to comment. GeoSouthern did not respond to requests for comment.
25;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2013-11-06T18:42:50Z;Chesapeake and Devon rein in capital expenditure;;Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy, two of the largest US gas producers, have reported results showing cuts in capital spending as they move to strengthen their finances in the face of weak natural gas prices.Their moves reflect pressure from shareholders for greater capital discipline and improved returns at companies that have been the leaders of the US shale gas revolution.Chesapeake, built by Aubrey McClendon who left the company this year, has reined in its spending sharply, cutting the total including the acquisition of new drilling leases by a planned 48 per cent from $13.4bn last year to $6.9bn in 2013.Doug Lawler, who took over as chief executive in June, said on a call with analysts that he expected it to fall again next year.He added that by cutting out inefficient drilling, Chesapeake should be able to increase its production, and continue its shift away from gas and towards more oil and natural gas liquids such as ethane.However, he accepted that “we still have to demonstrate our ability . . . to show higher quality better returns and offset the inefficient production growth decline that’ll be taking place in the next few years”.The challenge facing Mr Lawler was shown by investors’ concerns that Chesapeake’s oil production could end up lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in the third quarter, according to the company’s revised guidance. That pushed the shares down 7 per cent on Tuesday.Production fears overshadowed the improvement in Chesapeake’s profits, with a fourfold increase in underlying earnings per share for the third quarter from $0.10 in 2012 to $0.43 this year, thanks to cost cuts and higher production of the more profitable oil and liquids.Devon, meanwhile, said it had cut capital spending from $6.2bn in the first nine months of 2012 to $5.2bn in the equivalent period of this year.The company last month announced a plan to spin off its gas pipeline and processing operations.John Richels, Devon’s chief executive, said the company was focused on “capital discipline”, but also “investing in opportunities that will provide the next leg of high margin production growth for Devon”.Devon’s underlying earnings per share were up 47 per cent at $1.29, due to an increase in higher-margin oil and liquids production.Talisman Energy, a Canadian company that produces shale oil and gas in the US, also reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday and talked about its cuts in capital spending.Hal Kvisle, chief executive, said on a call with analysts: “Our first priority is to live within our means.”Talisman is cutting exploration and development spending from $3.5bn last year to about $3bn this year.Mr Kvisle said that in the Marcellus Shale gasfield of Pennsylvania, Talisman’s team “continues to find innovative ways to sustain production with minimal capital investment”.
26;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2013-02-25T18:06:44Z;Sinopec acquires stake in Chesapeake asset;;Sinopec, the Chinese state-owned oil and gas group, will pay $1bn for a 50 per cent stake in Chesapeake Energy’s Mississippi Lime oil and gasfield.The joint venture represents Sinopec’s second step into unconventional US oil and gas, following its $2.2bn purchase of stakes in five Devon Energy properties last year.It is the latest example of a buying spree by Chinese oil and gas companies, which the International Energy Agency forecast last week will lead to state-owned groups producing 3m barrels of oil a day outside of China by 2015, more than the current production of Kuwait.Chesapeake, the second largest natural gas producer in the US, has been looking to sell part of its Mississippi Lime property for at least a year as it seeks to pay down debt and counter the effect of low US natural gas prices.“Chinese companies are seeking to buy international oil assets and the US stands out as one of the few places where you can do that at scale,” said Colin Smith, an analyst at VTB Capital.“As long as you are a minority partner, US regulators seem to be fairly relaxed about Chinese companies buying stakes,” he added.Spending on international oil and gas acquisitions by Chinese state-owned oil and gas companies hit a record $35bn last year, including deals such as Cnooc’s $18bn bid for Nexen of Canada.Unlike Cnooc’s takeover of Nexen, Sinopec is entering a joint venture. Chesapeake will retain operational control of the Mississippi Lime field, in the US states of Oklahoma and Kansas.The transaction, worth $1.02bn in total, was announced by Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (SIPC), part of the wholly state-owned parent group.Sinopec’s overseas assets, which range from Argentina to Australia, are almost all owned by the parent company. Sinopec also has a partially listed subsidiary, which holds most of the companies’ domestic businesses, and is expected to purchase part of the parent group’s overseas assets over time.Chesapeake reported last week an 87 per cent drop in its underlying earnings for 2012, as rising oil production failed to compensate fully for the fall in the price of natural gas.The company plans $4bn-$7bn of disposals in 2013, down from almost $12bn last year, as it seeks to pay down some of the $12.3bn of net debt it held at the end of 2012.
27;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2013-01-28T23:42:44Z;Fracking: Industry faces up to hurdle of water pollution;These are, potentially, exciting times for companies that can reduce the environmental risks and the waste, reports Ed Crooks;The recent feature film sounding the alarm about the US natural gas boom, Promised Land, opens with its star Matt Damon washing his face in a bathroom. The film sets out its theme from the start: the greatest source of concern about the extraction of gas from rocks is water pollution.The use of water mixed with sand and chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, has made the shale oil and gas boom possible.The demand for that water – and the disposal of the produced water that emerges from wells after they have been fracked – are at the heart of the debate over whether tighter controls should be imposed on the industry.They are also potentially exciting opportunities for companies that have ways to manage water that are economically efficient and reduce the environmental risks.“Everybody is relying on fracking to make the US more energy independent, but there are major issues with water,” says Riggs Eckelberry, the chief executive of OriginOil, a company that has recently entered the business of water treatment for the oil and gas industry.He adds: “It’s becoming critical to the entire US strategy to do something about this water.”Dennis Danzik, a director of Ridgeline Energy Services, another small company that has been developing water treatment technology, agrees.He says: “Eventually, we’ll need a full waste water treatment policy, or we’ll have the country dotted with quarter-acre ponds. We have to have the energy, so the issue is not going to go away. It has to be dealt with.”A typical deep shale gas well needs 4m-6m gallons of water for hydraulic fracturing, according to a 2011 report from the National Petroleum Council, an advisory group to the US government that includes both industry representatives and environmentalists.That does not make the industry a particularly large user of water. As gas companies like to point out, in terms of water use per unit of energy produced, shale production compares very favourably to other sources such as coal or gas-fired power generation.In some parts of the US, however, water use can be a problem, especially during the drought conditions that have hit much of the country over the past year.Scott Anderson, of the Environmental Defense Fund, who has worked on the issue for the NPC, says there are some counties in Texas where 70 per cent of the growth in water consumption is a result of oil and gas production.Even in states where water is plentiful, it needs to be transported to wells, adding cost and creating disruption for communities that will be plagued by streams of trucks.The more serious problem, however, is the disposal of waste water that emerges with the oil and gas. It includes “flow back” fracking water – between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of water used for fracking comes back out again, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.That water, contaminated with salt and the chemicals used for fracking, needs to be managed. It is generally either pumped into injection wells or sent to plants for treatment.Neither method is ideal. Injection wells have been blamed for causing small earthquakes in Texas and other states, and there have been warnings that in some areas the volume of waste water needing to be stored will overwhelm the available capacity. Standard water treatment plants are not able to handle all the substances in flow back water. In 2010-11 Pennsylvania moved to limit the levels of pollution in waste water that gas producers were able to send to the state’s treatment facilities. Plants were also compelled to monitor for radioactive radium and uranium, which can be present in produced water.The solution for many companies is to treat and reuse water close to the well-site. More companies now offer water treatment technology, including big engineering groups such as General Electric and Siemens, oilfield specialists such as Halliburton, and smaller businesses such as Ecosphere.OriginOil was a specialist in technology for processing algae for biofuel production, but spotted an opportunity in fracking water treatment. It says its process, which it will demonstrate in Texas, will remove 98 per cent of carbon contaminants from waste water.Some processes can be expensive, but Mr Eckelberry says OriginOil’s system, used with further processing, can treat water for as little as 7 cents per gallon, less than the 21-26 cents of other methods and less even than the 11 cents typical cost of a gallon delivered to the well-site by truck.Ridgeline, meanwhile, has reached the point of selling its services to oil and gas producers, including ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Devon Energy.Mr Danzik suggests a cost of 1-8 cents per gallon for its electro-catalytic process, compared to about 22-24 cents for rival methods.He also argues that the use of water treatment will have to be much more widespread. Government regulation may also play a part. With the EPA studying the impact of fracking on water resources – its report is due late next year – the industry could face tighter curbs.“Technology can help, but technology alone isn’t a solution,” says Evan Branosky, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank. “We need to better understand the full water risks to inform smart decisions for responsible development of shale gas.”
28;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-10-10T18:07:00Z;‘Fracking’ to preserve US gas glut;;In 2008, at the height of the commodity price boom, Devon Energy was running 40 rigs drilling into the Barnett Shale beneath the rolling green countryside of north Texas. Today it has just 10.Squeezed by the collapse in US natural gas prices, which hit a 10-year low earlier this year, Devon has been cutting back its activity and redirecting the rigs it still operates away from “dry” gas wells and towards natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, that command higher prices.Yet Devon, an Oklahoma-based independent oil and gas company, is producing as much from the Barnett Shale as ever – about 1.32bn cubic feet of gas equivalent per day.For Devon, read the rest of the industry. While the number of rigs drilling for gas in the US has plunged, dropping 53 per cent in the past year, according to Baker Hughes, an oil services group, gas production has continued to grow.This production boom has sent prices tumblingMarketed dry gas production was 2,024bn cu ft in July, according to the government’s Energy Information Administration, not far off the record 2,042bn cu ft recorded in January.Traditionally, the link between rig activity and production has been reasonably predictable. If the number of rigs drilling for gas fell below about 600-700, then gas production would start to fall.Last week there were just 437 rigs drilling for gas in the US. But the EIA said on Wednesday it expected gas production to average 69.8bn cu ft per day in 2012, up 5 per cent from 2011, and to slip back by just 0.2 per cent next year.One explanation is that there is a lag between drilling and production, and the full impact of the declining rig count has yet to be felt. Bob Ineson, senior director for gas at IHS, the research group, says that “other things being equal”, he would expect US gas production to drop in the fourth quarter.Another factor is the increase in “associated” gas that comes off as a byproduct from wells drilled for oil or natural gas liquids.As the number of gas-targeted wells being drilled has dropped, the number aimed at oil has soared, as companies seek refuge from low North American gas prices in more lucrative crude and other liquids. The number of oil-directed rigs working in the US has risen fourfold since the start of 2009, and by 31 per cent in the past year, according to Baker Hughes.Simmons & Co, the investment bank, estimates that associated gas production from the “lower 48” states excluding Alaska will average 8.7bn cu ft per day this year, or about 13 per cent of total US production.It argues: “The oil price is the critical production variable to watch for in 2013” with respect to gas supply. If prices stay high enough to sustain drilling for oil, then associated gas output will continue to grow.More important for some industry executives and analysts is a structural reason for strong gas output: improvements in production techniques.The shale revolution was made possible by advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, and both techniques have continued to evolve.Five years ago, horizontal wells would typically extend 1,000ft-2,000ft sideways from the well head. Now they regularly run for 5,000ft.Continental Resources, another independent company that specialises in shale oil production, has extended wells more than 15,000ftFracking, using a mixture of water, sand and chemicals pumped into a well at high pressure to crack rock, releasing oil and gas, has also become much more sophisticated.“You can open up the reservoir more to produce more gas,” says Matt Jurecky at GlobalData, a consultancy. “It’s more efficient and lower cost.”His conclusion is that unless there is some fundamental change, such as a decision to allow large-scale liquefied natural gas exports, US gas prices will stay at about their current level of about $3.50 per million British thermal units for the Henry Hub benchmark.There is one other factor, however, that casts doubt on that analysis. Another reason for the decoupling on rig counts and production is that there is still a large backlog of shale gas wells that have been drilled but not yet brought into production.As those wells are completed, they add additional production.Arthur Berman, a consultant, points out that in the Haynesille shale in east Texas and Louisiana, the rig count peaked in the spring of 2010, but the number of wells in production was still rising two years later.In his view, once that backlog of uncompleted wells is worked off, the shale gas industry will need an average price that is about double present levels to sustain production.Mr Ineson at IHS, however, still believes prices can remain at close to current levels.“I would expect to see periods above and below it,” he says. “But I would think that $3.50-$4 is a long-term cost base equilibrium.”
29;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-10-09T13:02:25Z;Huawei hullabaloo hides Chinese minnows;US uproar over telecom group ignores rise of smaller deals;At about the same time that a US congressional committee ruled that Huawei and ZTE, the Chinese telecoms companies, posed a threat to national security, the state of Wisconsin was rolling out the red carpet for Chinese investors of a different breed.If Huawei and ZTE represent the whales of Chinese industry, the investors in Wisconsin were the minnows, a caravan of 50 entrepreneurs who had struck it rich in fields from property to mining and were now thinking of putting some cash to work in the US.They were looking at a range of companies that, should deals be struck, are unlikely to trigger security concerns in Washington. Potential targets included Eric Buell Racing, a high-performance motorcycle maker, and AquaMost, a water treatment technology developer.It is perfectly understandable that the fireworks over Huawei should attract more public attention. But they also serve to distract from the bigger trend, the one that was occurring in Wisconsin and off the international media’s radar: through a patchwork of smaller deals, Chinese outbound investment in the US and Europe is soaring, and is often being welcomed with open arms.The boom seems to be only beginning. Chinese direct investment in the US before 2009 totalled about 30 deals a year, worth less than $500m overall. Over the past two years that has mushroomed to an annual average of 100 deals, worth about $5bn, according to Rhodium Group, an economic consultancy. In Europe, it calculates that Chinese direct investment rose from less than $1bn a year for most of the past decade to about $10bn last year.The biggest deals are coming from the whales of Chinese industry, which are typically state-owned. But the vast majority of the deals – about two out of every three – are from the minnows.Foreign reactions to the whales and the minnows could hardly be more different, and it is not just about the size of their investments. For all the talk about China Inc as a monolithic entity, governments around the world are increasingly distinguishing between Chinese companies. Truly private players are pushing at open doors as they expand abroad, whereas state-backed companies are encountering far greater hostility.State-owned enterprises have completed some mammoth overseas deals recently, such as the $3.5bn investment by China Three Gorges in Portuguese utility EDP and Sinopec’s $2.2bn investment in Devon Energy of the US. Yet there is less than meets the eye to these mega deals. They are almost always for minority stakes – in effect, they are little more than financial investments. Chinese state-owned enterprises seem to have wisely judged that majority bids might not gain approval, but minority stakes do not yield the same kind of benefits that outright acquisitions can when executed well.Huawei’s troubles are illustrative of the pitfalls for any company that is seen as linked to the state. The congressional intelligence committee’s conclusion that it serves the Chinese military could bar Huawei from making any substantial investments in the US.Huawei protests that it is a private company that happens to be founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, but it refuses to fully divulge its ownership structure.There are good reasons to believe that Cnooc, China’s state-owned offshore oil company, will be successful in its $15bn bid for Canada’s Nexen. Yet it is hard to imagine Cnooc being able to gobble up a company much bigger than that – Nexen controls less than 5 per cent of Canada’s oil sands leases.By contrast, private Chinese companies are having a much easier time of it. Small acquisitions that come below thresholds for national security reviews are of course relatively straightforward, but even larger deals, such as Sany’s $475m acquisition of German pumpmaker Putzmeister, are going through.Thomas Luedi, a director with the McKinsey consultancy in Shanghai, says that Chinese companies have learnt how to structure deals to allay concerns – pledging, for example, not to fire workers.“The Chinese have shown in many deals that, by and large, it wasn’t the end of the day after they took it over,” he said. “The company wasn’t destroyed. Corporate governance didn’t go anywhere.”Huawei can make similar pledges, but the whiff of the state in its background overwhelms its words. Thankfully for China, it has thousands of other companies without similar baggage – and these are the ones that are leading its march into the US and Europe.Simon Rabinovitch is the Financial Times’ Beijing correspondent
30;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-10-03T17:38:24Z;Innovation drives America’s reinvention;From looking lost in telecoms and energy, the US has recovered and raced ahead of competition;"It is bizarre to come back to London after seven years in New York to find the UK struggling to launch 4G high-speed mobile services and European companies lagging behind the US. “If we do nothing in Europe, all the innovation will fly away,” José María Álvarez-Pallete, chief operating officer of Spain’s Telefónica, told an FT conference this week.When I moved homes in 2005, Europe was far ahead of the US in 3G and Nokia, and Research In Motion of Canada were the biggest smartphone makers. Meanwhile, the US agonised over its energy crisis – it depended on the Middle East for oil and faced the need to import liquefied natural gas.Since then, America’s talent for technological innovation has risen to both challenges. It has seized the lead in mobile broadband – Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows Mobile have 65 per cent of the global market, versus 5 per cent in 2005 – and launched 4G services before others. Fracking and horizontal drilling for natural gas, invented in the US, could support its energy needs for 100 years.It has economic problems, as Edward Luce pointed out recently. It is struggling to solve its fiscal deficit amid acrimony in Washington; it is short of well-paid jobs for the middle classes; its infrastructure is ageing; and the number of visas for the educated immigrants who fuelled the rise of Silicon Valley has fallen.But I am struck by its amazing, enduring capacity to reinvent itself through technology, a tradition reaching back to Benjamin Franklin and George Washington’s science experiments. It has often surprised with inventions such as aircraft, automobiles and computers.It should not be a shock that it still can, despite the worries about its comparative decline. “The US lacks a strategic approach to science and technology but the environment for innovation is very fertile,” says Daniel Sarewitz, a professor at Arizona State University. “It is a question of scale – we still invest more and have more people involved in it than anywhere else.”Public and private investment in innovation remains high – about 2.8 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2008, compared with 1.9 per cent in the EU. A lot comes from federal programmes that have provided the foundation for many inventions. The Maps service for which Apple has just apologised would not exist at all except for military investment in global positioning satellites.The US has an unparalleled structure for private investment in technology, flowing from venture capital-backed companies. That ecology has produced most of the world’s biggest technology companies, from Google to Apple, and constantly spawns new rivals eager to take on the big beasts of Silicon Valley.That leads to intense competition, with companies fighting to overturn each other. “It is hard to see the barriers to technology innovation here, whereas there are often obstacles such as access to finance or education in other countries,” says Robert Shapiro, chairman of the consultancy Sonecon.As a result, technological change can sweep through the US economy rapidly, not merely in technology but in other sectors. Apple’s 2007 launch of the iPhone restructured entire sectors in a few years – it battered RIM and Nokia, outshone Microsoft, and wrested control from mobile network operators.Having achieved all of this, it faced an immediate counter-attack from Google, which acquired Android and ruthlessly used it to replicate the iPhone’s features – taking a 52 per cent share of the US smartphone market in July, according to ComScore. Nokia’s effort at rivalling Apple’s iOS software, Symbian, had less than 1 per cent.The shift in power in the mobile industry toward the US is illustrated by the fact that Apple has launched the iPhone 5 in the UK without any network yet able to support its 4G services. Other European operators are also rushing to acquire the right kind of spectrum. In the past, they chose their standards and handset makers had to follow.It is a similar story in the US natural gas industry and for fracking technology. Hydraulic fracking has been available since the 1940s in local gasfields but its economic potential was later transformed by public-private research projects backed by the US Department of Energy. That technology was then developed by smaller companies such as Devon Energy and Chesapeake, rather than by the global oil majors.This isn’t to say that American technological drive and ambition is an unalloyed blessing. Fracking has environmental risks and the freedom to innovate free of obstruction and regulation that benefits the US can equally have nasty side effects. Natural gas companies rushing to inject chemical-fuelled water into shale can poison aquifers.Indeed, one of the biggest US-led technology innovations of recent years – the invention of credit derivatives that emerged from options research at the University of Chicago and was used to package subprime mortgages – led to the 2008 financial crisis. The US passion for invention can outstrip society’s capacity to use it for good.However, the US usually finds a way to correct excesses after the fact, even if the process of regulatory reform is more democratic and unpredictable than in other countries. By the time those countries have caught up, US companies own many of the patents, know how to apply them and enjoy a dominant position.The remarkable thing is how rapidly the US has managed to turn the technological tables in two of the most important global industries. For a few years, it looked lost in both telecommunications and energy, then it recovered and raced ahead. It hasn’t lost its touch.john.gapper@ft.com"
31;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-09-23T21:38:33Z;Cnooc / Nexen – decision time looms;Chinese bid for oil group is in Canada’s national interest to approve;"If governing is about choosing, a couple of governments have a big choice to make in the next few weeks. Shareholders of Canadian oil company Nexen approved a $15bn takeover offer from China’s Cnooc by a pretty convincing 99 per cent last week. The deal’s fate is now in the hands of politicians in Ottawa and Washington. There is hostility in Canada to the deal, which would see the state-controlled Chinese energy provider planting its big foot in the “oil patch”, as Canadians rather quaintly call their oil sands reserves. But there are compelling reasons to approve this acquisition.Cnooc’s friendly, $27.50-a-share cash offer, launched in July, was pitched at a 60 per cent premium to Nexen’s undisturbed price. It came with sweeteners: a promise to make Calgary into Cnooc’s North American hub, and to list its shares on the Toronto stock exchange. Now that shareholders have spoken, the deal is being reviewed in Ottawa, which investigates takeovers worth more than C$330m, and in the US (Nexen owns assets in the Gulf of Mexico).Few foreign purchases are turned away by Canada and the US. The last big one to be given the kibosh was BHP Billiton’s bid for PotashCorp in 2010. Cnooc’s 2005 offer for Unocal faced intense scrutiny in the US; the target eventually fell to Chevron. But Canada has lots more oil than potash. Chinese companies have also since acquired US energy assets without opposition, including this year’s Sinopec/Devon Energy agreement. The Cnooc/Nexen transaction should ideally be considered in that light.Cnooc is state-controlled but making Calgary its North American hub would give some independence to that part of the business. Canada’s oil reserves require huge investment: foreign investors will be needed to develop them. Nexen’s owners, many of them Canadian, also want this transaction. The national interest argues for its approval.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
32;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-09-11T12:15:06Z;China shale gas – no revolution yet;Without price reforms there is little financial incentive to develop the industry;The earliest known oil wells were drilled almost 2,000 years ago in China. That makes the country’s limp into shale gas look tardy. This week it made inroads by tendering 20 shale gas blocks to companies including Chinese-controlled foreign joint ventures. About time – there has been no meaningful shale gas production in the country until now.Modest estimates from the ministry of land and resources suggest that China is sitting on 25tn cubic metres of recoverable shale gas reserves, or a fifth of the global total – slightly more than the US. The US Energy Information Administration reckons that China’s reserves are more like 36tn cu m.China needs more gas to reduce its dependence on coal and hence its carbon emissions. Yet it plans to extract just 6.5bn cu m annually in shale gas by 2015, barely 3 per cent of US production last year. It hopes to increase production to 100bn cu m per annum by 2020.But there are obstacles. In addition to a poor water supply (essential for fracking) and a weak gas network, China lacks knowhow. Little wonder that its oil majors have spent $6bn in acquiring shale gas projects in North America, working with local operators such as Chesapeake and Devon Energy, even before Cnooc bid for Canada’s Nexen. But there is no guarantee that US drilling technology will be effective on China’s deep, earthquake-prone reserves.Without gas price reforms there is little financial incentive to develop the industry. Prices will need to rise to $8.50 per million British thermal units for drillers to break even, Bank of America notes. But China keeps its gas price artificially low at $6/mBtu, so it could cost China’s oil majors Rmb62bn-Rmb112bn in annual losses to meet 2020 gas consumption targets. Their balance sheets could support this. (Net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at PetroChina is less than one.)

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
34;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-08-22T15:25:22Z;Chinese acquisitions in US near record;;Chinese acquisitions of US assets and businesses are running at record levels this year, bucking the trend of a generally tough mergers and acquisitions market and a sign that it is easier than many think for Chinese companies to attain approval for deals in America.Almost $8bn of deals have been announced so far this year, led by Dalian Wanda’s $2.6bn takeover of AMC Entertainment, the US cinema chain, and Sinopec’s $2.4bn acquisition of big stakes in a number of oil and gas developments from Devon Energy.The $7.8bn total is a record for the first eight months of any year and is approaching the full-year record of $8.9bn for Chinese deals buying into the US set in 2007, according to data from Dealogic.Joe Gallagher, co-head of M&A in Asia at Credit Suisse, said the growth in China-US deal volumes was a natural product of the country’s development and its hunger for energy and resources.“China is getting bigger, getting richer, getting more sophisticated. Chinese companies are developing – all of that drives growth in deal activity,” Mr Gallagher said. “Some of China’s biggest companies, especially in the oil and gas sector, are getting much more sophisticated in their approach to acquisitions.”Credit Suisse tops the table for advising on deals with Chinese acquirers and US targets, having been involved in $5.1bn of trades. It advised Sinopec in the Devon deal and was among the five advisers to AMC. However, Credit Suisse is third behind Goldman Sachs and Citigroup for overall China M&A.The strength of the China-US activity comes in spite of the broader slowdown in M&A, both in China itself and globally. Total deal volume for the first half in China was down 3 per cent from a year earlier at $48.6bn, according to data from Mergermarket. Global M&A volumes for 2012 are on course to be the slowest since 2003.These totals could be boosted significantly by the end of the year. Chinese energy group Cnooc has launched a $15.1bn deal for Nexen of Canada and Sinopec is considering a bid for billions of dollars of assets owned by Chesapeake Energy, the US gas producer.Since Cnooc’s blocked attempt to take over Unocal of the US in 2005 in 2005 and the repeated knockbacks handed to Huawei, the telecoms group, in trying to do deals in the US, it had been widely assumed the country was resistant Chinese buyers.
35;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-08-05T16:48:35Z;Japanese traders benefit from nuclear shift;;While Japan slowly recovers from last year’s tsunami and nuclear accident, its big trading companies have managed to find some business opportunities in the wake of the disaster.The nation’s top trading houses – which have traditionally supplied the resource-poor nation with everything from coal to bananas – unveiled quarterly results last week that illustrated how they have benefited from the almost complete shutdown of nuclear power in Japan.While overall profits fell due to weaker metals markets, the big five’s combined net income of $4.7bn was equivalent to a fifth of the entire April-June profit made by the Nikkei 225 companies, excluding banks, as many of Japan’s exporters continued to struggle from the effects of a strong yen and weak external demand.In the wake of the meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in March last year, Japan progressively turned off all 50 of its surviving nuclear reactors. Two were switched back on last month, but the country faces a growing debate over the future role that nuclear power should play in its energy supply, leading to questions over when, or if, the other reactors could return to service.Lacking domestic fossil fuel sources, Japan has been forced to rely more heavily on expensive imports of oil and liquefied natural gas to fuel conventional power plants. This has made the nation more vulnerable to supply shocks, which has prompted the trading companies to secure resources by investing more aggressively in upstream energy assets.Each of the big five traders reported resilient first-quarter performances from their energy divisions. The energy businesses at Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co, the two largest trading houses by market capitalisation, were the standout performers. At Mitsubishi, net income from energy accounted for more than half of the total of Y98bn ($1.25bn), from just over a quarter a year earlier.Mitsubishi has been the most active acquirer of energy assets this year, doing half a dozen big deals, including the joint purchase with Mitsui of almost a sixth of Woodside Petroleum’s Browse LNG project in Australia.Last week, Sumitomo Corp, the trading house with the smallest exposure to energy, confirmed it would invest about $2bn in Texas shale oilfields after agreeing to buy big stakes in assets from Devon Energy, the Oklahoma-based operator.“If higher fuel imports are a long-term trend, then it is better [for the trading companies] to invest in reserves themselves,” said Eric Nishimura, analyst at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.LNG, a cleaner burning fuel than coal and oil, seems a particularly safe bet. Gas-fired generation has risen to about half of Japan’s total since the nuclear accident, according to CLSA. Japan is now sourcing LNG from every exporter except Libya and has even taken excess cargoes from non-producing nations such as Belgium.Marubeni, the smallest of Japan’s trading houses, saw Y780bn of energy trades in the three months to June, up 13 per cent from a year earlier, thanks mainly to increased imports of LNG. In Russia, an Itochu-led consortium is conducting feasibility studies with Gazprom on the co-development of a new LNG plant in Vladivostok.“We expect the current level of LNG imports to continue,” said Yuji Seiya, a senior executive in Itochu’s energy division.The trading companies are pushing ahead as the government urges the public to voice their views on how much nuclear power Japan should have. An advisory committee has put forward three options for nuclear power, ranging from zero to 20 to 25 per cent of the nation’s total energy mix by 2030, compared to about 26 per cent in fiscal 2010.In a series of public hearings across the country in recent weeks, most citizens who expressed a desire to speak supported the zero option, the government said on Saturday. Lawmakers are scheduled to make a decision on a national energy strategy later this month after taking into account the views of the population.According to Nomura, assuming that Japan does not switch on any more nuclear power plants, its LNG consumption in the year through March 2012 could reach 66.9m tonnes, an increase of more than 60 per cent from two years ago.Masakazu Toyoda, chairman of the Institute of Energy Economics think-tank, said that in the wake of Fukushima, a bigger official role for gas looks inevitable.“We’re the unquestioned world leader in LNG consumption,” he said. “We need to find sufficient supply to meet demand.”
36;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-05-08T22:21:36Z;IBM gets record low rate for US debt;;IBM, the computer services group with a reputation for taking advantage of cheap borrowing costs, set a new low at a US debt sale when it sold $600m in seven-year debt with a coupon of 1.875 per cent.Dealogic, the research group, said the sale was at the lowest interest rate for bonds of that maturity issued in dollars. IBM also issued $900m in three-year notes with a coupon of 0.75 per cent.Tuesday’s offering was the second for IBM this year after another two-part sale in February, when it issued $2.5bn of three and five-year debt with a 0.55 per cent and 1.25 per cent coupon, respectively.IBM was joined by other investment-grade companies including Berkshire Hathaway, Motorola and Georgia Power, which also took advantage of lower borrowing costs and sold a combined $8.45bn.The borrowers benefited from a drop in costs as the average yields on US investment grade corporate bonds touched a new low on Friday, according to a Barclays index.The yield on the index, which dates back to 1973, fell to 3.25 per cent, below the previous low of 3.27 per cent reached on March 2. On Monday yields went up slightly to 3.28 per cent.“Companies such as IBM, with no questions on their credit, will have no problem in selling debt even in a somewhat risk averse market,” said Adrian Miller, a global market strategist at GMP. “There will be people lining up to buy such bonds.”Low corporate borrowing costs in the US and the relative safety of the dollar have also attracted foreign issuers to the US capital markets. UK-based Diageo Capital, a subsidiary of the distiller, sold $2.5bn in five, 10 and 30-year debt.The increase in borrowing on Tuesday may bode well for the future pace of corporate bond sales after an issuance slump in April and renewed concerns about Europe.Last month, non-financial companies sold just over $100bn of bonds globally, about half of March’s issuance and the slowest month this year, according to Dealogic. As of Monday, total issuance in May has reached $22.7bn.April is a historically weaker month for corporate issuance as it coincides with many US corporations’ blackout periods ahead of the release of quarterly results.“It’s not just a question of record low yields, but with most of the earnings season behind us, we may see a decent rebound in corporate debt sales,” Mr Miller said.The latest drop in yields on benchmark US Treasury bonds has driven borrowing costs to lows throughout the US markets.Long-term yields on US municipal bonds fell to new lows on Tuesday with triple A rated 30-year bonds hitting 3.09 per cent, the lowest level for a Thomson Reuters MMD index that dates back to 1981. Last week, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 3.84 per cent, a fresh low for a Freddie Mac index going back to 1971.
37;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-03-28T00:20:19Z;Country focus: China faces difficulties in shale gas production;The premier has mentioned extracting natural gas for the first time, says Leslie Hook;Standing in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing this month, Wen Jiabao, China’s premier, faced thousands of delegates at the ruling Communist party’s annual congress and three small syllables passed his lips: yeyanqi, or shale gas.It was the first time shale gas had been mentioned in the premier’s annual work report, a three-hour policy speech that is mostly the same from one year to the next. The mention underscores how China’s leaders put a growing priority on unconventional gas as they seek to secure resources for the world’s biggest energy user.China has some of the largest shale gas potential in the world, but is still at a nascent phase of exploration, with the extent of commercially viable reserves un­known. Beijing has encouraged the development of shale gas and other unconventionals because domestic gas resources could allow the country to import less gas and reduce carbon emissions as gas replaces coal.If fully developed, China’s shale resources could radically alter the dynamics of supply for the world’s biggest energy consumer, just as shale gas has changed the situation in the US, the world’s largest producer of shale gas.A study by China’s Ministry of Land and Resources says the country has potentially recoverable resources of 25tn cubic metres of shale gas, nearly 200 times its annual gas consumption.However, when Mr Wen spoke this month, it was not the potential of shale that he focused on, it was the challenges.He vowed the government would “tackle key problems more quickly in the exploration and development of shale gas”, his first reference to shale in the government’s work report. It was a subtle admission of the difficulties of developing the gas, which is extracted from shale rock using injections of highly pressurised water and chemicals.Shale gas is technically difficult to extract and China’s national oil companies are relatively new to unconventional extraction techniques.To acquire the necessary expertise, they have invested billions of dollars in shale oil and gas projects in the US, such as Sinopec’s recent $2.5bn deal with Devon Energy of Oklahoma to invest in shale oil and gas projects in the US.At home, China’s oil majors are partnering with foreign companies, including Shell and Chevron, to explore shale resources.Scientists say the country’s complex geology will be a challenge, particularly in the Sichuan basin, which contains huge gas resources but is highly fractured, making it difficult to drill the horizontal wells needed to extract shale gas.Even after the gas is out of the ground, further obstacles remain: China lacks a widespread pipeline infrastructure that would allow it to be transported efficiently across the country. And natural gas prices, which are controlled by the state, are kept at low levels that discourage investment in exploration because oil projects are much more lucrative at current prices.In a recent plan for the development of shale gas, the government admitted that it might be difficult to produce domestic reserves in a commercially viable way, describing economic prospects as “relatively poor”.“China’s shale resources are, on average, fairly deeply buried. Shale blocks have complicated terrain, are densely populated, have challenging engineering operations, and their economic nature is relatively poor,” said the policy document.Despite these challenges, the government has clear goals for shale gas development: 6.5bn cubic metres of annual shale gas production by 2015 and more than 60bn cubic metres of shale gas production by 2020.Subsidised prices, tax incentives and preferential land prices are all expected to be announced for shale gas in coming years to encourage development.One wild card in China’s quest for shale is water resources, because large amounts of water are required to carry out the hydraulic fracturing that breaks open the shale rocks to release the gas.“Just because the US can succeed [in exploiting shale gas], doesn’t mean that China can copy its experiences and succeed itself,” explains Lin Boqiang, energy expert at Xiamen University.“Technology is not the real issue,” Mr Lin adds. “Neither is capital. The key is water. Shale gas requires a lot of water during the extraction process.“Furthermore it pollutes water. I think the reserves estimates aren’t realistic, because without water how can you develop them?”Water issues and environmental concerns have sparked objections to shale gas development in the US, where environmentalists say that shale wells have contaminated groundwater supplies and drinking water.No similar environmental opposition to shale gas has yet emerged in China and industry executives say that environmental concerns about hydraulic fracturing are rarely – if ever – raised.Even so, Beijing’s recent blueprint goes out of its way to lay out measures to mitigate the environmental impact of shale drilling, perhaps in anticipation of the types of protests that have occurred in the US.On balance, China’s policy makers believe shale gas will be beneficial to the environment because it will reduce carbon emissions. Natural gas is cleaner-burning than the coal that provides the great majority of the country’s power.The recent blueprint describes the benefits: if shale gas production meets its 2015 targets, it would result in annual carbon emission reductions of 14m tonnes.
38;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-03-13T20:12:20Z;Brazil oil and gas attract foreign groups;;When Britain’s Prince Harry last week rode the cable car to the top of Sugar Loaf Mountain, one of Rio de Janeiro’s biggest tourist attractions, it was hardly surprising that BG Group was among the companies at the event showcasing its presence in the Latin American market.The natural gas company is the largest UK investor in Brazil, with $5bn tied up chiefly in five offshore blocks off the country’s south-eastern coast. It also has a majority holding in Brazil’s largest natural gas distributor, Comgás, and a stake in a gas pipeline between Latin America’s largest economy and its neighbour, Bolivia. “BG Group has been present in Brazil for over 18 years,” the company said at the event to promote UK interests.But BG and other longstanding investors in the country no longer have the market to themselves. Since Shell became the first international operator to start oil and gas production in Brazil in 2003, ending the former monopoly of state-owned oil operator Petrobras, at least 36 foreign companies have entered the country’s upstream market, according to Ernst & Young.Chinese companies, particularly oil and petrochemical group Sinopec, are now among the largest investors in Brazilian oil and gas.Sinopec in November paid a total of $5.2bn for a 30 per cent stake in the Brazilian assets of Galp Energia, the Portuguese energy company. This follows Sinopec’s $7.1bn purchase of the Brazilian assets of Repsol YPF in 2010.Among the other Chinese groups, Sinochem has a $3.1bn stake in a field off Brazil’s south-eastern coast operated by Norway’s Statoil.Most other international oil majors are represented in Brazil as well – aside from Shell and BG, Chevron and ExxonMobil have interests in blocks in the country and BP has bought $7bn in assets from Devon Energy of the US that include interests in Brazil.But Brazil also comes with its risks, as Chevron discovered after a small oil leak at a field near Rio de Janeiro last year provoked an outcry from all levels of government accompanied by a $10.6bn lawsuit.
39;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-03-13T12:57:11Z;Local supply policy tests Petrobras;;When the new president of Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras took the helm this month, she left little doubt about where her loyalties lay.In her first press conference, Maria das Graças Foster highlighted the importance of the government’s policy of incorporating local content of up to 65 per cent in the national oil services industry.Petrobras says its level of local content is close to three-quarters. But the company and its partners need to build or buy more than double the number of the ships in Britain’s Royal Navy, about 250, – as well as other equipment – to meet its target for developing the country’s colossal deepwater “pre-salt” fields off the coast of south-eastern Brazil.The company has the world’s largest corporate capital expenditure programme, valued at $225bn over five years. Increasing “local content is a basic requirement of the nation and of Petrobras”, Ms Graças Foster told reporters.Yet the government’s local supply policy is worrying investors in Petrobras after Latin America’s largest company by market value released disappointing fourth-quarter financial results last month and struggled to increase production last year.In spite of being awarded the operating rights over the “pre-salt” fields, the largest oil discovery in the Americas in decades, Petrobras’ stock has underperformed. Its shares have fallen more than 17 per cent over the past year compared with a 1.2 per cent drop for the Bovespa benchmark index, according to Bloomberg data.“For practically three years, Petrobras has not been able to meet its own production targets,” says Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Centre of Infrastructure, a Rio de Janeiro-based consultancy.As a veteran of Petrobras and a close confidant of President Dilma Rousseff, analysts expect Ms Graças Foster to be in a stronger position to champion the company’s interests while maintaining good relations with Brasília than her predecessor, José Sergio Gabrielli.But the fourth-quarter results showed the extent of the challenge she faces. Net profit more than halved from a year earlier as the company’s downstream operations weighed on its performance.Demand in Brazil for petrol is soaring on the back of a growing economy and weaker than expected domestic production of ethanol. This is straining Petrobras’ domestic refining capacity and forcing it to import fuel at higher global market rates and sell it at lower local prices.Although Brazil does not officially subsidise fuel, Petrobras has not increased prices for eight years. Analysts believe this has been at the insistence of its controlling shareholder, the government, which is concerned that increases could drive higher inflation.“With uncertainty on near-term 2012 earnings added to a fundamental case that remains uncompelling for the next couple of years – low production growth, unchanged downstream pricing policy and necessity to grow unprofitably to supply the Brazilian fuel market – we continue to see little reason to purchase Petrobras shares,” said Credit Suisse in a research note.More concerning in the longer term is the company’s ability to lift its global production, which as of December was 2.72m barrels a day – lower than a year earlier, although the company blamed this on unplanned shutdowns at some platforms.“Petrobras’ investments since 2003 until now have risen 280 per cent but production has only increased 30 per cent,” says Mr Pires.The company has forecast it will more than double production to 6.4m b/d by 2020. While this target is based on existing fields, it will require Petrobras and the government to also make more progress in developing the vast new ultra-deepwater discoveries.The biggest challenge Petrobras faces, however, is that Brazil lacks the domestic capacity to meet its local content requirements for equipment.In January outgoing Petrobras head Mr Gabrielli told the Financial Times at Davos: “What’s going to be the main constraint that we face is the speed of the supply chain worldwide to provide the goods and services that we need.”Even if Brazil did have the manufacturing capacity, its industry not yet internationally competitive – a mid-range tanker can cost $66m to build in Brazil – twice as much as in China, Credit Suisse estimates.Perhaps mindful of this, the government does not appear to be in a hurry to hold the next round of tenders for the deepwater blocks. The process has been bogged down anyway by a political row between Brazil’s state governments over how to distribute royalties.“I’m not sensing the government is in any big rush to conduct these bid rounds because the real bottleneck is in the oil services industry,” says Chris Garman, of Eurasia Group, the research company.As for Ms Graças Foster, she has won a reprieve from a rise in Petrobras shares since the start of this year on the back of the improving global economic outlook.But analysts will be watching to see when she will use her clout with the president to secure more breathing space for Petrobras – whether it is an increase in domestic fuel prices or more flexibility on the local content requirements, or both.
40;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-02-17T15:44:43Z;Wall Street rally shrugs off Greek deadlock;;Investors shrugged off delays to a deal on bail-out funding for Greece to push US stocks to within touching distance of four-year highs.The S&P 500 index climbed 1.4 per cent over the week to close at 1,361.21, just five points shy of its post-crisis closing high reached last April.The benchmark US index has now climbed more than 100 points in 2012, the first time US stocks have ever clocked up a century points gain by mid-February, according to Standard and Poor’s Capital IQ.The previous best points return seven weeks into a year was 79 in 2010.Apparent deadlock in the Greek bail-out negotiations briefly threatened to derail the rally on Wednesday as the S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent for only the third time this year but a fall in jobless claims to near-four year lows on Thursday quickly focused investors back on the domestic economy.“Despite the histrionics in Europe, there is a sense on Wall Street that a Greek deal will be hammered out,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That means investors can focus above all else on US economic data, which for the most part suggest this recovery will be durable.”Apple shares broke above $500 a share for the first time, peaking at $526.29 on Thursday before sliding slightly as the company pulled the iPad 2 from Amazon China because of an ongoing trademark dispute, while mutual and exchange-traded funds appeared to sell the stock as its weighting exceeded maximum requirements for a single stock.Shares ended the week at $502.12, for a gain of 1.8 per cent, leaving the company $60bn clear of Exxon Mobil as the world’s largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation.Apple has contributed ten of the S&P 500’s 100-point rally in 2012, according to Bloomberg, while its results have also given a healthy glow to US corporate earnings.Were Apple’s results stripped out, Barclays Capital estimates earnings growth at S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results would be 2.9 per cent rather than 6.7 per cent.Mike Walkley, a tech analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said its shares could hit $665 within a year.“Apple appeals to growth investors because its share price performance has been strong but it also appeals to value investors as its still trading at a very modest multiple to earnings,” Mr Walkley said.Apple’s stellar start to the year has helped push the Nasdaq Composite index to 11-year highs and the index climbed another 1.7 per cent to 2,951.78 this week.That would have been even better were it not for a dip on Friday as shares in Gilead Sciences fell 14.6 per cent to $46.82.Gilead said the majority of hepatitis C sufferers enrolled in a trial of one of its treatments suffered relapses within four weeks of completing a 12-week course.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent over the week to 12,949.64, closing above 12,900 for the first time since 2008 on Thursday. But the transport sector of the index fell 0.3 per cent in what could be a bearish indicator for stocks: Dow theory suggests the transport sector leads the rest of the index, as it is the first to show signs of an economic slowdown.Yahoo shares fell 7 per cent to $15.01 after the internet portal company's attempts to sell its Asian assets appeared to break down on Tuesday, triggering a boardroom rebellion by activist investors.JPMorgan analysts, who had argued that a tax-free sale of stakes in companies such as Alibaba could yield a $20 share price bounce for Yahoo, expressed frustration at the drawn-out process.Doug Anmuth wrote in a note: “A taxed sale … remains possible – and we believe that may be better than doing nothing at all – but we think the board and management need to arrive at a conclusion in the near term so Yahoo can focus fully on its core business.”Financials had a mixed week. Bank of America fell 0.7 per cent to $8.02 for its first weekly loss in 2012 as at least two analysts said the bank no longer represented compelling value after its 44 per cent rally this year.John McDonald at Bernstein Research and Keith Horowitz at Citigroup both said investors will switch focus from BofA’s capital position, which has improved markedly, to its earnings potential, which remains subdued.Morgan Stanley also lost ground, falling 2.5 per cent to $19.16, after Moody’s, the rating agency, warned it could downgrade the investment bank’s debt by three notches.Citigroup was flat at $32.92 and JPMorgan Chase climbed 2.3 per cent to $38.47, although Moody’s put both banks on watch for two- notch downgrades.Devon Energy climbed 15.9 per cent to $74.95 after the oil and gas explorer said it would cut back investment on new exploration and also declared a smaller fourth-quarter loss than expected.Other oil and gas explorers also rallied as natural gas futures climbed to their highest level since January, easing pressure on margins.Chesapeake Energy was up 11.7 per cent to $24.71 and Cabot Oil & Gas rose 9.2 per cent to $36.64.
41;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-02-07T00:20:53Z;Anadarko shows exploration programme success;;Anadarko Petroleum, one of the largest US independent oil companies, has shown the success of its exploration programme by booking 392m barrels of oil equivalent to its reserves last year, equivalent to 159 per cent of its production.The company’s fourth-quarter results also showed the benefit of a concentration of capital spending on oil-rich developments rather than gas, which is less lucrative at today’s prices, especially in the US.Excluding the effect of non-operating items, including a $1.56bn writedown of coal-bed methane gas assets caused by weak natural gas prices, Anadarko’s post-tax profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $423m, up from $189m in the equivalent period of 2010. Revenues rose 43 per cent to $3.84bn.Gas still accounts for more than half of production but its output of crude oil and natural gas liquids used for fuel and as chemical feedstocks has been growing more quickly. All gas production is in the US, where strong supply and weak demand have driven prices to a 10-year low.Anadarko has been slower into the onshore US reserves of shale gas and oil than some other mid-sized US companies such as Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy. It scored most of its high-profile successes offshore, including oil finds off Ghana and a gas find off Mozambique that appears to be one of the largest found in the past decade.But Anadarko has also grown its shale production, which has gone from 1 per cent of its sales volumes at the start of 2010 to 10 per cent by the end of last year.The company also found what it estimated to be at least 500m-1.5bn boe of oil and gas in the Wattenberg field in Colorado.
42;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-01-16T13:09:32Z;China’s hunger for gas fuels hostile bid;;At first blush China Gas, a small company that distributes natural gas in Chinese cities, would seem unlikely to end up at the centre of a hostile takeover battle that has pitted a large Chinese state-owned oil company against a diverse range of small investors, including energy companies from Korea, India and Oman.Hong Kong-listed China Gas recently rejected a hostile offer from Sinopec, China’s largest oil and gas refiner, and ENN, a Chinese gas distributor. But the takeover saga has heated up as several shareholders have increased their stakes in China Gas since the offer, in anticipation of a possible renewed bid from Sinopec and ENN.The rare hostile takeover attempt underscores how high interest is running in China’s natural gas sector, and analysts and bankers believe that more consolidation is in store as China’s natural gas market matures.China, the world’s largest energy consumer, is increasingly favouring natural gas as a fuel source, partly because it is cleaner-burning than crude oil. China’s voracious demand for natural gas – which is growing at about 20 per cent annually – has become a major driver for global liquefied natural gas markets as well as for global M&A.This drive has steered big Chinese acquisitions overseas, like Sinopec’s $2.5bn purchase of a stake in Devon Energy, or Cnooc’s multibillion dollar investments in Chesapeake Energy, a US company specialised in shale gas.China Gas, with a market cap of just over HK$16bn (US$2.1bn) and core net profits of $410m during the first half of last year, has a range of gas distribution networks in more than 140 Chinese cities. Sinopec, China’s second-largest oil and gas producer by production, has an extensive petrol distribution network but lacks urban gas distribution.The takeover saga began on December 13 last year, when Sinopec and ENN made an unsolicited offer of HK$3.50 a share for China Gas, a 25 per cent premium to the previous day’s closing share price.Although that offer was swiftly rejected by the company as “opportunistic”, Sinopec and ENN have still submitted applications for regulatory approvals, including anti-monopoly approvals, and those close to the deal say the consortium would likely make another offer if those approvals are granted.“Sinopec already has upstream assets, so they need to buy more downstream,” said Danny Huang, oil and gas analyst at RBS. “As China’s gas consumption grows these [downstream] companies will get more gas projects.”China Gas has at times appeared troubled, with its founder Liu Minghui jailed in late 2010 and investigated for embezzlement, news that caused share prices to sink. Mr Liu has been released from prison but the investigation is understood to be ongoing.The company still seems to be growing quickly, with gas sold during the first half of 2011 up 30 per cent from the previous year.China’s fragmented natural gas distribution sector is expected to grow rapidly, with China’s big oil and gas companies seeking to consolidate distribution through more acquisition.Large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have their own local networks for piped distribution of gas, and in third and fourth-tier cities the distribution might be handled by a small nationwide company or by an entirely local company.“Gas is just starting out as an energy source in China,” said Laban Yu, oil and gas analyst at Jefferies SP in Hong Kong. “Natural gas demand is expanding 19 per cent a year, so a lot of new distribution is going to be built.”Mr Yu expects that the next few years will see fresh listings of small but growing natural gas distributors, followed by a potential period of consolidation as these companies make acquisitions or are acquired.Meanwhile, the unusual shareholder profile of China Gas makes it likely that any takeover battle will be fiercely fought. Significant shareholders include the Asian Development Bank, two subsidiaries of Korea’s SK Group, Oman Oil Company and an Indian gas company.Since the Sinopec/ENN offer was announced, SK E&S announced it would purchase a further five per cent stake in China Gas in addition to its 7.8 per cent stake. That move makes SK less likely to sell its shares unless Sinopec and ENN come up with a bigger offer.SK Group said it was not considering a hostile takeover of China Gas.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.
44;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-01-06T11:56:39Z;Marubeni pays $1.3bn for US shale rights;;Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, has become the latest foreign investor to jump into the booming US shale oil and gas sector, with a $1.3bn deal for a minority interest in the Eagle Ford concession in Texas.The Japanese group said on Friday it had agreed to buy 35 per cent of the 52,000 acres (210 sq km) of Eagle Ford development rights controlled by Hunt Oil, the privately held Dallas energy group. The financial figure includes the cost of the acquisition as well as Marubeni’s share of extraction expenses for “several hundred” wells to be drilled over 5-10 years.International groups are keen to increase their exposure to US shale resources in spite of an environmental controversy over “fracking” – the injection of water, sand and chemicals into wells to crack rocks and release oil and gas.This week Sinopec, China’s second-largest oil company by market capitalisation, unveiled a $2.5bn deal with Oklahoma-based Devon Energy to invest in five new development areas from Ohio to Alabama.Total of France is investing $2.3bn in an Ohio oil and gas joint venture with Chesapeake Energy and EnerVest of the US, even though fracking has been banned in France.In Japan, trading houses are the biggest investors in overseas energy projects, and Marubeni’s rivals have already committed to US shale.One of them, Mitsui & Co, has made one of the largest bets on the sector, agreeing a deal with Anadarko Petroleum in 2010 that saw it pay $1.4bn for one-third of Anadarko’s assets in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania and commit another $3bn-$4bn for exploration and extraction.Mitsui has also invested in Eagle Ford, while Sumitomo Corp, another trading group, has bought into Marcellus. A fourth trading house, Mitsubishi Corp, is tapping into shale projects in Australia and Canada.Japan is already the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, and its needs have grown further as a result of the crisis in its nuclear power industry after the Fukushima disaster last March.Before three reactors at Fukushima Daiichi power station melted down in the wake of the country’s tsunami, nuclear power supplied about 30 per cent of Japan’s electricity. But most of the country’s 50-odd surviving reactors have been kept closed since then pending safety reviews.Japan’s thirst for US shale oil and gas could grow further if a US-led effort to tighten economic sanctions on Iran forces it to stop buying oil from the country, currently the source of 10 per cent of its crude imports.
45;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2012-01-03T22:18:50Z;Miners rally on Chinese economic data;;Energy and material stocks gave Wall Street a new year bounce as miners and steelmakers rallied on economic data from China.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China for use in steelmaking, climbed 8 per cent to $22.07 after the official Chinese purchasing managers’ index moved back above 50 for December, suggesting China’s factories expanded output. US Steel Corp climbed 5.9 per cent to $28.03.The S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent to 1,277.05, led by financials, with Citigroup climbing 7.7 per cent to $28.33 and Morgan Stanley up 6.3 per cent to $16.08The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 12,397.31 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.7 per cent to 2,648.72.“Technically, stocks enjoy a seasonal tailwind early in the first quarter,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, who said the S&P 500 could be set for “an attack on the 1,300 area” if cyclical sectors rally.Oil explorers and producers gained as the price of crude oil rose after Iran made threats over a US aircraft carrier near its waters.Driller and oilfield services provider Nabors Industries jumped 9.7 per cent to $19.02 for the best performance in the S&P 500 and oil producer Denbury Resources climbed 7.9 per cent to $16.29.A rash of joint venture deals announced between US explorers and foreign companies provided more evidence of rising prices for drilling rights in booming shale plays.Chesapeake Energy closed up 5.9 per cent to $23.60, after announcing a joint venture with French oil group Total.Chesapeake’s Total deal comes on top of existing joint ventures with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation but, despite the company’s apparent ability to generate cash from its shale acquisitions, its share price has fallen significantly over the past year.Analysts point to the company’s failure to bring its debt level to less than $10bn.“The key now will be to see how much [of the Total deal] flows through to debt reduction,” said Tim Rezvan at Sterne Agee. “Spending has been out of control at Chesapeake without the transparency of other companies,” he added.Devon Energy climbed 6.6 per cent to $66.11 after announcing a transaction with Sinopec International, another Chinese oil company, which will take a one-third interest in five separate Devon ventures for $2.2bn.Oilfield services provider Halliburton was a rare faller, closing 1 per cent lower at $34.15, as BPproceeded with plans to recover all costs related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from the company.A Washington court’s decision to delay implementation of Environmental Protection Agency rules on interstate air pollution wreaked havoc among coal miners and utilities.The EPA rules, which were meant to be effective from January 1, aim to curb mercury and sulphur emissions from power stations.Coal miner Peabody Energy rose 8.8 per cent to $36.01, while Consol Energy, which operates coal-fired power stations, climbed 6.1 per cent to $38.93.But not all analysts were convinced by the rally. “This is just a temporary reprieve,” said Brandon Blossman, of Tudor Pickering. “Clean air regulations have been moving along for the last 30 years and this is just the latest incarnation. The industry is not going to reverse the trend.”Non-coal utilities had rallied strongly since the EPA first announced the new clean air rules on December 21, but gave up gains on Tuesday. Gas focused Public Service Enterprise Group fell 3.6 per cent to $31.81 and FirstEnergy fell 3.4 per cent to $42.81.Wynn Resorts climbed 3.2 per cent to $113.97. The casino and resort company was boosted by news that gaming revenues in Macao had surged in 2011.Fears that scarcer credit in China would lead to a fall in junket tourism by Chinese businesses to Macao had weighed heavily on Wynn in 2011.Shares in Tenet Healthcare slumped 3.3 per cent to $4.96 as Citigroup analysts downgraded the stock and told clients to brace themselves for “a long bear market in US entitlement spending”.Gary Taylor, of Citigroup, said Medicare-exposed companies could suffer revenue squeezes as healthcare spending becomes a target of government spending cuts.Barclays Capital analysts were bullish on semiconductor stocks, arguing that manufacturers have almost completed the process of running down excess inventory.“We expect demand trends to begin to outpace end-market growth beginning in [the second quarter of] 2012, enabling overall semi revenue growth of flat to 4 per cent in 2012,” said C.J. Muse of Barclays Capital. Micron Technology surged 7.3 per cent to $6.75, as Barclays Capital recommended that clients buy the stock.Shares in Californian rare-earth miner Molycorp climbed 4.8 per cent to $25.12 after the company said more than three-quarters of phase-one production at its flagship California manufacturing facility had been committed to customer orders or internal use.
46;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;China and France chase US shale assets;;Chinese and French companies have announced large investments in US shale oil and gas projects as they seek to benefit from the country’s controversial boom in “unconventional” resources.Sinopec, China’s second-largest oil company by market capitalisation, unveiled a $2.5bn deal with Oklahoma-based Devon Energy to invest in five new development areas from Ohio to Alabama.Separately, Total of France is investing $2.3bn in an Ohio oil and gas joint venture with Chesapeake Energy and EnerVest of the US.International groups are still keen to increase their exposure to unconventional US energy resources despite the environmental controversy over “fracking”, the injection of water, sand and chemicals into wells to crack rocks and release oil and gas.The exploration technique has been banned in France. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, has expressed fears about the process “massacring” the French landscape.Last week, the state of Ohio ordered a halt to well operations in an area near Youngstown for fear they were linked to a series of small earthquakes. Yves-Louis Darricarrère, Total’s head of exploration and production, said he was “conscious of the environmental aspects linked to developing shale acreage” but was confident in “Chesapeake’s capacity to manage the operations in a responsible manner”.Foreign companies have been shifting their focus from gas, prices for which have plunged, to oil. Devon’s deal with Sinopec also reflects Chinese companies’ hopes that techniques pioneered in the US could be used to develop China’s own resources. Sinopec is taking one third of Devon’s stake in the five oil projects but will pay 80 per cent of the development costs, or up to $1.6bn, as well as paying $900m in cash.Devon has a strong balance sheet with $6.8bn in cash, but most is held offshore and liable for tax if repatriated to the US. That makes it more attractive for the company to seek other funding for its American projects.Total’s deal has a similar structure. It is taking 25 per cent of a new joint venture in Ohio’s Utica formation with Chesapeake and EnerVest and committing to pay 60 per cent of its partners’ future development costs of up to $1.63bn, as well as paying $700m in cash.The proceeds will go to help reduce Chesapeake’s debts, which have been built up by aggressive acquisition of drilling rights in unconventional resource areas. Its long-term net debts were $11.8bn at the end of September, down slightly from $12.6bn at the end of 2010. Chesapeake first revealed the plan to form the joint venture, without naming Total as its partner, in November.Mr Darricarrère said the value of the deal was “predominantly linked to oil prices”, which have remained buoyant at more than $100 a barrel as gas prices have fallen. The company is involved in shale developments in Argentina, Bolivia and Europe, and has also invested in Canadian oil sands.Total said last October that it could work with Sinopec to explore shale gas developments. Two years ago, Total and Chesapeake agreed a joint venture in which the French company took a 25 per cent stake in shale assets in Texas for up to $2.25bn. Total believes the Utica development could contribute 100,000 barrels a day to its oil and gas production by 2020, or 3.5 per cent of its overall production.
47;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-12-01T19:44:27Z;BP sells package of gas assets for $1.67bn;;The stream of assets being sold by BP has continued with its disposal of a North American business that pipes and stores natural gas across Canada and the US Midwest for $1.67bn.The deal involves a subsidiary of Houston-based Plains All American Pipeline acquiring ownership or rights to 4,000km of pipeline systems, along with 21m barrels of storage and additional gas processing capacity in the region.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, insisted that the transaction would not compromise the UK-based energy group’s exploration and production commitment to Canada.Its operations in the country include a number of oil sands projects and offshore ventures across Alberta, the Northwest Territories and Canadian territorial waters in the Beaufort Sea bordering north Alaska.“Canada remains an important part of our portfolio of growth opportunities to meet North America’s energy needs,” Mr Dudley said on Thursday.Agreement on the disposal of part of its operations in Canada follows the collapse of BP’s $7.1bn deal to sell a majority stake in Argentina’s second-largest oil producer to Bridas in November.The failed Argentinian sale was one of the largest single disposals that BP had agreed in its effort to raise money to help meet the costs of last year’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It would have seen BP move near to raising about $26bn of its $45bn disposal target flagged in October.Thursday’s deal in Canada means BP has instead hit $21bn in sales agreements against a modified total target of $38m since announcing its asset sale programme.The move involves the transfer of about 450 staff to the acquirer’s subsidiary, Plains Midstream, upon completion of the sale which is expected by the middle of next year. BP’s Canadian midstream business had been up for sale for more than a year as part of a portfolio of businesses viewed as “long in the tooth” with limited growth potential compared with exploration assets, according to the company.BP Canada, based in Calgary, has partnered with Husky Energy to exploit oil sand deposits in the northeastern Athabasca region of Alberta. It has also struck joint venture deals with Devon Energy and Value Creation to exploit other oil sand leases in Alberta.In spite of the planned divestment of its Canadian midstream business, BP argues that the resource potential of these projects could help provide a secure, profitable source of oil supply across North America.Shares in BP rose 6.4p to 454.35p on Thursday, up 5 per cent over the past year but still below peaks of above 650p before last April’s disaster. Shares in Plains rose $1.17 to $66.03.
48;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-10-12T20:34:28Z;Devon faces US tax if it repatriates cash pile;;Devon Energy will have to pay US corporation tax on the $6.5bn cash it holds outside the US if it repatriates it, the energy company’s chief executive has said.It amassed the money last year when it withdrew from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the oil and gas industry outside the US and Canada to concentrate on onshore oil and gas development in North America.Many US companies, including Microsoft, Google and Apple, have large offshore cash holdings that would be liable for tax if brought onshore, inspiring a campaign by businesses for tax reform that would encourage that money to flow back home. Under the US system, which taxes a company’s worldwide earnings regardless of where they are made, companies are allowed an exemption for profits not repatriated to the US.Devon sold assets in Brazil, Azerbaijan and the Gulf for more than $10bn, raising about $8bn after local taxes. Overseas proceeds brought home will face US corporation tax of up to 35 per cent, although a deduction is allowed for foreign taxes already paid.Devon is in a tight spot because it has tightened its strategy to focus exclusively on North America, so it has few attractive options for using it.John Richels, chief executive, said he was hoping for tax reform that would make it possible to bring the cash into the US without paying the full rate of tax on it. “We’re hoping the Obama administration sees the wisdom in bringing that money back to the US. There’s $1,500bn sitting offshore right now. It makes sense to get that back to stimulate the economy.”Senators Kay Hagan, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, last week presented a bill that would create a temporary tax “holiday”, allowing earnings to be repatriated at a tax rate of just 8.75 per cent for a year.The move was welcomed by several business leaders, including executives at Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, and Duke Energy, but still faces scepticism in Congress and the administration.
49;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-10-10T16:35:26Z;Interview: John Richels – ‘Why environmentalists have got things wrong’;;For John Richels, chief executive of Oklahoma-based Devon Energy, investing in Canada’s oil and natural gasfields is a no-brainer.Not only is the resource base among the biggest in the world, but, at 170bn barrels of oil sands reserves alone, in a friendly neighbouring country, it represents the holy grail to the US, which for decades has talked about the need for a secure and stable energy source.That is why he is so annoyed by the environmentalist movement that has built up in the US to block the import of the 97 per cent of Canada’s reserves that are in oil sands.“For us not to take that oil from Canada makes absolutely no sense,” Mr Richels says in an interview. “If we don’t use it, it will go somewhere else. We will continue to be more dependent on foreign sources of oil in less friendly and less stable places.”Devon is among the largest independent gas and oil producers in Canada. The company does it all there – conventional oil production, oil sands and shale gas, and has been an innovator in reducing its carbon footprint.Mr Richels takes issue with the activists threatening to block the Keystone XL pipeline to deliver fuel from the Alberta oil sands to the US.They have staged White House protests, marches and a big media campaign to persuade the Obama administration that the president would be selling out the environmentalist constituency by approving the proposed 2,700km pipeline that would link Alberta to the US Gulf coast.The main objection by activists is that the oil sands start out as bitumen, making oil production more carbon-intensive than conventional fuel.But Mr Richels says that, as projects develop, the most carbon-intensive production – open-pit mining – should represent just 20 per cent of oil sands output, because that is how much of the oil is accessible through mining.The remaining 80 per cent can only be reached through technology such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), a process that requires heating the bitumen so it flows to the surface.Open-pit mining operations are criticised for big tailings ponds, but SAGD has none.Another criticism is that oil sands production risks polluting Canada’s pristine water systems. Yet, Mr Richels says, Devon uses saline water from deep underground in its operations – a procedure others have also adopted. “We only use fresh water, so our guys can have showers and heat oatmeal,” he says.He takes issue with the charge that oil sands production leaves a big environmental footprint.Conventional oil production would use 150 times more surface area than SAGD oil sands production, Mr Richels says.He insists that carbon dioxide emissions created by SAGD by burning natural gas to heat water to create steam to soften the bitumen are no greater than those in the output from California’s heavy oilfields, which have been under production for the past 50 years. On top of that, the industry is using solvents and other technologies further to reduce the amount of gas needed in the process. “We’re getting more efficient over time,” he says.These issues, he believes, pale in comparison with the benefit of the oil sands fuel to the US. “Keystone XL is critical to making sure we’re going to have a stable source of oil over the long haul,” Mr Richels says.The industry estimates that the $7bn project would create 20,000 jobs – a fact he believes will lead to its approval, in view of the high rates of unemployment in the weak US economy.Nonetheless, Mr Richels believes Canada could develop alternate export markets for at least its oil sands fuel. He says there are already calls to export gas to Asia through the Kitimat LNG project.While the US still imports, on a net basis, 7bn cubic feet of natural gas from Canada a day, the technological breakthrough in shale gas has meant the US will need less gas than expected.But there is no doubt in his mind that Canada’s natural gas and oil will be in high demand globally, given the growing needs of Asia and Africa.Producers are finding Alberta a welcoming place to work, with a tax regime that Mr Richels characterises as being friendlier than the US.While Alberta had “hit a speed bump” in attempting to increase its royalties when commodity prices spiked several years ago, the setback had been short-lived.“Once they did it, they realised it was the wrong thing to do.” Alberta has since revised its royalty regime to make it more favourable for the industry.“It’s a good lesson,” Mr Richels says. “Having a regulatory regime that is uncertain is bad. They saw that in Alberta and have done a lot to fix it.”
50;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-09-18T16:53:12Z;BG Group: reserves oil China interest;UK independent is sitting pretty in Brazil, having doubled reserves estimates;The prettiest girl at the dance will always get the most attention from the boys – especially rich ones. Reports that Chinese suitors have approached BG Group with a view to buying into the UK company’s Brazilian bonanza make sense: BG is sitting very pretty indeed in Brazil, having doubled its reserves estimates in the Santos Basin to 6bn barrels.That is potentially a game-changer for BG, yet it has barely moved the needle for investors. BG’s share price has only slightly outperformed, declining 4 per cent since the announcement against a 6 per cent fall for the sector. That suggests that investors are still unsure what the additional reserves are worth. One way for BG to help them make up their minds would be to sell a stake to a strategic investor.After all, doubt over whether it has the financial and operational heft to finance its 27 per cent share of the Santos Basin production costs is one factor weighing on BG’s shares. The group is spending $10bn a year on capital investment and is already highly geared – 24 per cent at the end of June compared to 12 per cent at Shell, for example. Farming out a stake to, say, an Asian national oil company, would address the financing issue.What price would such assets fetch? Credit Suisse estimates that BG’s incremental reserves are worth $3 a barrel – or about $9bn. Deals in Brazilian waters have an oddly wide range, from BP’s $7bn purchase of Devon Energy’s (mostly exploration) assets in 2010 to Repsol’s sale of 40 per cent of its Brazilian assets to Sinopec last October for the equivalent of $15 a barrel.Investors may soon get a more accurate steer, however. Portugal’s Galp is poised to offload a stake in its Santos Basin interests for around $2bn by year-end, with Asian NOCs said to be at the front of the queue. The assets are similar to BG’s, so terms should set a benchmark. Until then, BG should keep on dancing.
51;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-08-31T18:17:29Z;BP: playing Russian roulette;The company displays a remarkable talent in making enemies;BP has a remarkable ability to make enemies in Russia. As bailiffs raided one of its Moscow offices on Wednesday, it was hard to avoid the sinking feeling that it may once again be on the wrong side of the authorities there. A day after BP was elbowed aside by ExxonMobil as the preferred Arctic exploration partner for Rosneft, the omens do not look good. The raid may be a temporary setback. The real worry is the extent to which its Russia woes reveal a growing gulf between BP and its peers.Contrary to perceptions, BP has not been standing still operationally since April 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon disaster began. It has won final approval for two huge new ventures – the $7bn purchase of Devon Energy’s oilfields in Brazil, and the $7.2bn Indian gas deal with Reliance Industries – and sealed valuable smaller projects. These are the types of venture that leverage BP’s upstream expertise, which remains second to none.Yet a share price drifting along at under 400p suggests that investors are not convinced that they amount to a strategy. That is the biggest problem for BP’s two key leaders – chief executive Bob Dudley and chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg. The two oversold the Rosneft alliance, which was more grandiose and less commercially solid than they claimed. Add the financial and legal straitjacket in which BP operates after the Gulf of Mexico accident and the underperformance against its peers looks justified. The company also faces the same structural challenges as the wider industry, including a slowing global economy and higher upstream costs.Messrs Dudley and Svanberg need to prove that they can recapture BP’s lost value. Investors deserve reassurance that they can make the difficult decisions required to do so – up to and including separation of BP’s upstream and downstream operations. As the Exxon/Rosneft deal shows, time is running out. For all that it is hemmed in by its immediate past, Messrs Dudley and Svanberg must not allow BP to be defined by its mistakes.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
52;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-06-30T21:02:08Z;Tech stocks lead gains on Wall Street;;Wall Street concluded the final session of a mostly depressed and volatile quarter on a positive note as upbeat economic data lifted sentiment and investors began to position themselves long in anticipation of a healthy forthcoming earnings season.The technology sector saw some of the strongest gains helped by First Solar, the largest solar power company by market capitalisation, which rose 2.2 per cent to $132.27 after it won $4.5bn in loan guarantees from the US department of energy for three projects it is developing in California.Elsewhere in the sector Hewlett-Packard was up 2.4 per cent to $36.40 while Intel added 3.6 per cent to $22.16. The S&P information technology index rose 1.4 per cent, adding to the 3.5 per cent gains earlier in the week.Ebay, the online marketplace which owns PayPal, rose 4.6 per cent to $32.27, benefiting from a number of ratings upgrades following news on Wednesday that third-party payment systems like PayPal will likely not be subject to new rules limiting credit charge transaction payments.These gains left the S&P 500 up 1 per cent at 1,320.64, adding to the 3.1 per cent gains earlier in the week and helping the index break through its psychologically significant 100-day moving average line.The rally was broad based, with all 10 big S&P sectors moving higher, as sentiment across the board was lifted by news that business conditions in the Chicago area had improved unexpectedly in June.The Chicago purchasing managers index rose to 61.1 this month, which exceeded the 54 reading that had been expected by economists and was up 4.5 points from May. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion. The Chicago PMI is seen as a leading indicator for the national ISM factory index, due on Friday.The strong PMI data lifted the industrial sector in particular. Joy Global led the gains, rising 5.7 per cent to $95.24 while Cummins added 2.4 per cent to $103.49.The S&P industrial sector was up 1.7 per cent – the best performing on Wall Street – adding to the 2.9 per cent gains earlier in the week.The PMI news helped investors shrug off disappointing data from the labour department showing that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits was mostly unchanged last week, falling only 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000.Investors were also unperturbed that Thursday marked the end of the Federal Reserve’s second round of quantitative easing, a $600bn bond-buying programme that has helped buoy the markets since the plan was floated last August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent at 12,414.34, also helped by energy and material stocks as commodity prices ticked up. The index was up 0.8 per cent over the quarter and up 7.2 per cent over the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2 per cent to 2,773.52, but was down 0.3 per cent over the quarter.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 5.4 per cent to 16.34 in the session as investors positioned for a steady climb in the equity markets.“A big part of what is driving the market right now is people positioning themselves for a strong earnings season,” said Rex Macey, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. The earnings season starts in earnest on July 11 when Alcoa reports.Stocks are also benefiting from the belief that the 7.2 per cent losses on the S&P from the May high to the June low has left the markets oversold.“The recent pull-back provides a buying opportunity,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Collectively we forecast double-digit gains for equity markets in second half 2011.”The second quarter on Wall Street started with a month of modest 2.9 per cent gains on the S&P, but then weak economic numbers on employment, manufacturing and gross domestic product left sentiment in the doldrums from the end of April until last week.The S&P 500 saw six straight weeks of losses from the start of May, the longest run of declines since June and July 2008. If not for a 0.04 per cent gain on week seven, the markets would have seen the longest run of weekly losses in a decade.But last Friday the big indices on Wall Street bumped into some technical support levels, convincing traders that the markets were oversold after such a long time in the doldrums. Sentiment has also been helped by some positive news out of Greece and expectations that the upcoming earnings season will be broadly positive.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent in the quarter, but was still up 5 per cent over the year to date.
53;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-05-29T18:21:58Z;Supermajors seek the right balance;;"As the 20th century drew to a close, the US oil and gas industry went on a buying spree, forming supermajors such as ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips.The idea was to gain economies of scale and hedge against tough times and costs associated with exploration, production and refining. By 2008, rising oil and natural gas prices rewarded them with strong profits.“That increase in oil prices camouflaged or distracted attention away from the structural changes taking place,’” says Praveen Kumar, director of the global energy management institute at the University of Houston.Resources were harder to come by, with maturing fields and the rise of resource nationalism and competition from national oil companies. The supermajors scrambled to buy what they could – Canada’s oil sands, global deepwater, and US shale – all of which were more expensive to develop than conventional resources.“Even if you now have a promising find, the amount of money needed to exploit is higher than in the past,’’ Mr Kumar adds.To fund these projects, companies are now selling non-core, mature or politically risky assets. Several companies have aggressively pursued a shrink to grow strategy. At Exxon’s annual shareholders’ meeting on May 25, investors pressed the company, as they have in the past, for clarity on its future direction.Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips have been rewarded with a rise in their share prices since the start of the year. Even BP, forced by the Macondo disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to sell assets to raise cash, has been rewarded by investors.“We had more opportunities than we could reasonably develop,’’ says John Richels, Devon’s chief executive. “We decided to focus on the biggest piece – 90 per cent of our portfolio was onshore North America.”In November 2009, Devon began selling its international and deepwater assets, hoping to gain up to $7.5bn before taxes; it brought in $10.1bn before taxes. Yet some investors questioned selling oil assets prized in the market.“If you don’t have some sort of competitive advantage, you shouldn’t compete in that area,” Mr Richels says.It is a lesson sometimes forgotten as companies strive to grow. For Paul Sankey, analyst at Deutsche Bank, it raises the question for others in the industry: “Why are you holding on to non-core assets worth more to other companies?”Jim Mulva, Conoco chief executive, admits he was late taking stock. This was driven home when commodity prices fell off their record highs with the downturn in late 2008.In early 2009, Conoco, the third-biggest oil and gas company in the US by production and market capitalisation, disclosed a 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn; a $34bn writedown; 1,300 job cuts and a $2.8bn cut in capital spending.“We did an assessment of the business environment, opportunities, risk reward and value creation, but not as quickly as we could have,” he says. “We could and should have done it sooner. We were spending more capital than we had cash flow on opportunities that were not value creating.”Putting an end to that yielded such a positive response by investors that in March Conoco said it would shed an additional $5bn-$10bn in assets during the next two years on top of $7bn sold last year.However, Mr Kumar warns any strategy carries risks. By shrinking too much, companies lose the hedges provided by diversified portfolios.This is especially important for the exploration and production segment, which is exposed to multiple risks, such as high commodity price volatility, environmental accidents and expropriation of assets by foreign governments.For example, Seahawk Drilling filed for bankruptcy this year after the drilling moratorium following BP’s spill brought its Gulf of Mexico-focused business to a standstill.Devon is maintaining diversification, with its oil sands business in Canada and shale and conventional oil and gas exploration and production in the US. Conoco is holding on to refining with its exploration and production. In addition, Conoco says it may spend an additional $2.5bn this year on capital expenditures if the right opportunities arise in deepwater or shale.“You need to use a certain amount of money to invest for returns,” Mr Mulva says. “We have found the right balance.”"
54;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-05-11T01:51:12Z;BP gets final approval to buy Brazilian oilfields;;BP, the UK oil company, has received final approval to complete the purchase of 10 exploration and production blocks in Brazil from Devon Energy.The regulatory approvals announced on Tuesday were the last required to conclude the purchase announced in March 2010, as Devon sold offshore and international assets to focus on North America onshore projects.The blocks give BP a broad deepwater exploration acreage position in an oil-rich region off Brazil, as well as two onshore licenses.They follow the acquisition BP completed last month of majority control in Companhia Nacional de Acucar e Alcool, a Brazilian producer of ethanol and sugar. BP paid about $680m to acquire 83 per cent of the shares and refinance the company’s long-term debt. It is now responsible for operating two ethanol plants with processing capacity of 5m tons of sugar cane per year.The recent surge in energy prices has improved the economic competitiveness of plant-derived fuels, and the world’s biggest oil companies are investing increasing amounts in the sector. BP’s Brazilian deal is the largest so far for its alternative energy business.BP forecasts alternatives will be the fastest-growing energy sector over the next 20 years, with global biofuels production projected to more than triple.But there is no doubt oil will continue as the priority.BP had been eager for some time to get into Brazil, but other routes, such as participating in licensing rounds, appeared less attractive.The assets BP is acquiring from Devon are in the Campos basin, which historically has been less known for oil discoveries than the Santos basin to the south, but analysts believe they still contain significant potential.
55;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-03-03T19:07:25Z;US groups unlock secret recipe for oil;;"As the revolutions in the Middle East revive concerns about US reliance on foreign oil, it is not widely appreciated that that dependence has been falling for the past five years, and could well drop for the next five at least.Energy independence is still a distant prospect; the US imports about 60 per cent of its crude oil and will not be able to replace all of those foreign supplies for the foreseeable future.Tim Geithner, US Treasury Secretary, said that strategic oil reserves could be used if necessary to mitigate any “severe, sustained supply disruption”.“It is important to note that there is considerable spare oil production capacity globally, and we and other major economies possess substantial strategic reserves of oil,” he told the Senate Foreign Relations committee.But a revival in the domestic oil industry, driven by the exploitation of “unconventional” reserves such as shale oil, has for the past two years reversed the steady decline of US production that began in 1985.M. King Hubbert, a Shell Oil geologist, predicted in 1956 that US oil production would peak by the early 1970s; a forecast that proved accurate for the states outside Alaska. For a long time permanent decline in the “lower 48” states seemed inevitable, but not any more.Onshore drilling for oil has risen to a level not seen in two decades, as small and mid-sized companies apply to a variety of oil reserves across the US the same technology that brought about the shale gas boom.Hydraulic fracturing – pumping in water mixed with chemical additives – and horizontal drilling into shale rock have enabled the US to open up new gas resources. Its estimated reserves would now last 100 years at present rates of usage, instead of 30 as previously thought.That same technology is increasing oil production from a wide range of rocks.Dave Hager, the head of exploration and production at Devon Energy, one of the companies pioneering America’s oil renaissance, says: “What people realise now is that the technology also applies to other geologic areas.”According to Baker Hughes, the oil services company, the number of onshore oil-directed rigs recently hit its highest level since 1987, at 818 for the first week of February. That was almost double the number last year and as much as eight times the number active in the late 1990s.“This is getting at a resource not currently booked and often overlooked,” said Raoul LeBlanc, senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy.“You can employ these technologies to enhance everything: sometimes you just get the oil and gas out faster; sometimes you get more out.’’Chevron, the second-largest US oil group, is one of the larger companies seeking to do more in unconventional oil, and is looking at the Permian Basin in west Texas, which holds 24 per cent of US oil reserves. The basin has been producing since the 1920s, but the resources that are left are increasingly difficult to extract.Companies believe the new technology may open up a new phase of economic production in the Permian.In one example, Chevron has used hydraulic fracturing in a pilot project that enabled it to convert a gas field into an oil field that has produced 3.5m barrels.“The field had no oil reserves on the books,” said Mitch Mamoulides, Chevron’s manager for the Permian South.“Tight rock carbonate is full of hydrocarbons that we haven’t been able to unleash,’’ Mr Mamoulides said. “We are going to unlock layer after layer.”The success of these US companies have attracted interest from all over the world; particularly China, which has equally pressing concerns about energy security, and wants to learn these new techniques.“It’s not that you are going to keep the recipe secret from the rest of the world,’’ said Fadel Gheit, senior oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer.“The foreign players are here to learn.”Additional reporting by Robin Harding in Washington"
56;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2011-03-02T23:00:32Z;US oil production revives despite offshore disruption;;"US oil production last year rose to its highest level in almost a decade, thanks to an increase in the use of “unconventional” extraction techniques.As a result, analysts believe the US was the largest contributor to the increase in global oil supplies last year over 2009, and is on track to increase domestic production by 25 per cent by the second half of the decade.The rise would still not be enough to end America’s dependence on imported oil, which accounted for roughly half of US demand in 2010.But it would reduce the country’s vulnerability to supply shocks and its trade deficit.According to the US government’s Energy Information Administration, domestic production of crude oil and related liquids rose 3 per cent last year to an average of 7.51m barrels a day – its highest level since 2002.The rise enabled a 2 per cent drop in US oil imports to 9.45m b/d, in spite of rising demand as the economy recovered. US oil imports have fallen steadily since 2006.The revival of US production has been made possible by a rush of small and mid-sized companies into onshore regions such as the Bakken shale in North Dakota, the Permian Basin in west Texas and the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas.North Dakota’s production has doubled since 2008, reaching 355,000 b/d in November. Extraction of oil reserves in these regions was thought to be uneconomic, but has been made commercially viable by the transfer of techniques successfully used to extract shale gas; in particular, long horizontal wells and “fracking”, pumping water under high pressure to crack the rock and enable the oil to flow.Dave Hager, vice-president for exploration and production at Devon Energy, one of the companies pioneering the development of the new onshore fields, said new technology had transformed production economics at its mixed gas and oilfields in north Texas.“We see a bright future in these and other plays in north America,” he said.With weak US gas prices , companies such as Devon have been shifting drilling rigs and other equipment into oilfields.According to analysts at Credit Suisse, by 2016 the US could be producing an additional 2.5m b/d more oil, with the increase divided equally between deep-water fields in the Gulf of Mexico and new onshore sources.“This is the technology that is hot,” said Fadel Gheit, senior oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “Most of the money and brainpower has shifted to oil. It gives them the biggest bang for their bucks.”However, the industry faces a threat from environmental objections to the use of fracking, because of fears that the fluids used, which are mostly water with chemical additives, could contaminate drinking water supplies."
57;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-12-23T13:12:59Z;Maersk buys SK Energy’s Brazil stakes;;AP Møller-Maersk, the Danish-based shipping and oil group, is buying the Brazilian oil interests of SK Energy, South Korea’s largest oil refiner, for $2.4bn.Maersk, the Nordic region’s second-largest oil producer, will acquire a 40 per cent stake in the Polvo field, a 20 per cent stake in the Wahoo discovery and a 27 per cent stake in the Itaipu discovery.“This investment will contribute significantly to replacing Maersk Oil’s reserves in the long term as we expand in one of the world’s most attractive regions for the exploration and production industry,” said Nils Smedegaard Andersen, Maersk’s chief executive.The move marks the Danish company’s most substantial acquisition since it posted its first ever annual loss in 2009.The company is expecting to achieve a strong earnings rebound in 2010 on the back of an efficiency drive, improved oil prices and higher shipping volumes.The Brazilian acquisitions will not immediately augment group earnings, Mr Andersen told the Financial Times. “In the short term it will increase our spending on appraisals and exploration drillings.”At 10,000 barrels of oil a day, the existing production capacity in the Polvo Field represents a minute fraction of Maersk’s current global production of around 600,000 barrels daily.“The reason why we’re buying it is not because of the production but because we’re interested in the two blocks where there’s additional exploration opportunities,” Mr Andersen said.New production in the Itaipu or Wahoo fields, or both, would not happen before 2017 or 2018, he said.The sale of SK do Brasil is subject to regulatory approval from the Brazilian government. Following the approval, Maersk will replace Devon as the operator of Polvo and Itaipu.Maersk, which like other European oil operators is faced with dwindling reserves in the North Sea, has been looking to Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, Angola and Greenland to revive production growth.“Brazil is a very promising country. We’ve also just acquired 50 per cent of the Santos terminal which will be ready for business in 2012,” Mr Andersen said.“But we’re also looking elsewhere. We have our focus areas in the North Sea, Angola, Algeria, the Middle East and so on, and we will be looking at opportunities as they arise.”SK Energy said the stake sale was part of its efforts to readjust its business portfolio and improve South Korea’s energy security.It said the money from the stake sale would allow it to seek opportunities abroad by buying overseas oil fields on the verge of production and by taking over foreign oil developers.It also plans to increase production volume by accelerating exploration and development projects in promising oil fields in Vietnam, Peru and Colombia.
58;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-12-07T19:49:16Z;US independents to buy into shale oil boom;;Plunging US natural gas prices are pushing independents that have long focused on gas to buy into the shale oil boom.To finance the switch they are selling their traditional businesses to cash-rich foreigners or international oil companies that can afford to wait for the rebound in gas prices.The independents have also to search for shale oil acreage, which is growing increasingly expensive with the rush to use new technology and expertise to reach this long-ignored resource.Yet companies have a strong motive to make the transition, says Raoul LeBlanc, senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy. An mcf (thousand cubic feet) of US natural gas has historically sold for a tenth of the price of a barrel of oil, he says. But now that gap has widened and one mcf of gas is selling for one twentieth or even less of the price of a barrel of oil.“Almost everyone went too heavily into gas, thinking it was nirvana,” says Mr LeBlanc. “Everybody is trying to make a shift now. But like the Three Stooges all trying to go through a door, they can’t all fit.”Gary Flaharty, vice-president of investor relations at Baker Hughes, said the number of rigs focused on drilling for oil in the US had gone from 180 in May 2009, a low point, to 720 in November 2010. He expects that number to grow in 2011 as gas-directed drilling stays flat.EOG was among the first gas-focused independents to see the potential and in 2008 began snapping up acreage in the liquids-rich portions of the Bakken shale of North Dakota and Eagle Ford shale in Texas ahead of its competitors.The company projects that it will have gone from deriving 23 per cent of its north America revenue from liquids and 77 per cent dry gas in 2007 to 67 per cent liquids and 33 per cent dry gas by 2011.Even tiny companies are turning to oil. Nick Atencio, chief executive and director of Mainland Resources, a six-man company that has until now been focused on shale gas, is planning to try its hand at producing oil from shale in some new acreage picked up in Mississippi. “We’re just getting into it right now,” he says.Deals continue to be struck. Williams, a gas transport and production company, announced last month that it would pay $925m to an undisclosed seller for shale oil acreage in North Dakota’s Bakken formation.“If they don’t have an oil or liquids footprint, they’re trying to get one,” says Jon Wolff, a managing director at Credit Suisse.“There are countless examples.”Yet many independents are too strapped for cash to make the transition, given low cash flows from their dry gas-producing assets.The shale gas boom has pushed down US gas prices to the $3-$4 per million British thermal units range, from the 2008 record high of $13.69 per mBtu. Meanwhile, the rush to shale oil has pushed prices as high as $12,000 per acre in some areas, up from the $300 it was fetching just two years ago.To fund the switch, the independents must sell dry gas acreage, Mr Wolff said, noting this is something Range Resources, PetroHawk and EOG, have all announced plans to do.EOG said last month it would sell a portion of its Marcellus shale position to Newfield Exploration for $405m as part of efforts to unload $1bn of dry gas assets by year-end.Mr Wolff says those still keen to buy dry gas acreage are companies that can wait for prices to rebound.Chevron, the US’s second biggest oil and gas company, is a good example. It has just paid $4.3bn to buy Atlas Energy, which has a strong position in the Marcellus shale, a giant, dry gas field.Those with stronger balance sheets, such as Devon Energy, are hanging on to dry gas assets while they reposition rigs in liquids-rich areas.It plans to spend about 90 per cent of its capital expenditure on oil- and liquids-rich drilling next year. Devon expects capital expenditure for exploration and production to be between $4.5bn and $4.9bn, subject to board approval.
59;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-10-25T16:07:23Z;BP to sell four Gulf of Mexico fields;;"BP has agreed to sell its interests in four deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Japan’s Marubeni Oil for $650m (£414m).The assets, which BP said produce 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d), were purchased from the Oklahoma-based US company Devon Energy in March in a £7bn all-cash deal that included assets in Azerbaijan and Brazil.BP has been looking to reduce the number of operatorships it holds in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a move to cut its capital spending and rebalance its portfolio of assets in the wake of the Macondo oil spill disaster.BP said the spill affected only the timing of the disposal: “It’s about keeping the things that have big potential for growth and selling off those that don’t. We would have disposed of them at some point; the decision to get rid of them is nothing to do with Macondo although the timing has been accelerated.”The principal assets sold are mature fields in the western and central Gulf of Mexico. They include interests in the ConocoPhillips-operated Magnolia field, the Anadarko Petroleum operated Merganser and Nansen fields and an operating interest in the Zia field.BP shares rose 0.45p to 429.15p on Monday.Gordon Gray, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said: “The point is that BP did a deal with Devon pre-Macondo, which included a bundle of Gulf of Mexico assets. Some of them were not a logical strategic fit so it makes commercial sense to sell. This would have happened anyway – it doesn’t presage a wider sell-off in the Gulf of Mexico.”The Devon deal was primarily done to acquire eight licence blocks in offshore Brazil, whose deep water fields are estimated to hold at least 80bn barrels of oil, as well as deep water assets in the Gulf of Mexico that BP will retain.Andy Hopwood, BP executive vice-president, said: “When BP acquired Devon’s Gulf of Mexico assets it was clear that these four fields did not fit well with the rest of our business in the region.”The UK oil group produces from more than 20 deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and is the biggest operator in the region, with net production of 400,000 boe/d, according to the company. Until the Macondo oil spill disaster on April 20, the US was BP’s principal strategic focus but the company now faces a challenge to restore its reputation."
60;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-10-07T06:47:02Z;BP signs deal to develop Azerbaijan gas field;;Bob Dudley, the new chief executive of BP, has signed a deal to develop a huge natural gas field in Azerbaijan, underscoring the country’s importance to the UK energy group as it tries to recover from its spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The agreement to develop the Shafaq-Asiman field, which is 125km south-east of Baku and in deep water, was signed in the Azeri capital by Rovnag Abdullayev, president of Socar, the Azerbaijan national oil company, and Rashid Javanshir, president of BP Azerbaijan.“This is an important day for Azerbaijan and BP as it marks the beginning of our bilateral co-operation in exploration and development of a new offshore block. With Socar and our partners BP has helped to establish Azerbaijan as a world scale oil and gas producer, and I believe the significant remaining potential will continue to make it relevant for decades to come,” Mr Dudley said.The deal, which has been under discussion for some time, is structured as a 50:50 production-sharing agreement over 30 years.The gas field has estimated reserves of 17,000bn cu ft, according to Socar, which would put it on a par with its huge Shah Deniz gas field in which BP has a 25.5 per cent stake.It covers an area of some 1,100 square kilometres and has never been explored before, BP said. The field is located in a deepwater section of about 650m-800m with reservoir depth of about 7,000m.Azerbaijan is an important area of focus for BP. It is the largest producer in Azerbaijan and one of the largest investors in the country, having played a key role in opening it to international oil companies after the fall of the Soviet Union.The company also operates the ACG oilfield and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Earlier this year BP increased its operating interest in the ACG development as part of a deal to acquire several assets from Devon Energy.BP recently raised $2bn in new loans backed by crude sales from its interest in the ACG oilfield as part of a move to bolster its liquidity.An agreement, especially for acreage in deep water, will be seen as an early feather in the cap of Mr Dudley as he tries to restore BP’s battered reputation.One of Mr Dudley’s main challenges will be to restore BP’s fortunes in the US. If he fails, areas such as Azerbaijan will only increase in importance to the group.
61;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-07-19T19:20:53Z;Brazil’s fledgling deep-sea oil industry faces up to risks;Regulatory changes set to introduce delays and drive up costs;"There was little fanfare when Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva opened the taps last week on the country’s first commercial deep-sea oil ­production on a floating platform 85km off the coastline.But then the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has punctured some of the early exuberance that swept Brazil and the oil industry three years ago when the country discovered deep-sea reserves containing some 50bn barrels of oil and almost overnight became a “petro-power” in the making.“People know there is risk involved in deep sea operations, but you never want to see a leak, or any accident related to the risk involved in a drilling project, like what happened in the Gulf,” says Raphael Moura, safety co-ordinator at Brazil’s national oil regulator, ANP.Although Brazil is continuing with plans to develop its deepwater reserves, led by state-controlled oil major Petrobras, the BP accident is expected to raise insurance prices for deep-sea drilling. Regulatory changes are meanwhile expected to introduce delays and drive up costs.An ANP-led safety review, under which field operators must say what they would do if they faced a BP-like situation, is expected to take a year. “It is very important to complete a deeply technical investigation before deciding on regulatory changes,” says Magda Chambriard, ANP director. “We only have a preliminary vision.”The trouble is that leaves the industry in limbo in the meantime – as can be seen in the regulatory uncertainty surrounding BP’s mooted purchase of 10 deep-sea blocks from Devon Energy. BP expects the deal to be approved by year end, although the ANP has said it is reviewing the deal “with the Gulf of Mexico in mind”.“The ANP knows it has to look into environmental issues more carefully,” says Jose Virgilio Lopes Enei, a Brazilian oil and gas lawyer. “They are expected to be more rigorous, but they don’t know how.”One problem is that Brazil’s deepwater technical challenges are even greater than in the Gulf. Its “pre-salt” basin – so called because oil and gas deposits are buried several kilometres beneath the ocean floor under a layer of salt – is much deeper than BP’s Deepwater Horizon well. The fields, about 280 miles off the southeastern coast of Brazil, are also farther from shore.Furthermore, high temperatures and large quantities of carbon dioxide in the pre-salt can damage drilling parts. The salt formations can also act like a sponge and drilling through can create fissures, making it difficult to control the drilling hole.In some ways, though, Brazil is better prepared than the US to open up a deepwater oil province.Brazilian regulations are generally seen as tougher than in the US, where the Minerals Management Service has faced criticism for allowing the industry to “self-regulate”.Furthermore, a run of local disasters in the early 2000s – including an oil leak of 0.3m gallons that was dubbed “Brazil’s Exxon Valdez”, and the sinking of the P-36 oil platform that killed 11 – has already led Petrobras to improve safety procedures. Unlike many of its oil major peers, Petrobras has kept its engineering and deep sea expertise in-house, rather than outsourcing it to service companies.“These internal resources are of huge importance to be able to promptly intervene in emergency situations,” says Ildo Luís Sauer, a former Petrobras Gas & Energy director.But some worry that the government has overloaded Petrobras. Brasilia wants to reform the current concession regime and lease remaining deepwater exploration blocks through production-sharing agreements that would give Petrobras a minimum 30 per cent stake in future contracts and would make it the only operator in the remaining 72 per cent of unleased blocks. A further stake would be granted to Petrosal – a new state entity that will represent the government’s interests – to be calculated from net production; ie, the amount left after exploration and production costs.As Mr Lula da Silva sees it, this ensures “the best operator” is in the driver’s seat when navigating through the perilous ultra-deep-sea oil fields. Others wonder if Petrobras is fully up to the task.“There are three big areas we are studying in Brazil in the next 12 months – regulation, the federal election and the inability of Petrobras to handle everything it has on its plate,” says a leading oil company manager.The bill that would reform the current concession regime has been delayed until after Brazil’s presidential elections in October, and may well be scrapped if José Serra, the opposition candidate, is elected over Mr Lula’s chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff.A further uncertainty surrounds Petrobras’ proposed $25bn share issue, which the company will use to buy from the government the rights to 5bn barrels of oil. But delays over valuing those reserves has postponed the issue from July until at least September – just before the elections.Although Petrobras has played down similarities between the Gulf and the pre-salt fields, BP’s accident and uncertainty surrounding the share issue has helped make the stock the world’s second-worst performing oil company this year – after BP."
62;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-03-28T23:32:43Z;Oil exploration: Smaller fry reap reward of taking bigger risks;;When Anadarko Petroleum and Tullow Oil, two independent oil companies, drilled the Venus-B well off Sierra Leone, the exercise was little more than a rather expensive punt.But it paid off. The well showed signs of hydrocarbons and the two declared they had found a 1,000km oil coast.Anadarko, of the US, and UK-listed Tullow have been two of the most successful explorers of the past years.After drilling several wells with its partner Heritage Oil in Uganda, Tullow this year consolidated its position there. It has agreed to buy Heritage’s stake and flip it to two bigger companies. Heritage, like so many explorers, will take the money to look for the next big oil patch.Anadarko and Tullow are also at work in Ghana, where in 2007, the Jubilee field became one of Africa’s largest finds.On the other side of the Atlantic, Petrobras, the partially listed, partially state-owned Brazilian oil company, has the biggest position in one of the world’s other oil frontiers: the pre-salt discoveries in the deep waters of Brazil’s coast.Notably absent from this role of recent successful explorers are names of the world’s rich, powerful and savvy oil majors, such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and BP.For BP and Shell for example, their biggest exploration success has been in the Gulf of Mexico.“Integrated oil companies need to explore earnestly for resources – otherwise they are likely to underperform energy sector peers, and some may not even survive in the long term,” analysts at Sanford Bernstein, the financial services group, concluded in a recent comprehensive study on exploration.Many big international integrated oil companies (IOCs) have become so averse to geological risk that they have concentrated on projects with challenges they feel better able to control, rather than the hit-and-miss game of exploration.In Qatar, Royal Dutch Shell spent $18bn-19bn building the Pearl gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant, which turns natural gas into a liquid that reduces exhaust pipe carbon and other emissions when mixed with diesel.That was money, some analysts argue, Shell would have been better spending on seismic crews to look at new areas and on renting drilling rigs to see whether the rock formations below yielded anything.BP missed the initial chance to invest in Brazil’s pre-salt fields at favourable financial terms.Instead, to access this opportunity, it spent $7bn on Devon Energy’s international assets, which include positions in Brazil.Sanford Bernstein analysts have a rather scathing view about such Johnny-come-lately tactics.“The IOCs prevailing strategies of paying a premium to buy into someone else’s success story, and marginally economic projects will likely damage future returns,” they wrote.The most lucrative types of contracts are those that allow the companies a big share of what the industry calls “the upside” – the windfall profits of an oil price rise and the additional reward that comes with finding and pumping more oil than expected, thanks to improved technology, or clever geologists.It is the chance to make those huge gains that makes many companies willing to take huge risks.Moving into virgin territory and paying the host government a few thousand dollars to be allowed to explore and bringing in expensive equipment to drill wells is one of the best ways any oil company can add value.The downpayment is relatively small, the risk is high, but so is the reward.It is what Kosmos, an independent private equity-backed US producer, did in Ghana, and Heritage, the UK-listed company, did in Uganda. Now they have found oil, the big guys are knocking on the door.Heritage is set to receive up to $1.5bn for its Ugandan fields, which are scheduled to go to Total of France, and CNOOC, the Chinese state oil company, after a lengthy battle with Eni, Italy’s biggest energy group, which also wanted the fields.In Ghana, ExxonMobil has offered $4bn for Kosmos’s field, its main asset, although the sale is being blocked by the Ghanaian government.But Tom Petrie, a vice-chairman at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, sees a more positive future for big companies, suggesting the domination of exploration by smaller ones may have almost run its course, at least in some areas.“Historically, the opening of frontiers has often been the remit of independents,” he notes.“However, deep water is mainly the province of international companies and the ambition of national companies.”As the importance of exploration in deep waters grows, so will the fortunes of the big international companies with their “ability to marshal scale well beyond the capability of other companies,” he adds.He even sounds a note of optimism about Iraq, where big companies accepted very low fees to repair the country’s fields as a cost of entry: “There is a knock-on benefit relative to IOCs’ value proposition elsewhere, such as Africa,” he says.In other words, if BP and its peers are successful at turning round Iraq’s industry, other countries will open their fields more readily to them.It is a hopeful thought for a group of companies that has under-performed their smaller peers, especially as oil prices were rising between 2002 and 2008 and their exploration activities were able to capture that upside.

64;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-03-11T21:16:46Z;Devon deal is key to BP growth targets;;BP has done its largest deal for seven years, paying $7bn (£4.6bn) for a set of assets from Devon Energy of the US, including licences in the oil-rich waters off the coast of Brazil.For Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, it is a particularly satisfying move. The company’s absence from Brazil, the site of several of the biggest oil discoveries of recent years, seems to have been nagging at him like a sore tooth.It also looks like a vindication of BP’s much criticised business model.BP’s previous big deal was the creation of its Russian joint venture TNK-BP in 2003. Thursday’s acquisition will have nothing like the transformational effect of that move.Yet it is set to make an important contribution to sustaining the company’s growth at its hoped-for 1-2 per cent a year in the second half of the decade.The properties in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Azerbaijan put up for sale by Devon are a good fit for BP.In the Gulf, Devon’s key asset is its 30 per cent stake in the huge deep-water Kaskida oil field, discovered in 2006, where BP owns the other 70 per cent. In Azerbaijan, Devon has a 5.63 per cent stake in the ACG field, where BP is the operator and has 34 per cent.Brazil is a country that BP has been eager to enter for some time, but other possible routes, such as participating in the next licensing round, seemed less attractive.While Devon’s assets are in the Campos basin, which has been less fruitful for oil discoveries than the Santos basin to the south, they still have “great potential”, according to Scott Pearson of Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy.The cost of the deal will push BP’s debt up, but not excessively: gearing, as measured by the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ funds, will rise to about 24 per cent, still well short of BP’s target 30 per cent ceiling.While the price was full, it does not look bad value for BP. Devon’s calculations suggest the potential resources could be as much as 6bn-7bn barrels, suggesting a – very rough – acquisition cost of only about $1 per barrel.But to prove that the oil is actually there, and then extract it from deep under the ocean floor, will not be easy.The new fields now being discovered in Brazil are often trapped under several kilometres of sea water, rock and a hard-to-penetrate layer of salt.Drilling a single well in the area can cost $100m, which means that only well-resourced companies can afford to put in the investment needed to get at the oil.Faced with that prospect, Devon took the view that it had more attractive opportunities at home in the US and Canada, and decided to pull out.BP, with a capital spending programme costing about $20bn a year, can afford to take on that burden.It also has long experience of deep-water oil production that it hopes to be able to apply to develop its new Brazilian assets successfully.Last year, BP says, it produced more than 650,000 barrels per day of oil and gas from deep water, compared to less than 500,000 b/d for Royal Dutch Shell and less than 400,000 for ExxonMobil.BP has had success both in finding and extracting oil and gas in the US Gulf of Mexico, where it discovered the “giant” Tiber field last year and has brought on stream the Thunder Horse development, which has made it the largest producer in the region, with a total output of 400,000 b/d of oil and gas.But while Brazil may suit BP from the financial and technical standpoint, there is one further criterion that must be right: politics.The Brazilian government stopped granting licences to oil companies after the first big oil discoveries in 2007, and proposals to change the regulations covering the oil and gas industry are currently before Congress.The new regulations would replace a concessions system – under which oil companies are given ownership over any oil they produce in exchange for taking on the risk and paying royalties and taxes – with a production sharing system, under which companies are paid with part of the oil they produce.The government says the new regime will apply only to areas not yet put out to concession, so the assets acquired by BP should not be affected. However, some investors remain nervous that changes could be made retroactively.Critics have charged that the big western oil companies are being squeezed out of the industry by resource-rich governments, technologically superior service companies and fleet-footed independents.If BP can complete its purchase of the Devon assets, and retain the same more favourable terms when it starts production, it will be a sign that big oil is not headed the way of the dinosaurs just yet.
65;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-03-11T15:32:51Z;BP / Devon;Paying $7bn to jump to the head of the queue to get into Brazil;Bem-vindo à festa, welcome to the party. BP has long wanted to get into Brazil. Now it is paying a net $7bn to US independent Devon Energy to do so. Devon, which lacks the operational and financial heft to develop fully Brazil’s deep sea reserves, will meanwhile focus on unconventional North American production, such as shale gas and oil sands. Essentially, it is swapping out of uncertainties that BP can better bear, such as political and development risks. Strategically, therefore, it makes good sense for both.The price that BP is paying looks high at first glance – hence the dip in its share price on Thursday. The acreage Devon is selling, which includes shares in its Gulf of Mexico and Azerbaijan operations, currently produces just 40,000 barrels per day. Proven reserves are also only about 150m barrels, which implies a high price of $47 per barrel of oil equivalent. But this deal is about the future. Take into account likely resources, and BP may have secured some 1.6bn barrels for about $4.40 per barrel. By contrast, it bought into Russia in 2003 at $5 a barrel of proved and probable reserves, although the metrics are not entirely comparable.BP’s balance sheet can take the strain. Net debt to capital employed will rise to about 24 per cent from 20 per cent, Exane BNP estimates. That is comfortably within BP’s 30 per cent ceiling. Even if oil prices slip from $80 currently, BP still breaks even at about $70 a barrel. There may be a squabble with Brazil over concession terms – although BP insists these will be grandfathered when it takes over. More strikingly, Brazil continues to expand as an oil province. Extrapolate from production growth since 2000, and the country could overtake Venezuela as South America’s largest oil producer as soon as this year and trump Mexico by 2012.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyBP on Thursday confirmed it would enter the deep waters off the coast of Brazil, one of the world’s most promising areas for oil exploration, with a $7bn (£4.7bn) deal to buy international oil and gas assets from Devon Energy.Under the terms of the deal, BP will also expand its operations in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is already the largest producer of oil and gas, and increase its interests in Azerbaijan.In addition, the UK oil and gas exploration company will receive a $500m payment to create a joint venture with Devon Energy to exploit oil sand interests in Alberta, Canada, making the net cash cost $6.5bn to BP.

Exports declined 0.3 per cent but imports fell by a sharper 1.7 per cent.Initial jobless claims in the US were 462,000 last week, as expected. The figures raise the four-week moving average slightly to 475,500, the highest level since November.Trading was in a tight range and volumes were low. After the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 10,611.84 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,368.46.Performance of individual stocks in the indices has followed a trend dependent on their market capitalisation.“Big-cap names and big cap indices get much of the market’s attention but the real action year-to-date has been in the small- and mid-cap arena,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group.“For example, the 20 largest cap names in the S&P 500, which represent close to a third of the index’s market cap, have only contributed 0.5 per cent of the index’s 2.7 per cent move in 2010 through earlier this week,” Mr Colas said. “An ‘S&P 480’ of [the other] names would be up 3.7 per cent on the year.”The Russell 2000 small-cap index was 0.3 per cent higher at 677.22 yesterday and has risen 0.8 per cent since the start of the week.In the energy sector, Devon Energy rose 0.5 per cent to $72.02 on news that London-listed BP had agreed to buy its international assets for $7bn. The deal includes interests in 10 exploration blocks in Brazil, assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Devon’s stake in the BP-operated Azeri development in Azerbaijan, the company said.Dr Pepper Snapple Group rose 4.1 per cent to $35.03 after two broker upgrades. Analysts at UBS raised the stock to “buy”. Barclays Capital lifted the price target from $33 to $38.AIG fell 3.1 per cent to $35.11, in spite of signs that leading investors in Prudential were coming out in support of its $35.5bn bid for AIG’s Asian business following discussions with Tidjane Thiam, chief executive at Prudential.In the retail sector, Gymboree, a children’s clothing retailer, jumped 11 per cent to $51.38 on posting its fourth-quarter results that beat expectations. The company also forecast its first-quarter earnings would be above analyst expectations.It said it would step up store expansions and enter Australian and Middle Eastern markets this year.Men’s Wearhouse fell 5.2 per cent to $23.55 as it reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales. But the retailer of men’s suits posted an adjusted loss that was lower than expectations and forecast a higher first-quarter profit than analysts were looking for.Hologic gained 9.9 per cent to $19.28 on market speculation that Amsterdam-listed Philips Electronics is considering a bid for the technology company that specialises in medical imaging and diagnostic systems.Force Protection was down 0.3 per cent to $6.52 in spite of news that the company had won a $26.1m contract from the US Marine Corps for additional field service support.CA Inc, a leading maker of software for mainframe computers, gained 0.3 per cent to $22.66 after announcing that it is to buy Nimsoft, a provider of IT performance solutions, for about $350m. The move will help to expand its presence in cloud computing, which allows software applications and data to reside on web servers rather than on users’ own computers.The acquisition “is expected to help expand CA’s exposure to the mid-market enterprise”, said Israel Hernandez, an analyst at Barclays Capital.Vail Resorts, an operator of high-end mountain resorts, fell 2.2 per cent to $39.01. A slow start to the season, hurt by lower than average snowfall, will cause Vail to miss the top end of its current profit forecasts, it said.
67;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2010-03-11T11:18:14Z;BP strikes $7bn Brazil oil deal;;BP on Thursday confirmed it would enter the deep waters off the coast of Brazil, one of the world’s most promising areas for oil exploration, with a $7bn (£4.7bn) deal to buy international oil and gas assets from Devon Energy.Under the terms of the deal, BP will also expand its operations in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is already the largest producer of oil and gas, and increase its interests in Azerbaijan.In addition, the UK oil and gas exploration company will receive a $500m payment to create a joint venture with Devon Energy to exploit oil sand interests in Alberta, Canada.The deep fields off the Brazilian coast are estimated to hold at least 80bn barrels of oil. Industry executives think the region could be as important as the North Sea. Already one of the top 10 oil suppliers to the US, Brazil is set to become an increasingly important exporter.Several western companies have formed partnerships with Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil company, to explore and develop fields in the region. These include ExxonMobil of the US, BG of the UK, Galp of Portugal, Repsol of Spain and Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in the Netherlands.The deal with Devon, an Oklahoma-based US company which has six licence blocks in partnership with Petrobras to explore Brazil’s “most promising offshore areas”, provides BP with a faster and more direct route into the country.“This strategic opportunity fits well with BP’s operating strengths and key interests around the world, offering us significant additional long-term growth potential with an emphasis on high-margin oil,” said Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, in a statement.While Brazil offers great promise, industry executives and analysts say challenges need to be overcome before the country can realise its potential as an oil and gas exporter.The deep-water oil reservoirs, which are 7,000 metres below sea level and under a thick layer of salt, are technically difficult to develop. There has also been widespread concern that the government’s ambition to maximise Brazil’s income from its oil wealth could create problems for foreign investors.The deal will give BP interests in eight licence blocks in the Campos and Camamu-Almada basins as well as two onshore licences in the Parnaiba basin. The Campos basin blocks include three discoveries – Xerelete, pre-salt Wahoo and Itaipu – and the producing Polvo field.The Devon deal also strengthens BP’s position in the Gulf of Mexico, a region that it sees as very important strategically. With discoveries such as the Tiber field last year, BP is opening up new reserves six miles below the sea bed in the deep waters of the Gulf. It is already a partner of Devon in the Kaskida field, a large deep-water discovery in the area made in 2006.Statoil of Norway is also taking a keen interest in the deep-water reserves of the Gulf, buying Devon’s stake in the St Malo project.Andy Inglis, chief executive of exploration and production at BP, said: ”Through our entry into Brazil, BP will add a major position in another attractive deepwater basin. Together with the additional new access in the Gulf of Mexico, it further underlines our global position as the leading deepwater international oil company.”Devon, one of the biggest US independents, last year said it would sell its Gulf of Mexico and international assets to generate up to $7.5bn towards focusing fully on high-return US and Canadian onshore assets and to retire debt.That announcement underlined the success of the US onshore natural gas business in recent years, which has been led by the independents – US companies that produce oil and gas but have no refining business.Devon holds a leading position in the Barnett Shale – the biggest producing gas field in the US, as well as other shale fields across the country.The company had said it did not believe some of its assets, particularly those in the Gulf and internationally, were being properly valued.Analysts welcomed the deal.“Whilst the deal comes at the top end of the values speculated in the press recently, the acquisition is a key strategic move for BP,” said Merrill Lynch in a note to clients. “All-in we see the Devon deal…offering significant exploration upside over the longer term.”Jason Kenney, senior oil analyst at ING, said: “The $7bn asset-focused cash deal announced with Devon Energy displays a great deal of confidence in the value accretive, high margin opportunity that this move offers, but also signifies a strong confidence in the recently announced cost cutting gains in BP’s own business and the cash generative capability of its operations near and medium term in our view.”Shares in BP fell 2p to 622.9p in morning trading on Thursday.
68;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-12-15T22:51:14Z;Exxon’s deal for XTO may open floodgates;;Exxon’s move to acquire XTO Energy for $41bn sets the stage for a round of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, where the world’s top five super-majors alone are holding cash reserves of over $75bn.Such activity has been constrained during the past 18 months because of uncertainties over carbon legislation, as well as the economic downturn and credit squeeze. Many industry observers expect business will continue to be slow for a while.PFC Energy, the consultancy, projects it will take until 2013 for global exploration and production capital spending to return to the 2008 peak of nearly $460bn, and the possibility of a double-dip recession could postpone this further.Nonetheless, analysts, consultants and energy companies are forecasting that deals across the energy industry will pick up in 2010, as the pressures of the past year continue to build. Several big companies have already said that they would shed assets, and some smaller companies are growing increasingly distressed.“The main driver for such M&A activity lies in the cash strength of probable acquirers – super-majors, Asian national oil companies and large independents,” says Jim Dillavou, a partner leading energy M&A transaction services at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm.“The world’s top five super-majors have cash reserves of more than $75bn, so the capacity is there for much greater M&A activity,” he says. “We have a lot of impatient buyers waiting for assets to come on the market.”In October, ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil company, outlined plans to sell $10bn in assets over the next two years, including its 9 per cent stake in the Syncrude oil sands project in Canada.In November, Devon Energy, one of the biggest independents, said it wanted to sell its Gulf of Mexico and international assets for up to $7.5bn to pay down debt and focus on the high-return US and Canadian onshore assets.Executives say the market is swinging towards the buyer, with cash-rich oil companies in no hurry to spend their money and a lot of assets available, with more expected in 2010.Stephen Chazen, president and chief financial officer at Occidental Petroleum, the US’s fourth biggest oil and gas production company, says acquisitions by his company have “picked up sharply” in the fourth quarter of 2009.The sellers are individuals or small natural gas producers whose hedges for higher US natural gas prices are running out, with no sign of a return to the record high of $13.694 per million British thermal units seen in 2008. Many overextended themselves as prices rose to that record and have been barely hanging on as prices fell this year to a 7.5-year low.But deals of the size of XTO have been scarce, with overall transactions down about 50 per cent from June 2008 to June 2009, according to Jon McCarter, leader of transaction advisory services for Ernst & Young’s Americas Oil & Gas Centre.Negotiations began to pick up in July and August, leading Mr McCarter to expect a gradual increase in completed deals in 2010. One difficulty is disagreement on valuations, which has been compounded by uncertainty surrounding carbon legislation.Joe Stanislaw, head of the JA Stanislaw group, an independent advisory consultancy, said: “People don’t understand the full impact of carbon and the timing of legislation, whether it will come into effect over five or 10 years.”While Holli Nichols, chief financial officer of power producer Dynegy, said consolidation makes sense, given the benefits gained through scale and reducing duplicative efforts. But it remains hard to do a deal.“With these uncertainties out there, it’s hard for boards and CEOs to pull the trigger,” she said.
69;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-11-22T10:37:13Z;Investors must ask about shale gas cost;;An internal energy industry squabble over the true potential for shale gas, discussed in this column earlier this month, has now filtered through to the attention of some of the institutional investors in energy companies. This tremor of scepticism has not yet affected the ability of the large gas exploration and production companies to finance their ambitious capital spending programmes.One of the shale doubters that was quoted in this space, consulting geologist Arthur Berman, is no longer published in the pages of World Oil, an American trade journal. World Oil publisher, John Royall, says: “Arthur had written about shale for a year and it was time to move on.” The journal’s editor was dismissed at about the same time. Big shale gas producers, such as Chesapeake and Devon Energy, have taken public issue with Mr Berman’s assertions that the prospects for sustained high levels of gas production from shales were overstated.This is more than a parochial argument, or a dispute over the value of energy company shares. The upturn in gas production from shale has been one of the few favourable trends in US energy production. Both Wall Street and Washington have had a growing faith that the technologies for getting gas from the previously uneconomic shales were a gift from the gods of low carbon. Shale drillers have itched to displace the half of US electricity now generated from coal.Mr Berman contends that shale gas wells’ production declines at a dramatically faster rate than the companies’ estimates. Reasonable people can dispute the accuracy of his projected decline curves. I have found Mr Berman open to debate and willing to consider contrary evidence.Whether he or his critics are closer to the truth about shale gas decline rates, it does seem clear to me that Wall Street has underestimated the real cost of shale gas, and overestimated how fast its production can be expanded.This matters. By now, close to half of the gas rigs in the US, and most of the development money for the fuel, is going to shale plays.If the companies and investors are wrong, there may be tens of billions of dollars of over-investment, that might be more productively spent on conventional onshore gas, or on drilling US offshore prospects. This is not just an investors’ bet, but a core national energy policy.And as one Canadian gas analyst told me: “These guys [the shale producers] spend money in ways that most rational humans would not.” It’s not that they spend money as fast as it comes in from gas sales. They spend it faster. In times past, the successful companies in the oil and gas industry generated huge amounts of cash flow (cf “Giant”, “Dallas”). The shale gas producers, in contrast, consume lots of cash.The institutional investors have been captivated by the well publicised advantages of shale gas deposits: they are relatively easy to find, compared with most conventional onshore prospects, and not particularly difficult to drill, unlike the deep offshore frontiers.They do, however, tend to take a great deal of work to “complete” after the initial wellbore is drilled. It could take $6m (£3.6m, €4m), and less than a month, to drill a shale gas well, but another $4m-$5m and four or five months to get the gas to a pipeline. The completion work is where the newer technology is applied. This includes the high pressure fluid injections, or “fracs”, that make fractures in the rock through which the tightly held gas flows to the well. To keep the fracs open under the enormous rock pressure, “proppants” such as resin coated sand, or bauxite and ceramic beads, are mixed with the fluids.Baker Hughes, the oil and gas services company, in August announced the $5.5bn acquisition of BJ Services Co, in large part to expand its shale fracturing business. So while Wall Street keeps its eye on Baker Hughes’ weekly North American “rig count”, the rig counter has had its eye on the frac count.As Ben Dell of Bernstein Research noted in an October report: “Since 2003, in both Denton and Tarrant Counties in the Barnett Shale [the best developed shale region], the number of fracs has exploded but the average [initial production from wells] has remained flat. As a result, the increase in fracs has hidden an underlying deterioration in well results.”I do not think the shale gas developers and promoters are dishonest. I do think they are true believers. True believers push on despite the obstacles and cost. It is up to the rest of us to ask some more questions.For example: how much will this stuff cost to produce? No, really, how much? How much more technological innovation will be required to produce it, and produce it soon, from the new regions now being promoted? How elastic and idiosyncratic are your company’s metrics, such as Estimated Ultimate Recovery?Thanks in part to the outside capital spent on new shale wells, gas storage facilities are full, and gas prices lower than most shale wells’ production costs. To keep this industry going, prices will have to rise significantly.johndizard@hotmail.com
70;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-11-16T23:21:27Z;Devon to offload international assets;;"Devon Energy, the US independent oil and gas group, on Monday said it was looking to offload its Gulf of Mexico and international assets for up to $7.5bn.The group said it wanted to pay down debt and focus fully on high-return US and Canadian onshore assets, which do not carry the risk that often comes with developing overseas projects.Devon owns more than 9m acres of international assets, most of which are undeveloped. Those properties are in Azerbaijan, Russia, Brazil and China.In the Gulf of Mexico, Devon holds nearly 1.5m acres, of which about 87 per cent is undeveloped.Devon expects to have data rooms open for the assets in the first quarter of 2010 and aims to conclude a sale or sales by the end of next year. Oil and gas majors are the most likely buyers.The move underlines the success of the US onshore natural gas business in recent years, in which technological advances and a newfound expertise has increased US resources at current consumption rates from 30 years’ supply to 100 years’ supply.The independents – companies that produce but have no refining businesses – have led the development of this business, attracting the attention of the majors who once left the US market for dead, going overseas to exploit the international oil and natural gas scene.However, as the majors move back into the US, Devon holds a leading position in the Barnett Shale, the US’s biggest producing gas field.“Devon’s success has led to an over-abundance of opportunities, and this repositioning will allow us to optimise value for our shareholders,’’ said Larry Nichols, Devon’s chief executive.He added: “We do not believe that the value of our high-quality Gulf and international assets is being adequately reflected in our stock price.“By monetising these assets, we will realise their full value, allowing us to unleash the growth potential that resides within our world-class onshore assets.’’In doing so, Devon says it will emerge with an even stronger balance sheet and one of the lowest overall cost structures in its peer group, enabling it to fund its organic growth with internally generated funds.Devon expects the divestitures will generate after-tax proceeds of $4.5bn-$7.5bn, and be highly accretive to earnings, cash flow, production and reserves beginning in 2011.The group is not selling at the top of the market; indeed a sale of these assets last year, when both oil and natural gas prices were at record highs, would likely have yielded better prices.Just as Devon announced the sale, BP, the UK oil and gas group, said an appraisal well on the large Kaskida discovery in the Gulf of Mexico confirmed oil and increased the company’s confidence in its estimate of 3bn barrels in place. Devon holds an interest in that field."
71;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-11-16T18:36:57Z;US stocks rise on recovery hopes;;US stocks were set to hit fresh highs for the year on Monday after a rebound in retail sales left investors more optimistic about the country’s economic recovery.By midday, the S&P 500 had jumped 1.6 per cent to 1,110.66 and was heading for its highest close since October last year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.4 per cent to 10,408.93 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.5 per cent at 2,199.43.Dollar weakness boosted commodity prices, sending Peabody Energy shares up 5.5 per cent to $45.94 and Alcoa up 3 per cent to $13.58.Devon Energy gained 5.8 per cent to $71.70 after the company also announced it was selling its Gulf of Mexico and international assets for as much as $7.5bn in order to focus on its fields in the US and Canada.US retail sales rose more than analysts had been expecting in October and demand for cars increased in spite of the termination of the government’s “cash for clunkers” scheme.“What we’re beginning to see is a very clear and measurable transition from global recession into global growth,” said Dr Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments.“March priced in an event that didn’t happen – the end of the world. Not all of the market recovery since the March low has been due to forecasts of global growth and earnings recovery, a big chunk of it was just the market correcting a wrong forecast.”Shares in Barnes & Noble, the country’s largest bookstore chain, rose 2.2 per cent to $20.50 after the company said Yucaipa, a private equity investment group, had increased its stake to 17 per cent. Last month, the retailer joined in the battle over the electronic reader market, introducing its own version to rival the dominant model made by Amazon.com.Apollo Group, the education company, also helped lift the consumer discretionary sector after the US department of education recertified the University of Phoenix, its subsidiary, for inclusion in student financial aid programmes. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $58.Lowe’s, the second-largest home improvement chain in the US, posted a 30 per cent decline in profit for the third quarter after shoppers cut back on discretionary items and the weak housing market reduced the demand for renovation. The stock was down 0.5 per cent to $21.75.Cisco shares were up 1.2 per cent at $23.99 after the network equipment group raised its bid for Tandberg, the Norwegian video conferencing equipment maker. The US company said the latest offer had the backing of Tandberg’s two largest shareholders.Online video conferencing had been highlighted by Cisco as a key growth area, especially as businesses cut down on travel in the downturn.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Intel increased its quarterly dividend by 12.5 per cent, sending its shares up 2.3 per cent to $20.28. The chipmaker had previously said it was hopeful that a recovery in corporate spending would boost PC sales within the next two years.Shares in Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, jumped 25.3 per cent to $4.46 after it said GlaxoSmithKline could buy the rights to one of its nicotine addiction drugs for more than $500m.Spherix shares recorded one of the biggest gains, soaring 55 per cent to $3.10 after the drug-maker reported encouraging results from trials of one of its diabetes drugs.Human Genome Sciences said the Food and Drug Administration had requested further trials of its experimental anthrax drug.After early weakness, shares in Human Genome regained ground to rise 0.6 per cent to $28.06. The US government has already stockpiled doses of the drug, Raxibacumab, for use in the event of a bioterrorist attack.American Dairy shareholders suffered some of the biggest losses on Wall Street after the company, which distributes infant formula and milk powder in China, slashed its full-year revenue outlook.The group had estimated sales of up to $360m but its latest forecast was for revenues between $270m and $290m. The shares were down 19.6 per cent to $26.07.
72;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-11-04T21:37:16Z;US stocks give up gains after late sell-off;;"Wall Street gave up early gains on Wednesday in a late sell-off after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its intention to keep rates low for an extended period.Freddie Mac dropped 1.6 per cent to $1.22 and Fannie Mae lost 5.2 per cent to $1.09 after the Fed said it would buy less debt issued by government-backed mortgage finance agencies than it had originally planned.Financial stocks led the sharp pull-back in the final 30 minutes of trading, which left indices to close nears the lows of the day.Wall Street had initially risen on rising commodity prices, strength in the healthcare sector and a series of positive corporate results.While stocks fluctuated throughout the day, the healthcare sector remained strong after Republicans captured two state governorships on Tuesday.Investors bet that the opposition victories would bolster opposition to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform package, lifting shares of UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, 3.6 per cent to $27.87.After gaining up to 1.5 per cent during the day, the S&P 500 finally closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,046.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 9,802.14 and the Nasdaq lost 0.1 per cent to 2,055.52.Investor confidence had initially remained high in spite of disappointing economic data earlier in the session. The ADP employment report, released during pre-market trading, showed that 203,000 private sector jobs were lost in October.Although this was just above the 198,000 consensus estimate, investors welcomed the fact that it represented the smallest number of job losses for the survey since July 2008.The Institute for Supply Management’s October reading of the services sector was also worse than expected. Economists had been expecting a reading of 51.5 but the ISM recorded a level of 50.6. However, a reading above 50 still indicates growth. “The basic flow of the statistics suggests that, in fact, the economic recovery is continuing to roll along,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“The other dynamic that is still important is that, because of the scepticism about the recovery and about the rally, a lot of people would like to be more heavily invested in equities. And some just give in and plough their money into the market.”Corporate news had also helped to lift the mood throughout the day on Wall Street. Walt Disney gained 1.5 per cent to $28.03 after announcing late on Tuesday its breakthrough deal to build a theme park in Shanghai.Time Warner raised its profit outlook for 2009 due to better results than expected at its cable and films division. But after sharp gains in early trading, the shares closed 0.2 per cent lower at $30.10.Comcast also made strong gains in early trading after the cable operator reported quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates. It said profit had risen 22 per cent, mainly due to subscriber gains and lower capital expenditure. But, by the closing bell, the shares had slid 3.1 per cent to $14.06.Radian, the mortgage insurer, was another to surprise analysts by reporting a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. The group said fewer homeowners had claimed mortgage insurance and it also lowered its estimate of the value of claims to be paid out in 2009 by 15 per cent. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $6.09.Ambac Financial Group, the world’s second-largest bond insurer, surged by
35.2 per cent to $1.50. The group posted net income of $2.2bn, reversing last year’s loss, mainly due to accounting gains.Devon Energy, the third-largest US independent oil and gas company by market value, released quarterly results above expectations, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $67.07.Higher oil output and cost-cutting helped the company cushion the impact of falling prices.Elsewhere in the sector, Baker Hughes, the oilfield-services provider, fell 5.9 per cent to $40.89. The group reported a sharp drop in third-quarter profit due to plunging energy prices and reduced customer spending."
73;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-10-02T14:53:35Z;Larry Nichols, Devon Energy: Independent boss is happy with his lot;;"Larry Nichols is not your ordinary chief executive. The head of Devon Energy, the biggest US independent, arrives back from lunch alone and walks into a conference room without any handlers. There is no public relations person. He has no briefing notes. And no pretences.When I ask what he is reading, he does not pluck from thin air some classic to look intellectual. He admits he is not reading anything and has no favourite book. “I used to be a reader; life got too busy,” he says. And he is following nobody when it comes to getting through this crisis.Whereas most oil and gas companies have cut back on spending and staff, Mr Nichols has continued to fund long-term strategic projects, such as its exploration programmes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Canadian oil sands, despite the economic downturn, credit squeeze and plunging commodity prices.And he is not defensive about his counter-cyclical spending. At 66, he has been through enough slumps to position Devon to prosper during the good times and survive the bad.“We are deficit-spending a bit this year to keep activity going.” With a BBB+ credit rating, he believes Devon’s balance sheet is strong enough to borrow without putting the company at risk.For Mr Nichols, the downturn is about maintaining staff, drilling to keep crews engaged, protecting leases that will be lost if their parcels have not been drilled before they expire, and gaining knowledge.“When the upturn comes, you fully understand your portfolio, and you can fully attack,” Mr Nichols says. “We recognise that, just as things don’t go up for ever, they don’t go down for ever.” Therefore, Devon is keeping all its talent, looking through the recession to what it will need in 2010 or 2011. “There is no doubt in my mind that there will again be huge demand for geoscientists and all the other talent that runs our business,” he says.Deficit spending notwithstanding, Mr Nichols has reduced overall spending – cutting the drilling budget by half in keeping with the 50 per cent fall in oil and gas revenues. But he is still drilling, while others, such as Chesapeake, are shutting down natural gas production, and many more, like ConocoPhillips, are laying off staff.“We have frozen everyone’s salary, and I mean everyone’s.” The big perks that others were using to entice staff from competitors were never handed out by Devon, so they do not have to be revoked.More importantly, Devon has spent the past two years unloading uncompetitive assets: during the “gold rush”, Devon sold $3bn pre-tax in Africa assets to pay down debt. “If you have a property to dispose of, do it when prices are high and everyone loves all properties.”Despite this well-timed move, he does not want to sound smug about preparing for a crisis that has been deeper than anyone predicted: “We did not know this recession was coming, but we knew sooner or later one would come,” he says.Mr Nichols obtained a geology degree from Princeton University, but then set his sights on a legal career and obtained a law degree from the University of Michigan. He worked as a law clerk for chief justice Earl Warren and Justice Tom Clark in the US supreme court.Later he served as special assistant to William Rehnquist, assistant US attorney general in the US Department of Justice.But when his father, John Nichols, called him in 1970 to ask for help, the younger Nichols agreed to help establish the energy company that became Devon. His father, a certified accountant, had run several oil enterprises, but he wanted his son on board for what would turn out to be his biggest and most successful venture. Mr Nichols smiles as he remembers those early days.“We were a tiny company, with four and a half employees – we shared a receptionist,” he recalls. A director from the start, Mr Nichols became president in 1976, chief executive in 1980 and chairman in 2000. The staff grew with him, now numbering more than 5,500.His Washington DC experience is an asset when trying to influence policy. “What you read in high school about how our government works is not exactly how our government works, I regret to say.”Mr Nichols also knew that he could not rely on congressional hearings to educate lawmakers, because congressmen do not want to learn with television cameras watching. Rather he needed to meet individually with congressional leaders and their staff. This has proved especially helpful to Mr Nichols as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the 400-member national trade association.He spends a lot of time in Washington DC, trying to educate lawmakers and the new administration. “A good number of people in the new administration are eager to learn,” he says. Then adds: “There are some lost causes.”It is a good year for Mr Nichols to lead the Institute because he is not sniffing out distressed assets, unlike others who entered the downturn from a similar position of strength. “We’re very comfortable with the size we are.” Devon has never bought a company to get bigger. And, with 27,000 undrilled well locations, he is pleased with the company’s assets and financial position to exploit them.Devon’s net debt to capital ratio was 34 per cent at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Cash in hand was $397m and unused credit facilities totalled more than $2.3bn.Mr Nichols does his thinking about the long-term direction of the company while flying, driving to and from work and after 5pm, when the phone stops ringing: “Those few moments you have alone,” he says.To relax, Mr Nichols hikes. He takes one trip each year with his wife and friends. He would like to have two or three vacations a year but is still too busy. Without dropping any hints, Mr Nichols notes that he has been working for some time on a succession plan.His father passed away last year, at age 93, as chairman emeritus. And none of his three children are in the oil business to take control over the company he and his father founded.Nonetheless, he has managed to maintain the feel of a family company, chatting with staff as he walks the halls and goes to lunch.He does not have regular sit-downs aimed at grooming promising executives: “It is totally informal and constant.” He can only hope Devon will stay that way."
74;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-08-19T17:16:35Z;Naturally gassed;;Some twisted souls in Houston, Alberta and the trading pits of the New York Mercantile Exchange are secretly praying for a devastating hurricane, or at least a scorching heat wave. Who are these misanthropes? Producers and traders of natural gas, which has hit a seven-year low just above $3 per million British thermal units in the US, the world’s largest market.With North America choking on the stuff, prices may approach $2 and underground storage could bulge to a once unthinkable 4,000bn cubic feet before the heating season begins in October.Operators of liquefied natural gas terminals such as Sempra Energy expect a global glut to result in further shipments into the saturated US market.Even a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico or a late-summer surge in air conditioning demand cannot avert an awful year for producers. But overextended commodity markets tend to self-correct, giving them some reasons for optimism.One is that drilling activity has ground to a multi-year low barely a year after reaching an all-time high. Another is that some producers such as Devon Energy may take the unusual step of voluntarily reducing output, deeming the present value of gas in the ground superior to current prices.Quicker production decline rates at new fields will also aid in curbing supply. The demand side may get an unexpected boost, as some less-modern coal-fired generation plants shut in favour of natural gas. Coal has traditionally been cheaper, but its environmental compliance costs are high and may rise further with cap and trade legislation.Prices will eventually rebound, but structural changes in the market will cap gains. Technological advances that have opened up vast new drilling acreage virtually guarantee that the price record above $15 will stand for a long, long time.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
75;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-08-12T16:39:09Z;Natural gas industry fears damage from trading curbs;;Already laid low by the recession, the US natural gas market now faces its biggest structural upheaval since the collapse of Enron in 2001.Regulatory concerns are adding new drama to a period volatile even by wild gas market standards.Benchmark gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange traded at $3.56 per million British thermal units yesterday, near a 6½-year low and down almost 75 per cent from a peak of about $13.50 per MBtu in June 2008.The combination of fresh legislation to move opaque derivatives into exchanges and clearing houses – together with trading curbs on speculators and Wall Street’s banks – portend a dramatic change that some gas producers, consumers and speculators worry will dry up trading.“The wrong regulations can be just as harmful as no regulation at all,” warns John Arnold, founder of Centaurus Energy, a $5bn Houston-based hedge fund, and a former trader at Enron. Centaurus is one of the US’s largest traders in natural gas.Although the new rules are still under consideration both at Congress and at US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, some small changes that have been implemented show the potential for disruption.Trading volume in the Henry Hub swap natural gas contract have already been affected by new speculative limits, plunging 25 per cent in July. Henry Hub is the US’s most important natural gas pipelines hub and prices there set a benchmark.Natural gas producers and consumers are particularly worried about changes still under consideration. They believe their costs will increase if US lawmakers follow through on plans to require privately negotiated derivatives, such as some natural gas swaps and options, to be cleared or traded on exchanges.The prospect of an upheaval cannot come at a worse time for the natural gas producers.Companies such as Devon Energy, the largest US independent gas and oil producer, rely on over-the-counter derivatives to hedge against volatile prices. The problem, explains Jeff Agosta, Devon’s treasurer, is that Congress’s desire to force those derivatives into clearing houses or even exchanges could add billions of dollars in costs to Devon.The company’s existing derivatives deals with the likes of Goldman Sachs do not require Devon to post collateral but contracts traded or cleared on an exchange would, draining the company’s cash reserves.“They have the potential to seriously impact [on] the normal functioning of the natural gas markets,” he says.Devon and other producers also rely on unique hedging contracts that are far more complex than the standardised products clearing houses deal with.“By and large, the stuff that we do and the industry does isn’t plain vanilla,” Mr Agosta says.These themes were echoed in hearings on energy trading held at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the past two weeks.Chesapeake Energy, another US gas producer, said posting cash margin, or collateral, on an exchange would be a “significant liquidity drain on American companies”.The American Public Gas Association, a utility group, called OTC gas contracts “vital” and said forcing them on to exchanges would be a “burden”.The move by Congress to shift natural gas derivatives into exchanges and clearing houses is, ironically, unrelated to any problem in the commodities market.Lawmakers are weighing derivatives legislation after financial companies’ exposure to credit default swaps caused systemic crisis in the world economy.Barney Frank and Collin Peterson, respective heads of the powerful financial services and agriculture committee at the US House of Representatives, would include tighter rules for energy swaps in future legislation involving credit derivatives.“We are trying to make it tougher and tougher for derivatives generally to escape regulation like they have over the last 10 years,” a spokesman for Mr Frank said.While producers and consumers worry about higher costs in derivatives deals, hedge funds, Wall Street banks and speculators worry about curbs on trading.The CFTC is seeking to ration speculators’ access to energy markets in hopes of averting future price bubbles, predicated on its belief that “excessive speculation” helped last year to drive natural gas and other commodity prices higher.While some of the new measures are under consideration, the regulator has already extended its reach over a benchmark gas swap traded on the IntercontinentalExchange, subjecting it to the same caps on holdings as gas futures traded on the rival New York Mercantile Exchange.Hedge funds say newly enacted limits on the number of financial gas contracts they can hold could force them to reduce positions or shift to less transparent private, bilateral markets.The natural gas market is also an important source of commodity-linked income for several of Wall Street’s banks and trading limits could affect their operations.Banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan (which last year bought Bear Stearns’ large natural gas business) are very active in the market.While the natural gas market is vast and many market participants worry about its future, difficulties in shipping and storing gas have kept it tied to US shores, lessening the ­prospects that a regulatory crackdown would push the market overseas.“It’s a North American market,” Mr Agosta says, summarising a view widely echoed in the industry: rather than move, trading will just dry up.
76;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-02-17T01:42:27Z;US production growth to be cut off;;Growth in US natural gas production is expected to continue rising in the first quarter of 2009 before beginning what could be a dramatic decline, as producers complete projects started under last year’s capital budgets and more favourable market conditions.“In the same way you don’t start production overnight, you don’t stop production overnight,’’ said John Richels, president of Devon Energy, the country’s biggest independent oil and gas company, which has two-thirds of its portfolio in natural gas.The natural gas rig count is down to 1,150 from a peak of just over 1,600, but the decline has been in the traditional vertical rigs – not the horizontal and directional drilling, which are used for targeting highly productive shale and tight gas supplies, according to Jen Snyder, principal of Wood Mackenzie North American Gas Research.So the big production declines have yet to come. Mr Richels expects falls in US production – from the world’s fastest growth rate in 2007 and 2008, at 4.3 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively – to take shape in the final two quarters of 2009 and into 2010. In 2006, the increase in US natural gas production was 2.3 per cent.The sharp drop in natural gas prices from a high last year of $13.50 per million British thermal units in July to below $5 has stopped many new projects. But those companies with the finances to continue investing in the sector are focusing resources on longer-term development projects and to delineate new discoveries further so they can be closer to production when the cycle turns.“These are the times, if you’re a strong company, you can do very well,’’ Mr Richels said.Devon has more than $3bn in available credit.The collapse of natural gas prices is presenting the world’s largest oil and gas companies, which are cash-rich after the run-up in both oil and natural gas prices to record levels last year, with an opportunity to fill the gap in their portfolios of limited positions in US natural gas.The majors had left natural gas in the US to small exploration and production companies, never anticipating that new technology, at increasingly economic prices, would make viable fields that were off-limits only a few years ago.Phil Dodge, Stanford Financial Group’s lead oil and gas analyst, considers US natural gas to be a “gap’’ in the majors’ portfolios.
77;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2009-01-06T22:43:09Z;US stocks shrug off glum data;;"Technology stocks were among the big favourites on Wall Street on Tuesday as the market hit a fresh two-month high.Investors snapped up cash-rich blue chips in the sector, which rallied 3 per cent overall after more gloomy economic data provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession. Cisco and Intel climbed 4 per cent to $17.79 and 3.1 per cent to $15.37, respectively.Western Union jumped 8.5 per cent to $15.76 after Morgan Keegan upgraded its view of the money-transfer stock to “outperform”.“The global remittance market place is likely less sensitive to an economic downturn than Western Union shares currently reflect,” wrote the analysts.Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $20.76 following the release of Xbox sales figures, while Ciena soared 18.6 per cent to $8.40 on a tip from Barclays, which cited confidence in the communications equipment maker’s cash balance.However, Apple’s recent good run came to an end. The shares had gained further ground in the morning session after Oppenheimer analysts, who last month removed their price target on the stock, upgraded their view to “outperform” in the wake of Steve Jobs’s health update.Yet they later fell back to finish 1.7 per cent lower at $93.02 as the Macworld conference drew to a close without any blockbuster product announcements.The benchmark S&P 500 index overcame the previous session’s losses, up 0.8 per cent to close at 934.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 9,015.10 and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,652.38.Yet traditionally defensive sectors lost ground as investors dipped their toes into riskier stocks in areas such as retail. Healthcare, consumer staples and utilities – which outperformed the wider market last year – were the worst performing sectors.Celgene was among the poorest performing healthcare stocks, down 7.2 per cent to $50.47 after Baird downgraded its recommendation on the biopharmaceutical group to “neutral” due in part to concerns over Revlimid, a blood cancer drug.Johnson and Johnson dipped 0.6 per cent to $59.69 after Citigroup warned the coming year “looks more challenging than we realised”. Wall Street’s earnings estimates appear to be “too high”, wrote Matthew Dodds, Citi analyst, unless the group “either cuts expenses dramatically and/or does a massive stock buy-back”.The energy sector, which pared the market’s losses in the previous session, performed well in the morning session after oil prices hit the $50 a barrel level. Yet it later lost ground to enjoy only modest gains as crude fell back.Devon Energy eased 0.9 per cent to $70.37 after Barclays downgraded its
recommendation on the stock from “over weight” to “equal weight”.Thomas Driscoll, Barclays analyst, said the group had only hedged about 10 per cent of its 2009 natural gas production. “Devon is nearly alone among the large cap producers in that it has not hedged a substantial portion,” he wrote, “and as such could be most exposed to falling natural gas prices.”Prudential Financial was among several strong performers among insurers, up 14.9 per cent to $35.11 after Standard & Poor’s lifted its price target from $30 to $40. Bret Howlett, analyst, noted that the shares had more than doubled since they hit an all-time low in November.“The sharp rebound is a reflection of improved investor sentiment in the life insurance group as the spreads have tightened in the credit markets, the equity markets have rallied off of lows, and capital positions appear to be holding up,” he wrote.The wider financial sector gained 1.9 per cent overall.Elsewhere, Best Buy advanced 4.2 per cent to $31.25 after the electronics retailer disclosed plans to sell used iPhones for $50 less than new models. Among other consumer discretionary stocks to do well, Office Depot and Nordstrom added 8.1 per cent to $4 and 4.7 per cent to $15.91, respectively.The homebuilding sector rallied 5.1 per cent even though figures showed pending home sales sank to a seven-year low in November.The market had earlier trimmed more sizeable gains after Commerce Department figures showed US factory orders fell by 4.6 per cent in November, much more than expected and the fourth consecutive monthly decline."
78;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-12-08T22:14:54Z;Wall St rallies on Obama infrastructure plans;;"Hard-hit industrial and commodity stocks were among the most prized in a bullish session on Wall Street that lifted the market to its highest level in nearly a month.Plans for the biggest infrastructure investment in the US for half a century helped Caterpillar and Alcoa, which rose 10.9 per cent at $42.42 and 17.6 per cent at $9.58, respectively.In addition to the spending proposals of US president-elect Barack Obama, which would see new government projects such as roads, bridges and school buildings, sentiment was also helped as Washington edged closer to a deal to bail out the ailing American car industry.General Motors and Ford leapt 20.8 per cent to $4.93 and 24.3 per cent to $3.38, respectively, on hopes of imminent aid.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.8 per cent at 909.70 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just shy of the psychologically significant 9,000 level, up 3.5 per cent at 8,934.18 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.1 per cent to 1,571.74 points.“The sketchy plans were broad enough in scope to help send equity values skyrocketing,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, of the market’s reaction to the stimulus proposals.The materials sector led the advance, up 7.7 per cent overall. Dow Chemical jumped 7.2 per cent to $20.37 after the group disclosed plans to cut 5,000 full-time jobs in a move expected to save $700m in annual operating costs by 2010.There was mixed news in the media sector. The Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Gannett, publisher of USA Today among other titles, gained 2.7 per cent to $9.16.Energy stocks were other big winners as US crude prices rebounded from their sharpest weekly retreat since 1991.Leading the gains, Chesapeake Energy soared 24.4 per cent to $14.08 after Aubrey McClendon, chief executive, sought to quash rumours that it could have liquidity difficulties. Joseph Allman, JPMorgan analyst, welcomed the update and upgraded his recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “overweight”.Devon Energy was helped by a note from Jefferies, which upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and set a $100 price target. “Devon is well positioned to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a tight credit and depressed commodity price environment,” the analysts said. The shares rose 6.6 per cent to $65.32.However, profit warnings from 3M and Illinois Tool Works limited gains among industrials.The former was one of the day’s key losers, down 4.1 per cent at $57.38 in spite of a move to shed 1,800 jobs. However, Illinois finished the session up 1.4 per cent at $32.84. Homebuilders extended some of last week’s spectacular gains, up 3.2 per cent overall.McDonald’s, off 2.9 per cent to $60.92, was among the main losers in the consumer sector, in spite of a reasonable like-for-like November sales performance. Oppenheimer cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast due to the earnings risks presented by the strengthening dollar.In financials, MetLife lost 2.4 per cent to $30.03 after the insurer forecast profit for the fourth-quarter and next year below analyst predictions.The decline came even after the company became the latest in the sector – after Prudential Financial and Hartford Financial last week – to state that it was well capitalised.NYSE Euronext was among the strong gains in exchanges, up 22.5 per cent to $26.21, after reports over the weekend that it had been in talks with Deutsche Börse about a potential tie-up.The talks ended without an agreement.The US economic stimulus package is likely to include additional spending on internet broadband infrastructure and the technology sector stood 5.2 per cent higher
overall.Yahoo gained 4.6 per cent to $12.20 on renewed hopes that the company could reach a long-awaited deal with Microsoft, which was up 5.7 per cent at $21.01.Apple gained 6.1 per cent to $99.72 on reports that Wal-Mart would sell its iPhone for as little as $99. Shares in the retailer, among several defensive stocks to come under pressure, lost 1.1 per cent to $57.56."
79;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-10-22T21:59:19Z;Size is critical issue at Marathon;;"EnCana’s decision last week not to split itself in two has turned the energy sector’s focus on Marathon Oil, which said in July that it would also consider a split.There are growing signs that investors and lenders favour such a move less than they did before the credit crisis intensified.The smaller size of Marathon’s exploration and production and refining operations, if separated, could make it tougher for each business to finance itself.This is particularly the case for the refining operations, which have substantial capital requirements and could require a multi-billion dollar working capital facility.“This is not really an environment where you want to be going to your banks to ask them to step up with a big working capital facility,” one banker said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re having trouble putting that together.”Another banker said: “They probably won’t get the kind of attention they would want and deserve in this environment, because people are focused on putting out fires” in the financing markets.If Marathon cannot secure the necessary financing, or say it is highly confident it could do so, a separation in the near term could prove untenable.Marathon will also have to convince investors it will be worth more in pieces than combined.This is at a time when the markets are valuing large, less leveraged companies more highly than smaller entities with more leverage, according to research from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.“We’re in an environment where bigger is better, there’s no doubt about that,” one energy banker said. “That’s primarily for balance sheet and credit reasons, but also because investors are less inclined to pay very high growth multiples for companies that have just one or two [oil and gas] basins.”Marathon’s decision to announce it was considering a split could make it more vulnerable to takeover, bankers agreed. The company’s sagging share price has also turned it into a more easily digestible bite for the world’s largest oil companies.But while the credit crunch could make a split by Marathon difficult, it might help protect it from poachers by making an unsolicited takeover tough to finance.Marathon’s refining business has long served as a “poison pill” to deter suitors which do not want more exposure to the volatile refining sector, and sources expected that would continue to be the case unless the company split.If a split occurs, Marathon’s more desirable upstream oil and gas business may have
limited time to prove its mettle as a standalone operation if it wants to stay independent.But at the same time, while Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum, two similar businesses, have been long rumoured as potential takeover targets for ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, those deals have not yet occurred.Marathon said it would decide this quarter whether to execute the split.When that decision is made, credit market conditions might also dictate whether it would execute a straight spin-off of the refining business or pursue another structure to execute the plan."
80;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
81;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-07-23T23:51:07Z;Rush for natural gas drives rise in US output;;Natural gas production in the US grew faster than anywhere else in the world last year as a rush of companies eager to capitalise on rising prices moved quickly to adopt new techniques for tapping resources once believed to be off-limits.A report by PFC Energy, a consultancy, said natural gas production in the US grew by “an astonishing 4.3 per cent” last year, following a 2.3 per cent increase in 2006. Production data to the end of April this year show a growth rate of more than 10 per cent compared with the same period in 2007.“This growth can continue,” said Bob MacKnight, a PFC lead analyst. “The resource is there and the price is high enough so that the various technologies are commercial.”Only a few years ago the industry believed that US natural gas production had peaked. But new technologies have opened up access to more resources from unconventional sources, such as shale gas, tight sands and coal-bed methane.“Until recently, many of these unconventional sources were either uneconomic or marginally economic,” Mr MacKnight said. “Fuelled by an almost 100 per cent gas price increase, between 2003 and 2006 the US onshore drilling rig count almost doubled as the industry applied brute force to extract as much gas as it could.”As fears have grown about peak supplies, the world’s large oil and gas companies have scrambled to develop technologies to gain access to resources once considered unreachable – such as in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico – or too expensive to pursue.Typically, the development of new technologies has taken a long time. But in onshore US production, this has happened quickly over the past five years.“Driving the speed of implementation of these new technologies is the large number of operators and service companies active in these unconventional gas basins, causing any successful new drilling or completion technology to be quickly adopted by most companies active within the play,” said Mr MacKnight.Devon Energy, which has been a leader in extracting natural gas from shale rock – one of the fastest growing of the unconventional sources – has extensive natural gas production in the Barnett Shale of north Texas, widely considered the best gas field in the US.“An increasing volume of our natural gas is going to come from North America’s rich shale and tight gas sands reserves,” said John Richels, president of Devon Energy. “The progress we have made in producing gas from shale over the past decade is encouraging as we inventory the energy sources we will have available to our economy in the years ahead.”This good news for US natural gas production is bad news for developers of liquefied natural gas terminals, which invested billions of dollars in facilities to import natural gas a few years ago.
82;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-05-06T16:04:08Z;Senior executives: A shift in the balance of power;;Senior executives at energy companies have the upper hand over their employers. Just how much the power balance has shifted in their favour became clear earlier this month when BP and Royal Dutch Shell both announced big retention packages.Shell is planning one-off stock awards to Peter Voser (pictured left), chief financial officer, Malcolm Brinded, head of exploration and production, and Linda Cook, gas and power chief. The three are the leading contenders vying to take over as chief executive when Jeroen van der Veer retires in June next year. They will get the award come 2011, regardless of how well they perform. The only stipulation is that they remain at the company.At BP the story is similar, except that the awards were announced at the end of the succession battle. Andy Inglis and Iain Conn, who lost the race to succeed Lord Browne to Tony Hayward in January 2007, each received £1.5m ($3m). A one-off retention award was announced this month and will be paid over three to five years, subject to their remaining at BP and a “satisfactory performance”.All of those who were awarded the cash are members of a rare tribe: survivors of the 1980s layoffs, when the oil price plummeted to $10 a barrel and about 1m jobs were lost.The industry is slowly replenishing its ranks. The average age of the Society of Petroleum Engineers membership pool shrunk to 46 in 2007 from 47 in 2006 after an influx of young blood.But there remains a gap of an entire generation of more seasoned geologists and chemical and petroleum engineers who are now in their 40s and 50s. The so-called “lost generation” is especially apparent at the big oil companies, where rising up the ranks is still the norm and few top positions go to people outside the company.Fergus Wilson, a consultant at Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, was a petroleum geologist laid off along with three-quarters of his company in the 1980s. He says: “People who stayed employed are quite valuable commodities. Often they don’t realise it because they have never thought beyond the company, but now that is beginning to change.”With oil prices at $120 a barrel, companies are desperate to attract and retain talent.Competition has become fierce as private equity groups, national oil companies and other start-ups have joined the ever more difficult hunt for the increasingly valuable treasure.So what do those who do jump want? Money is not everything. Career projection, responsibility and freedom are often mentioned, according to leading head hunters in the US and UK.What is the opportunity for tomorrow? Where is my career heading? How much freedom do I have? These are questions often posed by the energy executives, says Curt Ross, head of the energy group at Russell Reynold’s, an executive search firm. In terms of remuneration, the biggest increases have come within the growth in the value of long-term stock incentives, he says.Another big draw is the chance to run one’s own show after years of relative confinement. David Sambrooks, 49, jumped from Devon Energy, the US’s biggest independent energy company, to NFR Energy in 2007.His new employer is a joint venture between Nabors Industries, the oil services company, and First Reserve, the biggest private equity firm in energy. First Reserve handed him $1bn and the assistance of Nabors whose focus is drilling, and told him “go and build a company and find some oil and gas,” says Mr Ross.Andy Baggus, partner at Boyden, the executive search company, says there is a limited number of places to search for people when it comes to fill senior positions. “There is a massive, massive dearth globally,” he saysProject managers able to run the construction of a multi-billion dollar refinery could be found in the construction and infrastructure businesses, while heath and safety executives could come from industries such as chemicals and mining, while exploration and production positions can sometimes be filled by people working at companies collecting seismic data. But, generally, they come from competing oil companies, he says.Other recruiting “academies” include oil service companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton because they invested in new talent even as major oil companies were shedding theirs, headhunters say. Andrew Gould, chief executive and chairman of Schlumberger, likes to quip that the industry will run out of people before it runs out of oil. He sees the labour shortage as one of most significant reasons industry costs have increased dramatically.“Years of underinvestment in new talent have led to a limited and ageing pool of skilled workers. Replacing them cannot be done overnight and while the industry has begun to hire again in considerable numbers, it takes time to train the large numbers of new recruits.” In other words, engineering and geology degrees have turned from joker to trump card not just for top executives.
83;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Executive profile: ‘You can jump to the top very quickly’;;"Three years ago John Schiller, chairman and chief executive of the Nasdaq-listed US oil independent Energy XXI, put himself and his career to what is perhaps the ultimate test. He asked investors to put money into the start-up company purely on trust in him and his team.Energy XXI was formed as a special-purpose acquisitions company: essentially a cash shell with plans to build a business by making deals.“All we had were the three people in the management team and our background,” Mr Schiller says.But with the contacts they had built and their records of achievement at US independents, including Burlington Resources and Devon Energy, they were able to raise $300m.Mr Schiller grew up in an oil and gas family. His father graduated from Texas A&M university – “the best petroleum engineering school in the US”, he says – and worked for Exxon, although in accounting rather than as an engineer.Showing an aptitude for maths and engineering, he followed his father to Texas A&M, and was going to be a chemical engineer. His interest in petroleum engineering was kindled, however, when engineers from Shell came to the university to talk about what they did.“They said every day is different, because you never know what fires you are going to fight,” Mr Schiller says. “And I had professors who wrote books on reservoir engineering, talking about going round wells and the things they had seen.”In his first summer at university, he worked for an oil rig company, drilling wells for $5.68 an hour. “We would work 10-hour days and then go and drink for three hours and tell stories.”In subsequent summers he worked for Amoco and Mobil in reservoir engineering, travelling around the oil fields of the US, and graduated in 1981. With the price of oil close to an inflation-adjusted high point that has only recently been exceeded, Mr Schiller had the right qualifications at the right time.“I graduated at the top 10 per cent of my class, and had somewhere in the region of 17 job offers,” he says.He signed on as a staff engineer at Superior Oil.“For the first five years, I was just blowing and going,” he says; in other words, working flat out.“It was a real baptism by fire: there was no formal training, no anything. But I became a senior reservoir engineer.”“After three months on the job, I had responsibility for three of the four largest fields in the company.”In 1984 Superior was bought by Mobil, and the following year Mr Schiller moved to Meridian Oil, the energy division of Burlington Resources.“I spent five years living on rigs,” he says. “Then at 27 years old, I was working in a corporate environment when the oil price collapsed. That was an eye-opening event. Then you saw guys who are pretty much legends in the business for handling that.”He spent the longest period of his career with a single employer at Meridian: 14 years in roles including a spell in corporate mergers and acquisitions, and two years putting in a settlement and accounting system.“If you are going to be a CEO, you have to get that range of experience,” he says.“I think one unique thing I have is the two years I spent on the finance side. There are not a lot of guys from the operations side, engineers, who can ask the questions I can ask in meetings about accounting.”In 1999, he moved to be vice-president for exploration and production at Ocean Energy, where he gained his first international experience. He never lived outside the US, but was constantly travelling to Ocean’s fields in west Africa, Egypt and Yemen.Then in 2003, Ocean was sold to Devon Energy, where he became vice-president for exploration and production.That was a big step up in scale: Ocean produced about 165,000 barrels a day, while Devon did 600,000-plus.But after a year he decided it was not right for him, and he left, spending some “time off” and working as the interim chief executive of a small oil services company, before coming back with Energy XXI.For petroleum engineers starting out on their careers, he says: “It’s an absolutely brilliant time to be doing it. You can be a graduate with a six-figure income.”The demographics of the industry favours ambitious young engineers, he adds.“I just turned 49, and I am exactly the median age of professionals in oil and gas. So in the next six years, half of them are going to get to the retirement age of 55. So what that creates is a great opportunity.”It is in the smaller companies, he adds, that the opportunities for progress at a young age can be greatest.“You have to look yourself in the mirror and say: ‘Are you confident that you are a good engineer, and are you a self-starter?’ If so, you should go into an independent company, because the type of opportunities you get there are quite different. It is not that the majors are not good, but they make sure people have more guidance before they are on their own,” he says.“In the independents, if you are a specialist in engineering with good leadership skills, you can jump to the top very quickly.”"
84;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-04-09T03:33:53Z;Wellstream recovery boosts Candover;;"Candover, the private equity company, showed patience is often a virtue for difficult investments by making a big profit on the sale of its £170m ($334m) minority stake in Wellstream, the supplier of pipes for offshore drilling.The prospects for Candover’s investment looked very different when it wrote off the entire value of its stake in 2004, as Wellstream suffered contract delays in Brazil just a year after it was bought for €123m ($193m) from Halliburton of the US.However, the company has since recovered, benefiting from the surging oil price to generate strong growth. Candover sold most of its 77 per cent stake in Wellstream as part of an initial public offering last year, earning several times its initial outlay.Wellstream shares floated at 320p and on Tuesday closed down 59p at £12.58 on the news of Candover’s sale.Tuesday’s share placement, handled by Credit Suisse, means the private equity company has now generated at least a 6.5 times return on its initial equity investment of €70m.Investors may ask why Candover did not wait longer before floating the company. But its backers are still likely to welcome Tuesday’s sale of Wellstream shares, as the flow of cash back to private equity investors has slowed markedly since the credit crisis caused a sharp drop in buy-out activity.Candover recently made a £1.3bn approach to acquire Expro International, the oilfield services company, amid a flurry of private equity activity in the sector, including First Reserve’s £906m buy-out of Abbot, the oil-drilling rig operator.Wellstream is the world’s second-largest supplier of offshore flexible pipe products with a 26 per cent share of a market forecast to be worth $1.9bn (£965m) by 2011.While the biggest supplier, France’s Technip, has a 60 per cent share, Wellstream is expanding rapidly in Newcastle upon Tyne and at its plant in Niteroi, Brazil, which opened last May after a £35m capital investment.The company aims to increase production capacity by the end of 2008 by nearly 40 per cent, to 570km of piping a year. Its 2007 aggregate order intake was £365m; at the end of December it had a backlog worth about £330m.With new contracts from Petrobras, BHP Billiton, Devon Energy, Anardarko and StatoilHydro, the company last year increased revenues 81 per cent to £266.8m as operating profits more than doubled to £56.9m."
85;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-03-09T20:47:40Z;Oil groups suffer Gulf of Mexico setback;;Disappointing oil exploration results in the Gulf of Mexico are upsetting the hopes of US oil majors for big new findings in an area free from interference by foreign, state-owned oil companies.Wood MacKenzie, the energy consultancy, said in a new report that findings in the Gulf in 2007 were the lowest of the past decade. With a total of 553m barrels of oil equivalent, these new reserves were less than half of what was found in 2006.The deep-water Gulf of Mexico is one of the few areas to which the majors have access without the fear of intervention by state-owned oil companies.National oil companies now control more than 80 per cent of the world’s oil reserves and have used new-found wealth and skills developed under the majors to bar them from many new exploration sites.“The Gulf of Mexico represents what many companies believed was the safest, most prospective area open to them in the world,’’ said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. Disappointing exploration results put more pressure on the companies’ portfolios, he said.According to the report, exploration in the Gulf deep-water region is becoming more costly. The average quantity discovered per exploration well decreased in 2007 to 16m barrels of oil equivalent – well below the 10-year average for the region of 26m barrels of oil equivalent per exploration well.It took billions of dollars to develop reserves in the deep water, said Tim Sampson, the American Petroleum Institute’s senior adviser of Upstream. “So, to make a project economically viable, you have to have an extremely good find.’’Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest private oil company, said: “When you are dealing in that kind of water depth, you need to try to get about a billion or so (barrels) under a facility to make it work.”With a couple of notable exceptions, he said, most of the industry’s discoveries had been 100m barrels – some less, some slightly more. BP projects its Thunder Horse project in the Gulf of Mexico will yield 1bn barrels, but it has been beset with a host of problems delaying production.Chevron, the largest leaseholder in the Gulf, claimed a number of “significant” finds, with its Tahiti project containing estimated recoverable reserves of 400m to 500m oil-equivalent barrels, among its biggest discoveries.Devon boasted of four significant discoveries since 2002, each estimated to contain 300m to more than 500m barrels of oil equivalent. All three companies said they would continue to work in the Gulf deep water.BP projects its Thunder Horse project in the Gulf of Mexico will yield 1bn barrels, but it has been beset with production problems.………………………………………………….Domestic needs drive Opec priceMany oil-producing countries cannot afford to let the price of oil drop as the revenue they require to assure macroeconomic stability at home continues to increase, a new report by PFC Energy, a leading oil consultancy, reveals.Owing to increased government spending and domestic consumption, as well as inflation and the erosion of the US dollar, the threshold oil price has risen for every Opec member with the exception of Qatar since 2000.According to PFC’s National Oil Company service, Venezuela is most dependent on high and rising prices, requiring a minimum of $94 a barrel this year and $97 next year to balance its external accounts. Nigeria requires a price of at least $68 per barrel this year and $71 next year, Iran $55 this year and $58 next year, and Saudi Arabia at $55 this year and $62 next. Kuwait, UAE, Algeria and Qatar do not require oil prices above $50 a barrel.“The economies of most producer countries now require massive (revenue) flows, which are only possible with higher prices,’’ said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy. “This is one of the factors leading to long-term higher prices.’’The report illustrated why Opec did not decide to increase supply at its meeting last week in Vienna despite prices of more than $100 a barrel, he said.Algeria, and to a lesser extent Venezuela and Iran, even pushed for a production cut to ensure that record oil prices were sustained. In the end the cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, left production limits unchanged.The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, estimates that Opec oil export revenues would jump this year to $862bn, nearly 28 per cent up on last year.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
86;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-03-05T02:25:30Z;Statoil in $2.1bn expansion;;StatoilHydro, Norway’s state-controlled oil and gas company, has continued its expansion by spending up to $2.1bn on operations in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.It bought the 50 per cent it did not own in Peregrino, a heavy oil field in Brazil, and 25 per cent of the deep water Kaskida discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, from Anadarko Petroleum of the US.The acquisitions form part of a strategy to reduce its reliance on Norwegian deposits as they deplete and diversify internationally.The price comprises $1.8bn for the assets and a “maximum pre-tax value of $300m related to the Peregrino field to be earned by 2020 conditional on future oil prices above predetermined thresholds”, the Norwegian company said.Statoil said the Peregrino field has “expected reserves of approximately 500m barrels, excluding identified upsides” and “is expected to come on stream in 2010”.It added it sees a “significant upside in the recoverable resources in Peregrino, both by a further increase in today’s 20 per cent recovery factor and by including additional resources outside the Peregrino main field”.Kaskida is one of the largest deep water discoveries in the US Gulf of Mexico in recent years, and is 55 per cent owned by BP and 20 per cent by Devon Energy.
87;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2008-02-22T21:48:54Z;The last of the Wildcatters;;"George Mitchell remembers how Houston’s oil men used to do business. It was 1946 and the war had not long ended. Every morning at 9am, brokers gathered in the Esperson Drug Store and struck deals over coffee for money and acreage to drill wells.Mitchell, who had a degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M, worked for oil group Amoco for a year and a half before serving in the US Army Corps of Engineers. After a five-year tour of duty building gun plants, airfields and other military facilities in Texas and Louisiana, he returned to the oil patch and looked for work. It was then that Mitchell started an oil company, acting as geologist and engineer, with his brother as broker, and a secretary to do the paperwork. The business was small, but, like Texas, determined to make something of itself.By the time Mitchell retired in 2002, following the sale of Mitchell Energy to Devon Energy, he had built his dream into an exploration company with 2,000 employees. Mitchell Energy had also pioneered a new technology for extracting gas from shale, which opened up the Barnett Shale in north Texas to development, making it the largest gas field in north America and making Mitchell a billionaire.This sharp and thoughtful man is number 135 on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America, with an estimated fortune of $2.8bn. Yet, at the age of 88, Mitchell sees a disquieting trend. He is no longer surrounded, on these rich lists, by his friends and associates from the Esperson Drug Store days. In 1982, there were 65 Texans on the Forbes 400 rich list. In 2006, there were 36. While the southern state is still considered the energy capital of the world, Mitchell notes that some of its richest beneficiaries now live in London, in large part because of laws (which, to much uproar this month, the British government had proposed changing) excusing them from paying tax on business done outside the UK.“That’s a totally unfair advantage for London – I have to say that this country better wake up,” he says. London is not the only rival. Dubai is also fighting hard for business. Last year the oilfield giant Halliburton made the first high-profile move there, establishing dual headquarters in Houston and Dubai, with its chief executive, Dave Lesar, relocating to the United Arab Emirates.“The Middle East is where all the money is. That is where all the action is going to happen,” Mitchell says in a skyscraper office towering over downtown Houston. The room has the trimmings one might expect of a self-made man from Texas: a plaque marking his induction into the All-American Wildcatters Association; an oil drop sculpture from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for distinguished and significant contributions to the petroleum industry; a bust of Albert Einstein designating his membership in the Einstein Society of National Academies; and a sculpture anointing him as a National Master Entrepreneur of the Year. But his mind is set on threats to Houston’s future, not the glories of the past.“[Dubai] is a terrible climate to have companies – in the heat of the desert, the temperature is 125 degrees in the summertime.” But, he says, “they are going to fight like hell to get an empire built in that area.”In 1901, at Spindletop Hill, Texas, a newly discovered geyser of oil gushed out enough black liquid to fill 80,000 barrels every day. More than a century later, the extraordinary scenes that marked the beginnings of the US’s petroleum empire are gone. “Easy” reserves have been tapped. Instead, companies are gnawing and splitting into shale rock to get oil and gas out, or searching deeper under the Gulf of Mexico, hoping to strike new reserves.“The state is kind of picked over,” says Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. The oil and gas that is left requires millions of dollars to exploit, using state-of-the-art technology. That means it is mostly well-funded corporations – not individuals – reaping the profits. “You’re not going to have an individual going out and drilling in the deep water,” says Jaffe.The “wildcatters” of the past had far greater freedom, doing deals on a smile and a handshake. T. Boone Pickens, another Houston wildcatter turned billionaire, once put it this way: “Keep things informal. Talking is the natural way to do business. Writing is great for keeping records and putting down details, but talk generates ideas. Great things come from our luncheon meetings, which consist of a sandwich, a cup of soup, and a good idea or two. No Martinis.” (Pickens is 117th on Forbes’ richest Americans list, with a $3bn fortune.)That is how Texas built its oil industry. And while many of the wildcatters have died, retired, or sold their discoveries to the majors, some of the wells they found can still be seen pumping oil by the side of lonely Texas highways, amid the bluebells, grazing cows and, increasingly, windmills generating electricity for nearby farms.John Walker, president and chief executive of EnerVest, a manager of oil and gas assets for institutional investors, says there are still a number of small-time investors, or entrepreneurs, with an oil well here and there, and they are still able to make money, but it is just “a few quibbling million dollars”. That is not enough to enable them to compete with the richest of the rich on the Forbes list, many of whom are benefiting from other growth areas in the economy.The natural decline of Mitchell and Pickens’ informal, oil-abundant age may help to explain the decline in Texans on the Forbes richer-than-rich list. But it leaves unanswered the question of what the future holds for the US oil kingdom and the Bush heartland in light of the potential exodus to Dubai and London. Will Texas still make people rich in 20 years’ time? And if so, how?Houston, the centre of Texas’s energy industry, recognises that it has a problem. The Greater Houston Partnership, the region’s business advocacy organisation, has appointed a committee, the Energy Collaborative, with the express purpose of sustaining Houston’s status as the energy capital of the world. Lane Sloan, director of the University of Houston’s Strategic Energy Alliance, was its second chairman.“We’re in the middle of a phase change,” he said, just before stepping down at the beginning of this year. “Before the industrial revolution, wood was the main source of energy. Then came coal. Hydrocarbons have dominated for the past 100 years, but they now comprise only about 55 per cent of the overall energy supply. Energy demand is expected to double by 2050, and yet oil and gas are becoming increasingly harder to come by.”Alternative sources of energy are needed to meet demand and, concurrently, to hold on to the city’s reputation. “The idea behind perpetuating Houston as the energy capital has been perpetuating its technological development,” Sloan says. So Texas has become the biggest producer of wind energy in the US, and is building a portfolio of other technologies involving solar, biofuels, coal and carbon dioxide capture. Its rush into technology has been made easier by the energy infrastructure already here. There are more than a half dozen top-notch universities, each of which features energy courses in its curriculum. But, says Sloan: “There is no one, single answer.”Almost 50 per cent of the Houston region’s $325bn economy is energy related. To put that in perspective, Houston has what amounts to the world’s 21st largest economy – one so big it was the only US city invited to the World Economic Forum to represent its business community at a summit last year in China. On Thusday, Houston is due to host a summit on energy at which the US presidential candidates will discuss energy issues.“We can slice the data a lot of different ways,” says Jeff Moseley, president and chief executive of the Greater Houston Partnership. “The bottom line seems to be that while the number of billionaires from Texas may be shrinking, companies here are doing very well and can contribute to its future.” Look no further than “Opportunity Houston”, a marketing effort to raise $40m over the next five years to create 600,000 jobs, $60bn in capital investment and $120bn in foreign trade, increasing to $225bn during the next 10 years. There are more than 3,600 energy companies in Houston to help meet these targets.Yet the clock is ticking at all energy companies in the US, where the average worker is 54 and approaching retirement. Houston is desperate to attract more young people into the sector, dispatching oil executives to speak to school children and, in a more aggressive push, opening the Academy of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology at Milby High School this year. It is the first of four public high-school learning centres focusing on the petroleum industry. At the inauguration, Mayor Bill White said: “Investing in minds is the way Houston will continue to be one of America’s great cities for opportunity and growth, especially in the petroleum industry.”Even as some companies, or their bosses, leave Houston, others continue to be drawn to it for the businesses – and the people – who are here. “There is certainly an historic tie to doing business on a handshake that goes back to the wildcatter days,” says Moseley from the Greater Houston Partnership. Kenneth Mackie, president of Rotech Subsea, an exploration company, says that establishing headquarters in Houston is integral to international success. “You have to be here. Houston is at the heart of the world’s oil industry.”Alex Archila, chief executive of Madagascar Oil, is another example of someone who felt he “had to be here” to get anything done. He moved his headquarters from London to Houston at the end of 2006. Houstonites, he says, not only understand the heavy oil he is producing in Madagascar, but also have crucial professional experience in oil and gas finance, accounting and logistics.“Much of the equipment can be designed and constructed in north America – it is so much easier when you can meet with people face to face,” Archila says. Tim Vail, president and chief executive of SES, moved his coal-to-gas headquarters to Houston from China, where the work is being done. The company needed more skilled engineering and energy technology personnel to help it take waste and low-rank coal and gasify it to create chemical products: “SES needed solid process engineers and technologists, and they congregate where the big firms are, and that is Houston.”To keep businesses coming here, Houston’s leaders have ensured the economy is diversified beyond oil and gas, with aggressive lobbying and flexible funding for relocating businesses. It also has one of the lowest tax burdens in the US – 28 per cent less than the national average, with no personal income tax, no state tax on property used for pollution control, no state tax on goods in transit and no state tax on machinery and equipment used in manufacturing.Houston is home to the Texas Medical Center, the world’s largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions, as well as Nasa’s Johnson Space Center. Texas also has strong biotechnology, high-tech and aviation industries. Dell is based here, as are Continental, American Airlines and Southwest. Dr Richard Murray, director of the University of Houston’s Center for Public Policy, said that while the number of billionaires may be dropping, many people are still doing very well: “We’re still selling many $200 bottles of wine in high-end restaurants.”Yet for all the diversification, Mitchell believes Texas’s future depends largely upon its ability to maintain its standing as energy capital of the world – and not to give in to challenges from London and Dubai.“[We have to convince] companies that we have good travel options to Dubai and to other places, we have more comfortable living conditions here. We have action with all the other companies here. We have to show them what is already here. And I think that other companies will begin to move their business in, and their companies in, and maybe their headquarters in.”The octogenarian oil man pauses, then finishes: “Houston has got to fight back.”Sheila McNulty is the FT’s US energy correspondent based in Houston."

That is expected to rise to an average of between 31,000 and 34,000 boe/d in 2007.It also benefited from a $6.50 boe increase in the price it realised from sales.The new oil and gas will largely come from Egyptian assets acquired from Devon Energy. That $375m deal is seen closing in the third quarter. The scale of the deal led the board to recommend that no dividend was paid for the year.Once the Devon deal is completed, Tom Cross, chief executive of Dana, said: “Dana will be producing from 29 fields, providing a strong and balanced base of cash flow enabling the company to deliver its intensive drilling programme throughout the next two years…”As many as 32 exploration and appraisal wells are likely on assets in the UK, Egypt, Mauritania and Morocco. The 12 firmly planned wells could each have “significant upside” and Mr Cross believes the next 12 months “will see the most exciting phase of the company’s development so far”.Reported pre-tax profits fell some 10 per cent to £97m as Dana suffered a £9.7m loss on currencies and £19m of exceptional gains made the previous year were not repeated. Turnover rose 30 per cent to over £215m.In early London trading, Dana shares were 0.8 per cent lower at £10.15.
89;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2007-02-18T22:05:41Z;Study sees harmful hunt for extra oil;;All the world’s extra oil supply is likely to come from expensive and environmentally damaging unconventional sources within 15 years, according to a detailed study.This will mean increasing reliance on hard-to-develop sources of energy such as the Canadian oil sands and Venezuela’s Orinoco tar belt.A report from Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultancy, calculates that the world holds 3,600bn barrels of unconventional oil and gas that need a lot of energy to extract.So far only 8 per cent of that has begun to be developed, because the world has relied on easier sources of oil and gas.Only 15 per cent of the 3,600bn is heavy and extra-heavy oil, with the rest being even more challenging.The study makes clear the shift could come sooner than many people in the industry had expected, even though some major conventional oil fields will still be increasing their production in 2020. Those increases will not be enough to offset the decline at other fields.“It becomes unclear beyond 2020 that conventional oil will be able to meet any of the demand growth,” Wood Mackenzie said. The report added that natural gas products such as liquids and condensate would also become important sources of growth.The increasing reliance on unconventional oil will require a substantial reshaping of the energy industry.Royal Dutch Shell and Total of Europe and ExxonMobil and Chevron, the US-based energy groups, have already begun to invest heavily in Canada and Venezuela.Others – including Chinese energy groups – are looking at the possibility of extracting heavy oil from Madagascar.On the gas front, Devon Energy last year spent $2.2bn (€1.7bn, £1.1bn) expanding its already sizeable position in Texas’s Barnett shale by acquiring Chief Oil and Gas. The development of such shale deposits is expected to help the US get 40 per cent of its production from unconventional sources by 2020.But the challenge is huge, said Matthew Simmons, an industry banker who sent shock waves through the oil world when he questioned whether Saudi Arabia, the most important oil source, would be able to continue to expand production.“The ability to extract this heavy oil in significant volumes is still non-existent,” he said in a recent speech.“Worse, it takes vast quantities of scarce and valuable potable water and natural gas to turn unusable oil into heavy low-quality oil.”“In a sense, this exercise is like turning gold into lead,” Mr Simmons said.
90;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2006-10-23T20:52:30Z;Optimists hope oilsands will deliver;;For optimists about global oil reserves and US energy security, Canada’s oilsands are a vital piece of evidence.Located in three main deposits across an area the size of Florida, the Alberta oilsands are estimated to contain reserves of 179bn barrels of oil, a figure exceeded only by Saudi Arabia.The sands have been exploited since the 1970s. But as the price of oil soared, oilsands rose to prominence as one of the solutions to the US’s dependence on energy supplies from the Middle East and other politically unstable areas.Canada already supplies about 2m barrels per day of the US’s consumption of 12m b/d: about half of that coming from oilsands. As other sources of oil decline, the importance of the oil sands is expected to grow.The problem, however, is that costs of producing oil from the sands are high and rising fast.As the oil price has fallen by more than 20 per cent from its peak in the summer, the outlook for Canada’s oilsands has been clouded by fears that oil may not be expensive enough to keep the industry viable.The oilsands, which look and feel like molasses, are found in bands between 6-10 metres thick.Extracting the oil is laborious. Two tonnes of oilsands yield just 1.25 barrels of bitumen and a barrel of crude.Foreign players have flocked to the oilsands in recent years. ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, Devon Energy and France’s Total are among those with stakes in either existing or proposed projects.Two of China’s biggest energy groups, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Sinopec Group, have invested in small Calgary-based companies with oilsands ambitions.The half-dozen or so existing oilsands producers currently turn out about 1m barrels per day. If all the projects now on the drawing boards come to fruition, output could rise to almost 3m b/d by 2015.But as investment has poured into the region, at a time of strong demand for skilled staff and equipment, costs have soared.Petro-Canada estimated earlier this month that the cost of expanding its Mackay River oilsands project had soared.Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto concluded in a study that companies were taking a more cautious view of oilsands projects as a result of escalating labour and material costs.The study noted that “the non-discretionary nature of oilsands capital spending, long lead times to first oil production and escalating costs in a highly competitive environment combine to create significant potential financial and execution risk for companies with major oilsands projects should prices weaken”.Several companies are having second thoughts about their projects.For instance, Husky Energy, controlled by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, is reconsidering plans to build an upgrader for its project.“Under the current economics and also the labour supply, and the cost of construction, it is very difficult and it is very challenging to maintain the building in Canada”, John Lau, Husky’s chief executive, said earlier this year.Murray Edwards, vice-chairman of Canadian Natural Resources, which has big plans for the oilsands, argued last month that many of the projects now being proposed would need oil above $50 a barrel to be profitable.However, different companies take different views. Integrated oil companies have the ability to benefit from taking the oil they extract and to refine it and sell the products, which the companies that only have upstream operations cannot. That should help make the business viable at lower oil prices than for some competitors.However, while oilsands may have their difficulties, none of the other options available to international oil companies is easy.“International oil companies are having to adapt to survive,” says Jason Kenney of ING.“Politically, outside of the OECD countries, things are getting worse and worse. With oilsands, at least companies have got a chance of keeping the reserves in the long term, and they know they can get earnings out of them.”

94;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2006-09-05T23:02:18Z;Chevron hails Gulf test drill results;;Chevron and two partners on Tuesday hailed the results of test drilling at a new field in the Gulf of Mexico, though analysts remain cautious about the impact of climate change on future production in the hurricane-prone region.The tests are viewed as an important milestone in the development of the Jack field in the deep waters of the Gulf, which have emerged as the only source of growth for domestic US oil production as older onshore wells pass their peak.However, analysts said the wide range of estimates for potential production from Jack – anything from 3bn-15bn barrels of recoverable reserves – and delays at nearby fields raised “a red flag” for any hope that it would reduce US dependence on imports.“I think we are going to find that the Gulf becomes an increasingly problematic source of supply,” said Jeff Rubin, oil analyst at CIBC, pointing to the disruption from last year’s hurricanes which have left 180,000 barrels a day of production “shut in” as engineers continue repairs.Mr Rubin maintained that total production from the US and Mexican sectors of the Gulf was likely to remain at current levels of 1.3m-1.4m barrels a day as new deep–water fields took on the mantle of declining coastal reservoirs. This is well below the 2m barrel-a-day estimate from the US department of the interior.Chevron, which is developing Jack alongside Devon Energy and Norway’s Statoil, said the latest test drill set several records, highlighting the extreme conditions – and higher operating costs – experienced in the Gulf’s deep waters.John Richels, president of Devon Energy, told the FT that it was “still early days”, with a second test drill scheduled for next year, and a final decision whether to develop the field is expected by 2008.However, Mr Richels said the test showed for the first time that coimmercially-viable reserves could be recovered from the so-called Lower Tertiary Trend, a 300-mile strip of the Gulf which has been the focus of intense exploration in recent years.However, the intense hurricane activity in the Gulf over the past two years disrupted undersea pipelines and production platforms, and have delayed the start of pumping from new fields such as Thunder Horse and Atlantis by more than 12 months. Other prospects in the region have also seen initial estimates of reserves downgraded in recent months.“The US is in exactly the same boat as it was before [this announcement],” said Mr Rubin, pointing to an increasing dependence on energy imports unless demand was constrained.Mr Richels contended that much of the damage last year was to older platforms, and that newer structures could withstand hurricanes “quite a bit better”.

101;DVN;Devon Energy Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
