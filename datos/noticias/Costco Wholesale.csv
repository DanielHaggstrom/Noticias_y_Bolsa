0;COST;Costco Wholesale;2019-08-27T15:25:58Z;Costco/China: flat contradictions;Exuberant scenes in Shanghai belie challenges ahead for the US discount retailer;Every so often, America wins foreign hearts and minds with a slick consumer proposition. One thinks of Russia’s first McDonald’s and Selfridges, the UK’s first US-style big store. Should Costco Shanghai join the roll of honour? The first Chinese outlet of the discount retailer is no glitzier than stores back home. Huge crowds still forced the shop to shut early.Mass retailing models generally travel no better than fresh vegetables. Walmart and Best Buy failed to revolutionise UK shopping. Tesco’s Fresh & Easy flopped in the US. Why should Costco Wholesale do any better in China?Price is the reason Costco could thrive. Consumerism is unchained in China. But average wages remain modest. Costco has low group gross margins — the difference between the cost of goods and selling prices — of 13 per cent. That compares with US supermarket chain Kroger at 22 per cent and general retailer Target at 29 per cent, according to S&P CIQ.Costco stores in the US are bright, cheerless barns, where newbies risk a skittling from trolleys given uncontrollable momentum by heavy bulk purchases. These merit big discounts, encouraging 90 per cent of subscribers of the members-only retailer to renew yearly.Inhabitants of nominally Communist countries are inured to austerity. Costco may fail other tests. First, where would the typical Chinese shopper stash all that stuff? In the US, Costco sells some toilet rolls in packs of 30. No problem in an average US dwelling of over 2,000 square feet. It is trickier in a typical Chinese apartment less than one-third that size.The second problem is that Chinese people mostly shop locally and often. Huge destination stores are poorly adapted to this preference. Japanese “combinis” — convenience stores such as FamilyMart — look better positioned.JPMorgan has prophesied that Costco can double its store base through global expansion. This is highly optimistic, despite exuberant scenes in Shanghai. The chain has little presence outside North America. Only one thing is overpriced at Costco — shares trading at 33 times forward earnings.
1;COST;Costco Wholesale;2019-08-27T09:24:27Z;Costco shuts early on first day in China because of overcrowding;Officials warn over heavy traffic as shoppers flock to store on opening day in Shanghai;Costco, the US big box retail chain, was forced to close early on its first day of operations in China due to large crowds of bargain-hunting shoppers.Despite a deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, thousands of people thronged the aisles of its maiden store in Shanghai as the US chain became the latest overseas retailer to try its luck in China’s fast-growing consumer market.Traffic within a 1km radius around the Costco outlet was brought to a near-standstill on Tuesday as lines of people formed outside. The store suspended operations in the afternoon after officials warned over the traffic.“There are discounts as the business is opening now. Meat is cheap here,” said Rick Zhou, 31, who drove for more than an hour to the store. “Milk powder is very cheap and meat is cheaper than the average supermarket,” said a 60-year-old man Mr Wang, who spent Rmb1800 ($251) at the store, adding: “New Zealand apples are also well-priced.”Costco said it had sent a message to members, via the company’s mobile app, confirming the store had shut earlier than expected. “Because there is a high concentration of people around the newly opened supermarket, for the safety of the public we recommend that residents consume in a reasonable manner,” state-run media outlet The Paper quoted a notice from Shanghai government officials as saying.A long queue formed outside the store’s entrance on Tuesday morning, with some parts of the store so full they were impossible to enter immediately. Costco’s own-brand baked goods, such as muffins, were among the most popular items. The Costco opening comes almost three months after German supermarket chain Aldi opened its first stores in China, setting up a battle to win over customers in a fragmented market in which foreign operators have traditionally struggled. France’s Carrefour sold a majority stake in its China operations to local retailer Suning for $700m in June, following in the footsteps of Britain’s Tesco and Spain’s Dia, which have also sold out of the country. Germany’s Metro is in the process of selling its China unit.Walmart is still expanding in China, but has struggled to gain more than a single-digit share of the market. The Costco opening highlighted optimism among US companies about the Chinese market, where wealthy consumers are increasingly demanding high-quality products that foreign brands are well-positioned to provide. US direct investment into China rose 1.5 per cent in the first half of the year from the average amount recorded in the period over the past two years, according to consultancy the Rhodium Group. The growth was driven by projects such as Tesla’s factory in Shanghai. 
2;COST;Costco Wholesale;2019-03-08T17:05:46Z;Costco tops S&P 500 after earnings beat, raises minimum wage;;Costco shares were heading for their biggest one-day gain in four years after reporting second-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street forecasts and even as the wholesale retailer said it would raise its minimum wage to $15.It is the second such pay rise for the company’s roughly 163,000 full- and part-time workers in the US within the past year and has taken place as rivals including Amazon, Walmart and Target also raised minimum wages for their employees in 2018.Such wage increases, which represent efforts by companies to hire and retain workers in a tightening labour market, were borne out by national jobs data that showed year-on-year hourly earnings rose in February to their highest level in almost a decade.The pay increases have led to a rise in overall company expenses since the hourly minimum was raised by a dollar to $14 last June. Chief financial officer Richard Galanti told analysts the new minimum of $15, which took effect on Monday, as well as increased wages for supervisors and paid parental leave, “will add about 3 to 4 basis points to [selling, general and administration] expenses over the next four quarters.”Regardless, investors welcomed an otherwise solid result from the company — which sells everything from paper towels to home appliances in its warehouse stores, to fee-paying members — as forecast-busting earnings after Thursday’s closing bell offset disappointment with a slight miss in total revenue and a strong US dollar.Earnings jumped 26.4 per cent jump to $2.01 a diluted share, roaring past the median estimate among analysts of $1.69 in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv. That came on a 7.3 per cent rise in total revenue to $35.4bn, which fell short of market forecasts for $35.67bn.Reported gross margin, a proxy of profitability, rose to 11.29 per cent from 10.98 per cent a year ago.Costco, which is headquartered in the west coast state of Washington, said comparable sales — a key industry metric tracking revenue from stores open a year or more — were up 7.4 per cent in its primary US market for the 12 weeks ended February 17 compared with a year ago.For the entire company, comparable sales were up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, while ecommerce sales were up 20.2 per cent. All those figures were slower paces of growth than what the company reported in its first quarter.Costco last year described the situation with the Trump administration’s tariffs, particularly those imposed upon China, was “extremely fluid”, and Mr Galanti told analysts that although the levies had not helped margins, “it probably hurt it less than one might think.”Dovetailing with recent concerns among Federal Reserve policymakers about tepid US inflation, Mr Galanti said there was “little” sign of it from the company’s perspective. “We’re not seeing — other than the tariff impacts and things. But in terms of food and what have you, it is frankly very little,” he said.Shares were up 5 per cent at a three-month high of $227.66 on Friday morning, positioning it as the top performer in the S&P 500 and lining up for their biggest one-day advance since February 2015. The stock, which has a market capitalisation approaching $100bn, is up 11.6 per cent so far in 2019.Costco plans to begin ecommerce operations in Japan and Australia later this year.
3;COST;Costco Wholesale;2018-10-04T22:25:43Z;Costco revenue tops expectations in Q4, but higher wages bite;;Costco’s reported better than expected revenue growth in its fourth quarter, but higher wage costs left earnings only in line with Wall Street forecasts.The wholesale retailer — which sells everything from paper towels to home appliances in its warehouse stores, to fee-paying members — noted that higher US wages had pushed up its selling and administrative expenses and that it was still trying to gauge the impact that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs might have on operations.Costco, which is headquartered in the west coast state of Washington, reported a 5 per cent year-on-year rise in total sales to $44.41bn in the quarter ended September 2, and which came in higher than the $44.37bn analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast.Comparable sales, a key measure of sales growth at stores opened for a year or longer, was up 9.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, which was down from an 11.7 per cent pace in the previous quarter. Costco has built up successful e-commerce operations, and comparable sales here rose 26.2 per cent during the period.Net profit rose 13.5 per cent from a year ago to $1.04bn, or $2.36 a diluted share, which matched Wall Street expectations.During the company’s conference call with analysts, management said a rise in wages over the summer had adversely affected its selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 basis points.Management said the situation with the Trump administration’s tariffs, particularly those imposed upon China, was “extremely fluid”, and that while it was working with suppliers to see what could be done to reduce or absorb some cost increase, it was also taking advantage of lower prices for US items such pork, nuts and soyabeans.Costco shares were down 2.1 per cent in after-hours trade on Thursday, and down about 7.1 per cent from a record high close of $244.21 about a month ago
4;COST;Costco Wholesale;2018-08-20T08:00:25Z;US banks tap the brakes on consumer credit;Spending is up, but concern is growing over credit quality and profitability;"This is a good time to offer Americans credit. Economic growth is solid, unemployment is low, and wallets are open.In July, retail sales grew at a sturdy 6 per cent from the year before, faster than analysts had expected. The prosperity extends even to dowdy brick-and-mortar stores: Macy’s, the struggling department store chain, last week posted its third straight quarter of sales growth after several years of declines. Walmart, the vast discount retailer, reported its best quarterly sales growth in 10 years. At the other end of the price spectrum, Nordstrom, the upscale department store chain, reported a big jump in sales which drove its stock up 13 per cent.Nor does the spending seem to be especially reckless. When, at the beginning of last year, household debt surpassed its last peak, in 2008, many pundits speculated about the possibility of a new financial crisis. But US household debt — all $13.3tn of it, according to the New York Fed — is much lower, relative to both GDP and disposable income, than it was in the run-up to 2008.The big card-issuing banks are pleased. In second-quarter calls with analysts, JPMorgan highlighted that consumer purchases using their cards were up 11 per cent; Bank of America’s purchase growth was almost as high. Citigroup and Capital One pointed out loan balances were growing nicely.If the card business is picnic, though, it is a late summer picnic; the watermelon has already been served, and the skies are showing the early signs of darkening. The card issuers acknowledge that, as US consumers have gotten their mojo back, the competition for their business has become very competitive indeed. Savvy Millennials shuffle between cards to maximise rewards and introductory interest rates. Big spenders with good credit ratings are the prize in a “ rewards war”.At the same time, the current economic expansion, at the grand old age of nine years, is the second longest on record. That does not provide any particular reason to think it is near an end. But trees do not grow to the sky.$8bnQuarterly bad credit card debt write-off in 2018The competitive heat and the length of the cycle are making themselves felt in industry-wide data. Measure of credit quality, while not flashing amber, are unmistakably headed in the wrong direction.Quarterly write-offs of bad credit card debt at US banks peaked at nearly $19bn in the first quarter of 2010 and bottomed under $5bn in 2015, according the FDIC. Since then they have crept back over $8bn.The rate at which credit card holders are falling delinquent, while still at a low level, has also been creeping up since 2015. Bankers dismiss these trends as the natural “seasoning” of credit card loan portfolios that have been rebuilt since the recovery. But the numbers show that it is growing harder to sell cards to high-quality customers.Last month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors released its annual report of credit card banks’ profitability. It showed return on assets falling in 2017, for the fourth year in a row. At 3.4 per cent, it is a full third lower than it was in 2013. The Fed noted that a moderate increase in provisions for losses cut into profits. More important, non-interest revenues — which are made up both of payments from merchants and the annual fees and penalty fees charged to card holders — are declining.Part of this is down to big merchants driving harder bargains with the banks and pushing down on fees. Costco, the big discount retailer, moved its branded cards from American Express to Citi last year, for example.“The banks are giving more to the merchants,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays.Another contributor to the squeeze in fee revenue is generous rewards offers for new customers, which are booked against revenue when the customer signs on.Finally, the compression of non-interest revenue is a long-term effect of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) act of 2009, a law that prohibited many punitive fees and limited the ability to raise customers’ rates.“Issuers lost their ability to dynamically re-price and their ability to generate fee income,” said Brian Riley of Mercator Advisory Group.Fee and margin compression is even visible in the accounts of big banks with stout card portfolios: At JPMorgan Chase’s card business, for example, non-interest revenue fell by $1.8bn, to $4bn, between 2013 and 2017, even as the card loan portfolio grew. At the same time, Chase’s “net revenue rate” — all fee and interest income as a proportion of card loans — has been tightening. A similar pattern of flat or declining fees and compressing margins is visible at Citi and Bank of America.As margins compress and credit metrics soften, it becomes harder for banks to keep the pledges — made frequently in the wake of the financial crisis — to run disciplined businesses, even if that means accepting slower growth. If the industry starts chasing profit at the lower end of the credit spectrum, another crunch would become a matter of time.There are some signs that the banks are pulling back: growth in the number of open card accounts has slowed to the low single digits in the last few quarters, according to the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s loan officer survey also shows more large banks tightening standards for card applications than loosening them.If the long cycle should finally start to turn, though, the pressure on bankers to generate profits will grow greater still. Whether they will maintain their discipline even then will determine the outlook for the industry for years to come."
5;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Costco hits all-time high after May sales update;;Costco shares hit a record high on Thursday after the retailer reported steady sales growth for May.The company’s shares rose as much as 2.64 per cent in the morning to reach an all-time high of $202.88.The move comes after Costco said Wednesday evening that net sales for the four weeks ending June 3 jumped 14.1 per cent to $11.02bn from $9.66bn a year ago. Comparable sales, a key gauge of sales growth at previously opened stores, rose 11.7 per cent during the periodNet sales for first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2018 to $103.26bn, up 12.1 per cent year-on-year to $103.26bn. Comparable sales, meanwhile, improved 9.7 per cent during the period.Costco — which sells everything from paper towels to home appliances in its warehouse stores, to fee-paying members — has built a successful e-commerce operations while trying to weather the negative impact of higher gasoline prices on purchasing power as well as a price war with other retailers.Shares of the company has increased around 8.3 per cent this year, outperforming rival Walmart, which is down 13.6 per cent in the year to date.Another retailer is also surging on Thursday on rosy results. Discount store chain Five Below jumped in morning trade, to hit an all-time high of $99.91, after more than doubling its latest quarterly profit. The 22.75 per cent rise is the biggest one-day advance for the company, which went public in 2012.
6;COST;Costco Wholesale;2018-05-31T20:32:48Z;Costco drops after sales come up short;;Costco shares stumbled on Thursday evening after the wholesale retailer’s quarterly sales fell short of analysts’ expectations.US-based Costco said net sales increased 12.1 per cent year-over-year in the three months to May 13, to $31.62bn, coming in just under the $31.913bn that analysts were looking for, according to Thomson Reuters.Net income was $750m, or $1.70 a diluted share, versus the $700m, or $1.59 a share, reported in the year-ago period. Analysts had been looking for net income of $747.48m and earnings per share of $1.69.Costco — which offers a range of items from paper towels to televisions in its warehouse stores, to fee-paying members — said that comparable-store sales, a key gauge of sales growth at previously opened stores, were up 10.2 per cent across the company, and 9.7 per cent in the US. Analysts had expected the metric to gain 7.73 per cent overall and 6.6 per cent in the US, its largest market.Costco shares are up 6.5 per cent so far this year after gaining 20.9 per cent in 2017. They dropped 2.14 per cent in after-hours trading following the results.

The game is on to divide up what is left;Sears may have a future, after all. Validation comes from no less an authority than its nemesis: Amazon. The online retailer and the department store chain have set up a venture where any tyres bought on the internet’s company website can be installed at a Sears Auto Center. Sears shares jumped 16 per cent. This would have been impressive if the equity value was not a feeble $300m.The venerable retailer has been in steady decay for years. It is best known for the efforts of its patron and chief executive, hedgie Eddie Lampert, to keep it afloat and extract value for the benefit of his investment firm. But Sears also demonstrates how bricks-and mortar retailers can endure, even when survival is expensive for investors.The residual value of Sears is a grab bag of intellectual property, real estate and retailing activity. The latter is, of course, the least promising. In 2017, like-for-like sales dropped more than a 10th. Overall revenue was $17bn. Fitch, the rating agency, projects that Sears’ annual cash burn still exceeds $1bn. Asset sales worth some $12bn, many involving Mr Lampert, have kept Sears afloat.The cynical view is that Mr Lampert has hived off value for himself. But there is merit in his vision of Sears as a membership club like Costco, whose flagship brands are available at other retailers. Amazon already sells tools and auto parts from Kenmore and DieHard, two flagship Sears brands.Recently, Mr Lampert’s fund offered to buy Sears-owned property along with its Kenmore brand and some other Sears units. The context is the shrunken equity value and a haircut endured by bondholders. Sears’ enterprise value has slumped under Mr Lampert’s tenure, coinciding with dire conditions in US retail.Sears’ core activity of selling stuff has little value. The game is on to divide up what is left — which Amazon has confirmed is not worthless — between Mr Lampert and other creditors.Sign up to Lex’s new midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters.
8;COST;Costco Wholesale;2018-03-07T21:38:36Z;Tax benefit bolsters Costco profit;;Costco’s quarterly earnings sailed past analysts’ estimates on Wednesday thanks to a boost from US tax reform.For the quarter ending February 18, the US-based wholesale retailer said that sales grew 10.8 per cent year-over-year to $32.8bn, edging just past analysts’ expectations for sales of $32.7bn.Thanks to a benefit from recently enacted US tax reform, net income shot up to $701m for the quarter, or $1.59 a diluted share. Analysts on average were looking for net income of $643.4m, or $1.45 a share.Comparable sales, a key retail industry metric, were up 8.4 per cent across the company, or 5.4 per cent when stripping out the effects of gas, inflation and foreign exchange. A smaller uptick of 7.1 per cent had been expected by Wall Street.At a time when many retailers are racing to adapt to changing shopping habits, Costco has generally held on to its niche as a membership-based warehouse retailer where customers can load up on a range of items from paper towels to flatscreen TVs. But it has been facing more pressure in recent months as Amazon and others try to go toe-to-toe with it on price and convenience.Costco shares were up 20.9 per cent in 2017 but so far this year have been little changed. In after-hours trading, Costco shares ticked up slightly before slipping 0.9 per cent.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
10;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-12-14T21:50:20Z;Costco profit benefits from higher membership fees;;US retailer Costco saw its revenue rise 13.3 per cent year-on-year in the most recent quarter as rising membership fees and the addition of the busy Black Friday shopping day helped boost its bottom line.For the three months ending November 26, sales of $31.12bn were just a hair shy of the $13.3bn analysts’ estimated, according to FactSet. It was a 13.3 per cent increase from the same quarter a year earlier.The fiscal first quarter of 2018 for Costco saw a 1.5 per cent net benefit thanks to the timing of Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving that unofficially launches the holiday shopping season — that fell during that period, compared with the previous year, when it fell in the second quarter.Net income came in at $640m, a substantial boost from the $545m last year and ahead of the $587m that analysts were looking for. Earnings per diluted share were $1.45, topping predictions for $1.33.Earlier this year, Costco boosted the fees it charges shoppers to become “members” and gain access to its warehouse-like stores, where consumers can buy a range of items from TVs to dozens of rolls of paper towels.That helped raise its membership fee revenue to $690m in the quarter, from $630m a year earlier. Comparable sales of 10.5 per cent during the quarter — in line with estimates — fell to 7.9 per cent when the effects of gas, inflation and currency were stripped out.Costco’s unique business model has helped it maintain its toehold even as other retailers largely reliant on brick-and-mortar outlets have struggled in recent years — although it too is looking to grab a piece of the e-commerce pie, and reported e-commerce sales growth of 43 per cent year-over-year in the latest quarter.Its shares are up 21.6 per cent year-to-date and edged slightly higher in after-hours trading before giving up those gains to trade flat.
11;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-10-05T20:46:58Z;Costco shares slip as sales just miss target;;Costco shares dropped in after-hours trading on Thursday after the wholesale retailer reported quarterly sales that came in just a whisker shy of analysts’ estimates, despite beating expectations on profit.US-based Costco said that sales for the quarter ending September 3 came in at $41.36bn, a 15.8 per cent increase from the same period a year earlier, but just shy of the $41.6bn that analysts were expecting, according to Factset.For the quarter, the fourth of Costco’s fiscal 2017, net income of $919m beat out analysts’ forecasts of $888m. Earnings per share of $2.08 comfortably edged out predictions for $2.02.Costco — which stocks its warehouse-like stores with bulk items ranging from paper towels and food to mattresses and televisions — said that same-store sales rose 6.1 per cent for the quarter, versus the 5.7 per cent that Wall Street was expecting. Excluding the impact from fluctuations in gasoline prices and foreign exchange, same-store sales rose 5.7 per cent during the quarter.Costco’s business model differs from many other US retailers in that it charges shoppers a membership fee to gain access. It has generally seen its foot traffic rise and revenues increase at a time when many of its conventional rivals are weathering a general downturn amid rising competition from online retailers.Costco shares have risen 15.8 per cent over the past 12 months. After the earnings release, shares dropped more than 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading.
12;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-08-24T18:15:41Z;Amazon says it will cut prices at Whole Foods, rival grocers’ shares crash;;Bring on the food fight.Amazon once again sent tremors through the supermarket sector on Thursday after it said it will begin cutting prices on products sold at Whole Foods as soon as its acquisition of the upscale grocer is completed on Monday.“Whole Foods Market will offer lower prices starting Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples across its stores, with more to come,” Amazon said in a statement.The spectre of a price war in an industry where margins are already notoriously slim wiped more than $11bn off the market value of the some of the country’s leading grocers.Shares in Kroger fell 6.8 per cent to $21.40 and Sprouts Farmer shares dropped 5.2 per cent to $22.61. Supervalu shares were down 5.1 per cent at $20.72 while Ingles Markets retreated 2.8 per cent to $23.33.Target, which has been looking to ramp up its food retailing business, shed 3.7 per cent of its value. Costco fell 4 per cent to $152.96. Even Walmart, the $238.55bn retail giant that is seen to have deep enough of a pocket to withstand a price war, declined 2 per cent to $78.31.Amazon’s announcement came after its $13.7bn offer for Whole Foods received shareholder approval on Wednesday and after the Federal Trade Commission said it would no longer pursue investigation of the deal.Price perception had been one of the biggest obstacles for Whole Foods as it tried to revive sales growth. The takeover will also see Amazon and Whole Foods Market technology teams begin to integrate Amazon Prime — the company’s subscription service that includes free shipping — into the the grocer’s point-of-sale system.“…when this work is complete, Prime members will receive special savings and in-store benefits,” Amazon added. “This is just the beginning.”
13;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-08-01T21:03:10Z;Costco says chairman and co-founder Jeff Brotman has died;;Jeff Brotman, a co-founder of wholesale retail chain Costco and chairman of its board of directors, died early Tuesday morning, the company announced.“The thoughts of Costco’s board, management and employees are with Jeff’s wife and family,” Costco said in a statement. The company did not elaborate on the cause of death.Brotman and former chief executive Jim Sinegal co-founded Costco in 1983, and it currently operates 746 warehouse stores and has a market cap of more than $70bn, according to Bloomberg data. Its loyal membership base and large stores with a range of items, from electronics and furniture to food and household staples, have helped it buck the recent slump that has beset other brick-and-mortar retailers.
14;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Costco discounted on rivals’ deals, Deutsche Bank downgrade;;Fresh off of big announcements from rival retailers Amazon and Walmart, Costco is struggling to get its shine back.The US-based wholesale retailer saw its shares decline than 1.6 per cent on Monday after having fallen more than 7 per cent in Friday’s session. Monday’s decline came after Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded their view on its shares from buy to hold.That extended the steep drop from Friday, when Costco was among numerous consumer-staple companies to be hammered as investors fretted about what competition they might soon face from a prospective combination of digital retail giant Amazon and upscale grocery chain Whole Foods in a $13.7bn proposed deal. Altogether, since Thursday, Costco has lost $7.6bn of its value.Playing second fiddle to Amazon’s announcement, US retail heavyweight Walmart unveiled a digital deal of its own on Friday, announcing that it was snapping up online men’s apparel business Bonobos for $310m.All that dealmaking has left Costco looking uninspired at the moment, particularly with year-over-year growth in online sales just cracking 11 per cent apiece in its past two quarters, Deutsche Bank analysts Paul Trussell and Tiffany Kanaga wrote in Monday’s report.That compares to the 63 per cent growth in e-commerce sales that Walmart saw in its most recent quarter, as it attempts to shore up its reliance on brick-and-mortar stores with a growing online presence — including through the acquisition of focused digital-first sites like Jet.com and Bonobos.“We are concerned the digital platform is underperforming in price perception (each item includes a shipping surcharge), innovation, and fresh food (available through Instacart and Shipt in select areas) which could put Costco at a meaningful disadvantage over time, especially as Amazon Prime builds its value proposition”, DB analysts wrote.Costco has plotted a steady course of growth by selling memberships to its warehouse-like stores. It has managed to impress Wall Street with positive traffic trends and margin growth, DB analysts said in their note.But its “pipeline of positive catalysts has played out and the competitive background is intensifying with Amazon and Walmart accelerating in-store and online efforts and innovation”, the report said.“The Whole Foods acquisition represents a game changer with Costco’s competitive moat in grocery under greater threat while its digital platform lags peers, putting membership renewal at risk for decline. Costco is still a relative winner in retail with positive traffic trends and healthy core margins, but we go to the sidelines with balanced risk/reward.”Even though it traffics in everything from paper towels to televisions, groceries have “been an important competitive moat” for Costco, which could come under pressure as Amazon breaks into the food business and Walmart implements its own efforts to stay two steps ahead of the emerging rival.Nevertheless, DB analysts said that it’s too soon to count Costco out, particularly as it has weathered a brutal retail environment better than most: “Despite the aforementioned challenges, we do still view Costco as a relative winner in a very tough retail landscape and worthy of a valuation premium with positive traffic trends, healthy core margins, global growth, and an attractive shareholder return story.”

16;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-05-26T19:20:51Z;Costco makes gains despite retailer gloom with upbeat earnings;Broader market fails to maintain momentum after rising to record territory this week;Costco bucked the weakness that hit many bricks-and-mortar retailers at the start of this year, with stronger-than-expected profits and sales, boosting its stock price.The wholesale chain said profits in the quarter that ended on May 7 rose to $700m, or $1.59 a share, compared with $545m, or $1.24 a share, in the year-ago period late on Thursday. Excluding a one-time item, earnings per share of $1.40 topped Wall Street estimates by 9 cents. Shares in Costco rose 1.8 per cent to $177.86 on Friday afternoon, up 11.1 per cent for the year.The upbeat like-for-like sales figures — altered where necessary so that a correct comparison can be made with a previous period — stand in stark contrast with the gloomy results disclosed by a number of other retailers in the first months of 2017. Department stores in particular had a tough go at it as consumers increasingly shun shopping malls.Costco, which operates 732 warehouses, including 510 in the US, differs from many retailers because it runs a membership model that has remained robust, guaranteeing income. One way the store draws consumers in is by operating on-site gas stations, said John Brick, an analyst at Morningstar, with the ability to buy items in bulk — ranging from oatmeal to T-shirts — generally reducing costs to customers and further insulating it from the growing threat of online shopping.“They have a loyal membership base with their annual membership,” he said. “They are really Amazon proof and ecommerce proof because of the value proposition supported by bulk offering and fuel sales. Consumers find value in that.”Comparable-store sales, a key metric for retailers, climbed 5 per cent, better than the 4 per cent rise that analysts had forecast. In the US, Costco’s biggest market, like-for-like sales rose 6 per cent. Meanwhile, total revenues increased 8 per cent to $28.2bn, shy of analyst forecasts of $28.5bn.On June 1 Costco will raise membership fees 10 per cent, which analysts expect will further boost the company.“They have done this in the past and the renewal rates have historically not been harmed,” said Mr Brick. “It’s a big part of our thesis.”By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 clocked a new record high, buoyed by large-cap technology shares. For the week, the benchmark rose 1.4 per cent with the S&P technology sector now up nearly 20 per cent so far this year.Elsewhere, shares in electronics retailer GameStop fell 5.9 per cent to $22.22 after it left its annual outlook unchanged on expectations of continued weakness in software and mobile sales, despite better than expected Nintendo Switch sales.While Nintendo’s new console lifted shares in rival retailer Best Buy to an all-time high on Thursday, investors remained concerned over GameStop’s profitability in the face of declining video game sales, both used and new. Sales in Switch, which comes with concerns about availability and new games in the pipeline, will not be enough to raise total earnings, according to analysts.Instead GameStop on Thursday evening reiterated its full-year earnings-per-share guidance of $3.10 to $3.40, with comparable sales either flat or falling as much as 5 per cent.“Switch was the driver of the increase in hardware sales,” said Robert Lloyd, the company’s chief financial officer. “Consumer demand has been very strong and we’ve consistently and quickly sold out of our allocations.”He added that “as of today, we do not have complete insight into the total number of units we can expect in Q2” and that new software sales “will face a difficult comparison” to the popular games that came out last year.
17;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-04-25T21:07:18Z;Costco to issue $3.1bn special dividend;;Costco unveiled on Tuesday plans to unleash a special dividend amounting to $3.1bn as the wholesale club looks to return more capital to shareholders and take advantage of low interest rates.The group said that it will issue a $7-per-share dividend payable on May 26 to shareholders of record at the close of trading on May 10. The dividend will be in addition to the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share, which was itself upped by a nickel.Costco, which is famous for its cavernous warehouse-like stores, said that it will fund the payout through “additional borrowings”. It comes as interest rates remain historically low, although the Federal Reserve has said it plans to begin raising rates at a more aggressive rate.“Our strong balance sheet and favourable access to the credit markets allow us to provide shareholders with this dividend, while preserving financial and operational flexibility to continue to grow our business globally,” said Richard Galanti, chief financial officer.Costco shares rose 2.8 per cent in after hours trading.
18;COST;Costco Wholesale;2017-03-03T21:18:48Z;Costco rally grinds to halt on disappointing earnings;US stocks secure 6th consecutive week of gains;Wholesale retailer Costco sank 4.3 per cent to $170.26 on Friday, as disappointing earnings outweighed optimism over its increased membership fees.It curtailed a long rally in the company’s stock — up 18.6 per cent since the US election — and still outperforming the S&P 500, which has risen 12 per cent over the same period.Its earnings fell to $1.17 for the fiscal second quarter from $1.24 per share a year ago, missing analysts’ expectations of $1.36.Despite the dip, analysts have maintained a positive outlook, in part due to an increase in membership fees expected to boost the company’s bottom line.Costco said on Thursday that it would increase the price of its Goldstar membership by $5 to $60, while executive membership fees will increase $10 to $120, going into effect June 1 for the company’s 35m members. The company last increased fees in 2011.“It is a different kind of retailer and it is one of the few places where you pay to shop,” said Oliver Chen, analyst at Cowen & Co. “And they have been experiencing positive store traffic. Physically people want to go to these stores.”The frequency of people attending Costco stores in the US increased 3 per cent for the quarter. That is in contrast to other retailers, in particular US shopping centres, which have struggled with declining sales figures and lower foot traffic as more people turn to shopping online.As earnings season draws to a close, Morgan Stanley analysts note that, unlike recent years, companies’ forward guidance has had little bearing on its stock price, with both negative and positive guidance seeing positive reactions in the market.“Unlike for 2016, stocks that issue guidance for 2017 better than consensus expectations are being rewarded, while those missing guidance expectations are also being rewarded,” said the analysts’ report.Aggregate earnings outpaced expectations by 1.9 per cent, the analysts added, with energy, real estate, discretionary and technology sectors delivering the most upside.The earnings outperformance is due in part to negative earnings revision leading into the reporting season — a common theme in which companies play down their earnings ahead of time to make it easier to beat analyst expectations.By the close of New York trading, US stock markets had secured their sixth consecutive week of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat at 2,383.12 and 21,005.71, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2 per cent to 5,870.75.That comes after continued inflows into US equity funds. State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund reversed its fortunes this week, receiving its biggest one-day inflow of $8.2bn since the end of 2014.It took the ETF’s year-to-date flows into the green, having struggled with outflows at the start of the year.
19;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Costco shares stumble as earnings come up short;;Retailer Costco saw its share price slashed in extended trading on Thursday after its latest quarterly results fell short of expectations, even as the company said it will raise its membership fees.The company — which peddles a range of merchandise, from toilet paper and food to appliances and jewelry, with a focus on bulk sales — said that for the three-month period ending February 12, net sales rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $29.1bn, falling shy of the $29.9bn that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Net income during the time was $515m, or $1.17 per diluted share, versus expectations of $596.9m, or $1.35 a share. Comparable sales, a key industry metric, were up 3 per cent overall, less than the 3.7 per cent that was expected.As some analysts had anticipated, Costco is also moving to raise the fees it charges to shop in its member-only warehouses. Standard individual memberships will increase by $5 to $60 annually, while executive memberships will rise from $110 to $120.Costco shares fell 4.6 per cent in after-hours trading. Over the past 12 months, its shares have risen 16.5 per cent
20;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Costco misses revenue estimates amid sluggish growth;;Shares of Costco slipped slightly in extended trading on Wednesday after the membership-based retailer reported sales and fees that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations despite a healthy boost to its profit.Like many retailers that rely heavily on attracting shoppers to brick-and-mortar locations, Costco has faced increasing pressure in recent months from online stores like Amazon. The company said it is also facing pressure from shifts in gasoline prices and foreign currency. Stripping out those effects, comparable sales rose 1 per cent at US locations, and 4 per cent in Canada, for an overall growth of 1 per cent – missing Wall Street’s estimates of a 1.5 per cent improvement.The company said that during the three-month period ending November 20 its net sales were $27.47bn, a 3 per cent improvement from the same period a year earlier. Its membership fees rose more than 6 per cent from the year-ago period to $630m, but combined with sales its overall revenue of $28.1m fell just shy of Wall Street’s estimate of $28.32bn.Net income came in ahead of estimates at $545m, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared to predictions of earnings per share of $1.18 on income of $525.1m. The company said that its earnings were boosted by a one-time legal settlement of $51m for an unspecified matter, which added 7 cents per share to its earnings.Costco, which operates 723 warehouse stores and several online retail websites, has seen its shares lose nearly 8 per cent of their value over the past year. Following Wednesday’s results, its shares fell a slight 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading.
21;COST;Costco Wholesale;2016-07-20T20:46:56Z;AmEx profits lifted by sale of Costco portfolio;;American Express said its profits jumped by 37 per cent in the second quarter from the year prior, helped by the sale of its Costco co-branded credit card portfolio.The New York-based company said its net income rose to $2bn in the three-month period from $1.5bn in the same quarter in 2015.The figure included a $1.1bn gain from the previously announced sale of its Costco credit card portfolio to Citigroup. The move came after Costco decided to drop American Express as the exclusive issuer of Costco-braded cards last year.Revenues net of interest expense declined 1 per cent to $8.2bn.Going forward, the company expects its 2016 results to come in at the “high end of the range we shared earlier this year”, said chief executive Kenneth Chenault.American Express’s shares rose 0.7 per cent in after hours trading.
22;COST;Costco Wholesale;2016-07-01T10:01:59Z;Push for higher wages squeezes US corporate profits;McDonald’s and Walmart caught between workers’ demands and investor concern;The entrance to McDonald’s Chicago headquarters was transformed into a tent community in May when Fight for $15 campaigners camped out in protest at low wages at its shareholder meeting.But inside the sprawling, red-brick complex in the Oak Brook suburb, the representative of a shareholder of the world’s largest fast-food chain saw matters differently.“At last year’s meeting McDonald’s crowed about artificially increasing the minimum wage for some of its workers. Well look, the barbarians are back at the gate demanding more,” said Justin Danhof referring to McDonald’s entry-level wage increase to $10 an hour at its company-owned restaurants.As general counsel for the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, Mr Danhof was speaking on behalf of Amy Ridenour, his boss and McDonald’s shareholder. “They didn’t see your concession as a victory for workers. They saw it as a sign of weakness that they could exploit and are trying to right now,” he added, his voice rising in indignation.Mr Danhof’s remarks and the Fight for $15 campaign represent polar opposite views with which many US companies are having to grapple. As US workers lobby for higher wages and some politicians demand that America is given a raise, investors are watching corporate profits warily. Following a period of record profits as a share of the economy, margins are being whittled away.One key measure of non-financial companies’ collective profit margins — the net operating surplus as a share of net value added — has fallen to 19.8 per cent, the lowest since the end of 2009, and well down on the peak of 23 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, according to JPMorgan Chase analysis.Michael Feroli, the bank’s chief US economist, said the trend may have further to go, with workers’ share of economic output remaining low looking back in history. “There is room for some further margin compression,” he argued. “It is a pretty big issue.”Driving the trend is rising wages, which are coming at a time of poor productivity growth in the private sector. Unit labour costs, which measure how much companies need to pay their staff to deliver a unit of output, rose 3 per cent in the 12 months ended in the first quarter of 2016. Business output prices rose only 1.2 per cent in the same period, suggesting companies struggled to hold on to their margins.The Federal Reserve has suggested this trend has further to go. With the Brexit vote roiling global markets, the US central bank is even less likely to be lifting short-term interest rates in the coming months, a dovish stance that could give further room for wage demands.Average hourly earnings rose 2.5 per cent in May on the same month a year earlier — still well below the growth rates of more than 3 per cent before unemployment hit 10 per cent during the recession. The Atlanta Fed’s wage tracker, which focuses on people in continuous employment, is running at a much quicker pace of 3.5 per cent.Companies are experiencing further pressure because of rising minimum wages. While the federal minimum wage has remained stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, 15 states mandated increases in their minimums at the start of 2016. California, the biggest state by population and economic size, introduced a law in April that will boost its minimum wage gradually from $10 to $15 an hour by 2022. New York has introduced rules that will boost its minimum to $15 an hour.Companies ranging from Walmart and McDonald’s to Costco and TJ Maxx have felt sufficient pressure to increase their entry-level wages voluntarily. Following growing customer complaints about store cleanliness and service, Walmart, America’s largest private-sector employer, is spending $2.7bn on increasing wages and training over a two-year period.The company estimates that this spending, combined with increased investments in store improvements and ecommerce, will translate into higher profits in three years, as more motivated staff encourage consumers to spend more in their stores thanks to a better service and improved shopping environment.The trend towards higher wages comes as Walmart’s founding family, worth a net worth $130bn according to Forbes, has been a target in the debate over inequality, which has gained traction in this presidential election year. It has also highlighted the extraordinary wealth of one family while many of its staff struggle to make ends meet.Nita Fischer, a single mother, says she was coerced into leaving her Walmart job paying $10.14 an hour when she was pregnant and to reapply after three months. She said she is earning $9 an hour and is reliant on the US government to pay her $294 a month in food stamps — which are spent at Walmart.“I do want something to change,” she said. “Walmart is treating some people like dirt.”Walmart said its store “worked with Ms Fischer during her pregnancy to provide appropriate accommodations, including providing her with light duty work. Unfortunately she didn’t always work all of the hours she was scheduled, causing extra work for the other associates in her store.”The Conference Board, a think-tank, has predicted further increases in wage growth to 3-3.5 per cent in the coming years as the working-age population stagnates and unemployment hovers comfortably below 5 per cent. Lines of work that face significant labour shortages include occupational therapists, nurses, plant operators and machinists, while the states with the tightest labour markets include Texas and Colorado.Craig Donohue, executive chairman of Options Clearing Corp, a financial services company, also expected upward pressure on salaries in his sector, particularly in areas such as enterprise risk management. OCC has hired more than 100 people in the past 18 months and plans to hire up to 100 more.“There’s definitely been a change to competition for candidates . . . as everyone is looking for people with these backgrounds,” Mr Donohue said. “Given we’re a financial services sector firm, we’re very attentive to that.”Each 100 basis point acceleration in US labour costs above 3 per cent growth drags on earnings across the S&P 500 by 0.7 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector may prove most vulnerable to margin compression because they are labour-intensive and may not be able to sharply lift prices.Revenue generated by each employee in the consumer discretionary sector is $245,000 as opposed to the $432,000 earned across companies in the S&P 500 index, according to analysis from JPMorgan. Restaurant chains, retailers and leisure businesses are the most sensitive to rising labour costs across the sector. Manufacturing, airlines and healthcare services companies are also vulnerable to higher labour costs.This was highlighted this week when workers in the home healthcare sector were handed a victory, when a court upheld a law requiring the payment of overtime.Fight for $15 is showing no signs of letting up on the pressure on McDonald’s and US companies across the country. George McCray, 36, a McDonald’s cashier in Chicago, has joined the campaign as he struggles to feed his family of six and also relies on food stamps.“Technically there’s three of us with jobs but we don’t make a consistent enough amount of money to survive as a family,” Mr McCray said. He feels his hours have fallen since he joined the campaign. “[Colleagues] feel the same way as me, but I’m not afraid to go out there on the front line.”When it comes to jobs in the US, the good news is that there are more available now. The bad news for some employers is that there are not enough people with the skills to fill those positions. That means upward pressure on salaries, writes Lindsay Whipp.“As unemployment rates fall, the availability of labour — particularly skilled — will become a significant challenge for the middle market,” says Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, which provides tax, audit and consulting services for medium-sized companies.“We believe incentive compensation will become a significant factor in firms’ ability to not only attract and retain skilled workers, but to grow revenue overall.”But it also means training, if it is available.In Chicago, Advocate Health Care, one of the largest healthcare providers in the Midwest, and JPMorgan have teamed up to create the Healthcare Workforce Collaborative, a programme to help train potential employees to fill the estimated 14,000 middle-skilled job openings a year in the sector to the end of 2019. The project aims to prepare more than 1,000 participants from parts of the city plagued with unemployment or underemployment to become medical assistants, home health support workers and technicians.“There is a limited talent pool for certain hard-to-fill positions, and it can take months to fill these openings with qualified, experienced candidates,” says Kevin Brady, chief human resources officer for Advocate Health Care.The UK is experiencing a similar skills gap. A survey published this year by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that British companies are facing the biggest difficulty finding skilled workers in a decade.

A strong US dollar kept the increase in check. Excluding currency adjustments, revenues would have increased 4 per cent, writes Adam Samson in New York.AmEx said it benefited from an increase in interest income from borrowers, as well as member spending and card fees.However, expenses climbed 5 per cent to $5.5bn, as the group increased its marketing and rewards expenses, which was countered to some extent by a $127m benefit from the previously-announced sale of its JetBlue co-brand portfolio.The New York-based group last year lost its deal to be Costco’s exclusive US credit card network, and co-branded credit card, which had been a lucrative pact for AmEx. Earlier this year, AmEx said it would sell its Costco co-branded portfolio to Citigroup in a move that the company has said is expected to fetch about $1bn.More broadly, AmEx is facing increased competition in the credit card sector from banks, who are looking to diversify amid a prolonged decline in trading revenues, and a robust consumer sector that is supportive of lending.AmEx also put more money aside for potential losses, with provisions climbing by 3 per cent from the year-ago quarter to $434m.Net income fell to $1.4bn, or $1.45 a share, from $1.5bn or $1.48 a year in the first quarter of 2015. Wall Street analysts expected per-share earnings of $1.33.The shares climbed 3 per cent in extended trading. They were down 6.5 per cent for the year as of Wednesday’s close.

The salmon farming industry certainly has. Warm waters cause blooms of algae that can choke the poor fish. Chile, a key source of farmed salmon has suffered badly recently. Worse, the anchovies used in fish feed disappear to deeper, colder seas. That means higher costs for the salmon industry.The operating profits of Oslo-listed Marine Harvest, the largest producer of Atlantic salmon, last year fell to their lowest since 2012. A weaker Norwegian krone has hurt since feed — half of costs — is priced in dollars.Tell that to the traders. Shares in Marine Harvest have risen 28 per cent over 12 months. Rivals Leroy Seafood and SalMar have done even better. Norway’s OBX index lost 8 per cent during that time.Clearly the market sees better times on the horizon. Chile has more than just algae problems; Salmon Rickettsial Syndrome has done great damage to its fish stocks, not to mention exports. US buyers such as Costco, used to get all of their salmon from Chile; that has dropped to less than half.Norway’s industry, long fearful of disease problems, has very tight regulations restricting supply growth to around 3 per cent annually. Meanwhile demand should climb 7 per cent this year. Prices have jumped accordingly; Atlantic salmon goes for around NKr52 per kg this year, 24 per cent above last year’s average price, according to specialists Fish Pool.This positive outlook has not stopped Marine Harvest’s key shareholder, a holding company controlled by shipping magnate John Fredriksen, selling a third of his holding on Wednesday. The stake, worth half a billion dollars, represents nearly a month’s trading volume and the news sent the shares down 6 per cent. More could come. Mr Fredriksen’s oil-related investments, such as Ship Finance, SeaDrill and Frontline, have declined sharply in value. The skies have brightened for Marine Harvest.

Yet a handful of long-time partners of the elite credit card group are becoming rather less beguiled.Last year, Amex dropped a 16-year relationship with warehouse retailer Costco under which the two offered a “co-branded” card. The impending merger of hotel chains Starwood and Marriott has also raised questions about the future of the Starwood Amex card that many business travellers cherish.And last week, mutual fund company Fidelity ended a relationship with Amex to set up a deal with Visa and US Bancorp. Investors have noticed and are, themselves, jilting the company — its shares are down nearly 30 per cent in the past two years.Amex earns revenue through a “discount fee” (the swipe fees it charges merchants), annual card membership payments and interest charged on loan balances. The company is itself a lender, unlike pure processing networks such as Visa and MasterCard that must work with banks.Amex’s success had been driven by its customer service and a “rewards” programme that allowed users to redeem loyalty points for merchandise or services. For many years, it was an alluring proposition; the company’s historical return on equity has been an impressive 25 per cent.Since the financial crisis, however, rival cards from big banks such as Citigroup, working alongside Visa or MasterCard, have replicated the high-end products for which Amex is best known as a way to start to expand their businesses. At the same time, retailers are now permitted to “steer” customers towards payment cards whose fees are lower than Amex’s (though the company won, in December, a stay on a ruling barring its prohibition of such behaviour, pending an appeal).Amex has responded to the growing competition in two ways. By choosing not to renew deals such as Costco, where the retailer found more favourable terms with another company, it has opted to preserve high returns even if it hurts earnings. Full-year 2015 earnings per share are expected to drop 5 per cent.At the same time, Amex has decided to broaden its appeal. An initiative, known as Opt-Blue, attempts to get smaller-sized merchants to accept American Express while the company has also unveiled a prepaid debit card called Bluebird.Such diversification begs an obvious question: can an elite brand be mainstream? American Express has no choice but try to find out.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comThis note has been amended to include a December ruling on American Express’s relationship with retailers"
27;COST;Costco Wholesale;2015-12-16T16:53:15Z;Thailand’s slave ships on the retreat;Nestlé admission highlights extent of labour abuses in seafood supply chain;Two big food companies have made extraordinary admissions about forced labour and a former top anti-trafficking official has fled Thailand in fear, he says, of his life. These are just the latest signs of the battle raging over a trade that has become a byword for brutality.Nestlé acknowledged last month that its Thai seafood operations were supplied by companies that use practices commonly described as modern-day slavery.This week Thai Union, the owner of leading brands such as John West, described revelations that its Chicken of the Sea subsidiary’s supply chain also involved forced labour as “yet another wake-up call . . . to the entire industry”. It dropped the contractor involved and promised to no longer use outside processors by the end of this month.But while international attention may be beginning to rein in some of the worst abuses of the $6bn Thai seafood export industry, the issue remains highly politically charged domestically: Paween Pongsirin, formerly the country’s top anti-trafficking investigator, sought asylum in Australia last week.Official reports, media coverage and victims’ testimony have long cast a spotlight on slave ships off the Thai coast. The mostly migrant crews, often undocumented labourers from Myanmar, Cambodia and Bangladesh, are subjected to beatings, extortion and even murder. Factories that peel prawns have also used child and forced labour for products, as shown by the Associated Press report that threw the spotlight on Thai Union’s supply chain.“It is an ugly reality that is now being fully exposed,” said Phil Robertson, Asia deputy director for Human Rights Watch, the US-based campaign group. “It is now possible to make the link between the way fish are caught in Thailand and those products landing on people’s dinner plates around the world.”Nestlé’s admission came after a report it commissioned from Verité, a charity that fights labour abuses, revealed how some workers at the group’s seafood suppliers in Thailand were sold, deceived with false promises and held in debt bondage.“Forced labour and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain,” the Swiss group said. “We are committed to eliminating them in our seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside others.”For its 2015 Seasonal Appeal, the Financial Times is working in partnership with Stop The Traffik, an organisation that raises awareness about human trafficking.How human trafficking spans the world — In-depth reports from Nepal, Italy, China, Brazil and beyond reveal how criminal networks prey on migrants and those they leave behind, as part of the FT’s 2015 Seasonal AppealExplore the storiesLawsuits have been launched in the US on behalf of consumers against Nestlé and other companies over alleged slave labour links, including Costco of the US and Thailand’s CP Foods. Nestlé won a motion to dismiss the claim against it last week while CP has said it will contest its case. All the companies say they are working to address questions raised about the seafood industry.The Thai government says it has launched an anti-trafficking drive, including impounding thousands of boats that failed to register with the authorities.Thai and Malaysian forces also conducted raids this year on so-called “slave camps” where migrants are often held for ransom on both sides of the two countries’ border, recovering the remains of more than 160 people.But the wider problem of trafficking is far from resolved, with the EU warning that Thailand faces possible sanctions if it does not improve standards in its fishing industry. EU ambassadors in Bangkok this month welcomed the “political messages” given by the country but also issued a further warning about the “gravity of the situation which requires further and decisive action”.The official Thai rhetoric also strikes a contrast with the unfolding scandal around the case of Mr Paween, the anti-trafficking investigator. In Australia last week he announced he had fled his homeland after uncovering what he said was evidence that top military and police officers were involved in human trafficking.While Mr Paween has named no names publicly, Thai officials say they are looking into who may have threatened him. Thailand’s police chief said the force was also examining whether it could launch a defamation case against the ex-investigator, whose remarks could “damage the country”.The deep-set causes of trafficking in Thailand and the wider region include Southeast Asia’s seaborne migrant crisis, corruption and falling profits due to overfishing, according to campaigning groups such as the Environmental Justice Foundation that recently published a three-year study of the trade. Steve Trent, the EJF’s executive director, describes large parts of the sector as characterised by “illegality, violence and abuse”. Despite this year’s advances, he is waiting to see prosecutions and a more fundamental overhaul of an industry whose reputation is far from clean.To find out more about the FT’s Seasonal Appeal partner, visit Stop the Traffik

In the same period last year, it recorded $2.4bn in investment gains, but the equivalent figure this year was just $362m.The company also reported a $411m underwriting loss at its reinsurance arm, in part due to storms in Australia and foreign exchange fluctuations.ValueAct, a San Francisco-based hedge fund, has invested $1bn for a stake of a little more than 1 per cent in Amex and is considering ways in which it might pressure the company to improve revenue growth, according to sources familiar with conversations between the two sides.The fund has not yet decided, however, if it will hold the stake for the long term and seek a seat on the board.Berkshire owns 15 per cent of Amex. Before Friday’s spike, the stock had dropped about one-fifth since the beginning of the year.In February, the company announced that it would end a 16 year-old joint-branding partnership with Costco, the discount retailer, which had accounted for roughly 8 per cent of Amex’s total billed business last year and one-fifth of Amex’s worldwide credit-card loan book.“The credit-card business has become hyper-competitive, so replacing the lost Costco business will be a challenge,” said Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit in New York.A week after that announcement, a federal judge ruled that Amex violated US antitrust law by barring about 3.4m businesses that accept its branded credit and charge cards from steering customers towards alternative brands, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. The ruling, which took effect last month, allows merchants to offer coupons, surcharges or discounts to promote competing brands, if they want to.Fears over Amex’s growth prospects were hardly eased by the company’s second-quarter earnings last month, which showed profits boosted by lower provisions and cost cuts rather than revenues, noted Mark DeVries, a Barclays analyst.ValueAct, founded by former Fidelity fund manager Jeff Ubben, is one of the more consensual activist managers, eschewing public criticism of companies and positioning itself as an ally of reform-minded chief executives. Last week, ValueAct revealed it had become the largest shareholder in Rolls-Royce, the aero engines maker, where it is likely to seek a board seat.Mr Buffett regularly warns shareholders that investment gains and losses make for volatile quarterly results.
31;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;TV maker Vizio files for IPO;Move caps unusual success for American company in mass-market electronics business;US television maker Vizio has announced plans to go public, a move that would cap an unusual success for an American company in the fiercely competitive mass-market consumer electronics business.The company was set up 13 years ago in Orange County in Southern California, an area better know for its aerospace and high-tech manufacturing. By outsourcing all its manufacturing to Asia and focusing on design and marketing, it has kept overheads low and claims more than a third of the US market for connected TVs, thanks to sales through mass retailers such as Walmart and Costco.The company filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for an initial public offering to raise up to $172.5m.A public listing would leave majority control in the hands of William Wang, the Taiwanese-born American who founded the company. Mr Wang owns 55 per cent of Vizio, thanks to the company’s ability to turn a profit in each of the last nine years as it grew, reducing its need to raise outside capital.Mr Wang once attributed his success with Vizio to the experience of surviving an aeroplane runway crash in Taiwan in 2000. His second company — a maker of computer monitors — was struggling at the time and would later file for bankruptcy. In an interview with Inc magazine, Mr Wang described how the experience of being one of 96 survivors from a flight of 179 had changed him.“I was still stuck with all these bad businesses, but I had a better attitude,” he said. “I mean, at the end of the day, we’re all going to die, right? So after the plane crash, it took a year or two to clean everything up.”In its filing, Vizio sought to play up its prospects in connected entertainment, based on its ability to collect data from 8m of its TVs that are connected to the internet. The data could play an important part in delivering targeted advertising and helping content companies direct relevant programming to consumers, it said.However, Vizio’s fortunes are still tied closely to hardware sales, with TVs accounting for 94 per cent of its revenues last year. It has struggled to achieve revenue growth amid steadily falling flatscreen TV prices. It reported a 5 per cent increase in revenues last year, to $3.1bn, a slowdown from growth of 23 per cent the year before.In 2014, Vizio reported a gross profit margin of only 6 per cent on its sales. However, with low costs and a staff of only 407, it reported net income of $45m.
32;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Foreign competitors sour Australian grocery sector;Rise of discounters such as Aldi disrupt long-standing duopoly;Australia’s supermarket wars have claimed a big victim with Grant O’Brien, the chief executive of Woolworths, stepping down as an influx of foreign competitors disrupt the country’s grocery sector.Australia’s largest supermarket chain on Wednesday issued its second profit warning this year and said it would slash 1,200 jobs, sell properties and install a new leader to lift sales amid intensifying competition.“The recent performance has been disappointing and below expectations,” said Mr O’Brien in a statement issued by Woolworths. “I believe it is in the best interests of the company for new leadership to see these plans to fruition.”Woolworths’ woes are emblematic of the difficulties facing established grocery retailers in the UK, US and elsewhere from the rise in foreign discount operators such as Aldi and Lidl. They are mirrored at Australia’s third-biggest grocer Metcash, which this week reported an after-tax loss of $384.2m for 2015.Analysts say the aggressive expansion of German discount chain Aldi is pressuring domestic grocers’ revenue growth and profit margins. US discounter Costco has also begun building a presence while no-frills German supermarket chain Lidl may yet follow suit.Sluggish economic growth and fragile consumer confidence compound woes in the supermarket and grocery industry, worth A$95bn in revenues according to Ibisworld, a market research company.“Australia’s grocery sector has traditionally been dominated by Woolworths [and] Coles,” said Gareth James, an analyst at Morningstar. “But Aldi has brought a low-cost model to Australia that is winning share and challenging their control.”Aldi opened in Australia in 2001 and has grown rapidly, now employing 8,500 staff across 372 stores. It plans to open 25 outlets a year on the eastern seaboard and recently said it would expand for the first time to the states of Western Australia and South Australia, opening a further 120 stores.The German discounter has 7 per cent market share, compared with Woolworths’ 40 per cent, Coles’ 30 per cent and Metcash’s 9 per cent, according to Ibisworld.Gary Mortimer, at University of Queensland business school, says Coles and Woolworths will continue to lose market share but that independent grocers such as Metcash will probably take the biggest toll.“Australian shoppers are well conditioned to private label and discount products,” he says.As they grapple with the competition, Woolworths and Coles have expanded their own private-label product lines, pressured suppliers and slashed prices. But Ibisworld says there is little room for suppliers to cut prices further, meaning lower profit margins for the supermarket chains.Coles, owned by retailing-to-coal-mining conglomerate Wesfarmers, has performed much better than Woolworths following a turnround strategy implemented in 2007 and led by former chief executive Ian McCleod, who quit the business earlier this year.Australia’s grocery sector — like many other sectors in the economy — has traditionally been oligopolistic given the country’s relatively small population, remote global location and the long distances between big cities.But multinational companies are increasingly moving in, lured by Australia’s relatively strong economy over the past decade compared with Europe and the US. Last year H&M followed Zara, Hollister, Miss Selfridge and Victoria’s Secret in opening shops in Australia.All eyes are now on whether Lidl is prepared to invest in Australia. Earlier this month the company told retail analysts it had “no current plans” to open up Down Under, in spite of recently trademarking its name in country. Some analysts reckon it is only a matter of time until Lidl invests while others remain sceptical.“I’m not sure if the Australian market will support two very similar discount retailer models as Aldi and Lidl,” said Mr James.
33;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
34;COST;Costco Wholesale;2015-05-26T23:12:42Z;Apple’s core business ensures fortunes rise;Times may be difficult for some companies, but big technology groups are booming;"The world’s top technology brands, headed by Apple, extended their influence yet more deeply into consumers’ lives as their dominance increased in the past year. Times were more difficult, though, for companies in sectors such as luxury goods, fashion, retail and global banking.Global brand values continued to rise after their slowdown during the financial crisis, according to the latest annual BrandZ top 100 brand rankings compiled by Millward Brown, a research agency owned by WPP.Successful companies not only provided goods and services that were distinct from those of competitors, but also found new ways to connect with customers and navigate the swirling waters of social media.Peter Walshe, strategic director of BrandZ, says: “Branding is becoming more important. People are taking it more seriously and it is becoming more of a factor in driving value and success.”But, he adds: “If you are going to grow a brand these days, you have to have something meaningfully different. You have to have something that fits into what consumers want, and you have then got to communicate and drive that.”Steve Wilkinson, managing partner, UK and Ireland markets at EY, the professional services company, says: “In technology, there is still a lot of space to build brands. In the world of products and services, it’s probably more difficult than it has been for some time to build a globally consistent brand.”The years 2007-12 were a “golden age” for branded consumer products, as emerging markets expanded, says Mr Wilkinson. Since then, a cooling in many economies has made it harder to maintain profitable growth. Nonetheless, the combined value of the top 100 brands in 2015 grew 14 per cent from $2.9tn to $3.3tn compared with the previous year, the fastest rate for four years, beating the average growth of 9 per cent a year since the rankings began in 2006.During the recession, their combined value grew 8 per cent a year on average. The ranking combines financial measures with surveys of how consumers view brands.US brands achieved 19.1 per cent overall growth and accounted for the entire top 10, whereas growth in continental Europe was just 1.5 per cent, reflecting sluggishness in cars and luxury goods. The UK was down 4.2 per cent. Asian brands recovered by 24.7 per cent, despite the emerging market slowdown. This was driven in part by the entry of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company, at number 13 in the top 100, after its initial public offering. There were rises for Chinese portal Tencent, search engine Baidu and China Mobile. In 2006 there was just one Chinese brand (China Mobile) in the top 100; now there are 14.Technology continued to dominate the top 10 global brands. Apple recovered its number one slot with a 67 per cent rise in brand value to $247bn, having previously held it from 2011 to 2013. Its growth was powered by the iPhone 6. Google slipped to second, although its brand value rose 9 per cent to $174bn. Facebook was the fastest riser, up 99 per cent, followed by Apple and Intel. Microsoft, which is making it easier for developers to adapt apps to Windows, was up 28 per cent.Elspeth Cheung, global head of valuation for BrandZ, says technology companies are not only opening up their platforms, “they are trying to acquire a bigger slice of everyone’s life”. Apple is doing so through developments such as Apple Watch and the Apple Pay mobile payments venture. Google is looking beyond internet search to driverless cars, devices for the “smart home” and treatments associated with ageing.The technology category accounted for just under a fifth of the top 100 brands and nearly a third of the total value. There was 17 per cent growth in telecoms, 9 per cent in beer, 8 per cent in soft drinks, 4 per cent in fast food and 3 per cent in cars, but zero in apparel. Luxury goods, affected by the emerging markets slowdown, were down 6 per cent, with falls at Gucci and Hermès. Retail, excluding the Alibaba effect, was up 2 per cent.1/3Total value of the technology category in the top 100 brandsIn financial services, there was growth for insurance companies such as China Life and Ping An, and payments companies including PayPal and Visa. But global banks, down 2 per cent, continued to suffer the hangover from the financial crisis and multiple scandals.Since the BrandZ rankings began, only 58 companies have stayed in the top 100. Some analysts think volatility will increase as technology exerts its disruptive influence. This year, there are seven newcomers, more than the long-term average of four.These are: Alibaba, expanding in areas from taxi hailing to financial services; Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker challenging Apple and Samsung in premium smartphones; HDFC, the Indian bank; Telstra, the Australian telecoms company; Costco, the US retail warehouse; SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms company; and China Telecom.$3.3tnThe combined value of the top 100 brands in 2015Millward Brown says the share price of its BrandZ strong brands portfolio — up 102 per cent since 2006 — has outperformed the S&P 500 at 63 per cent and the MSCI World Index at 30 per cent. It attributes the difference to the “power of brands”.Brand managers face a more complex task, however, at a time when consumers judge products and services from what others say on social media rather than taking their cue from marketeers. They are also grappling with changing demographics, such as trying to tap into the power of older customers and understand the millennial generation’s shopping habits.“You’ve got to be thinking about change, about innovating and improving what you have,” says Mr Walshe.“It is about refining your brand proposition and making sure it is the best. It’s about paying attention to how consumers are using your product and the faster feedback that you get now. It’s about dealing with complaints honestly and quickly and not ignoring them.”Branding is becoming more of a factor in driving value and successMs Cheung says leaders need courage to act quickly, citing Chanel’s bold decision to cut its retail prices in Hong Kong and China and raise them in Europe to harmonise the regional price difference which allows unauthorised cross-border trading. Mr Wilkinson says, although in theory social media widen the scope for brands that offer a consistent global experience, consumers may think more locally, as in the example of craft beer.“You widen your net, but your advocacy group [of engaged consumers] may be recommending a certain real ale or craft lager from Bavaria rather than drinking Heineken,” he says. “There is an argument that social media will be damaging for global brands.”He adds that consumer products companies are having to make tougher choices about where to invest, because profits are not good enough to do everything. “You’ve got to make choices about whether to acquire or to innovate internally. You can’t invest everywhere, so where are the key markets? Are you going to do it with a global brand or something more locally relevant?”"

Consumers will be able to use the service from June.The launch comes as competition in digital payments intensifies, with Google and PayPal among a number of technology companies creating digital wallets.Visa’s wallet, which was initially launched in conjunction with Nationwide in 2013, allows people to make online purchases without needing to give their card details each time.Once people add their credit and debit cards to the application, they can shop online from any mobile device with a few clicks.Visa said the wallet saved time and effort when shopping online, as it just requires customers to enter an email address and password, and claimed the service was secure because it shielded card details from the retailer’s website.Wendy Martin, executive director of V.me, said the launch of the wallet “responds to the huge growth of online payments”, noting that the sector is expanding three times faster than face-to-face payments.“The experience of paying in store and online is far from ideal, as you constantly have to enter details,” she said. “The key online shopping trends are that people are looking to spend on mobile and tablets and that more are doing it on the go.”Consumers are increasingly turning to mobile phones and tablets to make purchases, as more retailers open up to digital payment providers, such as Paym and Zapp.Research by Barclays suggests that people are set to spend £54bn a year using phones and tablets by 2024 compared to £9.7bn spent last year. It said that nearly 42 per cent of all retail sales will involve a mobile device, making mobile the fastest-growing retail segment.60mThe number of credit card accounts that will be able to use Visa’s digital payments service from JuneRichard Lowe, a managing director at Barclays, said: “The size of the retail opportunity is clear for all to see. The question every retailer should be asking themselves is what they are doing about it to not only satisfy today’s consumer but, also tomorrow’s”.But security and fraud concerns are mounting as new payment systems launch and retailers open up access, providing additional entry points for hackers.Even sophisticated biometric security involving fingerprints for authentication, for example, is susceptible.Thomas Bostrøm Jørgensen, chief executive of Encap, an authentication software provider for banks, said Touch-ID, a fingerprint recognition feature used by technology giant Apple, was hacked less than a month after introduction.“One hacker has claimed to be able to recreate fingerprints from high-resolution photos. And while you can issue a new PIN or password you can’t issue a new fingerprint,” he said. “A single factor will always be vulnerable to attack.”Ms Martin at Visa says V.me has a number of security layers, one of which includes not sharing card details with merchants.“V.me also has a sophisticated fraud engine, which looks at patterns such as whether a consumer has used this device for payment before. It allows us to make a better set of risk decisions,” she said.

ECB president Mario Draghi is set to speak after the announcement, and economists expect he will detail the central bank’s looming quantitative easing programme, which is set to begin in March.“For next week’s ECB meeting, we expect more details on the asset purchase modalities to become available, a more positive growth and inflation forecast, and a possible reinstatement of the waiver on Greek collateral,” said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at Société Générale.The Bank of England also meets on Thursday and is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent.EarningsFourth-quarter earnings season draws to a close, with just 12 S&P 500 companies slated to report earnings in the coming days. The list includes Mylan, Best Buy, AutoZone, Petsmart, Staples, Costco and Kroger. Outside of the US, Barclays, Glencore and Adidas are set to report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsVolatility has slipped by more than a tenth in the past month, as news of a Greek debt deal and an improving view of the economic landscape in Europe takes hold. That has sent the blue-chip S&P 500 5.5 per cent higher to 2,104.50 in February, its best performance in more than three years.Headline inflation figures in the US turned negative for the first time since the US emerged from recession in the summer of 2009 in January, as energy prices slid. Investors, however, shrugged at the report, as the less volatile core inflation figure remained steady.Thirteen months after the renminbi hit an all-time high against the dollar, China’s currency has fallen to a 28-month low as economic data weakens and companies pay down dollar-denominated debt, increasing demand for the US greenback.The corruption investigation and subsequent liquidity pressures prompted a downgrade of Petrobras into junk territory by rating agency Moody’s. The move is the first by one of the three major agencies, affecting more than $52bn in debt.

39;COST;Costco Wholesale;2015-02-05T17:16:25Z;Costco shares slide as strong dollar takes toll;US stocks led higher by rising crude oil prices;Procter & Gamble, Apple, Microsoft and United Technologies have a new stablemate in complaining about the strong dollar.Costco, the US retailer known for the bulk selling of toilet paper and extra virgin olive oil, was downgraded on Thursday from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Deutsche Bank after its latest results showed the climbing dollar was hurting its international operations.A strengthening dollar will crimp the retailer’s profits overseas, where Deutsche estimates Costco earns 29 per cent of sales.“We expect the company’s core fundamentals to remain strong, with healthy traffic trends and operational excellence led by a well respected management team,” said Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche.“However, we believe FX/gas headwinds over the next 12 months will derail comps into negative territory and stunt EPS growth.”Same-store sales — a closely watched metric in the retail industry — were flat in January and lagged behind expectations of a 1.2 per cent gain.Comparable sales outside the US fell 4 per cent, the steepest decline in more than two years, as the dollar gained against nearly all of its trading partners.Excluding the effect of foreign exchange movements and sliding gas prices, Costco said same-store sales rose 7 per cent, including a 6 per cent gain abroad.Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the dollar had been “the excuse of the quarter” but retailers are more exposed as overseas customers will react more quickly to higher prices than businesses.“Retail is impacted the most by the change in the dollar,” said Mr Silverblatt, as consumers can slow or stop purchases of discretionary goods, one of Costco’s strong suits.Shares of the retailer slid 4 per cent to $149.05.Michael Kors shares slipped 2 per cent to $69.77 after the company said same-store sales fell short of Wall Street expectations.The company said comparable sales in North America, which accounts for roughly four-fifths of overall revenues, increased 6 per cent. Analysts had projected a 9.3 per cent gain.Profits in the retailer’s fiscal third quarter rose by a third to $304m, or $1.48 a share, on sales of $1.3bn. Both figures topped expectations.Lower than expected fiscal first-quarter results and disappointing guidance sent shares of Keurig Green Mountain 5 per cent lower to $115.30.The Vermont-based company forecast second-quarter earnings in the range of $1-$1.05 a share, including an 8 cent impact from its Coca-Cola and Lavazza transactions.Profits fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $135m, or 82 cents a share, a penny below consensus forecasts. Sales were little changed at $1.4bn.Under Armour shares, after an initial rise, fell less than 1 per cent to $73.24 after the company announced it had purchased two fitness apps and said fourth-quarter results eclipsed Wall Street expectations.US stocks were led higher by rising crude oil prices, which lifted the energy and materials sectors.The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 2,062.52, just above its break-even level for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.2 per cent to 17,884.88.

40;COST;Costco Wholesale;2015-01-16T17:24:55Z;US retailers stumble in Canada;Clutch of premium brands build up their cross-border presence as household names retreat;Less than two years after Target opened its first stores in Canada, the US retailer has found that its efforts north of the border missed the mark.The company’s expansion campaign was plagued with problems from the start. Canadian consumers hoping for a taste of the affordable fashion and discount chain closer to home were met with empty shelves, lacklustre merchandise and higher than expected prices. The venture resulted in nearly $2bn in operating losses for Target, and now an embarrassing retreat.“We were losing money every day,” chief executive Brian Cornell admitted.There have been several success stories over the past few decades by US mass-market contenders moving north of the border, such as Home Depot, Costco, L Brands and Walmart. But Target is not alone in hitting problems in Canada, a country of 35m people with a $400bn retail trade.In October, Sears announced it would sell a majority of its stake in its struggling Canadian unit to raise as much as $380m to offset its losses, while other household names such as Best Buy have cut back their cross-border presence in recent years after failing to gain traction.Nordstrom, the premium US department chain that opened its first store in Calgary in September, delayed its plans to open 20 of its Rack outlets in Canada “given everything on our plate in both the US and Canada and the complexity of it”.And yet they keep coming — with the latest American entrants hailing from the upper end of the retail spectrum.Canada’s appeal appears to be its relatively robust economy and steadily affluent consumer base. Now, a clutch of premium US retailers are racing to build up in the country.Fashion brands Michael Kors and Calvin Klein have both said they want to expand in Canada, while Canadian retailer Hudson’s Bay acquired Saks Fifth Avenue for $2.9bn last July with the aim of launching the upscale US department chain on home turf. It plans to open seven full-line stores and 25 Saks Off Fifth stores, beginning in the autumn.Lucky Brand, the denim retailer, has opened 11 locations in Canada, recording 18 per cent same-store sales growth in 2014 — outperforming all its other markets.Industry observers say that the Canadian retail market — at just a tenth of the size of that of the US — is still under-penetrated. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, a well-regulated banking sector and resilient job market have triggered a swifter economic recovery than in the US — and a wealth of underserved shoppers with potentially deeper pockets.“Canadian consumers are feeling better about discretionary spending than many counterparts elsewhere and, as a result, the accessible luxury price-point is a real sweet spot for US retailers,” says Jeff Schiamberg, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets.“In terms of department stores there is Sears at the lowest-end, and the mid-market placed Hudson’s Bay, but currently no major operators carving out a niche at the highest end of the sector,” he says.With just 150 malls across the country and little development in the pipeline, real estate has become a critical part of the puzzle.“We’ve wanted to be in Canada for years — but the challenge was finding the right locations for our stores,” Karen McKibbin, president of Nordstrom Canada, told the FT last year.“There is a highly educated fashion customer being served by a robust retail community. Still, we feel there is an opportunity in Canada to provide customers with more options for where to shop and we think we can do a lot of business.”But Nordstrom — and its peers — will be keen to avoid the pitfalls encountered by Target and other US retailers. For the time being, they are remaining upbeat, if cautious.“We are very happy with our business in Calgary but recognise we have a lot to learn as we open more stores in Canada,” says Nordstrom spokesperson John Bailey upon news that Target was abandoning the country.Carlos Alberini, chief executive of Lucky Brand, says the company’s biggest hurdle has been gaining brand recognition without a large store presence — a point Target hoped would work in its favour with its aggressive launch.“Canada is a big market and achieving high brand awareness without a large store presence, significant marketing spend and many years in the market is very challenging,” he says.Historically, Canadian consumers have been keen to embrace American brands, with thousands regularly crossing the border to their southern neighbour on shopping trips. However, as Target found out, they were more than willing to place pricing and product mixes over convenience.“These new entrants have to be savvy and remember there are important cultural differences to be considered — especially in Quebec or areas where there will be less awareness of particular US labels,” says RBC’s Mr Schiamberg.The major homegrown competition — upmarket chains Holt Renfrew and Harry Rosen — are preparing for their rivals. Harry Rosen announced a $100m expansion and store upgrade when it found out Nordstrom and Saks were coming to Canada. Three major stores are set to open in 2015.“It’s a marketplace with enormous spending power and potential, but is unforgiving to those unwilling to adopt to its nuances,” Mr Schiamberg says.
41;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-11-17T15:03:02Z;Cheaper oil energises US consumer stocks;Consumer confidence in US at highest since 2007 with retailers upbeat on expectations for year-end;One of this year’s most maligned stock market sectors has finally found its spark – helped by sliding oil prices.US consumer discretionary stocks sprang higher in the past week after languishing for the first 10 months of the year.The sub-index has gained 1.8 per cent over the past five days, outpacing the broader S&P 500 as investors bet that low oil prices will prompt consumers to devote more of their salaries to clothing, food and cars.Third-quarter earnings, however, paint a mixed picture. Some consumer companies, such as Viacom and Nordstrom, reported stronger sales than expected, while the likes of Kohl’s and JC Penney have fallen short of expectations.Investors appear to be split between pinning hopes on a strong fourth-quarter rebound and the belief that the sector is overvalued after soaring 41 per cent in 2013, set against a 30 per cent rise for the S&P 500.Falling fuel costs, rising house prices and easing unemployment give rise to the theory that consumers should have more money to spend on non-essential items.“Consumer discretionary is a good way to play the health of the US economy, especially when you look overseas,” says Margie Patel, a fund manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management. “A lot of the companies are US-focused in their revenues.”Consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2007, according to a report by the University of Michigan, while US retail sales rebounded in October. Retailers, meanwhile, have been striking an upbeat tone on their expectations for the end of the year.Costco says it has been “blessed” by a drop in fuel prices. “When gas prices are, year-over-year flat or declining, as they are now, that's good news. We save the customer more and we make more,” the company’s chief financial officer said on a conference call with investors this autumn.Economists with Barclays say a 20 per cent decline in oil prices could result in $70bn in consumer savings, which will probably stream into the tills of clothing, furniture and electronics retailers.On some measures, consumer confidence is being reflected in profits for consumer discretionary stocks. Earnings have climbed 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to figures from S&P Capital IQ, which includes estimates from analysts as well as already reported results, just shy of the benchmark index’s 8.9 per cent rise.Retailers have been among the last to report quarterly results and investors continue to wait for earnings from companies such as Target, Best Buy and Urban Outfitters. But of the companies to have placed bets on the coming quarter, sights have been set high.Executives with Macy’s and Nordstrom said they expected same-store sales to climb in the fourth quarter as new ecommerce initiatives and better offerings boost activity. American Eagle Outfitters, the struggling teen clothier, unexpectedly lifted third-quarter guidance, citing its “ability to reduce promotional activity”, a significant headwind for the sector.Even McDonald’s, which has suffered from intense competition with Chipotle, seems to have hit an inflection. US same-store sales, stripping out sales from stores less than a year old, slipped by the lowest rate in five months in October.Analysts on Wall Street forecast earnings growth of 16.7 per cent in 2015 for the sector and for margins to expand from a year earlier.These stocks were priced for the consumer recovery, which we have seen. Now, you're seeing revenues and earnings not sufficiently above expectations to justify the price levelsRevenues also look promising, with sales expected to accelerate from the fourth quarter of 2014 over the first two quarters of 2015, data from S&P Capital IQ show. At that pace, revenue growth within the consumer discretionary sector would trail only the tech industry.The sector remains highly valued relative to peers, however, trading on a forward 12-month price/earnings multiple of 19.1 compared with 16.6 for the S&P 500.As of September, active fund managers were more overweight on consumer discretionary stocks than any other sector, according to a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Yet consumer discretionary stocks have risen a little more than 3 per cent this year, compared with a rise of more than 10 per cent for the S&P 500.Third-quarter sales have climbed 3.2 per cent in the period, shy of the rise by the benchmark index, as the sector follows its peers in cutting costs to improve profits at the expense of investment and expansion.“These stocks were priced for the consumer recovery, which we have seen. Now, you're seeing revenues and earnings not sufficiently above expectations to justify the price levels,” says Peter Stournaras, fund manager at BlackRock.Some believe it is too late in the cycle to be buying consumer discretionary stocks. “Consumer discretionary tends to do well in the early stages of an economic recovery when the Fed is easing and there’s no inclination to save money,” says Savita Subramanian at BAML. “When the Fed starts to tighten you will see consumer stocks will cede leadership to others.”Peter Dixon, a fund manager at Fidelity, says that consumer discretionary stocks with stronger brands, such as Chipotle or L Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, are seeing better results than those with weaker brands, such as Kohl’s or JC Penney, where sales fell unexpectedly in the third quarter.David Bianco, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says the sector has had one of the worst earnings estimate revisions in the S&P 500, with earnings per share for 2015 downgraded by 2.5 per cent since the end of August.Still, he believes that the sector will be among the best earners next year as cost-cutting has helped many of the stocks prepare for a slower growth environment.
42;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-11-12T00:12:50Z;Competition in retail space heats up;Traditional retailers warm to technology as the sci-fi idea of robots helping us choose products becomes reality;Hointer, a jeans store based in Seattle that was founded by former Amazon executive Nadia Shouraboura, points to one possible future for the retail industry. Based on the idea that men do not like shopping, the store has set out to remove as much of the pain – and human interaction – from the buying process as possible.Before visiting the store customers can download the Hointer app and decide what they would like to try on. Robots deliver the jeans directly to designated changing room, items that do not fit are returned down a chute and clothes can be purchased without leaving the cubicle simply by swiping a credit card over a card reader.The threat from online competitors is leading more traditional retailers to consider embracing even seemingly outlandish technologies. Online growth continues to outpace traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Where footfall in UK shops fell 0.9 per cent in September, according to the British Retail Consortium, online retailers notched up growth of 7 per cent, IMRG, the industry association for online retailers, says.With online retailer Amazon rumoured to be planning its first physical store in New York, the threat from digital competitors is also moving off the internet and into the shopping mall or high street as well.“High street retailers recognise they need to change,” says Peter Veash, chief executive of Bio, an agency which has helped to take retail brands such as upmarket department store Selfridges, cosmetics company Bobbi Brown and electronic retailer Dixons into the online era.The rush to change sometimes translates into heavy spending. Worldwide, retailers are expected to spend more than $190bn on IT in 2015, according to a report by IHL, a global research company. Key areas of spending will be payment systems, data security, extending into new channels, and mobile shopping. A particular mantra being heard everywhere is “omnichannel” – by which retailers mean making shopping opportunities available in physical stores, online and on mobile devices.So-called “beacon” technology is one of the ideas many retailers are excited about. This relatively expensive micro-location system allows stores to track shoppers’ mobile phones when they are close by and beam information and offers directly to their devices. In the UK, House of Fraser, the department store, Waitrose, the supermarket chain, and Michael Kors, a fashion house, are among those who have tested the technology, while in Sweden ICA and Coop, the grocery retailers, have also experimented with it.A headlong adoption of technology does not always pay off, however. For example, customer opinion is still divided on self-service checkouts, one of the most visible recent technologies adopted by retailers. Twelve years after the first self-service checkout was installed in the UK, the phrase “Unexpected item in bagging area” has become a term used to describe customer frustration with the technology. A 2013 poll by Tensator, a customer management software producer, found a third of Britain’s shoppers had walked out of a store without buying the goods they intended to because of problems with self-service tills.Some US retailers, such as wholesale warehouse club Costco and supermarket chains Jewel-Osco and Albertsons, have even removed self-service tills from stores because shoppers did not warm to them.Mr Veash says the benefits of self-service checkouts depend on the situation. “If you are going into a luxury brand store you still want to speak to someone. But if you were going into Primark to buy one item during a busy lunchtime, you’d prefer a self-checkout.”Geoff Brady, chairman of Harvey Jones, a maker of personalised kitchens that cost as much as a luxury cars, says that beyond using social media for some advertising, he is not in favour of any more digitisation in their showrooms.“I think there is a lot of consumer frustration, nowadays. Some businesses don’t even display a telephone number on their websites, You can’t get in touch with them in person,” says Mr Brady, adding: “Sitting in your living room designing a kitchen on your iPad is not the same as speaking to someone.”It may be that some of the ideas with the biggest impact could be almost invisible to customers. Clothing retailer Superdry, for example, is one of many testing to see if they can use radio frequency identification tags to track stock and to make sure that there are always plentiful supplies on the shelves.Simple and cheap changes can also have big impact, says Jon Wragg, Superdry’s head of ecommerce. The company ran a trial where it gave shop assistants iPads equipped with chip-and-pin readers so customers could pay without having to go queue at a till. If an item was out of stock they could also order it for home delivery.“We implemented it quite frugally – we just bought some iPad minis,” says Mr Wragg. “The payback, based on increased orders, was incredibly fast.” Superdry now plans to roll out shop-floor iPads to all stores starting in the first quarter of next year.Payment is one area most retailers agree needs a revamp. Apple Pay, which began operating in the US in October, is the most recent and arguably most hyped of recent systems that allow shoppers to pay using mobile phones. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has said it will change the way we pay for things, and may eventually replace the wallet.Not all retailers are fans of Apple Pay. A number of big US stores – including supermarket chains Walmart, 7-Eleven, department store group Kmart and electronics retailer Best Buy are even developing their own competitor system, CurrentC.“I think the whole idea of payments is ripe to be revolutionised,” says Superdry’s Mr Wragg. “In the future we will be paying with wearable devices. I see a time when credit cards are a thing of the past.”Earlier this year we asked readers to suggest articles for The Connected Business. Thank you very much for your responses.

Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘nation state’ plansThis meat, however, has never been near a cow or a meadow: it is made entirely of vegetables here in Redwood City, in the heart of Silicon Valley.If that sounds impossible, meet Impossible Foods, just one of several Silicon Valley start-ups that want to change what we eat, how it is produced­ and how we eat it. “We are not trying to make a meat alternative,” says Pat Brown, founder and chief executive of Impossible Foods. “We are making meat a better way.”That involves transforming “cheap, abundant biomass” into meat in the same way that a cow does – only without the cow. “We have to fill in the gap that is currently filled by animals,” says Brown, a 60-year-old former biochemistry professor at Stanford University who lists “exploration” and “hacking institutions” as his main interests on LinkedIn.Impossible Foods is based in one of Silicon Valley’s many low-rise office parks, in a bland open-plan workspace where inspirational slogans such as “Live your dream don’t dream your life” and “It always seems impossible ’til it’s done” are scrawled on a whiteboard. Only a rack of white lab coats hints at the huge kitchen and laboratory spaces that lie beyond.“Right now, there is a process that turns plants into meat and eggs that takes place inside an animal and in a slaughterhouse,” says Brown, whose grey mess of hair seems mismatched with his start-up logo’d T-shirt and jeans, the regulation uniform of the twentysomething internet entrepreneur.“What we need to do is come up with a complete process, not just make a burger – a complete process that does that whole thing more efficiently, more safely, with a smaller environmental footprint, that makes a more affordable product that is healthier for consumers and more delicious.”Brown’s particular method of hacking food is different to that of Josh Tetrick, founder of Hampton Creek, or Robert Rhinehart, co-founder of Soylent. But as the chiefs of food-science start-ups, they all share the same belief that the way food arrives on our plates today is offensively wasteful, harmful to the planet and unkind to its residents, both four-legged and bipedal.While Impossible Foods wants to replace cows, Hampton Creek has chickens in its sights – or rather, the eggs that are produced by millions of battery hens. The company’s egg-free mayonnaise, cookies and other household ingredients are made from a particular­ (but top-secret) variety of Canadian yellow pea. Soylent, meanwhile, wants to replace entire meals with a gooey beige drink that provides all the nutrients without the hassle of producing, preparing and, well, eating. “Food is a very costly hobby,” Rhinehart says. “There is a higher joy and freedom that comes from eating on your own terms.”In many ways, all this is a classic Silicon Valley recipe. Take one determined entrepreneur who is not afraid to “think different”. Add a new ingredient – “big data”, say. Mix with a market that is already worth tens of billions. Sprinkle millions of dollars in venture funding. Bring to boil.“Food is one of the largest potential markets in the world,” says Howard Hartenbaum, a venture investor with August Capital. “Everybody eats. If it works, the market is ungodly huge.”We have to fill in the gap that is currently filled by animalsGiven this opportunity, it was perhaps inevitable that food would become the next industry to face the bright heat of Silicon Valley disruption. Investors have pumped $75m into Impossible Foods alone, and tens of millions more into its peers, which also include Beyond Meat (plant protein products) and Modern Meadow, a New York-based company that uses muscle-cell cultivation to grow “novel biomaterials”.Yet “food 2.0” might also be Silicon Valley’s riskiest bet yet. Just a few years ago, investing in biotechnology was considered only for the bold or the foolish, with massive upfront costs and long years of research required before making a breakthrough. Even if these companies can commercialise their technologies, huge cultural and industrial barriers exist to changing what appears on our plates. The innovation driving the latest wave of food start-ups rests less on the discovery of a brand-new magic ingredient and more on a combination of data science, marketing and sheer bloody-minded ambition.“The only way to accomplish our mission is to give every possible pleasure a meat eater gets from their eating experience and, in the eyes of the most hardcore uncompromising meat lover, make the best burger they’ve ever tasted, and at a better price,” says Brown. “Our definition of success is that the world will look different from outer space, not that we see our label in Whole Foods.”Impossible Foods’ burger patties cost $5 apiece, a price more suited to an upscale grocery. But as he moves from prototype to scaled-up manufacturing, Brown believes that the product could be at or below the mass market price within a couple of years.Getting there will probably require even more venture capital funding and, until recently, few investors in Silicon Valley wanted anything to do with the physical world. Software, websites and apps are easy to distribute at scale; less so jars of mayonnaise. But following the success of Uber, the taxi-hailing app valued this year at more than $17bn, venture capitalists seem to have acquired a taste for atoms as well as bits. As Marc Andreessen, the Netscape founder turned tech investor (including in Soylent), is fond of saying: “Software is eating the world.” Soon, perhaps, the world will be eating better thanks to software.Of all the companies chasing this goal, Hampton Creek is the best known and, in the eyes of its investors at least, the furthest ahead.Backed with $30m from big-name investors including Bill Gates, Li Ka-shing and Founders Fund, Hampton Creek has already struck distribution deals for Just Mayo, its first egg-free condiment, with Walmart, Safeway, Target and Costco in the US and soon Tesco in the UK.Most three-year-old food businesses would stay away from large retailers and their demanding terms for as long as possible. But while Hampton Creek is based in foodie-friendly San Francisco, Tetrick does not want it to be a small-time artisanal producer. After years in the non-profit world, which he describes as “extremely inefficient”, Tetrick wants to use Silicon Valley’s “explosive form of capitalism” to change the world for the better – and make a lot of money in the process.“There’s so much interesting innovation in the mobile landscape and on the web but with food – this thing that goes in our bodies, that is so essential to us – it’s like we are using the Apple I and we haven’t advanced past it,” he says.We are standing at a workbench in front of a massive TV monitor showing Hampton Creek’s investor presentation, in a chaotic, garage-like space in downtown San Francisco bursting at the seams with laptops, lab coats and mayo jars. Staff sit around a giant kitchen table, while beyond them, chefs rub shoulders with data scientists.Tetrick is brawny under his tight T-shirt, the model of a health-food CEO. With his Alabama accent, he can also sound a little like an evangelical Southern preacher – but with more cuss words.“Innovation in food was making a Dorito crunch a bit better in the mouth. It hasn’t been about how the f*** do we feed x billion people by 2050 in a way that enables their bodies? We think it’s an urgent need.”With food . . . it’s like we are using the Apple I and haven’t advanced past itMany of the eggs in regular mayonnaise today come from battery chickens, which in turn require corn to feed. Swapping all that out for a vegetable protein is 40 per cent more cost-effective, improves public health and benefits the environment, Tetrick says. But it only makes a meaningful impact on the world at scale, which means making something that appeals to the Walmart masses, not just the Whole Foods classes.Tetrick says it’s “too easy for regular people to do the wrong thing” when they buy food. Hampton Creek has to make the right thing easier for them by improving on flavour. “People didn’t move away from the horse and buggy to the car because they cared about the horse. It’s just better.”Using plant-based proteins in place of meat or other ingredients is not a brand-new idea. But Tetrick says that Hampton Creek can achieve better results thanks to its database of thousands of species of plants. A proprietary algorithm – that magic ingredient of many a Silicon Valley start-up – models out the likely properties of the different species, such as viscosity or how well they emulsify, to narrow down the cultivars most likely to be useful.Fed with enough data, Tetrick says that the system can identify relationships between molecular properties such as weight and a particular “functionality” that makes food taste just right. After eggs, Tetrick believes his data crunching is closing in on a red bean that could be a substitute ingredient for sugar in cakes and cookies.It was this big idea that makes Hampton Creek stand out to Silicon Valley investors. “Generally we are really interested in companies that sit at unusual intersections that aren’t intuitive,” says Geoff Lewis of Founders Fund, an early investor in the company. “For Hampton Creek, it’s at the intersection of machine learning and plant biological­ properties and branding. You don’t see many things like that.”Alongside Khosla Ventures, a veteran of the biotech industry, the fund that has placed the most bets on these food start-ups is Horizons Ventures, the investment arm of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.Bart Swanson, an adviser at Horizons, which has backed Hampton Creek, Impossible Foods and Modern Meadow, says: “There has been an inflection point” in food start-ups. “It’s possible for someone to go out and raise single-digit millions [of dollars] and be able to get a proof-positive product.”Success is not a question of technology but of economics, Swanson says. “In most cases we know they work, but are they going to get the costs of goods down?” Often that involves outsourcing production of both ingredients and finished product to more experienced food-service companies. “Hampton Creek came up with the idea but to implement it, they need it in large quantities,” says Kantha Shelke, food scientist with Corvus Blue, an industry consultant. “That knowledge and technical level they do not have in Silicon Valley.”Hampton Creek is in advanced talks to raise tens of millions of dollars in new funding, less than a year since its last investment. And it is hiring data scientists from Google and luring Stanford PhDs in the face of competing offers from tech giants, Tetrick says. However, not every new hire has worked out. Ali Partovi, a serial entrepreneur who also backed Facebook and Dropbox before investing in Hampton Creek, joined the company as its chief strategy officer this September, only to leave after just nine days on the job. Accounts differ of the reasons behind his departure. Tetrick suggested that Partovi would remain on as an adviser, which the investor later denied.That the departure came during Hampton Creek’s negotiations about its latest round of financing was all the more striking. In clubby Silicon Valley, the episode sends a confusing signal to potential investors. Tetrick says they simply “decided it wasn’t the right deal for both of us”.Whatever is in Hampton Creek’s future, it needs to be more than just mayonnaise. “Hampton Creek luckily picked on the right ingredient,” says Shelke. “The boost they get with seamless invisible switching in the fast-food and food-service industry is more than justifying the valuation you’re seeing.” Just Mayo, which comes in a range of flavours, is indistinguishable from any other mass-produced mayonnaise (its cookie dough also tastes just as good as its less vegan-friendly rivals). But while Shelke believes the company can repeat the egg trick with a bean-based sweetener, “after that, it will be difficult to say”.Hampton Creek hopes to expand its product range to include pancake mixes, salad dressing and even sour cream over the next year. I tried its scrambled eggs this summer – very similar to school-canteen powdered eggs and not an improvement on the original.Not every food-science start-up wants to recreate existing foodstuffs. Some want to replace them altogether. Leading that movement is Soylent, the powdered nutritional drink that was the accidental invention of 25-year-old Rob Rhinehart.As one of many start-up hopefuls in San Francisco struggling to reconcile fast-rising living costs with zero income, Rhinehart had tired of the archetypal entrepreneur’s diet of ramen and takeaway­ pizza. But it wasn’t just the nutritional limitations of these foods that he didn’t like, it was the “chores and drudgery” of shopping, cooking and cleaning.“I started seeing food as an engineering problem,” he says. “If I can optimise my algorithms, why is my food so inefficient?”While trying to grow his wireless networking business, he also steeped himself in nutritional biochemistry and settled on a concoction of powders and vitamin pills to supply his daily nutrition needs. Rhinehart says the resulting mixture, named Soylent after the soya-and-lentil steaks in Harry Harrison’s population-crisis sci-fi novel Make Room! Make Room!, is “ecologically efficient, convenient, shelf stable and affordable”. Right now, he can’t make enough of it to keep up with demand.It currently costs about $3 per “meal”, if that is the right word for a glass of gloopy beige liquid that tastes a little like pancake batter with too much flour. It’s not exactly tasty but nor is it offensive. In fact, says Rhinehart, it is deliberately bland so that people – like him – who consume it for most of their diet do not tire of a strong taste. (At least Soylent doesn’t taste like it is made of people, the dark twist added to the movie adaptation of Harrison’s book.)Regular Soylent eaters can add their own flavourings, and a community of enthusiasts has already sprung up to swap recipes online. But Rhinehart wanted to make his nutrition as basic as possible. “This is meant to be a life simplification tool,” he says. “Rather than a supplement to your diet, it could be the entirety.”Soylent’s concept of a meal in a glass has already attracted competition in the form of Ambronite, a Finnish start-up creating an organic shake free from artificial minerals or flavourings, which recently relocated to San Francisco. Rhinehart, however, wants Soylent to be as “independent from agriculture as possible”, for instance drawing its fatty acids from algae.“In the interest of efficiency, it is better to synthesise­ the chemicals directly rather than grow the plant and extract it out,” he says. “There are huge problems that would be solved by obsolescing traditional agriculture, by transcending it.”Like Brown and Tetrick, Rhinehart uses the word “efficiency” a lot.“Most food is optimised for pleasure. Soylent is optimised for utility,” he says. “The goal of the company is to create food with no waste. It’s absolutely possible – you just do what plants and animals do, but more efficiently.”He hates grocery stores, “food warehouses” with their car parks, rotting stock and “so much wasted space”. Restaurants are places for indulgence of the “lascivious pleasures of meat consumption”, not nutrition. Home cooking is little more than “manufacturing”. While he does acknowledge the cultural value of breaking bread – actual bread – among friends and family, it is hard to argue with his assertion that most meals are fast forgotten.With its sci-fi echoes, Soylent’s vision may sound far-fetched but a year ago it raised $1.5m from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures and Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit. That is just a small portion of the $146m investors poured into food-related start-ups last year, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital funding. “No industry is safe from Silicon Valley,” CB Insights wrote in a report in February, saying that consumer-goods companies such as Unilever and P&G should “watch their back”. But it also cautioned­ that Silicon Valley’s “hubris” can lead investors “who know little about these industries to jump in and believe they can be successful”.Investors love the fact that these food start-ups’ ambitions are far greater than just another photo-sharing app or, as one start-up recently pitched to investors, “Uber for lawn mowing”.Hampton Creek is going from zero to what Tetrick claims will be $30m in revenues in the space of a year. “I feel like there is a little bit of a backlash against creating bullshit that doesn’t matter,” says Tetrick. “We want to take advantage of this.”To listen to the entrepreneurs behind these start-ups, transforming the world’s meals can seem like a higher calling – even if it ultimately leads to replacing one kind of monoculture farming with another. “I think we are going to live in a post-energy, post-food society within our lifetimes,” says Rhinehart.Despite the huge sums being invested in food science, he believes making that shift is more important than the riches that could flow from success. “I don’t see the point of optimising for money. Food isn’t sacred . . . food has always been changing.” More efficient food supply, he says, “has to happen for humanity”.Tim Bradshaw is an FT correspondent in San FranciscoPhotographs: Carlos Chavarria——————————————-Letters in response to this article:Humans don’t need animal products / From Michael Schwarz, CEO, The Gardener Cheese Company, USDining on slurry is not worth further discussion / From Thomas Bower"
44;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-10-15T11:59:32Z;Costco: new market, new model;Initial foray for warehouse club will have no warehouses. And no club fees;Costco, US-based vendor of everything from car tyres to comestibles, has arrived in China. But its appearance is only virtual. On Tuesday, Costco announced the launch of an online shop hosted by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba. The site sells food, healthcare and private-label products.Costco may have learnt from predecessors including Tesco, Carrefour and Walmart. For them, China has been less successful than hoped. Last year, Tesco turned to a joint venture partner to rescue its foundering China business. Meanwhile Walmart closed several unprofitable large stores in China to focus on quality over quantity.And quality is important in China, where food safety scares occur regularly. So Costco’s decision to open a virtual shop may be sensible on two fronts. First, it gains an experimental, relatively cheap entry into a crowded market. And second, goods flown directly from the US should benefit from consumers’ desire for reliable products.But the strategy is not without risk. Despite its status as a top-three US retailer, Costco has only been online since 2012. It garners just 3 per cent of revenues from internet sales in Mexico, North America and the UK. Meanwhile overseas sales from markets including Korea – Costco’s first Asian foray in 1994 – account for a mere eighth of the top line while contributing one-sixth of operating profit. China will be Costco’s first internet-only presence, and its first online presence in Asia.And Costco will not be running a membership model in China. In a business where net margins are very low, dropping an additional source of income is a significant move. Whether or not Costco hits the ground profitably, there will be an early winner: Alibaba. The company earns fees from hosting websites and by transaction. Both sides will be looking for volumes. With Alibaba’s 270m customers, Costco may have come to the right place.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex

Sales climbed 9 per cent on the year to $34.75bn. Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.52 a share on sales of $35.57bn.It reported a 7 per cent increase in same-store sales, excluding the impacts from petrol and foreign exchange.“The 13 per cent year-on-year earnings growth was the company’s best performance in five quarters, and we believe this is just the beginning of an upturn in bottom line results,” Paul Trussell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said.Shares of biopharmaceutical company Chimerix fell as much as 10 per cent before paring losses to 1 per cent at $32.91, after Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital confirmed the death of the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the US.An experimental drug, the antiviral Brincidofovir, developed by Chimerix, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with the deadly virus in Texas and Nebraska.“Yesterday it was announced that Brincidofovir was given to an Ebola patient in Nebraska, supporting our belief that the drug may be leapfrogging the competition as a therapy of choice for infected patients based on its clinical safety combined with in-vitro antiviral activity,” Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said.Halliburton shares slipped 1 per cent to $60.41, dragged down by a sell-off in oil futures. Energy stocks have been some of the biggest losers among US stocks in the third quarter on the back of falling oil prices.Allergan shares climbed 2 per cent to $190.50 on reports that Valeant Pharmaceuticals was considering sweetening its bid by $4.5bn.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent to 1,968.89, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.6 per cent to 16,994.22 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9 per cent to 4,468.59.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
46;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11.

47;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-07-08T18:29:19Z;The right capital structure for bricks and mortar retail?;;"Lex recently wrote about the hurly-burly around PetSmart, the pet supply chain. An activist or two is keen for the company to sell, and have also made noises about things like returning capital to shareholders. Looking at the numbers, private equity ownership or a big one-time payout don’t look like silly ideas. This is a very stable business that generates a good amount of cash, and it currently has no debt on it.The last point got me thinking, and I ran a company screen on S&P Capital IQ of big retail companies that carry no debt, and a long list came back: H&M; Costco; TJX; The Gap; Ross Stores; Whole Foods; Advance Auto Parts; Bed Bath and Beyond; Best Buy; Williams-Sonoma; Foot Locker; Game Stop; Urban Outfitters. Many more as well.Unscientifically, it struck me that there was an unusual number of companies in this industry with no debt in the capital structure – despite the presence on that list of a number of quite steady, cashy enterprises. I’m wondering if experienced retail leaders are, as a group, nervous about debt, and whether this is rational or not.Any thoughts?"
48;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-05-09T18:00:57Z;Mitt Romney backs Obama on minimum wage;;Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, backed President Barack Obama on what is arguably his top domestic economic policy initiative this year: raising America’s minimum wage.“I, as you know, part company with many of the conservatives in my party on the issue of the minimum wage. I think we ought to raise it,” Mr Romney told MSNBC. “Frankly, our party is all about more jobs and better pay,” he said.Mr Obama has been on what seems like a quixotic mission this year to secure an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour, in a bid to lift middle-class incomes that have been stagnant even amid the US economic recovery.Republicans in the Senate recently blocked a bill to raise the minimum wage, and their counterparts in the House are unlikely to embrace it any time soon. But Democrats – and the White House – are expected to keep pushing the policy right up to the November presidential election, and any sign of Republican fissures on the minimum wage could help their case.Indeed, Chuck Schumer, a senior Democratic senator from New York, pounced on Mr Romney’s comments on Friday.“I thank Governor Romney for urging Republicans to do the right thing. Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage is slowly crumbling,” Mr Schumer said. “We will keep bringing this bill up until it passes . . . everyone who works full time deserves a fair shot at getting out of poverty,” he added.The White House campaign for a minimum wage suffered a blow in February when the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan agency, said raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses of about 500,000, even as it lifted 900,000 people out of poverty.Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve chairwoman, was asked about the minimum wage in her congressional testimony this week. “It will help individuals who benefit from a higher wage,” Ms Yellen said. But she also added: “It’s likely to have some negative effect on jobs, and it’s a question mark exactly how large that impact is, with different studies coming up with different numbers.”In the interview, Mr Romney – who denied any interest in running for president again in 2016 – did not say how high he would like to see the minimum wage go. He had previously suggested it should rise with inflation.In the wage fight, Mr Obama has frequently clashed with retailers and other business groups lamenting the consequences of such a move. But on Friday, Mr Obama was due to visit a Walmart in California to talk about the benefits of solar power and renewable energy.Mr Obama had previously singled out discount retailers such as Costco for paying healthy wages to their workers, in contrast to Walmart which is frequently criticised for its low wages.But Mr Obama’s visit may not touch on the minimum wage. Instead, he will tout Walmart’s environmental initiatives, such as installing solar panels on the roof of that California location, as well as the White House’s own completion of solar panels at the president’s residence.“The retrofit includes the installation of energy-saving equipment such as updated building controls and variable speed fans, as well as 6.3 kilowatts of solar generation,” an Obama administration official said.“The project, which helps demonstrate that historic buildings can incorporate solar energy and energy efficiency upgrades, is estimated to pay for itself in energy savings over the next eight years,” the official added.

That leaves the government in profit on the bail-out so far.Ally had sought to sell shares between $25 and $28 but was met with lacklustre interest. Shares declined more than 4 per cent to close at $23.90.Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, rallied after the company forecast robust sales over the coming year.The company said it expected revenues in fiscal 2015 to range from $26bn to $26.5bn as same-store sales climb as much as 4 per cent. The guidance was ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $25.8bn.Rite Aid shares climbed 8.44 per cent to $6.94.Overall, US equities slid as technology stocks sold off and momentum from the release of Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday faded.The S&P 500 fell 2.09 per cent to 1,833.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.62 per cent to close at 16,170.22.

The year-ago figures included an extra week of trade.Results were buoyed by 18 per cent same-store sales growth at West Elm and a 15 per cent rise at Pottery Barn. The two units account for more than half of Williams-Sonoma sales.“We believe that our lifestyle merchandising approach, together with our high-touch service model, separates us from commoditised offerings as we help our customers decorate, entertain, and create the homes of their dreams,” chief executive Laura Alber said.At least half a dozen investment banks increased their price targets on the company following its results after-market close on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler lifted his price target to $69 from $65, noting sales were “impressive in the light of a challenged retail backdrop”.“The strength was driven by improvement in execution at the namesake Williams-Sonoma brand in its first holiday under new leadership, strong execution across brands and, no doubt, the after-effect of a surge in housing turnover,” Mr Fassler said.Its shares rose to $65.08, a new record high, before slipping back to close 9.73 per cent higher at $64.71.By contrast, discounter Dollar General forecast full-year earnings shy of Wall Street forecasts and said severe weather continued to hamper its results.The US retailer said it expected earnings to range between $3.45 and $3.55 per share as same store sales rise as much as 4 per cent over fiscal 2014. The earnings outlook was more than a dime below analyst expectations.Same-store sales rose 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, trailing forecasts for a 3.9 per cent gain, while net sales were $120m below Wall Street expectations.Chief executive Rick Dreiling said he remained “cautious on the current operating environment” and the challenges facing his customers.Shares in the company fell 2.78 per cent to close at $57.64.Amazon shares climbed on Thursday as the company lifted the price on its Prime membership, a service that gives customers unlimited free two-day shipping on purchases, by 25 per cent to $99 per year.The rise takes effect next week and marks the first price increase for the service in nine years and was expected to boost the company’s annual operating income by $400m, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.In January, Amazon surprised investors and the wider public when it disclosed it was considering raising the price of Prime. Faced with rising shipping costs, executives said the company was considering lifting the fee for consumers by between $20 and $40.Mr Mahaney noted that he did not expect Amazon to see a “material increase” in the number of subscribers who cancel their memberships due to the increased price.Amazon shares advanced as much as 3 per cent during the day before closing 0.21 per cent higher at $371.43.RadioShack rose after the company’s chief financial officer disclosed he had purchased 100,000 shares in the struggling US electronics retailer.John Feray increased his position in the company by roughly $212,000, taking his stake to some 250,000 shares.Mr Feray’s investment comes as the retailer closes 1,100 of its worst-performing stores as it tries to return to profit.Shares in the company rose 2.31 per cent to end at $2.21.Overall, US stocks declined as weak Chinese economic data offset improvements in US retail sales.The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1.17 per cent to close at 1,846.34 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 1.41 per cent to 16,108.89.

51;COST;Costco Wholesale;2014-03-06T17:59:25Z;Staples slumps after stores retreat;;Staples shares sank at the greatest pace in more than six months – erasing more than $1bn from its market capitalisation – after the US office supply retailer said it would close hundreds of stores amid stalling sales.The Massachusetts-based company said it will shut as many as 225 stores as part of a plan to trim $500m from annual operating expenses by 2015.Staples attributed the move to shifting habits of US consumers, who increasingly purchase printer ink and other supplies online and from competitors like Amazon.The company said sales would continue to decline at its US stores in the first quarter and profits would be shy of Wall Street forecasts.“A year ago, we announced a plan to fundamentally reinvent our company,” chief executive Ron Sargent said. “With nearly half of our sales generated online today, we’re meeting the changing needs of business customers and taking aggressive action to reduce costs and improve efficiency.”The decision comes just days after RadioShack, the struggling electronics chain, said it would close as many as 1,100 shops as it consolidates its business.Closures at Staples will affect 12 per cent of the company’s 1,846 storefronts in the US and Canada.The announcement was coupled with its fourth-quarter results, which fell below Wall Street forecasts.The company said sales slid 11 per cent from a year earlier to $5.8bn. Profits rose to $212m, or 33 cents per share, compared with $78m in the year-ago period.Analysts had forecast quarterly earnings of 39 cents a share on sales of $6bn.The company was met with a wave of analyst price target cuts and a downgrade from Janney Capital Markets to neutral from buy.“The company had years to close and shrink the store base, and stuck to its guns, and that decision is likely to impact them for the foreseeable future,” Janney analyst David Strasser said. “This is too little, too late, in our humble opinion.”Shares in the company declined more than 15 per cent to close at $11.36.Costco shares also weighed on the benchmark S&P 500 on Thursday, falling 2.76 per cent to $113.26, as profits at the warehouse retailer fell 15 per cent.The company said profits dipped to $463m, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared with $547m a year ago.Sales climbed 6 per cent from a year earlier to $26.3bn, approximately $300m below analyst expectations.Chief financial officer Richard Galanti blamed the decline on weaker sales of non-food items, particularly during the run-up to the Christmas holiday.Lower fresh food gross margins and currency swings also hampered Costco’s results.Mr Galanti estimated severe weather lowered February sales by 1 per cent on a call with investors.“The firm indicated that much of the earnings shortfall reflects trends early in the quarter,” Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said. “In addition, the company reported February sales that show well versus broader retail but tracked slightly light of expectations.”Yum Brands shares climbed after broker Robert W. Baird upgraded the fast-food chain to outperform on the prospect of improving Chinese sales, the company’s largest single market.“Following five quarters of same-store sales declines, we are optimistic that Yum China is poised for a rebound in 2014 . . . given the company’s solid positioning across segments, upcoming sales drivers (including KFC brand restage in Q2), and encouraging progress on margin initiatives,” Baird analyst David Tarantino said.Mr Tarantino increased his price target to $87 from $79. Shares in Yum advanced 3.3 per cent to $77.28.Overall, US equity markets drifted higher as a report from the labour department showed initial claims for unemployment benefit declined.The S&P 500 rose 0.17 per cent to close at 1,877.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.38 per cent to 16,421.89.

These may be prejudices, which often are not noble, but at least they are our prejudices.One of mine has long been to not shop at any of the chain pharmacies that increasingly dominate and homogenise America, in the process turning it into a nation of hypochondriacs. That means, where I live in Washington, CVS, Walgreen’s and Rite Aid, but the pattern holds all over. There seems to be one of them on every third corner. On Route 301, the direct but not scenic road to our weekend place in southern Maryland, two of them stare balefully at each other from across the highway at most traffic lights.CVS Caremark, its corporate name, has long been my particular bête noir. I am pretty sure it deliberately seeks to drive small independent drug stores out of business by suggesting, for example, that prescriptions under government health insurance, such as Medicare, or other forms of coverage can only be filled at CVS stores, which is a flat out falsehood. At least my local independent continues to fill mine, without putting me in a long queue for pick up.But now CVS is being hailed, from the White House down, for its “selfless courage” in announcing that later this year it will stop selling tobacco products at a cost of $2bn a year in revenues, out of total sales of about $120bn. It also said, to much approbation, that it would expand its “minute clinics” where basic medical services can be obtained, from qualified nurses etc, without recourse to a doctor’s office. Given the shortage of physicians nationwide, it is hard to say this is not a good thing.After all, CVS says half the customers at these retail walk-in clinics do not have a regular primary doctor and those that do can wait for days or weeks to get an appointment for a complaint not immediately life-threatening, which is why hospital emergency rooms get overwhelmed. Medicine, after all, ought to be preventive and, within reason, can be provided by those who have not done seven years in medical school and hospital residencies.Still, I will not shop at CVS – or the other chain pharmacies – and not because it never sold the small Dutch cigars on which, to my shame, I still puff. It may be incalculable but I suspect that whatever good comes from taking tobacco off the shelves is more than offset by the bad – the aisles full of obese-making junk food, candy, sodas and other “convenience” items that form formidable barriers before the customer ever waddles to the pharmacy counter in the back.As I said, these are my prejudices. Therefore, when we go to Maine in summer, I do not patronise the state’s most famous outdoors retailer, L.L. Bean because its founding family has long helped to fund the anti-abortion cause. Nor will I buy a lobster roll from one of the proliferating Linda Bean’s Perfect Maine shacks because I fear she is trying to take over the lobster business (of course, she could be trying to modernise and rationalise it, but some things are better left alone).Briefly, I tried to boycott Whole Foods Market, the upmarket grocery chain, after its chief executive compared Obamacare, the US president’s healthcare reform, as “fascism”, but I was overruled by the better half, who thinks the produce is superior, if expensive, and, er, full disclosure, happens to be a shareholder, too.But I am increasingly drawn to Costco, the discount warehouse that sells stuff in bulk, because, according to no less an authority than Barack Obama, it treats its employees relatively well, better, for example, than Walmart. There is a downside to this, however; closets full of vast packages of toilet rolls, rotting fruit and vegetables in the fridge, enough lightbulbs to illuminate a small city, etc.Still, in the greater scheme of things, exercising my right to prejudice, rational or not, makes little difference. I am not hurting myself, because I have purchasing alternatives, nor, frankly, given the picayune amount I spend, the businesses I choose to boycott.Of course, sanctions in general are back in fashion as a tool of diplomacy, as threatened against Ukraine, or even its oligarchs, before events in the streets of Kiev rendered them moot, at least for the moment. It seems to me they are most likely to work if carefully targeted, as when sport was included in the sanctions against apartheid-era South Africa. Mine are just random. Long may they stay so.onohana@aol.com"

The warehouse club operator said traffic rose during the period, and customers bought more food, auto and office supplies, offset somewhat by declines in consumer electronics.L Brands shares gained 4.2 per cent to $53.98 while Costco rose 3.4 per cent to $114.26.Investors in Twitter braced for their steepest fall since the company began trading publicly, as the company lost a fifth of its value.Twitter reported a loss of $511m in the final three months of the year compared with a loss of $8.7m in the same quarter a year earlier as costs surged. Revenues more than doubled to $242.7m.The social network said that the quarterly loss included a stock-based compensation expense of $521m.Investors worried that slowing user growth would hamper its profits going forward. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded the company from neutral to sell on concerns costs would rise as the group cultivates its user base.“Given the likely forward effort . . . to improve user growth and engagement (including product development costs), we see little potential for upside in estimates over coming quarters,” Mr Sheridan said. Even after the stock correction, “Twitter remains one of the most expensive stocks in our universe”.Shares declined 24 per cent to $50.03 by the close in New York.Overall, equity markets broadly rallied on Thursday, as the Department of Labor reported a sharp decline in initial jobless claims and a report on productivity in the country increased ahead of economist forecasts.The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 per cent to 1,773.43 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 15,628.53.

54;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:00:55+0000;Retailers feel the squeeze in America’s poverty economy;;The neediest Americans will be hurt by an $8.6bn cut to food aid in a bill that was approved by Congress this week and will be signed into law by President Barack Obama on Friday. But another set of welfare beneficiaries will lose out too: big grocery retailers.The farm bill, which contains both agricultural subsidies and federal food stamps for the working poor and unemployed, is watched closely by big retailers such as Walmart because it affects a substantial number of their shoppers.A record 47m Americans now use food stamps for their groceries and Walmart has said its sales were hit by a previous cut to the programme late last year.The big retailers’ dependence on food stamps underlines the ambiguous and sometimes conflicting role they play in America’s often lucrative poverty economy at time when inequality is at the centre of political debate.The retailers’ sales suffer along with the finances of the poor because they are the most important source of cheap food for Americans on tight budgets.But the companies, which employ many of the US’s 15m retail workers, are accused of contributing to that hardship – and the wage stagnation that partly explains it – by not paying higher salaries. In last week’s State of the Union address Mr Obama praised one outlier, Costco, for its relatively high wages.At Walmart, which is better known for penny-pinching, analysts estimate that around 20 per cent of shoppers use food stamps. The company said last week that sales at its US stores had fallen in the past quarter partly due to $11bn of food stamp cuts that began in November and will extend over three years. For a household of four, that reduced monthly payments by $36 to $668, according to equity analysts at Cowen & Co.The cut approved this week, which is spread over a decade, works out at an annual reduction of $860m. It will shrink benefits for 850,000 households – or about 4 per cent of all recipients – by an average of $90 a month, according to the Congressional Budget Office.“Food stamps have become a vital part of retail industry just because of their magnitude,” says Thom Blischok, chief retail strategist at Booz & Co, a consultancy.At Target, 17 per cent of shoppers use food stamps – known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – and at Costco the figure is 13 per cent, says Cowen & Co.When low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tabThe latest cuts fell short of the $40bn some House Republicans had wanted. But they incensed anti-hunger activists such as Joel Berg of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, who complains that Mr Obama has not defended a programme that his own mother once turned to for support. “The Democratic party has become spineless and soulless,” Mr Berg says.Retailers are reluctant to lobby hard for more food stamps, wary of the accusation that they are trying to boost their own coffers.But a more sensitive issue is the reliance of some of their own employees on government assistance. Food stamps are intended to be a safety net for the elderly, disabled and unemployed, but also to supplement the wages of low-income workers, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think-tank.In a report last year, the Democratic staff of a House committee estimated that the 300 employees of a Walmart store in Wisconsin received annual government benefits of between $3,015 and $5,815 each, including food stamps worth between $29 and $61 a month.“Low wages not only harm workers and their families – they cost taxpayers,” the report said. “When low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tab.”Walmart disputes its stingy image, saying store workers earn on average $12 an hour and that less than 1 per cent of them make the minimum wage, which is $7.25 at federal level.That is not, however, alleviating political pressure. “Do what you can to raise your employees’ wages,” Mr Obama told business leaders in the State of the Union speech, when he also called on Congress to lift the minimum wage to $10.10.Catherine Ruetschlin, policy analyst at Demos, a centre-left think-thank, says lifting wages for retail workers would boost the US economy because people living in or near poverty “go right out and spend” every extra dollar they get.Retailers say that forking out more would force them to cut jobs – and conservative economists concur. But others say the evidence suggests that is a hollow threat. By championing the success of Costco – where the average hourly wage is $20 – the president was endorsing the latter view.In a year when inequality is centre stage, many retailers are likely to find that political goodwill toward them is as limited as their customers’ money.
55;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Companies resist president’s call for minimum wage rise;;Employers of low-wage workers attacked Barack Obama’s call for a 40 per cent rise in the minimum wage even as the US president attempted to forge new partnerships with business groups to revive his second-term agenda.Restaurant chains and retailers warned that a wage hike of the kind Mr Obama is pushing through unilaterally for federal employees would cut the jobs available to young and low-skilled workers if it flowed through to the private sector.David French, senior vice-president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, a trade group, said: “We understand that the minimum wage rise polls very well and is politically popular with certain voters, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right thing to do. The challenge we see is it will make unemployment worse.”Mr Obama said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening he will mandate a rise in the minimum wage for workers employed on new federal contracts from $7.25 to $10.10.Although some states have increased it over the past year, the federal minimum wage has not been lifted since 2009, which the White House says amounts to a pay cut for workers.“Just last year alone, workers earning the minimum wage basically got the equivalent of a $200 pay cut because [it] stayed the same, but costs of everything else are going up,” Mr Obama said in a post-speech campaign stop in Maryland.Long criticised for being indifferent to business concerns, Mr Obama’s speech was otherwise striking for the areas where he proposed co-operation with companies, including on hiring the long-term unemployed.It was also largely free of the kind of harsh rhetoric Mr Obama has in the past aimed at Republicans, Wall Street and the very wealthy. “This was not done by poking fingers in anyone’s eyes,” said Joel Benenson, who has been his lead pollster since 2008.The president presented his minimum wage demand as a means of reducing inequality, but liberal and conservative economists continue to spar over how a rise would affect the lowest-income Americans.Mr French at the retail federation said: “If an employer has $1m to spend on wages and you increase the cost of wages by 40 per cent, theoretically that has to come out of something. It either results in higher prices or fewer jobs being created.”At the National Restaurant Association, another trade group, Scott DeFife, executive vice-president for policy and government affairs, said: “The higher the minimum wage goes, the less opportunity there is for people who have the least amount of skills and the lowest educational attainment.”He said restaurants – the largest employers of teenagers in the US – would have to adapt to a rise in wage costs by reconstituting jobs so that individual roles involved more tasks and therefore needed workers with more skills and experience.The higher the minimum wage goes, the less opportunity there is for people who have the least amount of skills and the lowest educational attainment.Mr Obama sought to disprove the business groups by visiting a Costco store in Maryland to highlight how the warehouse supermarket has secured higher productivity and reduced employee turnover by paying some of the highest retail salaries, including an entry-level wage of $11.50 an hour.Pointing also to the knock-on benefits of greater consumption, he said: “I guarantee you if workers have a little more money in their pocket, they’ll spend more at Costco.”Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal is a Democratic fundraiser and was given a prime speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.Peter Colavito, director of government relations at the Service Employees International Union, endorsed the president’s call for a minimum wage raise and said there was no evidence to support the arguments of business groups.“Raising the minimum wage has no effect on whether or not employers hire. This is a mythology perpetuated by the far right,” he said.On joblessness, Mr Obama will host chief executives at the White House on Friday as part of his effort to build a network of companies which say they will try to hire more of the long-term unemployed when taking on staff.White House officials said Mr Obama wants to work with companies to make sure that they keep their doors open to people who have been out of work a long time, whose struggle to get a job often feeds on itself.The measure is voluntary, as is another initiative in the speech, mobilising business, unions and local colleges to increase the number of apprenticeships on offer in the US.

They had bought it from Zara, the Spanish retailer.While most fashion retailers take months to introduce new product lines, Zara’s supply chain can design and deliver new clothes to its 1,500 stores in more than 70 countries within days.In her book The Good Jobs Strategy, Zeynep Ton argues that Zara’s investment in staff is crucial to this speed, together with its ability to collect information from employees on what is popular. Zara’s shop assistants, for example, tell managers if customers are requesting a long-sleeved version of a particular shirt.The question that Ton, an academic at MIT Sloan, set out to answer is how do Zara and other successful retailers treat employees better than rivals, yet still deliver healthy profits and shareholder returns? Her work focuses on low-cost retailers because they compete on price and because it is often argued that the only way companies can keep costs down and prices low is to skimp on labour costs – whether through low wages, minimal benefits or underinvesting in training.As the title implies, The Good Jobs Strategy argues that this is not the case. The author focuses on four low-cost retailers in the US that treat employees well: Costco, the discount retailer, Trader Joe’s, a food store, Mercadona, the Spanish grocer, and QuikTrip, a petrol retailer. It contrasts these with low-paying, “bad” employers such as Walmart, the world’s largest private sector employer.Salespeople and cashiers are also the two largest occupations in the US, even though a typical retail worker earns wages beneath the poverty level. In 2011, staff at Walmart received $585m in public assistance.Moreover, Ton points to studies that have shown that when Walmart has opened a new store, wages have tended to fall in surrounding shops.If you had invested $100 in Walmart 10 years ago your money would have grown 40 per cent; invest in a company with a “good jobs strategy” such as Costco and your money would have tripled.While there are likely to be many reasons for this difference, Ton argues that the decision to give employees low-paid jobs for which they are badly trained ultimately costs companies in lost performance – such as empty shelves, or stock recorded as being on the premises but impossible to find.The book identifies some crucial practices that have helped model companies transform their investment in staff into higher profits. These include cross-training employees, offering secure contracts and paying them properly. While Walmart deals with erratic customer traffic by hiring staff at the last minute on hourly rates, Costco shifts employees between jobs and occasionally offers staff unpaid time off work. If they do not take up the offer, Costco takes the financial hit. However, staff often do opt for the unpaid leave because they have regular pay packages and benefits.Another practice is to give workers more power. Although window displays in Zara are modelled in Spain, shop assistants can suggest local improvements, sending snapshots back to head office for approval.But Ton’s advice is not limited to employment strategies. She also found that successful retailers offered a smaller range of products and fewer promotions. This helped retailers buy at bigger discounts, avoid confusing customers and forecast sales better.Critics would argue that companies such as Walmart are successful, profitmaking machines, and that without surveying all retailers it is impossible to tell whether combining good employment conditions and standardisation of products really delivers higher profits growth overall or just at a few key companies. But at a time when the complexity of workers’ jobs is increasing and labour force investment declining, this is a methodically researched riposte to cutting staff and wages."

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

The warehouse club Costco posted strong sales growth, as did the pharmacy chain Walgreens on Wednesday.Retail Metrics, a research group, said sales excluding pharmacy chains were up 2.5 per cent year-on-year in December at companies that report the figures.Ken Perkins, of Retail Metrics, said the figures reflected a confluence of discounting, sluggish consumer spending, stagnant wages and multiple winter storms.Sears, which has spent years struggling to turn itself round, said in November and December its like-for-like sales fell 7.4 per cent from a year ago. It said it expected to make a loss of between $2.01 and $2.98 per share in the quarter to the end of January, worse than analysts had expected.L Brands, which also owns La Senza and Bath and Body Works, said its like-for-like sales in December were up 2 per cent from a year ago in the five weeks to January 4.As a result of price discounting, it cut its profit forecast for the quarter to the end of January to $1.60 per share, from a previous range of $1.67 to $1.82.The consumer is willing to buy the item, but they are only going to buy it at the discounted dollar priceAt American Eagle, like-for-like sales in December fell 7 per cent from a year ago and the company said it expected quarterly profits to be 26 cents per share, the bottom end of its forecast range.Robert Hanson, chief executive, said: “The retail environment was highly promotional, pressuring margins and [earnings per share].”He said that although sales over the Thanksgiving weekend in November had been solid, they tailed off later.At Pier 1, a homewares retailer, Alex Smith, chief executive, said he was “extremely disappointed” with a 5.7 per cent decline in like-for-like December sales, which he blamed mainly on “wintry weather” that kept consumers away from stores.The company cut its earnings forecast for the quarter to between $0.47 and $0.52 per share, compared with prior guidance of $0.60 to $0.66.Costco said its US sales rose 5 per cent in December.ShopperTrak, a research group, said on Wednesday that US retail sales increased 2.7 per cent in November and December, the first year since 2009 that growth has fallen below 3 per cent.The National Retail Federation, a trade group that will publish its own holiday sales tally next week, had forecast a rise of 3.9 per cent, including online sales.
60;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Push to curb US retailers’ overtime pay;;A lobbyist for US retailers including Target and Walmart is pushing for the passage of a Republican-backed proposal that could strip low-wage workers of their overtime pay.Its proponents say the proposal will give working families more flexible hours by allowing private sector employers to offer staff time off instead of paying them an overtime rate, which is normally one-and-a-half times the usual wage for hourly workers.Supporters of the Working Families Flexibility Act include a lobby group that represents the biggest retail companies in the US, including Costco, Gap, Walgreens and Staples.The lobby group, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said it supported the proposal, which is being spearheaded by Eric Cantor, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, because it would allow both employers and employees the chance to “voluntarily” enhance retail workers’ flexibility.“It would be used to attract and retain talent so those individuals could balance work-life challenges,” said a representative for the group.However, critics of the legislation say it is an attempt to cut pay for hourly workers, because those who exceed their 40-hour work week can be promised time off in the future without any realistic guarantees that the time off will be offered when they need it.“Employers would essentially be getting an interest free loan from their employees. They are taking the work today and are paying by giving time off or cashing out wages at a later time, up to 13 months later,” says Vicki Shabo, a director at the National Partnership for Women & Families.The law requires employers to get the voluntary agreement of employees to accept time off instead of overtime pay, but opponents say the proposal ignores the realities of the workplace, arguing workers could easily be pressured to accept the instructions of their employers or risk losing their jobs.It is not the first time Republicans have sought such a change and multiple attempts have failed since the late 1990s.But what makes this proposal different is that it is being sold by Mr Cantor as a “common sense” policy to enhance work-life balance and give workers more flexibility.A speech earlier this year by Mr Cantor as part of a “make life work” agenda included the proposal and was seen as a way to make the party appear more in touch with the problems of ordinary Americans.It is expected to pass the House of Representatives in early May but will probably die in the Senate because of Democratic opposition.A spokesman for Mr Cantor derided objections to the law that were based on fears that employers would unlawfully pressure their workers into accepting time off instead of paid overtime.“I love that that’s the best thing that they [opponents] have going,” said Rory Cooper.“The only rebuttal liberals have is, ‘well, employers might break the law’. We can’t write laws assuming that people won’t follow them.”He also pointed out that it would extend rules that already apply to local government workers, a sign he said that employees in unions clearly support such proposals.But the 1985 change in the law that allowed municipal workers to accept time in lieu instead of paid overtime was in fact contested by union workers and was seen as a cost-saving mechanism for municipalities.Target said it was aware of the proposal but had not taken a position on it. Walmart did not immediately respond for comment.

Meanwhile, the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 and a gauge for investor nerves, rose 6.1 per cent to 12.34 after touching a six-year low a day earlier.“On a normal day, a jump in the Vix like this would definitely catch your attention, but considering where we are coming from it should be expected,” Mr Kinahan added.Shares in Yum! Brands were among the best performing stocks on the benchmark to start the day after the fast-food chain operator said its business in China picked up in February.The company, which operates fast-food restaurants such as KFC and Taco Bell, gained as much as 5.4 per cent in early morning trading. Its shares closed 1.3 per cent higher to $68.73.Jefferies’ analyst Andy Barish said the stock, which trades at a multiple of 23 times its forward earnings forecast for 2013, was fairly valued despite the better-than-expected sales results.Meanwhile, Costco rose 1.3 per cent to $103.75 as the wholesale retailer said higher membership fees helped it beat analysts’ forecasts for its latest quarterly profits. The company also reported a pick-up in market share against its competitors, including Walmart. Shares in Walmart were 0.9 per cent higher at $73.60.JC Penney, a US department store chain, climbed 4 per cent to $15.65 as it moved to deny market rumours that its chief executive was planning to step down amid the company’s troubles.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,242.32, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished fractionally higher to 14,450.06.Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, rose 0.9 per cent to $83.70 as reports said the company had received a 200 jet order from budget airline operator Ryanair Holdings.Shares in computer product maker Hewlett-Packard were 1.8 per cent higher to $21.40 as the UK’s Serious Fraud Office said it had launched an investigation into Autonomy, the software maker, acquired by the company for $11bn in 2011.The S&P 500 energy sector index was 0.1 per cent higher as benchmark crude prices rose.Refiners including Valero Energy, which gained 4.2 per cent to $45.55, pared some of their losses after a recent sell-off.Heading into Tuesday’s trade, analysts at Barclays said the ten largest publicly traded independent refiners had lost a total market value of $5bn. They added that the declines may be due to investor concerns over the impact of an increase in biofuel prices.Google lost 0.9 per cent to $827.61 as the internet search and advertising company agreed to pay $7m in a settlement with 38 US states for violating privacy rights.VeriFone rose 6 per cent to $21.68 a day after the electronics payments services company said its longstanding chief executive would step down. The company, which has lost 27 per cent from the start of the year, recently acknowledged that it had struggled in shifting from hardware-based business into software services.John Williams, analyst at UBS, said the management change should be a reason for investors to reconsider its shares: “Investors who were uncomfortable with management may not take a fresh look.”

It is about timing. It just takes longer to do things.”Mr White said that 2012, and particularly the second half, was a year of transition for the group during which it had shifted its focus from short-term trading opportunities to building long-term sustainable businesses. Last year, he said, was about “putting the group on the right footing” for 2013.Lonrho also revealed for the first time that the board had conducted a strategic review of profitability following the departure of the group’s executive chairman, David Lenigas, who was awarded £900,000 in shares in lieu of notice in September.As a result of the review, several lines of business had been dropped, including a contract to supply animal feed to Middle East dairy farmers which, although big in terms of revenues, was unprofitable.The group said that the fourth quarter, traditionally its strongest, had “been demanding” but that the shortfalls were mostly down to slippage in timetables, “not any weakness in the underlying business models”.In food, the size and volume of hake loins caught off the coast of Southern Africa failed to match the requirements of Costco, the US wholesaler, but the order has been delayed, not cancelled.Production delays and congestion in Mozambique’s port of Maputo hampered delivery of 72 John Deere tractors. Hotel openings in Gabon and in Johannesburg were delayed to 2013. There were also delays in completing government contracts to build schools and offices in South Africa.Lonrho was once a FTSE100 conglomerate under the leadership of Tiny Rowland, chief executive for 30 years until 1993. Mr Rowland’s empire was dismantled following his death, but Lonrho relaunched six years ago as an Aim-quoted mini-conglomerate to capture Africa’s growth potential with four core Africa divisions – agriculture, infrastructure, support services and hotels.Lonrho said on Monday that each business division was now cash generative and that revenues had risen 44 per cent last year to £186m on 2011 and 24 per cent on a like-for-like basis.Nonetheless, Jefferies, the house broker, said it expected “the reversal of financial progress over the second half to be seen as a considerable disappointment” and Lonrho “remains high risk”.The shares fell 1.93p to 6.95p on trading volumes of about 5 per cent of the group’s shares in issue.
63;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;US holiday retail sales disappoint;;Limited spending by US consumers produced a lacklustre holiday shopping season for many retailers, which are likely to face pressure on profits and questions over whether they should have fewer stores.Target reported flat December sales while the owner of Victoria’s Secret for once fell short of sales expectations. Macy’s, despite decent results, said it would close six stores this year.Sales at stores open for at least a year rose on average 2.3 per cent in December among the 19 retailers that reported figures on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters. That compares with a 3.5 per cent rise in the same month last year and headline inflation currently running at 1.8 per cent.December is the most important month of the year for retailers and in a desperate effort to win consumer dollars – even at the cost of profits – many stores resorted to big price cuts in the days before Christmas.Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said: “Essentially [retailers] averted disaster. That’s the best you can say about this holiday season.” Excluding drug stores, like-for-like sales were up 4.5 per cent.Retail Metrics, a research group, said December sales were not as disappointing as some had feared, but had been hit by a stream of negative news, including worries over the “fiscal cliff”, winter storms and the Newtown massacre.The S&P index of big retailers rose 0.9 per cent on Thursday.Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, said the holiday sales figures would revive questions over whether the US has more stores than it needs in a fragile economy.“You have to add that many people who shop at the promotional stores also shop on the internet, where sales were abounding from the 1st to the 31st of December,” he said.Just before Christmas, research group ComScore said ecommerce spending was up 16 per cent from a year ago in November and December.Barnes & Noble, the bookseller that is facing a bigger threat from digital commerce than most, reported a 10.9 per cent fall in sales at its stores and on its website in the nine-week holiday period to the end of December.Last week Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, spent $89.5m to buy a 5 per cent stake in Nook Media, a joint venture between Barnes & Noble and Microsoft which runs the Nook ebook division.Target is the US’s second-biggest general retailer by sales after Walmart and analysts had expected it to report like-for-like sales growth of 1.5 per cent. Instead it reported flat sales after a fall in the number of shoppers was not offset by an increase in the average dollar spend.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, reported a lower-than-expected 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in December. Macy’s, a department store, reported like-for-like sales up 4.1 per cent as it announced the closure of six “underperforming” stores.Gap, which reported a 5 per cent rise in December sales, also announced that it was moving upmarket by paying $130m to buy Intermix, a women’s fashion boutique. Its 32 stores in North America give Gap a foothold in the luxury sector, where sales have generally been stronger than in mid-market fashion.December’s best performers included Costco, a warehouse club, where like-for-like sales rose 9 per cent from a year ago, and Nordstrom, a high-end department store where like-for-like sales were up 8.6 per cent – both ahead of expectations.
64;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Why Europe will bounce back in 2013;Europe’s woes have echoes of an east Asian crisis, says Ruchir Sharma;"Watching the crisis in Europe I cannot help but recall the drama that unfolded in Asia in 1997 and 1998. Fear of insolvency seized Bangkok and spread to Jakarta, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur, triggering fiery protests and chasing off investors. The total value of the Thai stock market fell to $30bn – less than Chrysler’s market capitalisation.Today, in equity market terms at least, peripheral Europe is suffering a similar fate. At $42bn, the aggregate capitalisation of the Greek stock market is less than Costco, the US warehouse discount store. The same basic arithmetic applies to Ireland, Spain, Portugal and even Italy, where the stock market now has a total value about the same as Apple’s.The point is not to disparage troubled Europe, quite the opposite. There is value in many of these markets. Since hitting their bottom in 1998 east Asian markets have surged tenfold in dollar terms, marking that year as a huge buying opportunity. The question is whether peripheral Europe is at a similar inflection point.In statistical terms, peripheral European markets have surpassed the lows typical of regional crises since Latin America’s in the 1990s. On average, the maximum decline in the stock market has been 85 per cent in the country where the crisis began and 65 per cent across the region as a whole. Greece’s market, where the eurozone crisis started, had fallen 90 per cent at its lowest point, while the average decline for peripheral Europe was 70 per cent.But the Asian crisis has more than just statistical echoes in today’s eurozone. In order to appear safer places to lend and invest, both regions had fixed exchange rates – Asia in the form of currencies pegged to the dollar and peripheral Europe through the euro. The plan worked almost too well. As interest rates fell locals borrowed to shop, build houses and erect factories. The debt binge drove current accounts – the broadest measure of trade – into deficit, stirring fears about whether these countries could pay their debts. When doubts peaked in one country – Thailand in Asia, Greece in Europe – contagion spread.Compared with the trend in gross domestic product growth in the decade preceding the crisis, Greek GDP is now 28 per cent lower than expected, similar to Thailand which at its low was 30 per cent below trend; Ireland is as hard hit as Indonesia, while Spain, 16 per cent off trend, is 3 percentage points worse off than Malaysia.The big difference is the speed of recovery: Asia had surpassed its pre-crisis output within four years, but Europe has not. Why? Because Asia simply abandoned the dollar peg, and as the region’s currencies crashed, Asian exports became more competitive, sparking a recovery. Asia also had the advantage of recovering in a period of strong global growth. Peripheral Europe does not have any such global tailwinds and cannot just abandon the euro. The region can regain competitiveness only by tolerating a collapse in wages and employment. This process is slow and difficult.The Asian experience shows that one of the strongest signals of recovery in crisis-torn countries is the return of the current account to surplus. That is the point when the economy is generating the income to pay down foreign debts. By early 1998 – when pundits were casting east Asia’s troubles as a threat to the global economy – the end was in sight because current account balances were back in surplus.Peripheral Europe is approaching the same point. Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are on track to shift into current account surplus next year. Europe is also making the necessary, painful adjustment in labour costs. Measured from recent peaks, unit labour costs have fallen roughly 7 per cent in Spain, Portugal and Greece. The star, however, is Ireland where a 17-percentage-point swing has created the first current account surplus in peripheral Europe at 9 per cent of GDP. Unit labour costs, meanwhile, are down 18 per cent from their peak.In Asia the toughest reformers, namely Indonesia and South Korea, enjoyed the strongest recoveries; there are signs the same will be true in Europe, with Ireland the only peripheral economy on track to post positive GDP growth this year.The recovery in Europe will come. Today, the average ratio of stock market value to GDP worldwide is about 80 per cent; in peripheral Europe, this ratio ranges from 23 per cent in Greece to 38 per cent in Portugal, close to where their Asian counterparts were in 1998. One way to think about the future of Europe is to ponder this question: can Italy be worth no more than Apple?The writer, head of emerging markets and global macro at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, is author of ‘Breakout Nations’"

The gains, albeit muted, marked the sixth consecutive session in positive territory for US stocks, which have come despite concerns about unresolved US budgetary issues.The late afternoon slide followed as Mr Bernanke warned that uncertainty over the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes was already impacting business behaviour and showing up on economic indicators.JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said: “When the people who are viewed as some of the smartest people out there talk about the fiscal cliff reckoning as a time to be nervous, it makes the overall market nervous which leads to a selling of stocks.”For much of the day, financial sector stocks enjoyed strong gains after an announcement by the US central bank that it would expand its bond-buying operations and keep important interest rates near zero as many had anticipated.Despite a downward turn, the S&P 500 financial sector index was among the best performing industry groups and rose 0.5 per cent. The KBW Bank index, a closely-watched measure of US banks, climbed 0.4 per cent.Among Wall Street’s largest banks, Citigroup was 1.4 per cent higher to $37.53.A flight from riskier stocks helped the telecoms sector, which rose 1 per cent, record the day’s strongest advances.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.3 per cent to 3,013.81.

Shares in the company, which have fallen 22.4 per cent this year, lost 0.8 per cent to $16.96.Costco, the US wholesale retailer, fell 0.2 per cent to $97.72 as it reported a 30 per cent jump in quarterly profits that bettered analysts’ forecasts for the three month period to November 25.Colin McGranahan, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “While Costco continues to execute well in a challenging environment, we remain cautious given [its] already rich valuation and overly optimistic expectations about [its] ability to expand retail margins.”Shares in Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $87.95. Late on Wednesday, the company said it would move up its dividend payment of 52 cents a share to avoid a potential hike in taxes next year.Avon Products fell 1 per cent to $14.33 as the cosmetics direct seller said it would cut about 1,500 jobs globally and exit the Vietnamese and South Korean markets.CBOE Holdings, the derivatives exchange operator, climbed 0.6 per cent to $30.10 as its chief executive, William Brodsky, said he would step down from the role in May 2013. Earlier this week, the CBOE said it would join a record number of companies issuing a special dividend before the end of the year.Nasdaq OMX shares rose 3.7 per cent to $24.30 as the transatlantic exchange operator said it would buy the investor relations, public relations and multimedia solutions businesses of Thomson Reuters.

66;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-12-04T19:57:49Z;Republicans in capital gains tax fight;;Republicans in the House of Representatives are fighting tax increases on capital gains and dividends, ruling out investment income as an acceptable source of additional revenues in increasingly urgent talks to avert the fiscal cliff.The debate on investment income highlights the difficulty in finding common ground in the talks – with less than a month to go before the US economy is otherwise walloped by a $600bn mix of annual spending cuts and tax hikes that could tip it back into recession.“We are opposed to raising rates on investment income,” one senior aide to House Republican leaders told the Financial Times, narrowing the window for compromise with Democrats and Barack Obama on taxes, a critical front in the negotiations.The part of the negotiations relating to capital gains and dividends, which are currently taxed at 15 per cent, are being watched closely on Wall Street, where anxiety is growing about the possibility of a tax hike.In a pre-emptive strike, Walmart and Oracle have issued early dividend payments and others such as Costco are making special payouts. In addition, Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, is preparing to sell up to 1m stock options in the global exchange operator, according to a securities filing.The US president wants to raise nearly $250bn over the next decade from hiking rates on capital gains and dividends. These measures were part of the Obama administration’s opening bid to Republicans last week for a $1.6tn revenue target.John Boehner, the Republican House speaker, countered this week with his own offer to avoid the fiscal cliff, including $800bn in new revenue. But Republicans have said this money should come from curbing deductions and tax breaks, rather than allowing Bush-era tax cuts on ordinary income to expire for the rich, as Mr Obama is demanding. The House Republican aide said higher taxes on investment income was also excluded from their offer.Mr Obama said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that Mr Boehner’s proposal was “still out of balance”. The president added: “if we’re going to protect middle-class families, then we’re going to have to have higher rates for the wealthiest Americans.”A compromise between the two sides on investment income could conceivably lead to a modest hike in capital gains and dividend taxes. But if no deal is reached at all, the impact could be much greater, with tax rates on capital gains rising to 23.8 per cent and those on dividends increasing to 43.4 per cent.The tough line taken by House Republican leaders is in contrast to a greater openness by other Republicans, especially in the Senate, to higher taxes on capital gains and dividends.But what actually is a fiscal cliff and what does it mean for the US economy?“Before this is all over with, there’s lots of machinations: there’s capital gains, there’s dividends, there’s all kinds of ways of looking at this and I think cooler heads will prevail,” said Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee, on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday.But House Republicans argue that higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends, unless offset by lower tax elsewhere, could be just as damaging to the economy as increasing tax on ordinary income.“I think that any increase in capital gains and dividends rates without a commensurate decrease in marginal rates is destructive to economic vitality and therefore is an unwise idea, “ Tom Price, a senior congressman from Georgia and chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, told the FT. “Capital gains and dividend income have been allowed to be taxed at a lower rate because it is believed to be a stimulus for investment and increasing economic vitality and jobs. I don’t think that that belief has changed,” he added.Even a big concession by Republicans on investment income may not be enough to overcome the bigger divide on the taxation of ordinary income, since Democrats and Mr Obama are likely to continue to insist on the expiration of Bush-era tax rates on the wealthy.“Recognition that we must raise rates on the highest income Americans stands today as the critical key to unlocking the door to a bipartisan budget agreement,” said Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council and a top aide to Mr Obama, on Tuesday.
67;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-12-04T00:26:15Z;Oracle to pre-pay $867m dividends;;Oracle said on Monday it would pre-pay $867m worth of dividends that would otherwise not have fallen due until 2013, making it the latest US company to accelerate the distribution of cash to help shareholders offset some of the risk of higher taxes.Among the biggest beneficiaries of the move will be Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chief executive, who will receive a one-off payment of $205m from his stake in the database software group. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Oracle said Mr Ellison “did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter”.The announcement follows a spate of special dividend payments by other US companies as politicians in Washington debate how to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would be forced by the fiscal cliff. Higher taxes on dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at 15 per cent, are among the ideas proposed in some quarters.Costco last week announced a special dividend of $3bn to its shareholders to beat the end-of-year deadline that would bring automatic tax rises if a deal in Washington is not reached.The accelerated Oracle payment could save Mr Ellison more than $30m, if the lower tax rate instituted by the Bush administration is reversed. The software company said it would pay a dividend of 18 cents a share for stockholders of record on December 14, with the payment being made on December 21.Referring to the distribution as an “accelerated” payment, Oracle said it would not make the usual regular quarterly payments it would have made over the following three quarters as a result.A number of other US companies whose directors own a significant amount of stock, putting them at risk from higher tax rates, have also announced one-off dividends in recent weeks, including Franklin Resources, Wynn Resorts and Werner Enterprises.

The S&P 500 homebuilder index fell as much as 1.5 per cent but pared some of the losses by the close to finish 0.7 per cent lower.PulteGroup fell 0.6 per cent to $17.00 and Lennar Corp shed 0.9 per cent to $38.38.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recouped losses and closed 0.8 per cent higher at 29,691.73. Its biggest member, Apple, ended the session 0.3 per cent lower at $582.94 in a volatile session.Shares in Microsoft dipped in and out of negative territory but by the end staged a solid recovery and closed 1 per cent higher at $27.36.Analysts at Nomura reiterated their “buy” recommendation for the stock, but reduced their earnings-per-share estimates for 2013.“We suspect that the shares of Microsoft already reflect much of the bad news. We think investors that can have a thick skin through the awkward quarter or two of the Windows 8 transition will likely see better traction ahead.”Shares in Research In Motion bounced back after a 10 per cent fall during the previous session when it was revealed that BlackBerry’s smartphone market share in the US fell to 1.6 per cent.

On Wednesday, the discount warehouse club Costco announced a special dividend of $7 per share – a meaty payout for a stock that traded around $97 before the announcement. Giddy buyers bid the shares up by as much as $6.In theory, though, a dividend should not affect the value of a company. Cosco’s dividend will take $3bn in cash off the asset side of its balance sheet; retained earnings will drop by the same amount. Investors end up with $7 in their pockets and a share that is worth, on paper, $7 less.There are forms of value not reflected by a balance sheet. The equity of a company is worth more if its management has a record of allocating capital wisely: deploying cash internally when high-returning opportunities are present, paying it out otherwise. A one-time dividend does not, however, demonstrate enough management skill to increase the value of a $42bn company by 6 per cent. One might argue that the special dividend signals insiders’ confidence that profits are headed up. But Costco is not about to introduce an amazing new product or radical new strategy. It is a big-box retailer. The insiders can see Costco’s future only slightly better than anyone who reads its reports.The punters bidding up Costco might suggest, finally, that $7 is worth more to investors now than it will be next year, when US Federal taxes on dividends are expected to rise. Fair enough. How much should this boost the value of a Costco share before the dividend is paid? By, at most, the difference between the payout’s current and future after-tax values. Assuming the current 15 per cent tax rate goes to a draconian 38 per cent, that is about $1.61. That leaves believers in the efficient market hypothesis with, say, $4.50 of share price change to explain away.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
70;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-11-28T19:36:35Z;Costco shares jump on special dividend;The retailer said it would pay out $3bn;Costco shares jumped more than 6 per cent after the retailer said it would pay out a $3bn special dividend in the latest US corporate move to help shareholders escape higher taxes on equity income.The group, which has 617 warehouse-style discount stores worldwide, said it would distribute a special dividend of $7 per share on December 18.Companies are racing to beat a year-end deadline after which it seems likely that taxes on dividends will rise sharply in the US.So far this quarter a record 112 companies have announced special dividends, more than three times the average for the final three months of the year, according to data from Markit.Costco is funding the special dividend by issuing $3.5bn of new debt, prompting Fitch to downgrade the company’s credit rating by one notch.It had previously rated the retailer at double-A-minus, the highest rating given by the three major rating agencies.Standard & Poor’s raised the company’s risk profile from “minimal” to “modest” and Moody’s said its leverage metrics will weaken “for a relatively brief period”, but both affirmed their A-plus ratings.“Our strong balance sheet and favourable access to the credit markets allow us to provide shareholders with this dividend, while also preserving financial and operational flexibility to grow our business globally,” said Richard Galanti, chief financial officer.Costco shares closed 6.3 per cent higher at $102.58, raising the 30-year-old company’s market capitalisation above $44bn.The US’s current low dividend tax rate of 15 per cent was introduced under President George W. Bush, but his tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year when the US reaches what has become known as the fiscal cliff, a mix of automatic spending cuts and tax increases.In another sign of how US companies can help their shareholders avoid higher tax bills, Disney said on Wednesday that it would pay its $1.34bn annual dividend on December 28 this year, instead of in January as it has in previous years.Management insiders hold a high proportion of the shares at many companies that are paying special dividends. That is not the case at Costco, but Jim Sinegal, its co-founder and former chief executive, will net $14.4m from his shares.Costco on Wednesday also reported a 6 per cent rise in November sales at stores open at least a year, and analysts have praised its steady cash flow.It has reported like-for-like sales growth of at least 5 per cent in all but one of the past 12 months in spite of volatility elsewhere in retail. It has nearly $5bn of cash and short-term securities on its balance sheet.Daniela Nedialkova, analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: “Cash has been building up because the execution [of the group’s strategy] has been so good – and it’s that time of year with the fiscal cliff.”Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors noted that a special dividend was better for shareholders than the company buying back its own stock and said: “Costco certainly does not need the cash balance it has for an operating cushion.”
71;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-10-05T10:26:01Z;Costco vs Seoul: when Sunday comes…;;"Costco Wholesale, the US retail giant, has sparked ire in South Korea after opening its outlets in Seoul on two Sundays last month, defying local regulations imposing mandatory closure on big supermarkets for two days a month.Civic groups already held a big rally in front of one of the retailer’s outlets in Seoul last week, protesting Costco’s flouting of the city’s ordinance to close every other Sunday. They plan to hold frequent demonstrations until the company abides by the controversial regulations restricting their operating hours.“We strongly criticise foreign retail giants for their greed and ignorance of local laws,” a coalition of 520 civic groups said in a statement. “They are to blame for their activities against their social responsibility and economic democratisation.”These big retailers including Costco are facing an increasingly hostile business climate in Korea, especially with presidential election candidates promising to protect traditional markets and small merchants under the catchy slogan of “economic democratisation”.Costco, in particular, has become a target for small Korean merchants and civic groups after it kept its doors open on two Sundays last month. The retailer said it opened the stores because the city’s ordinance was found illegal by the Seoul Administrative Court in June. “In light of these recent court rulings, we should also be allowed [to] operate our warehouses on Sundays, just like all other large marts,” Preston Draper, country manager of Costco Wholesale Korea, said in a statement.Still, Seoul says Costco should not join its rivals in opening the stores on every other Sunday because it did not participate in the lawsuits mentioned above. “Costco is a foreign company but it is obliged to abide by Korean law as long as it does business here,” the city said in a statement. Seoul has fined about Won30m ($27,000) on the retailer so far and plans to impose further fines.Costco is one of the few successful foreign retailers in Korea, generating an operating profit of Won130.8bn ($120m) last year on sales of Won2.86tn ($2.5bn). Unlike its local rivals that have more than 100 supermarkets, Costco runs only eight stores in Korea but it is very popular among urban Koreans, causing traffic jam around the stores on weekends. Its Yangjae outlet in southern Seoul generates about Won500bn ($450m) in annual sales, one of the highest among all 608 Costco stores worldwide.Strong momentum, but it might prove hard to sustain as the battle over opening hours goes on. Civic groups are asking local authorities to strengthen laws against big retailers to protect small, family-run shops. Big retailers already face strict regulations in Korea as smaller urban supermarkets cannot open within 1km of small stores without first gaining the consent of local communities. Their operating hours are also restricted as they are barred from opening certain kinds of stores between midnight and 8am, when small stores are generally closed.The political pressure to limit the expansion of bigger retailers is increasing with the presidential election two months away. In September, an opposition party lawmaker, Park Hong-keun, submitted a revision to a development law which would allow the authorities to cancel a business license of large retailers that ignore the city’s ordinance.Related reading:

72;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-10-04T17:57:56Z;US retail sales growth slows;;US retail sales growth slowed in September but was in line with expectations against the backdrop of uncertainty over the economic recovery and the presidential election, writes Barney Jopson in New York.Like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent from a year ago in September at 17 retailers that report monthly figures, according to Thomson Reuters, after a 6.1 per cent rise in sales during back to school shopping in August.“It’s not hot, it’s not not, it’s just ‘meh’,” said Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, as economic data continues to send mixed signals to consumers. Gap, Costco and the TJX Companies narrowly beat expectations with gains in like-for-like sales of 6 per cent each. Department stores had a relatively weak month as Nordstrom and Macy’s posted smaller gains that fell slightly short of expectations. At Kohl’s, another department store, sales fell 2.7 per cent.The figures indicated the sector was on course for a “decent” but not spectacular end-of-year shopping season, Ms Kahn said, but she added that the impact of the November 6 presidential election was a wild card.“From a consumer point of view you may have very strong expectations and if your candidate wins maybe you’ll be jubilant and it’ll be reflected in higher shopping,” she said. “If your candidate loses maybe you’ll think the country will go into a tailspin and you’ll be pessimistic.”Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said retailers were likely to start their end of year marketing blitz later than normal because of the election and the associated heavy spending on political advertising. “With media prices being what they are and the general distraction of the nation, retailers are being prudent about their marketing dollars. They’re saying ‘Let’s just wait till November 7’,” he said.Discounts and promotions are expected to be abundant this year as retailers battle for market share, promising a concentrated blizzard of activity. Mr Bines said consumers had held back in September after a splurge of back-to-school spending.Target, a mass market discounter, posted a 2.1 per cent gain in sales. Rises in house prices and the stock market are lifting consumer sentiment, as is the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy.On the negative side are higher gas prices and worries about the jobs market, the US budget deficit and eurozone crisis.
73;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-09-05T20:42:26Z;Costco founder backs Obama at DNC;;When Ann Romney declared last month that she and her husband Mitt “love” the retailer Costco, she was praising the creation of a man who will on Wednesday make the case for President Barack Obama to stay in command of the US economy.Jim Sinegal, the supermarket warehouse’s co-founder and former chief executive, has a prime speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention, highlighting how both parties have seen something useful in a retailer central to many American lives.The devotion of its middle-class members – who pay an annual fee of at least $55 – is one reason why Mrs Romney spoke so enthusiastically about it in a Fox interview aimed at combating the notion that her husband is out of touch with ordinary Americans.“We both love Costco,” she said as Mr Romney sat smiling next to her.“It’s got great produce,” he chipped in later, citing a three-pack of “very nice” shirts that he bought recently at one of the cavernous stores where Costco sells high-quality goods in bulk at rock bottom prices.But for Democrats, the significance of Costco – which Mr Sinegal founded in 1983 in Washington state – is probably more to do with the way it treats workers.While it squeezes its suppliers and opts for bare-bones interiors, the company is renowned for paying some of the highest wages in retail– an average of $20 an hour according to CNBC – and for offering generous healthcare benefits.“We don’t want one set of rules for ourselves and another for our employees,” Mr Sinegal said on Wednesday night at the convention. “We remember what it was like to be employees.”It also gets on well with unions: 16 per cent of its workers are members of the Teamsters.At a July fundraising event that Mr Sinegal hosted for Mr Obama, the president said: “The story of Costco . . . I think is representative of what America is all about: entrepreneurship, vision, value for your money, treating your workers right. Doing well and doing good at the same time.”Mr Sinegal has donated more than $200,000 to political funds and candidates, the majority Democrats, in the last 15 years.Mr Obama also described Mr Sinegal and his wife as “extraordinary friends”.Costco’s approach suits Democrats who want to paint a picture of their party as a supportive ally in a tough economy, standing in opposition to supposedly uncaring Republicans.Republican candidate Mitt Romney takes on President Barack Obama in the race for the White HouseIt also contrasts with Walmart, which owns Costco’s main warehouse rival, Sam’s Club, and is regularly pilloried by activists for paying workers too little.Mr Sinegal says his approach is not about generosity for generosity’s sake, but is a means of ensuring that Costco’s workers stay with the company longer and are more productive than their counterparts elsewhere.“It’s not altruistic. This is good business, hiring good people and paying them good wages and providing good jobs for them,” he told the Seattle Times in late 2011 ahead of his retirement as chief executive in January of this year.Wall Street analysts do not always agree, grumbling occasionally that Costco should be more tight-fisted.Staking out the politics of groceries, the author Gillian Flynn wrote in Gone Girl, a Midwestern novel currently riding high in the best sellers list, that: “Republicans go to Sam’s Club, Democrats go to Costco.”The stereotypical Costco shopper is also well-heeled: their average annual household income is $96,000, according to Morgan Stanley. That compares with a median household income of around $51,000 calculated by Sentier Research.But Kat Fay, senior analyst at Planet Retail, said Costco shoppers are not as homogenous as presumed in terms of either income or inclinations – a point that makes the Romneys’ promotion of their Costco affiliation all the more useful.“I know people who go to Costco just for gas,” Ms Fay said, “And I know people who go just for salmon and wine.”
74;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;US retailers beat sales forecasts;Gap, Victoria’s Secret and Costco enjoy August burst;Gap and the owners of Victoria’s Secret and TJ Maxx reported sharp sales growth in August as US retailers reported another strong month in spite of economic uncertainty.Sales rose by 5.4 per cent among the 20 or so retailers that report monthly figures, beating expectations for the second consecutive month, according to Retail Metrics.August is the crux of the back-to-school shopping season, the second-most important part of the year for many clothing retailers after the end-of-year holidays.“The US consumer continues to surprise everyone with their ability to dig deep,” said Chris Donnelly, head of the retail practice at Accenture.“There’s no fundamental reason why spending should be so high,” he said, alluding to stubbornly high US unemployment and meagre economic growth. “It has to be psychological.”Roughly 90 per cent of retailers reported sales that beat market forecasts. Clothes sales at both department stores and speciality chains were especially strong.Like-for-like sales at Gap climbed 9 per cent from the same month last year following a 10 per cent rise in July, as its newest clothes click with consumers after a long period of criticism for uninspiring fashions.Sales at Limited Brands, which owns the lingerie store Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, were up 8 per cent.While Victoria’s Secret does not see the same back-to-school peak as other retailers, its Pink brand for college students – which includes backpacks as well as underwear – does get a new-term kick.The TJX Companies, which include the discount clothes and homeware chain TJ Maxx, posted an 8 per cent rise in sales. Costco, the supermarket warehouse club, reported a 6 per cent rise in August sales.Retailers continued to rely on coupons and discounts to woo shoppers as many consumers justify spending only when they see a bargain, said retail analysts, a trend that is cutting into profitability.Nancy Liu, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, said: “Back-to-school is a time when people need to go back and spend. But we’re still a little bit touch and go with the economy.”Sales had been flat in June but rose 4.3 per cent in July.
75;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-07-05T21:06:43Z;Global economic gloom weighs on Wall St;;JPMorgan Chase shares fell 4.2 per cent to $34.38 as the banking sector continued to suffer amid broader economic and regulatory uncertainty.The S&P financials index fell 1.5 per cent, making it the worst performing sector on Thursday.“The short-term future for banks – the next nine-12 months – holds a lot of uncertainty, as capital requirements and the regulatory environment are getting tougher and large retail banks still hold a lot of bad debt,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We think that they will underperform in the near future until they figure out how to be more profitable on a much larger scale again.”JPMorgan was also downgraded by Meredith Whitney’s group to “hold” from “outperform” on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley lost 3.9 per cent to $14.51. Citigroup dropped 2.9 per cent to $26.84, while Goldman Sachs fell 2.7 per cent to $95.92. Bank of America shares declined 2.9 per cent to $7.82.In the wider markets, equities ended Thursday’s session lower. Eight out of 10 S&P sectors were in negative territory, led by financials, energy and telecommunications.The S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,367.58 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4 per cent lower at 12,896.67, while the Nasdaq Composite recouped earlier losses to close virtually unchanged at 2,976.12.US employment data, while positive, failed to lift equities in the wake of central bank moves in Europe, the UK and China. US private sector employers added more jobs in June than forecast while the drop in jobless claims in the week ending June 30 was also larger than expected. Analysts said that such an improvement, however slight, could mean that the Federal Reserve abstains from further monetary stimulus.Stock markets also reacted negatively to the gloomy view of the world economy by central banks, after the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates while the Bank of England announced another round of its bond purchasing programme.“We are in a period when bad economic news is good for markets, because it increases the probability that the Fed will supply cheap money with quantitative easing. Today’s data were better than expected and many investors took it as an impediment to QE3, while the ECB’s quarter percentage point cut was negligible,” Mr Wren said.Netflix shares rallied 13.4 per cent to $81.72, making it the best performing stock for the second consecutive day. Investors reacted to the announcement on Facebook by its chief executive that the video streaming service’s customers watched more than 1bn hours of movies and TV shows online in June, a record for the company.Retail stocks were in focus after top retail chains reported their same-store sales. The S&P 500 retail index shrugged off the fact the average figure for same-store sales growth was less than analysts had estimated and rose 1 per cent.Sales at discount and luxury chains were strong and shares in TJX, Limited Brands and Nordstrom were among the best performers on Wall Street, while sales at mid-scale stores such as Target, Macy’s and Costco were below analysts’ estimates.The “retail sector is bifurcated – on one side discount and luxury stores continue to do well, while mid-scale stores remain weak, which is a function of the struggling labour market”, said Phil Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated Investors.Sales at TJX, which owns the discount stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls, rose 7 per cent, beating analysts’ average estimates. The shares rose 3.7 per cent to $44.09.Sales at Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, also beat analyst estimates and the shares rose 4.5 per cent to $46.12. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, reported higher same-store sales and its shares added 1.9 per cent to reach $51.53.Target, the second-largest discount store and Macy’s, the department store chain, reported declines in sales and highlighted the continued pressure of high unemployment on consumer confidence and spending. Target shares fell 1.1 per cent to $57.15. Macy’s rose 2.7 per cent to $34.27.Among technology stocks, Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, climbed 1.8 per cent to $609.94, underpinning gains on the index.Google also rose, adding 1.4 per cent to $595.92.
76;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-07-05T15:24:52Z;US retailers hit by slower spending;;US shoppers spent in a less robust fashion in June, as uncertainty over economic growth and falling consumer confidence took a toll on some of the country’s largest retail chains.Total sales at stores open for at least a year rose just 0.3 per cent last month, according to Retail Metrics, the research group. Sales were less than the 1 per cent forecast, and below the 7.2 per cent gain made in June 2011.“Retailers found a difficult 7.2 per cent year-over-year comparison and navigating a deteriorating economic backdrop just too much to overcome,” said Ken Perkins, president at Retail Metrics.A slowdown in China, Europe’s debt crisis, a looming fiscal cliff in the US, high federal debt levels and flagging employment gains are contributing to a tough summer for retailers, he said.Analysts said June lacked any real selling catalysts and purchases made earlier than usual this year because of the unseasonably warm winter were also a drag on sales.Macy’s reported worse than expected sales, up just 1.2 per cent in June from the same month a year ago as a result of an economic environment that Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said was “stagnant at best”. Analysts surveyed by Retail Metrics had expected a 2.3 per cent rise.The operator of the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s department stores also cited less spending by tourists in leading cities such as New York.Sales at Target, the discount chain, rose 2.1 per cent, falling short of analysts’ projection for a 2.8 per cent gain.The individual department, chain, discount and apparel stores that report monthly sales figures represent roughly 10 per cent of total US retail sales and are an indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.Retailers tabulate sales at locations open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s growth as they exclude new and closed stores.Costco, the wholesale store which sells everything from potato chips to outdoor plants, posted a 3 per cent rise in same-store sales in June. The company missed analysts’ forecasts for the fourth time in a row, as a strong dollar hurt the value of its sales overseas.Sales at TJX, which owns the discount stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls, rose 7 per cent, beating estimates of 3.7 per cent.Same-store sales at Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, gained 7 per cent, better than forecasts of 2.6 per cent.Saks, the luxury retail chain, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent in June, crediting strong demand for women’s shoes and men’s tailored clothing. Analysts had expected a 4.2 per cent rise.
77;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-05-03T15:33:22Z;US retail spending slows in April;;US shoppers cooled their spending in April as they faced a softer economy and seasonal challenges, according to monthly sales figures from some of the country’s largest retail chains.Total sales at stores open for at least a year rose just 0.8 per cent last month, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. That was below the expected 1.5 per cent forecast increase and compared with an 8.7 per cent surge in April last year.Last month retailers faced headwinds, including an earlier Easter and unseasonably warm weather in February and March, which brought sales forward, as well as a weaker economic environment, highlighted by a rise in unemployment insurance claims and slow private sector job growth.“All of this was just too much to overcome for retailers as softness was evenly distributed across the retail landscape,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Some analysts had hoped the momentum from March’s 3.9 per cent sales rise would carry over into April.“April put March into perspective,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Pennsylvania university’s Wharton School. “People bought their spring clothes, but they bought them in March instead of in April. It was just regular, slow, solid progression.”Same-store sales at the discounter Target rose 1.1 per cent, less than half the 2.9 per cent expected. Costco, the membership warehouse club, reported a 4 per cent gain compared with an estimated 5.4 per cent rise.Target “received an early season boost from the combination of warm weather and an earlier Easter”, said Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of the chain.Sales were weaker than forecast at middle-market chains, including Macy’s, the department store, where sales rose 1.2 per cent, below the 1.9 per cent forecast. The company said it had expected April’s figures to fall from March – when they rose 7.3 per cent – because of the combination of an early Easter and late Mothering Sunday.At Saks, the high-end department store, sales were up just 2 per cent compared with estimates of 5.6 per cent. Among the few department stores to report a gain was Nordstrom, where sales rose 7.1 per cent, above forecasts.The apparel retailer Gap reported a steeper than forecast 2 per cent drop as lower sales at its Old Navy stores offset increases at Gap and Banana Republic.But other clothing chains reported strong gains. American Eagle Outfitters, the teen-focused retailer, on Wednesday raised its first-quarter earnings outlook after comparable sales in the first three months of the year jumped 17 per cent.“We experienced broad-based strength in our spring merchandise selling, which enabled us to pull back on full-scale promotional plans,” said Robert Hanson, chief executive.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Henri Bendel, also boosted its profit guidance after it reported April sales climbed 6 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent.TJX, the brand-name discounter, said its sales rose 7 per cent, twice the forecast gain.

J&D’s Foods, the Seattle-based makers of bacon salt and bacon mayonnaise, have launched a bacon-themed coffin. The move is not only a PR stunt for generating sales of bacon-flavoured foods, but also an unconventional entry into the market for customised caskets.Casket sales in the US have been on a steady decline since 2000, between 5 and 8 per cent per year, due mainly to the increased rates of cremation. But funeral industry experts believe the trend may shift as the baby boomer generation demands personalised funeral accessories that reflect their preferences and lifestyles.“Anything that is unique and highly customised is going to have an advantage over mass-produced caskets,” said Mark Allen, former chief executive of the Casket and Funeral Supply Association of America. “We’re all such individuals and we live in a culture where we want to be unique, we strive for that, and I think funeral service is no exception.”J&D’s Foods is selling its bacon coffin – a steel coffin the founders bought at wholesaler Costco and had professionally wrapped in a pink and red sheath – for $3,000. The company received one order on the first day of sales on Thursday, and plans to continue selling them indefinitely.But the main goal of the coffin sale is to draw attention to the company’s line of edible bacon products. Online sales for those tripled on Thursday.The company, founded in 2007, has made a tradition of staging April Fool’s Day jokes in recent years, by launching spoof products such as bacon lip balm or bacon soda at the same time as its more conventional products like baconnaise or bacon popcorn. Last year the company joked that it was making a bacon-flavoured sexual lubricant, as a way to gain attention for its bacon croutons, only to have customers demand that they actually make it. They have since sold 20,000 tubes.“I can’t compete with General Mills or Kraft on manufacturing cost,” said Justin Esch, co-founder with David Lefkow of J&D’s Foods, “so I have to be creative with marketing”.Referring to the pair’s appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show when they introduced bacon lip balm, he added: “If Oprah puts Dave and me on just to talk about bacon mayonnaise, it’s interesting. But if we talk about bacon lip balm, it’s hilarious, and it makes for good TV.”

This career has seen her writing – in partnership with David Clark – eight books about Warren Buffett and his investment methodology. The latest, The Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio, was published at the end of last year.In an exclusive interview in the FT magazine Investors Chronicle this week, she claims that private investors can easily emulate Buffett Snr’s approach, if they have patience and a sufficiently long time horizon.“He made $60bn by only investing in the stock market,” she explains. “Everyone can with much less capital still get outstanding returns. Anyone can invest like Warren if you stick to the principles and discipline. It’s not rocket science, but not many people do it.”In her new book, she examines 17 equity investments that have helped him to achieve his extraordinary wealth, and reveals the four basic questions that he uses to identify a company with a durable consumer monopoly:17 Warren Buffett investments with a durable competitive advantage●American Express●Bank of New York Mellon●ConocoPhillips●Costco Wholesale Corporation●GlaxoSmithKline●Johnson & Johnson●Kraft Foods●Moody’s Corporation●Procter & Gamble●Sanofi SA●Torchmark Corporation●Union Pacific Corporation●US Bancorp●Walmart●Washington Post Company●Wells Fargo1. Will the product or service the company is selling today be the same product or service that it will be selling ten years from now? Or, as Warren Buffett puts it: “Take Wrigley’s chewing gum. I don’t think the internet is going to change how people chew gum.” Other examples are Coca-Cola and Kraft.2. Can you understand how the product works? Mary says: “Railroads, ie Union Pacific Corporation; and discount shopping, ie Walmart, are not difficult to understand.”3. Does it take large amounts of research and development to keep the service or product competitive?4. Does the company in question have a monopoly or is it the leading low-cost producer of the product or service it sells? “Predictable products equal predictable earnings,” says Mary.She explains that Warren Buffett likes to view stocks like these as fixed-income investments, because their earnings are so predictable. He calls them “equity bonds”. Once a company’s durable competitive advantage and predictability of earning have been established, the “Sage of Omaha” gauges a stock’s value by how attractively it is priced and the consistent long-term profit he believes it will bear.“We are, as value investors, price-motivated. The lower the price the higher the motivation.“It’s like in High School and you like a guy but he is going out with another girl. You wait and then make your move when they break up,” she explains. “This is the key thing that investors don’t do – know what you want to buy and then wait for it to be sold at a discount.”She advises that investors use the tools that are out there on the internet to evaluate companies. “Don’t think of it as stock. Buying a stock is buying a fractional piece of business.”GlaxoSmithKline is the only London-listed stock among the 17 highlighted companies. “It shows great consistency in earnings and rising per share book value,” she says. “Plus, it has really made its mark with Aids antivirals. For Warren and the foundations he has supported it is a natural.”Moira O’Neill is personal finance editor of Investors Chronicle. Read the full interview in this week's issue on sale now"
80;COST;Costco Wholesale;2012-02-02T19:28:58Z;US retail sales mixed in January;;US retailers reported mixed sales figures for January with half beating market expectations and half falling short as overall sales rose 4.4 per cent from a year ago.January is traditionally a quiet month that accounts for a small proportion of full-year sales, as consumers count the cost of their Christmas spending and retailers seek to clear out the remainder of their inventory.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which compiles the monthly figures, said January had yielded “all kinds of mixed messages” about the resilience of consumers and their shopping preferences.The figures signalled a slight acceleration from sales growth in the holiday shopping months of November and December, when sales rose 4.1 per cent from the previous year, according to National Retail Federation.Macy’s, the department store, reported a 2.4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales at stores open at least a year, which fell short of market expectations.In contrast, Costco, a warehouse club that performed consistently well in 2011, said its like-for-like sales in the US, excluding gas, rose by 8 per cent in January. Target also beat expectations with a 4 per cent gain in sales.However, Gap, the clothing retailer, reported another weak month, with like-for-like sales in January – including online sales – down 4 per cent from a year ago.Unusually warm weather across much of the US meant that sales of winter clothes did not match those of an icy cold January in 2011.John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm, said the growing importance of online sales at some bricks-and-mortar retailers was reducing the significance of the monthly store sales figures.“We’ve seen some companies today that are not hitting sales expectation but revising their earnings forecasts up,” he said. “What that suggests is that the same-store sales picture is becoming a smaller and smaller indicator of a retailer’s overall health because it’s only reporting one channel.”Retailers are not expected to step up marketing, promotions and price discounts until March, said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, in a report this week.
81;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-12-08T21:55:22Z;Clearwire capital call slows Sprint;Equities open lower despite positive job numbers;The S&P 500 suffered its first big sell-off in two weeks, after Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, lowered expectations that the bank will accelerate its sovereign bond buying programme.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,234.35, with losses accelerating to the end of the day, as the benchmark index moved back into negative territory for the year.“Bulls have consistently tested but not broken through the S&P’s 200 day moving average all week,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s. “That left the market vulnerable to a reversal in European sentiment.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.6 per cent lower to 11,997.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2 per cent to 2,596.38. The normally volatile Nasdaq was given ballast by Apple, its most heavily weighted stock, which climbed 0.4 per cent to $390.66.The iPhone manufacturer was boosted by news that AT&T is set to sell a record number of smartphones this year, with sales driven by strong demand for Apple’s iPhone 4s.Analysts were divided on whether this was good news for AT&T, with Citigroup analysts focusing on the positive impact on revenue but Baird analysts arguing the high subsidies AT&T has to pay to Apple for iPhone users will hurt margins. AT&T shares fell 1.8 per cent to $28.86.The financial sector of the S&P 500 tumbled 3.7 per cent with big banks buffeted by the European news.Citigroup fell 7 per cent to $27.75, Morgan Stanley 8.4 per cent to $15.88 and Goldman Sachs 5 per cent to $99.92.A JPMorgan note offered some respite for US lenders with data from Dealogic showing high-yield debt underwriting had increased sequentially for two months running.SunTrust was the main beneficiary with underwriting fees in October and November exceeding the whole of the third quarter, while US Bancorp saw strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, as JPMorgan’s analysis of weekly bank filings suggested solid fourth-quarter growth in credit.Investors were unconvinced as SunTrust shares fell 5 per cent to $17.30, and US Bancorp fell 2.9 per cent to $25.65.Clearwire dealt existing investors a blow after pricing an upcoming share offer at $2.00, a discount of $0.28 to Wednesday’s closing price.Shares in the wireless network, which is fighting bankruptcy, fell 4 per cent to $2.19, after hitting $2.04 in the morning session.Clearwire also said it would raise $350m through the share offering, $50m more than previously planned.That meant its largest customer, mobile phone network Sprint Nextel, will have to invest more capital in the company than previously thought to maintain its controlling interest.Sprint shares fell 4.7 per cent to $2.44.Analysts said Clearwire is even more dependent on Sprint for capital in light of Verizon’s deal to jointly sell products with cable companies Time Warner, Comcast and Bright House.“There is no way cable companies will renew contracts with Clearwire now because they will be reselling Verizon Wireless,” said Christopher King of Stifel Nicolaus. “That ends any hope that cable operators will commit capital to keep Clearwire afloat.”Solar panel manufacturer MEMC Electronic Materials fell 0.2 per cent to $4.20, but had earlier tumbled to a new year low of $3.85 after announcing it will combine its project development and solar materials businesses.The company will take a $700m charge and reduce output as part of the restructuring. MEMC’s share price has collapsed this year as Chinese companies have created a glut of solar panel supply, driving down the price of polysilicon.“It really pains me to support a company all the way down 60 per cent year-to- date and then give up on it, calling for an even lower price, but that is what I had to do today,” said Theodore O’Neil, solar analyst at Wunderlich Securities, who advised clients to sell the stock.“I think MEMC is doing precisely what it needs to do to try and turn profitable, but it seems to me that the Chinese have won and if we stay the course, we will just chase a rabbit down the hole,” he added.Halliburton defied the market, falling just 0.8 per cent to $33.13 after Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the oilfield services sector with a “positive” outlook.But Transocean fell 3.2 per cent to $43.95, as Waqar Syed, Goldman’s analyst warned, “structurally higher downtime and costs” would hurt those firms which have not updated equipment since the Macondo oil spill last year.Valero was knocked by a downgrade from RBC analysts who said the return of light oil from Libya means complex refiners will no longer be able to charge a premium for processing lower cost oils.Shares fell 5.4 per cent to $20.88Ford Motor fell 3 per cent to $10.75, despite reinstating a dividend, ending five years without a pay-out.Shares in IBM fell 1.3 per cent to $191.58 after the computer services company purchased market research firm DemandTec for $440m.Costco shares fell 2 per cent to $85.76 despite a double-digit increase in revenue in the 12 weeks ended November 20 compared with the same period last year.The European news overshadowed improving US data as new jobless claims fell to 381,000 from 404,000 a week ago to touch their lowest level since February.
82;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-11-15T08:25:15Z;Thai floods reach Hackensack, NJ;;"After working its way down the computer supply chain for weeks, the impact of Thailand’s disastrous floods has reached one distant end point: the US consumer.As Americans prepare to go holiday shopping, at least one Costco store in New Jersey is restricting sales of hard disk drives due to the “significant supply reduction” caused by flood damage at Thai component makers.A sign (click photo to enlarge) tells customers they cannot buy more than two hard drives made by Western Digital, the world’s biggest producer, which has been forced to close all its factories in Thailand.The purchase limit underlines the pervasive impact of the floods, which have led to forecasts of both rising prices and an overall fall in computer sales in the Christmas quarter – the biggest shopping period of the year – and in the first three months of 2012.The restrictions at the Costco store in Hackensack, New Jersey, apply to Western Digital’s one terabyte My Passport Essential SE, which the retailer sells for $79.99, marked down from its standard price of $99.99.With retailers anxious about how many dollars hard-pressed US consumers will spend on gifts this year, the last thing they need is having to impose limits on stuff people may actually want to buy.Measured by sales, Costco is the US’s biggest discount warehouse club – a format that caters to fee-paying members who bulk-buy food and other products stacked on towering shelves in its industrial-style outlets.The company, which has 432 stores in the US, declined to comment on any aspect of the purchase limit, including the number of stores in which it was being applied and whether hard drives other than Western Digital’s were affected.A spokeswoman for Best Buy, the US’s biggest electronics retailer by sales, said she was not aware of any purchase restrictions at its stores.Western Digital said it could not comment on what Costco or other retailers were doing. But a spokesman said: “WD’s intent is to be as balanced as possible in our approach to satisfying all of our customer’s requirements, across geographies and market segments, while we deal with our constraints and those of suppliers.”Costco’s restrictions could signal several things.It may be getting less favourable access to limited supplies than its rivals; it may have a thinner cushion of inventory than others because it was running a leaner operation before the floods; or it may be smarter in perceiving the full impact of the floods than its rivals, who will eventually have to impose their own limits.Alternatively, it may simply be that Costco sees the shoppers of northern New Jersey as especially voracious consumers of digital storage.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San FranciscoRelated reading:

83;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
84;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-10-07T21:38:27Z;Wall Street ends week with a spring in its step;;In a week where the S&P 500 moved into bear territory, breaking below the 1,100 barrier for the first time in a year, Wall Street closed Friday in surprisingly good cheer, buoyed by strong retail sales data and a better than expected employment report.The 23 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales for September, handily beating analyst expectations. The corresponding figure in September 2010, when the economy appeared to be in much ruder health, was only 2.7 per cent.Bellwether discount retailer Target posted a 5.3 per cent increase in sales and its shares rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $51.56.Limited Brands, which operates high-end chains including Victoria’s Secret, enjoyed double digit year-on-year sales growth. The stock rose 5 per cent for the week to $40.43.Bulk goods retailer Costco posted a 12 per cent rise in sales, although a decision to raise membership fees to offset higher commodity prices alarmed investors. Shares fell 3.8 per cent to $79.02, the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500.The consumer discretionary index of the S&P 500 was up 4.1 per cent for the week. Since markets began to slide in late July, the sector has outperformed the broad S&P 500 by more than two percentage points.“We’ve had sixty days of bad economic news and falling markets, but consumers are still going out and buying stuff, and at a healthy clip too,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.But some retail analysts were worried resilient consumer spending may be debt-driven.“Taken as a point in time, September sales data do look very strong,” said David Strasser, hardline retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we question whether that is sustainable, if consumption is outpacing wage growth.”At 4.7 per cent in July and 4.5 per cent in August, the personal savings rate – the fraction of US personal income that is not consumed – has fallen beneath 4.8 per cent for the first time since 2009.The broad S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent for the week, as European politicians appeared to inch towards a co-ordinated recapitalisation of the continent’s banks. An FT report to that effect late on Tuesday had sent the S&P 500 up 4 per cent in forty minutes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent for the week to 11,103.12, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.6 per cent to 2,479.35.But US banks ended a volatile week on a low note. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 3.7 per cent Friday. A leak, late on Thursday, of a draft text of the Volcker rule, which would seek to stop proprietary trading by banks, caused alarm. By the week’s end, Tuesday’s euphoria at the prospect of European bank recapitalisations had also given way to worries about the speed of implementation.“As with everything in Europe it’s going to happen slower than the markets want,” said Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent for the week to $5.95, after a 6 per cent fall on Friday. Goldman Sachs fell 5.5 per cent Friday to end the week down 2 per cent at $94.56. But despite its own 6 per cent fall on Friday, Morgan Stanley ended the week up 5.4 per cent to $14.24.That represented a turnround for Morgan Stanley, which was hit early in the week by reports that some banks were cutting exposure to the firm, as the cost of buying insurance on its debt hit 30-month highs.On Friday Morgan Stanley received a vote of confidence from analysts at its rival Goldman Sachs. Goldman’s options team put out a note recommending clients buy calls and sell short-dated credit default swaps to profit from a rise in the Morgan Stanley share price.“We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan exposures appear overdone,” Goldman’s equity research analysts wrote in the note.Apple shares were down 2 per cent for the week to $369.80, after a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, and the death of founder and figurehead Steve Jobs.Sprint was by far the biggest faller in the S&P 500, losing 10 per cent of it market capitalisation on Friday afternoon, to close the week down 10.9 per cent at $2.71, after its chief executive said the mobile phone network may need to raise additional capital.Sprint also announced it will upgrade to a 4G network next year, which sent the share price of its current wireless network provider, Clearwire, tumbling 32.2 per cent to $1.39.Material stocks were the best performers in the S&P 500 on renewed hopes for global growth. Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 11.7 per cent to $34.01. Cliffs Natural Resources, which extracts iron ore and metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.2 per cent to $55.87.Wynn Resorts, the casino chain, reversed two weeks of heavy losses to close the week up 12.1 per cent to $129.06. Nomura analysts came out in defence of the stock, which had been hit by fears of a decline in Chinese junket tourism to Macau.Shares in Yahoo jumped 17.5 per cent to $15.47 over the course of the week after reports suggested Microsoft was preparing a bid for the internet portal. Microsoft denied interest but Alibaba remained in the running, along with various private equity houses.AMR, the holding company of American Airlines, was down 15.5 per cent for the week to $2.50, on reports the company is considering bankruptcy.Seed company Monsanto was up 18.1 per cent to $51.56 after reporting strong quarterly sales.
85;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-10-06T15:37:33Z;Back-to-school shopping lifts US retailers;;Back-to-school shopping and heavy discounting fuelled sales at US retailers in September, beating Wall Street’s expectations as consumers searched for deals in a turbulent economic environment.Sales rose 5.8 per cent at stores open at least a year, ahead of an estimated 4.9 per cent gain, according to Retail Metrics, the research firm.“The general disconnect between US retailers…and broader weakness in the global economy continued in September,” said Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president. He noted that the labour market “continues to struggle to gain job-building momentum”, citing Thursday’s report that weekly jobless claims rose back above 400,000. The government is due to report on September job creation and unemployment on Friday.As the stock market has taken a wild ride, driven by concerns over the eurozone debt crisis and fears that US growth may remain in low gear, consumers have been more pessimistic about economic conditions.Despite those worries, shoppers flocked to discounters like Target and Costco, and department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s to stock up for the new school year.Target sales rose 5.3 per cent from a year ago, the company’s biggest single monthly increase outside of the Easter holiday since before the recession, Mr Perkins noted. That beat an expected 3.9 per cent rise. Costco, the membership-based discounter, posted a 12 per cent gain compared with a forecast 9.9 per cent rise.Kohl’s recorded a 4.1 per cent gain, compared with a forecast of 2 per cent, helped by aggressive promotions. Sales at Macy’s were up 4.9 per cent, compared with an expected 4.4 per cent, a performance that chief executive Terry Lundgren said “underscores that our business remains on track, despite the persistently negative macroeconomic news”.With Americans watching their wallets more closely, retailers “who have figured out how to do business with the consumer in these economic times” are succeeding, said Mike Brown, a vice-president at AT Kearney, the consultancy. “We are looking at strong performance from retailers who are offering the consumer great value.”He pointed to luxury retailer Saks, which posted a 9.3 per cent sales rise compared with an expected 6.2 per cent gain, saying that stores which sell high-end products that people feel they “have to have” continue to do well despite the rocky economy.Other department stores were not so successful, however. Bon Ton Stores sales fell 3.6 per cent while JC Penney was down 0.6 per cent, both missing expectations. Following the disappointing sales data, JC Penney cut its forecast for third-quarter earnings to 10 to 15 cents a share from about 25 cents a share, and said it expected sales growth in the July to September quarter to be flat.Clothing retailers reported mixed results. Sales at Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works, jumped 11 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent rise. But Gap sales dropped a greater-than-expected 4 per cent.“While there were some bright spots across our brands and business units, we’re clear and focused on the steps necessary to improve our business performance going forward,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Limited Brands.Hurricane Irene, which brought record flooding and damage to the east coast at the end of August, was likely to have affected shopping patterns last month, said Michael McNamara, head of MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which tracks US retail sales. He said store closings over the final weekend of August pushed some back-to-school shopping into September and also boosted sales at hardware suppliers as homeowners repaired damaged houses.
86;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-10-06T03:16:45Z;Yahoo surges on Microsoft takeover reports;;Shares in US internet portal Yahoo rose 9 per cent in the last two hours of trading on reports that Microsoft is considering a bid.An existing tie-up means Yahoo’s website is powered by Microsoft’s Bing search engine, leaving some analysts sceptical of the value of a bid.“Why buy the cow when you already get the milk for free?” said Herman Leung, senior internet analyst at Susquehanna Financial.“Its not clear what’s in it for Microsoft, but if anyone has the cash, it’s them, so you can’t rule it out.”Buyers pushed Yahoo up to $15.77, a rise of 20 per cent on the week, on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce site, which confirmed its interest in buying out the California-based group last Friday.Microsoft closed up 2.2 per cent to $25.89.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,144.04 as the International Monetary Fund pushed for a speedy recapitalisation of European banks, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she was inclined to act soon. That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70. Refiner Tesoro was up 13.8 per cent to $21.95.Apple inched up 1.5 per cent to $378.25. Investors were underwhelmed by the launch of the latest iPhone model. The stock is down 2.1 per cent for the week.Jefferies analyst Peter Misek predicted a quick turnround once investors tune into the upgrades “under the hood” of the iPhone.Costco fell 1.7 per cent to $80.25, despite reporting fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $27.58bn, a 17 per cent increase on the same quarter last year. Some analysts had expected even better results from the wholesale club, while investors were cautious about the company’s decision to increase membership fees to offset rising commodity costs.Seed company Monsanto rose 5.2 per cent to $66.25, after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results. The company also promised to restate its financial results for the past three fiscal years as a result of a federal investigation into incentives paid to distributors of its herbicide.
87;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Costco: remarkable figures;Offering savings to the relatively well-off should remain a good business;"Costco’s latest quarterly results, posted on Wednesday, were greeted with the equivalent of a disappointed sigh (the stock was down a few per cent). Many retailers would be cheered for performing as the discount warehouse club did. Sales were up 17 per cent, same-store sales increased 7 per cent and despite gross margin pressure, earnings per share rose by double digits.These are remarkable figures for a retailer of Costco’s size ($90bn in annual sales) facing both inflation in its inventory and increasingly frugal shoppers. The company also showed its commitment to profitability and confidence in the value it offers by announcing that membership fees for most members would rise by $5 to $55 – the first increase in years.Expectations have been set high, however, and Costco missed analysts’ EPS estimates by a penny or two. But looking beyond a single quarter, the crucial issue is whether this very strong business will continue to receive a very premium valuation should the economy continue to slow. The stock trades at 21 times prospective earnings. Most other big retailers (save Amazon) trade closer to 10 times; Walmart is on 12 times.The premium reflects the outperformance of Costco’s stock since the market bottomed in 2009: it has more than doubled, twice the increase in consumer staples shares generally. Costco underperformed in the preceding crash, however. This makes a certain amount of sense: warehouse clubs are about value but customers have to feel relaxed enough about their next paycheck to buy ahead, and in bulk. That is part of the reason they attract a more affluent customer base than regular discounters such as Walmart. But same-store sales at Costco held up during the 2008-2009 recession. There is no reason to think that offering savings to the relatively well-off should not remain a good business in the next downturn as well.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
88;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Costco increases its membership fees;;Costco, the largest US wholesale club by revenues, said on Wednesday that it was raising its membership fees for the first time in more than five years as rising commodities costs ate into its quarterly profit margins.The company, which sells products in bulk at discount prices, said its fourth-quarter net revenues jumped 17 per cent from a year ago to $27.58bn, while its net income rose 10.6 per cent to $478m, or $1.08 a share, during the same period. The results trailed expectations of Wall Street analysts and Costco’s shares fell 1.7 per cent to close at $80.25.Richard Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer, said he was concerned about the US economy, citing “market gyrations” and the ongoing struggles facing the housing and jobs markets. However, he said the company had thought hard about the need to raise its annual membership fee to $55 and that the it still provided good value to the 22m people who will face increases.“These fee increases were necessary given the higher costs Costco is experiencing in its business and its promise to keep prices low to members, and should have been expected by the member base as competitors have since moved on fee hikes,” said Brian Sozzi, retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies.Mr Galanti said that in spite of the weak economy, Costco was “bucking the trend” and seeing strong traffic in its stores, as its customers increasingly looked for bargains on petrol and food.“We recognise that people are probably eating at home more than they used to,” he said. “That drives people into our parking lot.”As consumers turn to wholesale clubs such as Costco for food, pressure is increasing on the US restaurant industry.Separately on Wednesday, Friendly Ice Cream Corporation, which operates about 500 restaurants in the US, said it was filing for bankruptcy and would close 63 of its underperforming restaurants. The company said its decision was “driven largely by the challenges of the current economic downturn, significantly increased costs, particularly in commodities such as cream, [and] rents that exceed current market rates”.That followed an announcement on Tuesday from Real Mex Restaurants, a leading operator of Mexican restaurants in the US, which said it was filing for bankruptcy and putting several of its chains up for sale. The company noted economic weakness, rising rents and debt as the reasons for its restructuring.According to analysts, many customers who choose to eat out are going to quick service restaurants in favour of full-service dining.“While demand for full-service restaurants – family dining, casual dining and fine dining – declined steeply during the recession, the economic recovery has failed to produce a symmetric bounceback,” said Sara Senatore, analyst at Bernstein Research.
89;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-09-01T17:58:09Z;Discount clubs lead way with sales boost;;Discount warehouse clubs, which cater to middle-income Americans under pressure to save money, posted strong sales figures for August even as other some retailers and less wealthy consumers continue to struggle.BJ’s Wholesale Club, which is being taken private by two buy-out groups in a $2.8bn deal, posted an 11 per cent jump in August sales from a year ago, while Costco, the sector leader by revenue, posted a 6 per cent rise in US sales.The strong performance of discount warehouse clubs in recent months is a sign that middle-income Americans continue to search for ways to economise on groceries as they face persistent economic worries over jobs, debts, house prices and inflation.Overall, retail sales from 25 companies that report monthly figures were up 5.5 per cent from last August, but the companies represent only 20-30 per cent of total sales and do not distinguish the impact of higher ticket prices from changes in sales volumes.For consumers, last month was marked by extreme stock market volatility – which tends to unnerve people with investment portfolios – and bookended by the US debt ceiling impasse at the start and Hurricane Irene on the east coast at the end.The discount warehouse clubs let fee-paying members pay low prices to bulk-buy products – such as 2kg jars of mayonnaise and 36-packs of toilet roll – which they stack on towering shelves in their industrial-style outlets.John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm, said: “Consumers are looking at higher food, fuel and apparel prices and these warehouse clubs offer them an opportunity to stock up on staples that they may use for three or four months. That’s a way of protecting yourself against inflation.”Costco announced late on Wednesday that Jim Sinegal, its chief executive and co-founder, would step down at the end of this year to be replaced by Craig Jelinek, currently chief operating officer.“He’s leaving the company in tip-top shape,” said Daniela Nedialkova, analyst at Atlantic Equities, who said Costco’s success was built on offering a limited range of select products and negotiating hard with suppliers to secure the lowest possible prices.Costco’s August net sales at its US and international businesses combined were $6.9bn.The second-biggest warehouse chain is Walmart’s Sam’s Club, which last month reported a 9.5 per cent rise in sales to $13.6bn in the three months to July 31, even as Walmart-branded stores reported a ninth consecutive decline in quarterly like-for-like sales.Sales at BJ’s Wholesale last month hit $901m. The company’s acquisition by two buy-out groups, Leonard Green and CVC Capital Partners, is expected to close by the end of this year.Rather than warehouse clubs, Mr Long said that low-income Americans continued to shop at dollar stores such as Dollar General and Family Dollar, because they were deterred by the clubs’ membership fees.“People who are living pay cheque to pay cheque have to assess whether they feel they’re getting a return on that subscription,” he said.
90;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-09-01T15:52:55Z;Tesco’s exit adds to Japan’s tough reputation;;When Carrefour set foot in Japan a decade ago, its claim to revolutionise retailing in the country caused such a stir that its competitors predicted its demise even before it opened its first store.By contrast, Tesco arrived eight years ago with the low-key acquisition of the Tsurukame group of small supermarkets and seemed determined to quietly but patiently build its presence in one of the world’s most difficult markets.In the event, Tesco has become the latest in a long list of foreign retailers to retreat from Japan, adding to the market’s reputation as a tough one to crack.Carrefour stumbled as a result of misreading Japanese consumers. It tried to present a French shopping experience, which was not sufficient to attract a loyal audience, and failed to meet Japanese shoppers’ need for a broad range of fresh products they could buy daily in small quantities.Meanwhile, Sephora, the French cosmetics retailer, failed to understand that Japanese consumers at the time were not yet ready for self-service cosmetics sales and preferred the attention they received at department store counters, despite the higher cost.Walmart, the giant US retailer, has also struggled in Japan, where it acquired Seiyu, a local supermarket group.Walmart has invested heavily in Seiyu, but Takayuki Suzuki, representative of Primo Research Japan, an independent research firm, says the stores are dark and unattractive and have become like warehouses. Consequently, Walmart cannot find attractive acquisitions to expand in Japan, because only distressed stores would be willing to be acquired by it, he notes.Although Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has managed to fill a need in Japan for stylish yet low-cost home furnishings, it took the group two earlier attempts to crack the Japanese market before finally succeeding.But the fiercely competitive Japanese retail market is a debilitating battleground, not just for foreign retailers.Japanese department stores have been struggling for years, amid persistent deflation and a growing shift to speciality stores.For food retailers, Japan’s high costs, particularly high rents and personnel costs, pose an additional challenge, making it difficult for even the largest groups, such as Aeon and Ito-Yokado, to generate solid operating profit margins, analysts say.As a result, while operating profit margins for global groups, such as Tesco and Carrefour are about 5 per cent, for even the best Japanese supermarket groups they are around 3.5 per cent, says Mr Suzuki.One factor behind the high costs is consumers’ strong preference for locally sourced fresh foods.For example, the radish eaten in Kyoto is completely different from the radish that people eat in Hokuriku on the northwestern coast of Honshu, says Masafumi Shoda, analyst at Nomura in Tokyo.Scale is crucial to keep costs low and this is what ultimately led to failure for Tesco, analysts say.With just 129 stores, compared with Aeon’s 1,900 or so stores, Tesco was just too small to compete with the large Japanese supermarket groups, says Mr Shoda.While Tesco’s decision to buy C Two Network, the operator of the Tsurukame smaller discount food stores, appeared an odd one at the time, it was actually “a clever acquisition”, Mr Suzuki says.Food retailing in Japan is increasingly shifting away from large hypermarkets in the suburbs to smaller stores in the cities.What is more, stagnant wages and the increasing number of pensioners in Japan have meant that food discount stores have been growing, says Mr Suzuki. “Tsurukame was one of the pioneers in that field.”The problem is that Tsurukame faced increasing competition from much larger groups, like Aeon, which have been moving into the discount sector.Despite efforts to do so, Tesco was unable to buy scale due to a lack of either sites for store development or attractive acquisition targets, Mr Suzuki says. “Western companies want to grow rapidly but that is unrealistic in Japan.”One exception has been Costco, the US membership discount wholesaler, which has slowly but steadily increased the number of stores it has in Japan.Increasingly cost-conscious Japanese consumers have flocked to Costco stores, often in groups, which share the large-sized packages that Costco products are generally sold in.Although Costco does not disclose its results, “the industry believes it is doing well and is keeping a close eye on it,” Mr Suzuki says.
91;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-08-16T21:35:45Z;UK rice king makes a name for himself;;Moni Varma has a good memory for figures. He recalls that his first salary – selling duplicators in his native Malawi – was $30, but he also remembers precisely that his average monthly commission was a then-remarkable $112. Soon afterwards, he recalls, his first big sale after joining a friend’s barbed-wire business won him a commission of $495. “I remember I couldn’t reach the $500 mark,” he says, as if it still rankles more than 40 years later.Now 62, and the founder and owner of Veetee Rice, the UK-based business with a turnover of £80m that he set up in 1987, Mr Varma deals in bigger numbers these days. Immaculate in a monogrammed white shirt and wearing a Hublot watch, he strides around his factories in Rochester, Kent, and seems almost as proud of those first deals as of his more recent, larger achievements.The Veetee name is well known in a number of countries outside the UK as well as among Britain’s Asian consumers. Now, however, Mr Varma believes his latest foray into the convenience-food sector – pre-cooked dishes that are ready to heat and eat – could turn his company into a mainstream brand.Yet it is a business Mr Varma never intended to start. After arriving in the UK in the early 1980s, where his wife had grown up, he intended to use his background in steel production in Malawi to start a plant producing reinforcement mesh. Demand would be strong, he thought, because construction of the Channel tunnel was set to start.However, he was diverted by relatives in northern India who wanted to sell rice in Britain and had asked him for help with contacts. Having reluctantly agreed, he soon spotted that European import duties on milled white rice were £400 a tonne, compared with £200 on unmilled brown rice. “I knew nothing about rice, but I thought there’s a bit of margin here to play with,” he says. “And, as the base is manufacturing, it was something that excited me – I can’t just trade and make money.”On starting work instead of studying law: “The salary was $30 and within a month or two I was making so much money on commissions that I never looked back.”On coming to the UK to start up: “Within three to four months I sold some steel into Africa and made about £152,000. I remember the figure.”On continuing to innovate: “What motivates people like me is not that there is a pot of gold at the end. It’s that there is a problem that you want to solve – the pot of gold is just the byproduct.”On still working at 62: “I work in short bursts. I’ll go and play golf and get my handicap down, but then I lose interest. So in the winter months I come back with a vengeance.”On how to be an entrepreneur: “Back your instinct. It’s a lot cheaper to lose in your ‘infancy’ and start again. Of those that take the step and go out and try something, 70 to 80 per cent will succeed if they’ve got staying power. It’s almost criminal not taking that chance.”Although confidence in UK manufacturing has wavered for decades, Mr Varma has never shied away from borrowing large amounts of money to back his instincts. Undaunted by the debt that would be needed to set up a factory, he worked out that he needed to process 1,100 tonnes a year to make the repayments on loans for a small mill. But reaching consumers would be a challenge. “I had no USP [unique selling point], and big brands like Uncle Ben’s and Tilda were already established here,” he says. “My background was selling steel in bulk and there was no branding in steel …so I knew not to go for branding.”Instead, he pursued the private-label market, starting by supplying Marks and Spencer and then exploiting the results of a taste test in which his rice came out top – “It’s the luck of the draw, one day you think ours is tasty, the next day theirs is tasty” – to win a contract with Safeway, another high-street supermarket retailer.The business grew during the following decade, and he built factories in India, Pakistan, Malawi and Nigeria. The Indian arm of the group turns over £50m. He built up exports to about 50 countries but in the UK, where many people still struggle to cook rice that is not stodgy, the market was changing – and offering a new opportunity.Because natural rice cooked in large quantities sticks together, industrial caterers use parboiled rice that maintains its separate-grains consistency. Meanwhile, in Japan, a technology that allowed the production of palatable ready-cooked rice in microwaveable pouches had already been exploited by rivals such as Uncle Ben’s.Supermarkets clamoured for own-label pouches but Mr Varma refused. To him, parboiled rice lost the “flavour, aroma and mouth feel” of the natural product, while the intense heat further im­paired the taste.But his reasons were also economic. “The brand leader and first-mover advantage was taken by Uncle Ben’s – so anybody else would only struggle along behind …And I was so used to being mucked about by private-label, where margins went wafer-thin at times, that I was not prepared to go into yet another product just chasing someone else,” he says.“If you want to introduce something in a sophisticated market like the UK, you’ve got to come out with a difference and something that the consumer wants.”He flew to Japan to work with manufacturers there, but their steaming process could not get Mr Varma’s rice grains to remain separate. Refusing to be discouraged, Mr Varma experimented by putting chicken pieces, water and a supermarket Thai curry sauce in an individual meal tray and cooking it in the plant. The result was so “finger-licking good”, he says, that even the Japanese workers liked it. That persuaded him to invest £200,000 in a plant in Kent to continue trials on pre-cooked rice pouches.Mr Varma persevered for months on cooking rice in individual trays that could be seal­ed and kept at ambient temperatures. “Then, one fine day, we managed to crack it, more by accident than design, and we managed to keep the rice fluffy,” he says.Convinced at last that he had something as good as rice cooked from scratch, he raised £17m from a bank to invest in a production line that treats the rice for just a few seconds to kill bacteria without impairing the flavour, before steaming it in individual trays. The production line is sealed and sterilised air is then pumped in at high air pressure.The gamble seems to have paid off: the ready-cooked range, branded Dine In, made profits of £2m and is carried by the main UK supermarket chains. A second production line is being installed to more than double capacity to 90m units a year. In the US, the Dine In range is to be rolled out in 300 Costco stores in Texas.Now he has a USP, Mr Varma is bullish that he can build a profitable brand that appeals to a broad cross-section of consumers. “The bottom line in this sphere alone could give us £20m,” he says.As a result Mr Varma plans to sell all his factories outside of those in the UK and India in order to “concentrate on [the project’s] development full-throttle”.The importing and milling of rice has made Mr Varma a multimillionaire. But for now, as he enthusiastically dons a bright blue hairnet and high-visibility jacket and launches into an impromptu factory tour, he is eager to describe in detail every aspect of production.“I am an industrialist,” he proclaims, checking the production line as he passes. “And there are so many opportunities here. Whoever said you can’t manufacture in the UK needs their head examined.”
92;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-08-04T20:58:57Z;Wall Street tumbles on economic concerns;;US stocks tumbled to their worst one-day losses for more than two years with industrial and energy stocks leading the declines as a surge in the dollar raised fears that exporters would be hit by higher costs.All three major US indices entered correction territory, meaning they were more than 10 per cent lower that their 2011 highs. The benchmark S&P 500 retreated 4.7 per cent on Thursday to 1,200.24 at the closing bell. It was the worst session since February 2009.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in more than two years, falling more than 500 points or 4.3 per cent to 11,383.83, while the Nasdaq Composite was off 5.1 per cent to 2,556.39, its worst session since January 2009.The CBOE Volatility index or Vix, popularly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge“, jumped to its highest level since March, up 29.64 per cent on the session to more than 30.The S&P energy sector fell 6.8 per cent, materials lost 6.7 per cent and industrials were down 5.4 per cent, all hit by the rising dollar and weakening market sentiment.Alcoa was the Dow’s biggest faller at the close, retreating 9.2 per cent to $12.94, while Caterpillar was 7 per cent lower at $89.55.In the energy sector, which reached its lowest level since March, the US oil majors were hit hard.ExxonMobil fell 5 per cent to $73.84, ConocoPhillips was down 5.2 per cent to $66.92 and Chevron lost 5.8 per cent to $96.84.Alpha Natural Resources reported a $56.4m second-quarter loss, much of which was due to takeover-related costs after acquiring Massey Energy for $7.1bn in June. Its shares dropped 17 per cent to $33.24.In addition to concerns about global economic growth and currency stability, weekly US initial jobless claims weighed on sentiment, with the 400,000 figure less than the 405,000 that was forecast.Wall Street was also anticipating Friday’s nonfarm payroll report for July, one of the most important economic indicators, which has disappointed in the last two months“Having been burned badly the last two months, it appears that this time a lot of traders have been exiting positions and going to the sidelines ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report,” analysts at CMC Markets said. “This suggests that unlike the last two months where pre-announcement euphoria ended up being crushed, the resignation and despondency seen today could set the table for a positive surprise.”Kraft was one of the few bright spots, leading the Dow after news that the US food company would split into two divisions.As well as reporting forecast-beating results, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oreos and Kool Aid said it would spin-off its grocery business from the faster-growing snack business. Its shares were 1.5 per cent lower at $33.78.Among retailers, individual July same-store sales figures were mixed but sent the S&P retail sector 4.9 per cent lower.As a whole, the Retail Metrics July same-store sales index rose 5 per cent, with 58 per cent of retailers beating forecasts. “Retailers catering to higher-end consumers outperformed once again in July,” the report said.But mid-level department store group Kohl’s, which was expected to miss sales expectations, fell 7.9 per cent to $47.67.Shares in Gap, the clothing store, fell 11.6 per cent to $16.98, one of the worst-hit retailers of the session. Shares in the troubled retailer have fallen nearly 30 per cent from its 2011 high.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 15 per cent bump in sales against a similar period last year, registering net sales of $6.4bn. Gasoline inflation and foreign exchange rates both worked in the chain’s favour, Citigroup analysts noted. Its shares were off just 0.7 per cent to $76.51.Limited Brands also reported strong sales and boosted its outlook for the second quarter, which left its stock 1.27 per cent lower at $35.84. The company, whose brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent over 2010, beating analysts’ expectations.Elsewhere among the earnings reports, General Motors said its quarterly profit nearly doubled to $2.5bn on strong North American and Asian sales. Earnings per share in the carmaker were $1.54, beating analysts’ expectations.“We believe this quarter should begin to revive momentum around the GM story,” Citigroup analysts said. “Recent market share gains, resilient pricing and now a high-quality quarter are all occurring ahead of GM’s major North America product cycle.”But the strong earnings did little to boost GM shares, which fell 4.3 per cent to $25.99. Its domestic competitor, Ford, was down 6.8 per cent to $10.86.DirecTV, the US satellite broadcaster, reported that net income rose to $701m, or 91 cents a share, but its market share shrunk, adding just 26,000 US subscribers. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $46.63.A key concern is that DirecTV’s model is “structurally flawed vs the cable operators”, analysts at Collins Stewart noted. They were optimistic about the outlook because “DirecTV has been able to withstand the crippling US recession and housing crises because of its premium brand and superior service.”
93;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-07-22T16:48:00Z;Borders collapse signals a new retail chapter;;"At a store on the southwest corner of New York’s Central Park, signs blaring “Everything must go!” and “Nothing held back” were put up overnight, confirming that Borders had entered its final chapter – and that US retail was beginning a new one.The loss-making book chain was sent into liquidation this week and its going-out-of-business discounts, flagged in big yellow letters on Friday, dispelled the usually cosy feel of its Columbus Circle store.The previous day several lunchtime customers had nestled into its quieter corners: a woman browsing the religion section with a bowl of water for her dog; a man splayed like a sun-bather on the floor of the events zone.Borders’ role as a home-away-from-home is one reason why its extinction has been greeted with sadness. But the company’s demise – leaving Barnes & Noble as the US’s only national book chain – is about more than the end of an era in books.Three decades ago, the rule of thumb in US retail was that there was room for three big players in each product category. “Good, better, and best,” as Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, recalls.But today, so a new theory goes, each category has room for just one specialist chain, competing with Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer by sales, and Walmart, the dominant mass merchant whose low prices yielded $260bn of US sales last year.Following the collapse of Borders – a victim of online shopping, the e-book and a dose of bad management – the book business now fits this model.It points more broadly to the slow death of diversity across big retail, a process that has been accelerated by the US’s seemingly unshakeable economic funk. With that come questions about which category will be next – and whether any can escape.Consumer electronics, another of Amazon’s strengths, went down to one national chain in 2009 when Circuit City went into liquidation, leaving struggling Best Buy in the top spot.In music – first sold in hard copy online and now easily digitised, like books – not even one national chain has survived.“We’re in a ‘no excuses’ environment,” says Faye Landes, managing director of Consumer Edge Research. “Amazon and then the recession mean there is not much room for people who aren’t good at retailing.”The broadening range of goods online and people’s growing comfort with e-commerce is well known: that is why online sales are growing at or above 15 per cent year-on-year, reaching $46bn or 4.5 per cent of all retail sales in the first quarter, according to Census Bureau data.The limited spending of all but the rich is also obvious. Steven Burd, chief executive of Safeway, the grocery chain, said this week: “My gut basically splits our customers as about 25 per cent ‘recession’s over with, times are good, spending as they always did’. And then the other 75 per cent ‘really very cautious and very concerned’.”Even Walmart cannot feel secure. It accounts for $10 of every $100 spent in US retail, according to Euromonitor, but its sales have slipped in each of the past eight quarters. For some consumers, two other big box merchants, Target and Costco, fill Walmart’s shoes.What’s also new – thanks to smartphones and comparison shopping sites – is that consumers are better informed, more canny and more eager for bargains than ever.The category where the next victims are most likely to fall is office supplies, where Office Depot, Staples and Office Max toil on.“It seems to defy logic. You’d think that’s one of the most commoditised industries,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research. But years of competition with Walmart may have pared them down to a “hyper-efficient model” early, she says.Then there is sporting goods, home to Dick’s, Hibbett Sports, Foot Locker and Sports Authority. They were once shielded by the belief that consumers would not go online to buy anything they wore. But that has been proved wrong.“Look at shoes,” says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon, a boutique investment bank. “It has the highest number of styles, colours and sizes of any category; everyone’s feet are different; but even so, Zappos [acquired by Amazon in 2009] has been incredibly successful online, continuing to take share from brick-and-mortar retailers.”Groceries is one category where the US is not expected to see an online retailer such as the UK’s Ocado, because selling perishable goods is too difficult and expensive outside high-density cities. Both Walmart and Amazon are doing tests, but they have not found a profitable model.For other bricks-and-mortar retailers, the outlook is not unremittingly bleak.Leon Nicholas, senior vice president at Kantar Retail, a consultancy, says that if diversity is dying, it is only among the bigger stores: “What we’re seeing is a more fragmented, postmodern sort of marketplace, where shoppers slide across channels and retailers.”There is still demand for small stores that are quirky or localised. Among bigger stores, most analysts say the winners will be those that make shopping more than a chore.“Consumers want to be entertained as they shop,” says Mr Berliner. “Better retailers create an original and exciting store experience. They understand how to entice people into their stores and make them feel good about purchasing their goods.”The leading examplar is a technology company: Apple.Its stores are so admired that JC Penney, a department store, has recruited the man behind them, Ron Johnson, as its chief executive. They have even been cloned – transparent staircases and all – by ambitious fraudsters in China, as an expat blogger revealed this week.It is a painful irony for Borders that, with its comfy corners and knowledgeable staff, it scored high marks on the experience scale. But the forces massed against it were too great."
94;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-07-14T14:08:52Z;US car sales lift weak retail data;;An unexpected rise in auto buying helped US retail sales edge up in June, but consumers remained cautious amid high unemployment, rising inflation and economic uncertainty.Retail sales were up 0.1 per cent last month, the commerce department said, ahead of an expected 0.1 per cent fall and beating a revised 0.1 per cent decline in May. But the uptick was driven entirely by an 0.8 per cent boost in sales of cars and parts. Stripping out auto purchases, sales were flat for the month, and excluding both auto and petrol prices, sales rose a modest 0.2 per cent. Overall sales rose 8.1 per cent from June 2010.“While the headline beat expectations, when you scratch beneath the surface, what you see is a number that doesn’t look nearly as good,” said Tom Porcelli, US economist at RBC Capital Markets. “It’s the loss of momentum that worries us.”The increase in demand for cars was unexpected, following auto industry reports earlier this month that car sales softened in June as consumers grew more pessimistic and inventories remained at low levels in the wake of the March earthquake in Japan.Rising car sales helped offset a 1.3 per cent drop in petrol station sales as prices moderated from recent highs of nearly $4 a gallon.In spite of paying less at the pump, Americans remained cautious with their money. Sales of furniture, electronics and appliances, sporting goods, books and music and health and personal care products were all lower over the month, although consumers spent more on building materials, food and beverages, clothing and general merchandise.Declining energy prices reduced wholesale costs last month, a separate report from the labour department said. Producer prices – what wholesalers charge retailers – fell 0.4 per cent in June, a sharper decrease than the 0.2 per cent expected by analysts, and following May’s 0.2 per cent gain.Energy prices pulled back by 2.8 per cent, the largest fall in two years, with a 4.7 per cent fall in petrol prices accounting for two-thirds of the decline. That offset a mild 0.6 per cent rise in food prices, driven by more expensive fresh fruit and melons.Stripping out the impact of volatile fuel and food costs, core prices rose 0.3 per cent, slightly ahead of a forecast 0.2 per cent rise. “Japan-related supply constraints may be behind continued gains in passenger car (+0.2 per cent) and light truck (+1.6 per cent) prices. Also boosting the core was a 0.3 per cent rise in tobacco goods prices, this component’s largest gain in six months,” noted Dana Saporta, director of US economics at Credit Suisse.Whether retailers will continue to pass on these higher costs to consumers will be seen in the June consumer price index, set to be released on Friday. Consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent from April to May, the fastest growth since 2006.Americans are keeping a tight rein on spending as the economy sputters. While US chain stores lured consumers with steep bargains in June, sending same-store sales up 7.2 per cent from a year ago, gains were led by discount wholesalers such as Costco.Hopes that the economic recovery would accelerate from its recent slowdown were shattered last week with the news that US employers added just 18,000 new jobs in June and the unemployment rate rose to 9.2 per cent.Another report from the labour department on Thursday offered some relief, showing that jobless claims dropped to the lowest level in three months, but analysts warned that the weekly data are too volatile to draw firm conclusions about the health of the labour market.Initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 22,000 to 405,000 in the week ending July 9, better than the 415,000 new claims forecast by economists. The four-week moving average was still elevated, dipping 3,750 to 423,250, but that was the lowest level in 11 weeks.“Given the volatility in initial claims in early July (a period when auto plants are traditionally shut for retooling), we can read little into the drop in jobless claims in the latest week,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics. “We need to see a sustained move in initial claims below the 400,000 mark for this report to signal a return to more solid job creation.”Continuing claims rose by 15,000 to 3.73m in the week ending July 2, while emergency claims fell by 22,408 to 3.23m in the week ending June 25.
95;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;When two’s company but three’s a crowd;Three-partner firms usually don’t stay that way;For those starting out in business, I recommend taking a partner. Such relationships help spread the load and usually make the journey a more enjoyable one. I’ve found that sharing the highs and lows means the experience of creating a company is much more fulfilling.Since industrial capitalism began, many of the great concerns have been forged by two individuals working together. Andrew Carnegie could not have built his steel empire without Henry Clay Frick, and Royal Dutch Shell would never have existed but for Henri Deterding and Marcus Samuel deciding to pool their interests. Famous partnerships of recent times include Bill Gates and Paul Allen at Microsoft, and Bill Hewlett and David Packard at Hewlett-Packard.I’ve noticed that three-partner firms mostly don’t stay that way – one of the trio usually drops out. Examples include Topps Tiles and Carphone Warehouse. I think this happens because two can gang up against one, because equity split three ways isn’t enough and because the likelihood of three entrepreneurs having the same sustained ambition is slim.Picking the right partner is hard. Many founders simply choose a friend – as I have on a couple of occasions. For us it was fruitful, but I suspect such link-ups are generally less effective. I liked the way Costco co-founder Jeffrey Brotman found his partner Jim Sinegal: “I called around to retail contacts and asked them to list executives who could run such a business. Jim was on most lists. I cold-called him one day and flew to California to meet him.” They have built a corporation with more than $70bn in revenues.Structuring partnerships is a difficult art. The default assumption is a 50/50 arrangement. I used to assume this formula was best but inevitably one partner works harder, and contributes more. The danger is that the grafter grows resentful and the business suffers. Eventually it leads to a break-up. Many of the investments I’ve found have been triggered by such circumstances. And ultimately most organisations do require a single boss, even if there are co-founders and co-owners. So perhaps the most pragmatic approach is to give one individual a majority – but make sure the minority partner has protections.Of course, shares represent a financial stake but also control – and power. Occasionally it makes sense for rewards and influence to be split differently. This can happen if one partner is a passive contributor but provides more cash or assets. In such cases the operating partner might argue that they want to be in command – with the capital partner possessing certain veto rights.It is sensible to have a legal agreement that governs how the partnership functions. Such paperwork is tedious but saves misunderstandings and is invaluable in the event of a bust-up. This should include some mechanism for an exit strategy, especially if one partner needs to buy the other out. I like the technique known as a Mexican shoot-out, where each participant submits a confidential bid for the other side’s shareholding – and the highest offer wins.How should partners divide responsibilities? When discussing his method of working with composer Richard Rodgers, the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein said: “I hand him a lyric and get out of the way.” If tasks are clear-cut like that, then the alliance is simpler – and often more successful.Typical partnerships are vaguer, mostly because co-founders instinctively bond with individuals whose interests and personalities are similar to their own. The disadvantage of this type of association is that there is duplication – perhaps one reason why it is estimated that more than half of all business partnerships fail.Sibling partnerships are the most complicated. I have seen several end in bitterness and litigation. One suspects the disputes were almost adult reruns of childhood fights – the same psychology playing itself out decades later. Blood loyalty can be magnificent, but business feuds that destroy families are far more tragic than conventional partnership disputes. Such dangers make me relieved that I’ve never teamed up with my siblings in business.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts
96;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-05-05T18:57:29Z;Easter spending boosts US retail sales;;"US retail sales grew strongly in April as discount promotions and the Easter holiday persuaded consumers to spend more than expected, in spite of rising inflation and a weak labour market.Sales were up 8.7 per cent from a year ago at stores open at least 12 months, equalling the largest monthly gain in the past 11 years, according to Retail Metrics.But against a backdrop of continued economic uncertainty, analysts warned that life for shoppers and retailers would get tougher as the year went on and the pain of adjusting to inflation grew.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that after June “all bets are off”.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its April sales were 8 per cent higher than a year ago, bouncing back from a 10 per cent decline last month.The best performer was Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, whose sales grew 20 per cent.But department stores other than Macy’s failed to meet expectations.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said many of the better performing retailers had offered aggressive low-price promotions, but at
the cost of narrower profit margins.“We continue to see consumers responding to value and promotions. They want the deal,” he said.“Consumers are not showing any signs of being willing to accept price increases.”Gap, which has offered particularly big discounts, was forced to lower its earnings forecast for the first quarter. It also said its design chief, Patrick Robinson, was leaving the company, as it struggles to revitalise its product range.Among permanent discount retailers, sales at Target stores rose 13 per cent while Costco said its comparable store sales – excluding petrol – rose 6 per cent.Some retailers were boosted by the late timing of Easter, because the traditional pre-holiday shopping surge that took place last year in late March instead came in April this year.Both retailers and consumer goods companies are facing a difficult combination of rising input inflation and consumers who they know may stop buying if prices increase.Sara Lee, the US food company, said on Thursday that its price increases – including a 6 per cent rise in its retail division from a year ago – would hit sales volumes this year. It lowered its earnings outlook.Estée Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand, said that rising fuel prices were not yet affecting its high-end consumers, but acknowledged that more dramatic rises in petrol prices would damp consumer sentiment and eventually be a drag on business.Mr Bassuk said: “Unemployment is rising; consumer confidence is at low levels; gas prices have hit $5 [a gallon] in some cities; food prices are up. Summer is going to be very difficult for retailers focused on the discretionary spend.”"

This once eventful market has been mostly event free in recent times: no corporate defaults at all so far this year and just two throughout the whole of 2010 on a mere $534m of debt, versus 11 on $3.5bn in 2009.Now, with economies in decent shape and equity markets generally receptive to recapitalisations, Moody’s predicts only one corporate default in 2011, among 65 junk-rated issuers in Asia (excluding Japan).Who could it be? Smallish (sub-$200m), illiquid issues from the likes of Indonesia’s Bakrie Sumatera, a rubber-plantation owner, are trading at big discounts to par. In greater demand, but vulnerable all the same, are Chinese property companies, as tightening measures begin to bite. Three of the nine issuers rated B3 or lower by Moody’s – and thus the likeliest candidates for default – are mainland developers.But as they idly scan the lists of bonds trading above or just below par, investors should be mindful that risks can emerge from nowhere. In early 2009, for example, a combination of cold weather and a nasty new virus caused pond yields to plummet at Jakarta-based Central Proteinaprima, a big supplier of frozen shrimp to the likes of Tesco and Costco.By August that year the company was warning foreign bondholders of vanishing liquidity; by January 2010 it had missed a coupon payment on $325m of senior notes. Haircuts can be severe, too. Last July, at the third time of asking, Titan Petrochemicals, a Hong Kong-based oil services company, succeeded in exchanging $209m of debt due in 2012 for a combination of cash, payment-in-kind notes and zero-coupon convertibles worth $136m.

to $25.30. Analysts roundly approved of the move, saying that the plan could help unlock value for the high-growth and high-margin TripAdvisor. “We view such corporate activity as a positive catalyst for Expedia shareholders,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,328.11, leaving the index down 0.3 per cent over the week. Sentiment was subdued by economic data showing that the inventories of US wholesalers rose in February but their sales fell, a sign of uncertainty in the economic recovery.The markets were also unsettled by comments from Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, who said that the central bank was near the “tipping point” where it should start to focus more on combating inflation than stimulating employment.Not helping sentiment was the growing threat of a government shutdown as US lawmakers struggled to agree on a 2012 budget before midnight.Historical evidence suggests that the market impact of a shutdown would not be devastating. In the five-day period in November 1995 that the government was shut down, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent. During the subsequent 21-day shutdown later on that year the index added 0.1 per cent.Still, as the shutdown loomed the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent o 12,379.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,780.41. The Dow was flat over the week and the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent.The energy sector was one of the few winners in the session, led by oilfield services stocks as oil prices climber higher. Nabors Industries, the world’s largest land rig contractor, added 3.5 per cent to $31.56 while Helmerich & Payne gained 2.2 per cent to $68.98. The S&P energy index was up 0.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector Hercules Offshore lost ground after announcing that it was under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in the oil exploration group were down 11.3 per cent to $5.66.Seagate Technology added 7.6 per cent to $15.84 after the hard-disk manufacturer reported third-quarter sales that topped analyst estimates and said that it would reinstate its dividend payments.The mood on Wall Street was cautious as investors paused for breath following a 6 per cent rally in the previous weeks when the markets were bouncing back from losses sustained during the turmoil in north Africa, the Middle East and Japan. There was also little economic data to direct the markets and many traders were waiting for the start of the earnings season next week.“The markets are just passing the time at the moment and will need months of good employment news before they get their next leg up. This will likely happen in the summer and take the S&P 500 up to 1,450,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors. This suggests the markets will put on another 8.7 per cent before the end of the year, adding to the 5.6 per cent already put on.The materials sector saw some of the biggest gains over the week, lifted by deal activity in the sector and rising commodity prices.On Monday, Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m. Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn bid for Equinox Minerals.Molycorp was up 13.4 per cent to $67.19 over the week while Equinox Minerals gained 35.8 per cent to $8.05. The S&P materials sector was up 0.2 per cent over the five days.The S&P retail sector was up 1.2 per cent over the week after a series of strong March same-store sales growth figures from key industry players. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 2.9 per cent to $76.41 over the week.The markets were briefly shaken on Thursday by news that another earthquake had hit Japan, but recovered quickly."

The S&P industrial index fell 0.5 per cent, led by General Electric, which was down 1 per cent to $20.35, and 3M, which fell 0.7 per cent to $93.19.General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, lost 6.9 per cent in the days following last month’s Japanese earthquake.“This is another setback for the markets, raising the level on the global uncertainty thermometer just another touch,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Technology stocks, which saw sharp losses after the previous earthquake due to supply worries, were hit by the news.JDS Uniphase lost 3 per cent to $18.99, while Cisco Systems fell 0.9 per cent to $17.91. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.5 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,333.51, recovering from the much sharper losses earlier in the session after a tsunami warning was lifted in Japan and officials at the nuclear agency there said no further troubles had been reported following the earthquake.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,409.49 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,796.14.Before the earthquake, the markets had been hovering in neutral territory as traders reacted warily to the decision by the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, a move that suggested the era of ultra-loose monetary policy was coming to an end.Helping to limit the losses of the session was strong US economic data. Figures from the labour department showed that new applications for unemployment benefits had dropped by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week, in a further sign that the US labour market was continuing to improve.“The downward trend continues, as the pace of lay-offs by small businesses slows further,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Elsewhere on Wall Street, retail stocks were in focus after a number of same-store sales figures from key industry leaders. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 3.8 per cent to $77.82.Elsewhere, Limited Brands rose 1.6 per cent to $35.80 after the clothing retailer, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported same-store sales had climbed 1.4 per cent in March, beating the 1.1 per cent rise that was expected by analysts.Bed Bath & Beyond saw some of the strongest gains in the session, rising 10.5 per cent to $54.55 after the home furnishings retailer forecast annual earnings of $3.38 to $3.53 a share, more than the $3.33 expected by analysts.“The company delivered a high quality beat with better than anticipated sales,” said analysts at Citigroup.But the results from the retail sector were not all positive. Gap, the clothing retailer, reported same-store sales down 10 per cent, while Target reported sales down 5.5 per cent. Shares in Gap lost 1.5 per cent to $22.72 while Target was down 2.6 per cent to $49.62.Overall though, the results were better than expected and so the retail sector was up 0.4 per cent.In corporate news, Newmont Mining, the largest gold miner in the US by market capitalisation, was up 3.3 per cent to $58.29 after announcing plans to increase its annual gold production to approximately 7m ounces by 2017, a 35 per cent increase from current levels.The company also announced a new dividend policy that will link its quarterly dividend payment to its average realised price of gold sales. The price of gold has gone up 65 per cent in the past two years and is now trading around record highs near $1,450 a troy ounce.Among other companies in focus, Rite Aid put on 1.9 per cent to $1.08, reporting that its fiscal fourth quarter loss had narrowed slightly. Pier 1 Imports added 10.5 per cent to $11.65 after the home furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate.

Consider that since the end of the US recession in June 2009, shares in Tiffany and Saks, which both sell mostly to the rich, have risen 108 and 186 per cent respectively; shares in discount retailers Family Dollar and Costco are both up about 50 per cent; but shares in mid-range retailers Walmart and Best Buy are up 3 and down 15 per cent respectively. European markets tell the same story: companies that sell to the very rich or the very poor are prospering; those selling to the middle are not.Strong sales in emerging markets explain some of the luxury outperformance, but there is a good domestic reason to think the west’s wealthy are in fine fettle: loose monetary policy, which has lifted asset values, reduced mortgage payments and raised bonuses in finance. Meanwhile, the middle classes are struggling. In the UK, inflation is outpacing wage growth. US companies appear to have improved their bottom lines by squeezing employees: corporate profit after tax was 5.7 per cent of gross national income in the second quarter of 2010, up from 4.5 per cent a year earlier. The employees’ share fell from 56.5 per cent to 55.2 per cent.The data on how the various classes have fared are not yet in for 2010. In 2009, however, the Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality where 0 means everyone gets the same and 1 means one person gets everything) ticked up to 0.403 in the UK (after housing costs), according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and to 0.468 for households in the US, according to the Census Bureau. Both were records. The market’s hunch that the west’s economic recovery came with greater inequality may well be right.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"

The S&P technology index advanced 1.6 per cent, the best performing sector in the session.Those gains helped the S&P 500 benchmark index finish 0.9 per cent higher at 1,309.66, climbing past the psychologically significant 1,300 mark for the first time since the earthquake struck Japan two weeks ago.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by employment data showing that the number of people in the US seeking jobless benefits had fallen by 5,000 to 382,000 last week. The four-week average of claims fell to its lowest point since July 2008.This helps to provide “strong evidence that the labour market recovery is for real,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, the consultancy.Optimism over the domestic economic recovery in the session outweighed more global concerns.“There is a tug-of-war going on in the markets at the moment,” said Douglas Godine, head of equities at Signal Hill. “On the one hand we have an improving economy, the Fed staying accommodating and strong company earnings. On the other there is uncertainty over Japan, the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, Portugal,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 12,171.17 in the session and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent to 2,736.42.The S&P 500, having cleared the 1,300 mark, is now 1.1 per cent higher than it was before the natural disaster in Japan, but still 2.5 per cent lower than before the eruption of conflict in north Africa and the Middle East.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility the market, was down 5.7 per cent in the session but was still up 10 per cent since before the tensions began in the Middle East.Retail stocks saw some of the strongest gains in a session where the domestic economy was in focus.GameStop, the video game retailer, was up 3 per cent to $21.74 after reporting a 10 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits and issuing a forecast for the current quarter that beat expectations. Elsewhere in the sector, Walmart added 1.8 per cent to $52.59 while Costco was up 1.7 per cent to $72.11.The S&P consumer services index gained 0.8 per cent, one of the best performances among major S&P sub-indicesThe retail sector was weighed down by Best Buy, however, which lost 5.3 per cent to $30.15 after the electronics retailer reported earnings down 16 per cent in the fourth quarter due to restructuring costs and weak TV and entertainment hardware sales.In deal news, Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, said it would buy Drugstore.com, the online drug retailer, in a deal worth $429m. The news sent shares in Drugstore.com rocketing 113.1 per cent to $3.82, while Walgreen added 0.3 per cent to $39.96.Bank of America lost ground for the second day as investors continued to digest news that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its proposed dividend hike. The stock was also hit by a number of rating downgrades and shares were down 1.3 per cent to $13.48, adding to the 1.7 per cent losses on Wednesday.Wells Fargo removed the bank from its “Priority Stock List,” citing slower dividend improvement as one reason for the decision.Elsewhere, Regions Financial was down 0.6 per cent to $7.13, adding to a 1.8 per cent loss in the previous session, but the financial sector as a whole was up. The BKX banking index rose 0.3 per cent, paring some of the 0.6 per cent in losses seen on Wednesday.Among the other stocks in focus, Imax, the operator of large-screen cinemas, climbed 12.4 per cent to $29.90 after Richard Gelfond, the chief executive officer, said they planned to open at least 100 theatres a year for the next two to three years.AT&T, the wireless carrier which recently announced a $39bn acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom, was up 1.4 per cent to $28.54 after Bernstein upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”.
102;COST;Costco Wholesale;2011-03-07T19:22:29Z;Hardship on rise for middle class;;"Outside the social security office in a rundown area of Washington, Jamie Cremeans, 31, sits with her boyfriend smoking a cigarette, waiting to pick up the benefits that keep them afloat.Her boyfriend, who is partially blind, has been receiving disability benefits for years, but Ms Cremeans is new to this. Like millions of other Americans buffeted by the financial crisis, she is receiving food stamps for the first time, now part of a multibillion-dollar benefit recently renamed the supplemental nutrition assistance programme, or Snap.Ms Cremeans started to use the programme when the couple moved from southern California to Washington to find work after she, like thousands of other middle-class Americans, lost her job in the recession. “We moved … because there’s no work there,” she says. “I just wanna work; I probably apply for five jobs a week.”According to recently released figures, 44.1m Americans are now being fed in some part by Snap, the highest number in the 50-year history of the programme. As the US continues to reel from stubbornly high unemployment, the number of US citizens using the programme has ballooned over the past three years by almost 17m, an increase of 61 per cent.In the rancorous battle over spending cuts , the programme, which cost $69bn in 2010, has come out unscathed. This is not simply due to growing hardship. “The reason it enjoys [political] support is that it benefits growers [and] ranchers,” says Kevin Concannon, secretary for food and nutrition at the Department of Agriculture, which administers the programme. It supports areas of the country that are more Republican than Democrat, he adds.In addition, the benefits of Snap to communities where the money is spent has helped the programme escape the eye of deficit hawks. The Department of Agriculture estimates that every $5 of Snap money spent in the local community generates $9 of economic activity. Very few people can afford to save their food stamps.At current levels only two-thirds of those eligible for Snap enrol, meaning 59m Americans qualify for the benefit, or about a fifth of the population. Among minorities that is even higher. In 2006, the last year for which there are records, 44 per cent of Snap household heads reported their race as Hispanic or African American, while they comprise 29 per cent of the general population.“As Americans, we like to think highly of the good things in our country. We struggle with acknowledging that in our midst, there are people who go hungry,” says Mr Concannon.The average Snap allowance is $130 to cover a month of food, an amount Ms Cremeans says is insufficient. “We never have enough food, sometimes we just go without, but there are a lot of different programmes, lots of churches help out with food.” The programme is available to anyone under the government’s designated poverty level who does not have more than $2,000 in liquid assets or own a home. It is dispensed through a debit card which is topped up automatically at the beginning of the month.The financial crisis has forced many middle-class families on to the programme and sparked a rethink among food companies previously against accepting Snap payments. Before the financial crisis, for example, warehouse stores Costco and BJ’s were not part of the programme but have since joined up. Costco was forced to make its new store in New York City Snap-friendly after realising its initial mistake in opting out.But many complain that even with these new stores taking part, Snap entitlements are not enough to sustain healthy nutritional levels. “All the evidence is that it’s not enough for a healthy diet, it’s enough to keep people from starving, to keep people from very severe malnutrition,” says Jim Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, which does public research and advocacy.It is not just a lack of funds that can cause malnutrition for those enrolled in Snap.“They may live in something called a ‘food desert’ where there’s a shortage of healthy food, and if it’s available, it’s often at a price,” says Alexandra Ashbrook, outreach co-ordinator of DC Hunger Solutions, which helps people process the Snap claims."

Yahoo rose 3.3 per cent to $16.63, one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500.Softbank, which holds a 41 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, on Wednesday said there was “no truth” to the media reports. Yahoo declined to comment.Other technology stocks were also in focus. Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, gained 3.3 per cent to $36.14 as JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral”.Another semiconductor company, Xilinx, rallied 5.6 per cent to $34.54 while Altera gained 3 per cent to $42.46. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.4 per cent while the S&P technology index rose 0.5 per cent, the strongest gainer along with energy of all 10 major S&P indices.That helped stem losses on the S&P 500, which closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,308.44, trimming some of its 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.The index is still off 2.6 per cent from its mid-February high, because of fears that sustained high oil prices due to political instability in north Africa and the Middle East may
hamper economic growth.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent to 12,066.80 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,748.07.Sentiment was lifted somewhat by the ADP national employment report which suggested that job creation had been strong in February. The report estimated that private non-farm payroll employment had risen by 217,000 last month, ahead of the 180,000 expected by economists.This was a positive leading indicator for the official non-farm payroll figures which will come out on Friday, although the ADP number is not always a successful predictor of these widely watched numbers.“ADP has not exactly covered itself in glory recently in terms of accuracy versus the government data, so we don’t look for any change to the published median forecast of 193,000 for total non-farm payrolls and 200,000 for private payrolls,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Worries over oil prices, which edged up in the session, continued to weigh on sentiment in the wider markets.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the previous session that higher oil prices were “a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability”.Some economists appeared more worried about the inflationary risk of the higher oil price than the chance of it damaging growth. “I think fears are overblown of a sharp oil-related downturn in global growth. I worry more about the inflationary consequences,” said Joachim Fels, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global economics team.Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company which fell 6.3 per cent in the previous session after announcing in its annual report that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bounced back slightly, rising 1.2 per cent to $44.24.Some analysts suggested that this might be an opportunity to buy the stock. “We believe this news will have limited fallout given the huge successes that LVS has had in Macau and Singapore and its ability to execute on a true integrated resort,” Citigroup said.Costco Wholesale reported a 16 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings but this failed to impress investors. The stock fell 2.5 per cent to $71.76.Elsewhere in the sector, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, reported an 81 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits on charges related to store closures. But the company also reported that same-store sales had risen by 5.5 per cent. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $49.66.Apple was in focus as it unveiled the second edition of the iPad.

Shoppers have been utilising their memberships to purchase cheaper petrol at a time when prices have been surging across the US.Costco said on Wednesday that its net sales rose 11 per cent to $20.45bn during the second quarter.Comparable-store sales, a measure closely watched by retailers, were up 7 per cent thanks to a big jump in demand at the company’s international locations. The company said inflation in petrol prices and strengthening foreign currencies had a positive effect.Meanwhile, at BJ’s, sales were up 7.4 per cent to $2.9bn, with same store sales up 3.8 per cent.Laura Sen, chief executive at BJ’s, said visits to its stores had been rising along with the increase in petrol prices and lifting sales.“We also see that we’ve got some improved performance in member sign-ups versus a year ago, in clubs that have gas,” Ms Sen said. “We see this as one of our best marketing tools, especially in a rising-price environment.”Profits at BJ’s were slowed by costs associated with store closures during the quarter. Net income fell 81 per cent to $10.2m, or 19 cents a share. Meanwhile, Costco’s profits jumped 16 per cent to $348m, or 79 cents a share.Wednesday’s results came a day before most big US retailers will report their monthly comparable-store sales.SpendingPulse, a retail data company, projects that February sales growth will be slower than previous months, as rising petrol prices divert purchases from other products such as clothing and furniture.“If gasoline prices continue to rise, this would mean less disposable income for other retail sectors,” said Michael McNamara, vice-president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. “If consumers cut back on driving, this could put pressure on categories such as the travel industry and some segments of the restaurant sector, while benefiting online retail.”Richard Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer, said that the company was trying to be strict about holding prices on its food products. However, he acknowledged that it was necessary to pass on the costs of rising commodity prices for certain items such as clothing and tin foil because of how dramatic the increases had been.“We recognise you’ve got to pass on increases, but we’re in a pretty good position to be able to delay that for short periods in some instances,” he said.

But he warned that “retailers and consumers are still facing some headwinds from a languishing housing market, as well as 9.4 per cent unemployment”.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the sales gain was “encouraging …and suggests relatively healthy underlying consumer demand”.The increasingly buoyant consumer mood was also reflected by SpendingPulse, the monthly survey from MasterCard Advisors, which estimated that clothing sales rose 6.2 per cent during January against a year ago.SpendingPulse, which bases its estimates on MasterCard card spending and estimates of other forms of payment, said luxury spending rose 6.1 per cent, and online sales rose 12 per cent.Store chains reporting better-than-expected numbers included Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, which saw sales at stores open at least a year increase by 24 per cent.Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret rose 35 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, also reported a better-than-expected 1 per cent increase in comparable sales against the same period a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in comparable sales, although Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said sales have been “restrained by the series of snowstorms that caused widespread store closures along the east coast and in the south-east”.Its online sales were up 27 per cent.JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, reported sales below Wall Street’s expectations, with JC Penney down 1.2 per cent and Kohl’s up 1.4 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said its comparable sales increase of 1.7 per cent was below its expectations, citing weakness in the north-east and south, regions affected by the bad weather.Costco, the warehouse club, said its same-store sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, rose 4 per cent.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report monthly sales data.

The largest US chemical company reported profits of $511m, or 37 cents a share, up from $172m, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were only slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts and so the shares were up 0.3 per cent to $36.74.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,307.11 after strong economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 12,062.26, its fourth consecutive session of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,753.88.Figures from the Labor Department showed that the number of j obless claims had fallen by 42,000 to 415,000 in the last week of January, surpassing the 31,000 drop forecast by economists.“Initial claims are trending down as the labour market recovers,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “We would expect the downtrend in claims to continue.”Data also showed that the productivity of US workers had unexpectedly risen in the fourth quarter. Separately, figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US service sector had seen strong growth in January, with the index moving 2.3 points higher to 59.4. A reading above 50 signals expansion.But market reaction to the statistics was muted as traders looked nervously at the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East after Yemen became the latest country to face anti-government protests.“The focus …seems to have turned towards Egypt because this higher ISM number is really strong (approaching a booming pace) but the market is simply not trading on it,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The retail sector was one of the leaders of the session after groups reported better than expected January sales.Limited Brands, parent of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported a 24 per cent increase in January same-store sales and revised up its fourth-quarter earnings guidance, sending the shares 7.4 per cent higher to $31.29. Zumiez, a speciality sports retailer, said January same-store sales had risen 15 per cent, sending the shares up 3.2 per cent to $24.39.Costco Wholesale, a warehouse retailer, rose 4.5 per cent to $74.03 after its same-store sales rose 9 per cent.Sally Beauty Holdings saw same-store sales up
6.8 per cent, but reported first-quarter earnings up 57 per cent, outstripping analysts’ estimates and sending the shares 13.8 per cent higher to $14.37.News that BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, was considering selling itself sent its shares up 12.2 per cent to $48.25.After the closing bell on Wednesday, News Corp, owner of Fox Broadcasting and Twentieth Century Fox, reported a doubling of second-quarter net income. Its shares gained 6 per cent at $16.96. The company reported second-quarter profit of $642m, or 24 cents per share, from $254m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, driven by higher TV subscriber fees and advertising sales.That came in spite of deep cuts at MySpace, which triggered a $275m charge to News Corp’s quarterly earnings. The group disclosed that rivals and financial groups from the US and elsewhere had shown interest in the site.Verizon Communications, the telecommunications provider, advanced 0.6 per cent to $36.38 after announcing it would buy back 100m of its shares.Kellogg, the maker of breakfast cereals, reported a 7.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, sending its shares up 4.3 per cent to $52.52. Gap rose 4.2 per cent to $19.83 after it forecast that its end of year profits would come in ahead of previous estimates.CVS Caremark, the second-largest US pharmacy chain, dropped 5 per cent to $32.92 after reporting weak fourth-quarter earnings."

The figures showed that underlying earnings, excluding one-off items, were 21 cents per share, beating the consensus forecast of 19 cents per share.Its shares, up 25.7 per cent since the start of December, fell 1.2 per cent to $16.30 on the news, as some traders used the news to book profits.The beginning of the results season also saw Apollo Group, the US education company that owns the University of Phoenix, gain 13.5 per cent to $40.74 after also posting forecast-beating first-quarter earnings. These gains in the stock followed a sharp 5.5 per cent loss in the previous session after it reported that new student enrolment had fallen by 42.4 per cent at the University of Phoenix.“Major operational and regulatory challenges remain, but we continue to rate the stock overweight as we see the risk/reward as favourable,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note following the results.The news from Apollo, a bellwether for the education sector, helped lift related stocks. Career Education was up 7.5 per cent to $20.01 while Corinthian Colleges gained 1.5 per cent to $4.65.In the retail sector, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, jumped 6.4 per cent to $75.03 after forecasting that its fourth-quarter profit would be well ahead of analysts’ expectations.It said profit, excluding store closures, restructuring and other items, will be between $3.39 and $4.12 per share compared with the $3.05 forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The news helped Walmart rise 1 per cent to $54.29 and Costco 0.8 per cent to $71.07.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher to 1,274.48, also lifted by news that Japan had committed to buy eurozone bonds to help reduce borrowing costs for vulnerable nations. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,716.83, a three-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 to 11,671.88.The Dow was helped particularly by gains from Hewlett-Packard, up 1.3 per cent to $45.43 after UBS raised its rating on the stock.Limiting gains on the US indices were losses from technology stocks AT&T and Verizon Wireless. AT&T fell 1.5 per cent to $27.91 after rival Verizon Wireless said that it would begin selling a version of Apple’s iPhone smartphone next month.AT&T had previously been the only network in the US on which the iPhone was available. The stock had lost 6.9 per cent in the past four sessions in expectation of the news. Verizon fell after the announcement, losing 1.6 per cent to $35.36. Overall, the S&P telecommunications index was down 1.5 per cent to 126.50 – one of the few indices to lose ground.Also in the technology sector, Advanced Micro Devices, which makes microchips and microprocessors, was down 9 per cent to $8.36 after announcing late on Monday that Dirk Meyer, chief executive, had resigned. Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer, was named as interim chief executive officer.In other results news, Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, posted earnings of 17 cents per share compared with the 6 cents predicted by analysts polled by FactSet Research. The results sent shares in the company up 7.1 per cent to $20.24.Energy stocks rose in the session as the US Energy Information Administration forecasted that crude oil would average at $93 a barrel this year.Halliburton, the second biggest oilfield services company in the world, was up 3.2 per cent to $39.38 while the S&P energy index rose 1.6 per cent to 515.12.Most of the stocks that were embroiled in deal activity in the previous session lost ground.Shares in IGate continued to fall back after the IT outsourcer announced that it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems.

108;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained.

The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.

It expects to report further details of its holiday sales on Thursday. Its shares rose almost 9 per cent to close at $15.42 in New York.Barnes & Noble’s digitally-driven gains come as Borders, the second-largest US book chain, is facing looming liquidity issues that it is seeking to resolve by negotiating new financing arrangements. Its shares fell sharply before New Year after it confirmed that it was delaying payments to some of its suppliers.Both retailers have struggled for several years against low-cost competition from Amazon and from discounters including Walmart, Costco and Target, while also facing growing challenges from the emerging market for e-books.But Barnes & Noble has taken a more aggressive approach to investing in establishing itself in the world of digital publishing, underpinned by the Nook, which it introduced in late 2009 as a challenger to Amazon’s successful Kindle reader.During the past year the retailer has substantially expanded its efforts to promote the Nook reader in its stores, creating special areas devoted to the reader with dedicated salespeople on hand to promote the product.It said at the end of December that the Nook had become its best selling product ever, without giving numbers. Amazon said in December that the latest model of the Kindle had also become its best selling item ever.Despite the strong growth of sales of the Nook and of digital books, sales at Barnes & Noble’s physical stores continued to slip last year, declining 3.3 per cent in the quarter ending October 30, while digital and online sales rose 59 per cent.The bookseller has also seen the costs of its digital initiatives weigh on its overall results, and is forecasting losses of between 75 cents and $1.15 per share for its current fiscal year, ending on May 31st. It has said that it expects sales of digital content will be running at a $400m annualised rate.Barnes & Noble is also currently reviewing a possible sale to private equity investors, possibly including its founder and chairman, Leonard Riggio.

Bennett LeBow, a tobacco billionaire who invested in Borders in May, holds a similar-sized stake, and serves as non-executive chairman.Both Borders and its rival Barnes & Noble have been losing business to Amazon, the online retailer, and to discounters including Walmart, Costco and Target.At the same time, both are seeking to bolster their digital and e-commerce business, with Barnes & Noble promoting its new Nook e-reader.Borders said in December that its quarterly losses almost doubled to $74.4m from the same period last year, while total sales fell 17.6 per cent to $470.9m. Comparable sales at its stores declined by 12.6 per cent, while e-commerce sales fell 8.6 per cent as it overhauled its website.

It grew to be one of the first nationwide retail chains after the first world war, becoming the country’s largest chain in the 1930s, when it had about 16,000 small stores.It runs a range of store names, including Food Emporium, Waldbaum’s and Pathmark, a chain that it acquired in 2008 for $1.3bn. The group, which had more than $8bn in sales last year, has recorded annual net losses since 2008 as it struggles against more nimble competitors such as Whole Foods Market, and low-price competition from the likes of Walmart, Costco and BJ’s Wholesale Club.Tengelmann, the German retail group, has been its largest shareholder since 1978. Ron Burkle, the California retail billionaire, has also been a significant shareholder in A&P, having been the largest shareholder in Pathmark before the merger.Regional grocery chains, most of which are unionised, have been struggling since the 1990s, when the emergence of discount chain Walmart led to a wave of industry consolidation.Basha’s, a privately held supermarket in Arizona that runs around 155 stores in the state, filed for bankruptcy last year.The news from A&P, one of the north-east’s best known supermarkets, comes as New York’s city council is preparing for a hearing on the impact of Walmart stores on small local businesses, as part of the union-led political opposition to the expansion of the Arkansas-based retailer in the city.Some Wall Street analysts have predicted that Walmart’s move to use smaller format stores to move into cities such as New York and Chicago will lead to a further wave of industry consolidation in the years ahead.

They are starting to unlock the purse strings a bit,” Mr Bines said.Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, underlined the continuing strength of demand from the wealthiest US consumers, with October’s comparable sales up 11.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, reported a 4.8 per cent increase in October same-store sales at its full-price stores.The figures released on Thursday followed the announcement of a strong quarterly performance last week from Coach, the handbag and leather accessories brand, which predicted double-digit sales increases in the holiday season.Blue Nile, the online jeweller, is also forecasting a holiday quarter sales rise of between 3 and 12 per cent.Overall October sales figures from US chain retailers presented a more mixed pattern, with the Retail Metrics monthly index rising 1.5 per cent, its smallest gain since April, with unseasonably warm weather weighing on clothing sales.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell in New York

Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4.7 per cent to $70.00 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 7 per cent to $103.89.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investment, said stocks could rally into the end of the year as diminished uncertainty after quantitative easing, the midterms and stabilising jobs and housing data helped investor confidence.“Cyclicals like energy and materials are very good suspects for leading markets [where as] financials have a lot of question marks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank,” he said.He added that natural resources stocks were soaring partly due to quantitative easing but also because of expectations that China would end its tightening cycle in the first half of next year.The financials rallied later in the session, up 3.4 per cent, after it was reported that the Federal Reserve might allow banks with strong capital levels to increase dividends. The two biggest banks by assets led the risers. Bank of America jumped 5.2 per cent to $12.12 and JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.5 per cent to $39.80.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.7 per cent, lifting the wider consumer discretionary sector by 1.6 per cent as retailers reported their October same-store sales.Gap, Target and Macy’s all beat expectations.

He cited strong back-to-school selling “coupled with attractive fall fashions, aggressive promotions and a near-record September stock market rise” as factors supporting the performance.Limited Brands, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works, reported a 12 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with margins up “significantly” as the company avoided the price-cutting promotions seen last year.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, said same store sales rose 4.8 per cent. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the back-to-school period was “one of our most successful in years”. He highlighted the performance of its Material Girl teen clothing collection, a joint venture with Madonna, and its American Rag clothing for teen boys.JC Penney said its sales rose 5.1 per cent, ahead of expectations. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales up 3 per cent. Kohl’s said on Wednesday that it would increase its temporary holiday staff hiring this year by 20 per cent, reflecting new store additions and increasing confidence in holiday demand.Luxury and high-end stores also performed well, with Neiman Marcus reporting same store sales up 4.7 per cent, Nordstrom up 7.5 per cent and Saks up 6.5 per cent.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the strong performance of higher-end spenders was “especially encouraging for the economy and the upcoming holiday-shopping season because the top 20 per cent of households by income account for nearly 40 per cent of total consumption”.Several teen and youth fashion retailers who have struggled over the past year with sluggish discretionary spending also fared better than expected. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 13 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Zumiez, a teen retailer, said its same store sales rose 17 per cent, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter. Buckle and Aeropostale both saw comparable sales up 3 per cent.But Target, the discount retailer, said its 1.3 per cent increase in comparable sales was lower than it had expected, despite being pleased with its back-to-school performance. Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, reported a 1 per cent drop in same store sales, saying that September had been more challenging that it had expected.Sales at its Gap stores in North America fell 1 per cent, despite efforts to draw sales with a large marketing focus on black denim pants that the company said would increase inventory levels. Gap’s lower-price Old Navy stores reported a 5 per cent drop.Costco, the warehouse club, said on Wednesday that its same store sales rose 5 per cent, also slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, although US store sales excluding fuel were slightly below forecasts, at 2 per cent.

Employment fell by 39,000 after a revised gain of 10,000 in August.On average, economists had forecast a rise of 20,000 although there had been a broad range of estimates.The report is watched by some investors as an indicator of what the government’s non-farm payrolls report could show on Friday. Economists had forecast a rise of 75,000 in private payrolls for Friday’s report. “[The figures] reinforce yet again that the recovery is not at this stage where it will be adding private-sector jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.But she said that the direction of the market could quickly change during the session as traders were watching the direction of the dollar, and considering the potential for another round of quantitative easing. She added that the Federal Reserve had made it clear that easing was dependent on the employment picture.Technology shares led the fallers, dragging the Nasdaq down, after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded semiconductors to “underweight” because of fears of a slowdown in demand in Asia.The S&P 500 technology index lost 0.6 per cent with the semiconductor index declining 1.6 per cent.

118;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-10-05T02:23:50Z;Spending can be better than giving;;From Mr Edward Vale.Sir, There is suggestion implicit in John Woods’ letter (October 4) that it is despicable for the top earners not to give a high proportion of their wealth to charity. He quotes a senior former banker in support of this view. Well, I disagree, not necessarily with the moral aspect of the sentiment, but certainly with both the element of coercion and the mistaken acceptance that giving money away is somehow more beneficial to society than spending it.Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman, is quoted as saying recently: “I believe Costco does more for civilisation than the Rockefeller Foundation …I think it’s a better place. When you get a bunch of very intelligent people sitting around trying to do good, I immediately get kind of suspicious and squirm in my seat.”Spending private money on goods and services, even if to make £1,000 handbags or marble bathrooms, is surely the best way to provide employment and enable the private sector to increase its profits, and of course its tax contribution. Charities and other forms of giving are more often than not merely subsidies, which I would submit are far less efficient ways of helping those who need it.Edward Vale,London SW19, UK
119;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-09-20T20:14:22Z;Boost for Burkle in battle at Barnes & Noble;;Ron Burkle, the billionaire retail investor, has scored a victory in his battle for board seats at Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller, winning the support of Institutional Shareholder Services, the most influential US shareholder advisory service.ISS said on Monday that shareholders should vote for Mr Burkle and two other dissidents at the retailer’s annual meeting next week, over a slate that includes Leonard Riggio, the company’s chairman and founder.It argued that Mr Burkle’s Yucaipa funds had raised legitimate questions about the bookseller’s financial performance and about the corporate governance standards under Mr Riggio, who together with his brother Stephen holds more than 34 per cent of the company’s shares.“We believe the dissidents have demonstrated a compelling case that change in the Barnes & Noble board is warranted,” it said.Barnes & Noble said it was “astounded” the ISS recommendation, and that Mr Burkle and his nominees – Stephen Bollenbach and Michael McQuary – “have offered no positive ideas or strategy to build value for Barnes & Noble shareholders”.“While ISS has a track record of supporting dissidents, we believe its analysis is flawed,” the bookseller said.Two smaller proxy firms, Glass Lewis and Egan Jones, have both recommended that shareholders support the Barnes & Noble board.Barnes & Noble is struggling to reposition its business amid the upheaval created by the emergence of the digital book market, and from intense competition in the physical book business from rivals including Amazon, the online retailer, and discounters including Walmart and Costco.The ISS recommendation focused on performance and governance issues at the bookseller, rather than on the board’s argument that Mr Burkle is seeking to acquire control of the company without paying a premium for control through an informal alliance with Aletheia, a Los Angeles-based investment fund run by Peter Eichler.Yucaipa owns just less than 20 per cent of the bookseller, while Aletheia, which has invested alongside Mr Burkle in the past, holds around 15 per cent. Yucaipa, which has denied any interest in acquiring control, is also proposing raising the limits on a poison pill provision, limiting shareholder stakes, from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.Yucaipa welcomed the ISS recommendation, saying “we have said all along that we believe Barnes & Noble is significantly undervalued and that the right changes can unlock significant value for the benefit of all stockholders”.

Economists had forecast an increase to 475,000 from a previously reported 473,000.“Thank heavens for small mercies,” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.He said the rises in jobless claims might have been because of changes in legislation authorising people to renew their benefits.“It would take a sustained move above 500,000 in claims to signal that the economy might be slipping back into recession,” he said.“However, even if claims fall back into the 450,000 area – as we judge likely over the coming weeks – they would still be at a level that historically has not been consistent with solid job creation.”Pending home sales increased unexpectedly in July, rising 5.2 per cent compared with the consensus forecast for a 1 per cent decline.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 2.2 per cent with DR Hortonleading the risers, gaining 2.5 per cent to $10.98. Home improvement retailers, which are heavily dependent on the housing market, also rose with Lowe’s up 3.3 per cent to $21.94.Factory orders edged up 0.1 per cent in July after declines in May and June.Most retailers reporting same-store sales from August – the key back-to-school season – beat analyst expectations.The S&P 500 retailers index climbed 1.9 per cent, pushing up the wider S&P 500 consumer discretionary index by 1.8 per cent.Costco, the largest US warehouse club operator, reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store sales in August, excluding gasoline.

121;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-07-08T22:11:43Z;Patchy spending paints mixed US retail picture;;Consumer spending at large department stores in June was relatively strong, but sales at other store chains in the US remained patchy and uncertain, according to monthly sales data from a variety of retailers compiled by Retail Metrics.In June, which benefited from a late Memorial Day weekend, same-store sales at large department stores were up 6.1 per cent on the year before, paced by strong volume at Nordstrom, and better-than-expected sales at Macy’s, Dillards, Saks and JC Penney.Still, the relatively strong performance in one sector was undercut by the low bar set by last year’s results. For department stores in general, June 2009 saw double-digit sales declines compared with the previous year.In other retail sectors, sales of teen apparel outperformed estimates, while sales at large discount chains, such as Costco, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Target, inched up over last year’s totals, disappointed observers who thought discount sales would be robust.Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president, said the aggregate June sales, like the results from April and May, fell short of expectations. “It was supposed to be a significant improvement from the soft results in April and May,” he said. “We had a later Memorial Day holiday in June, which boosted sales, but by the middle of the month things tailed off and sales were not particularly strong.”Consumers are still recovering from a shopping “binge” in the first quarter of the year, said Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup. Strong sales in March, which suggested that consumers might be ready for a return to their free-spending ways, turned out to have been a false indicator, she said.“The feeling is that you had this binge where consumers starved themselves in 2008 and 2009, and they started to spend a little bit more,” she said. “But sales for June are probably going to be a little weaker than anticipated. Now we’re getting questions about a double dip.”The June results are important, Ms Weinswig said, because for many retailers, June is the middle month of the quarter and its results will determine whether earnings will be strong, or whether they will have to resort to significant discounting to offload inventory in July.A swoon in the stock market seems to have affected luxury sales in June, according to SpendingPulse, a forecasting unit of MasterCard which combines transactional data from the credit card company with survey-based estimates for other forms of payments.For the most part, luxury purchases have outperformed general retail sales, said Michael McNamara, vice-president of research and analysis for SpendingPulse.“In June, for the first time in 2010, there was a decline in year-over-year sales in the luxury sector,” he said. “This was the first decline since November 2009. The performance of the luxury sector is closely tied to the performance of the capital markets.”

However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22. The leading tax preparer said Russell P. Smyth resigned as chief executive. Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.

It hopes to complete the float later this month.“Clearly it’s not helpful,” said Greg Lawless, analyst at Collins Stewart. “But from an initial view it appears more like Costco than Ocado.”Marks and Spencer uses Amazon to run its online shopping site. It has yet to develop a full food offering online, but this is expected to be one of the initiatives spearheaded by its new chief executive Marc Bolland.Analysts at Investec recently called on M&S to drop Amazon and team up with Ocado, but this has been scuppered by Ocado’s new and exclusive 10-year deal with Waitrose.Ocado on Wednesday declined to comment on Amazon’s move. But people close to the company shrugged off the potential threat, indicating that Amazon would not be able to provide a weekly shop, consolidated into one delivery, to be dispatched in a one-hour time slot, as Ocado does.They said Amazon’s move highlighted the attractiveness of the online grocery market. “It just shows that this is an exciting sector and they think it is worth going into,” said one person familiar with the situation.Amazon said customers would be able to order goods via the company from third-party vendors, which would be dispatched separately. However, customers ordering directly from Amazon could have items consolidated into one delivery.“It is early days for the grocery store, and we will continue to work on expanding selection for our customers,” Amazon said.Ocado said on Tuesday that it would press ahead with its initial public offering, which will see shares in the company priced at between 200p and 275p, valuing the equity at between £800m and £1.1bn.The float has divided opinion in the City because Ocado has yet to make an operating profit. In its prospectus published on Tuesday, Ocado highlighted competition from traditional supermarkets and other online grocers as a potential risk, but did not mention Amazon.

Analysts said programme trades may have exacerbated the fall.At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was down about 4 per cent to 1,120, and then plunged to its intraday low of 8.6 per cent.Tom Schrader, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus, says that once stocks reached 1,200, it triggered computer programmes that were set up to sell off at that level.“There is the possibility of some programme trades going wrong, and trades being executed in error.”“Liquidity at that point was thin, exacerbating the drop,” he added.Rich Adamonis, spokesman at NYSE Euronext, said: “There were a number of erroneous trades…Nasdaq is investigating.”At the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 3.2 per cent to 1,128.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.2 per cent to 10,520.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3.4 per cent lower at 2,319.64.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility rocketed up 39.1 per cent to $34.65, its biggest one-day change since February 2007.An unusual move in the Procter & Gamble share price, with the stock dropping to $39.37 from about $62 in a matter of minutes was being investigated by Nasdaq as trading error.

Aeropostale sales fell 5 per cent and its shares lost 6.7 per cent to $27.66.Gap fell 7.2 per cent to $22.91 after its sales fell 3 per cent; analysts were looking for a 1.3 per cent rise on average.Shares in Nordstrom, the high-end department store chain, pulled back 2.3 per cent to $42.49 even as its sales beat expectations to rise 7.5 per cent in the quarter. Rival Macy’s edged 3.5 per cent lower to $22.42 even after it reported a 1.1 per cent increase in same-store sales last month, exceeding its own and analyst forecasts.The company also raised its first-quarter profit forecast to 4 cents per share, excluding some items, compared with the average analyst estimate of 2 cents per share.Warehouse club operator Costco tumbled 3.9 per cent to $58.03 after its April sales data came in slightly lower than expected, rising 11 per cent versus average analyst estimates of a gain of 11.2 per cent.Americold Realty Trust, a warehouse operator owned by billionaire Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos, postponed its $660m initial public offering after slashing the mid-point price by 33 per cent.The offering, which was expected to be the year’s largest US listing, was originally priced at about double the average valuation of property firms worldwide.Internet stocks were in focus as the Federal Communications Commission said it would seek stronger authority to regulate companies that provide internet access after a recent court ruling reduced its powers.Cable operator Comcast and phone company AT&T have both warned that more regulation could damp investment.

130;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-05-06T16:47:47Z;US same-store sales disappoint;;US retailers on Thursday reported April same-store sales below expectations, but which overall confirmed an ongoing rebound in consumer spending.Sales rose 0.5 per cent in April at stores open for more than a year, according to a Thomson Reuters compilation of figures, short of the estimate of 1.7 per cent growth.The disappointment was not a surprise, due to poor weather in April and a shift of spending toward March because of an early Easter holiday.Discount general retailer Costco reported an 11 per cent gain, due in part to higher fuel prices, but missed expectations of a 11.2 per cent rise.“The bounce in the business that began last summer seems to be cooling as demand is satiated for televisions, and consumers ever so lightly migrate back to the likes of Target and specialty retailers given improved economic conditions,” said Brian Sozzi, of forecasting firm Wall Street Strategies.Target sales dropped 5.9 per cent in April, versus a forecast of a 2.3 per cent drop. But it also reported that a combined March-April rise of 3 per cent was its best sales jump in two years.Speciality were hit hard. Gap sales fell 3 per cent, while they had been expected to grow 1 per cent. Abercrombie & Fitch sales fell 8 per cent in April, well past its 2 per cent forecasted decline.Off-price clothing stores reported higher sales, though they also missed forecasts. Ross Stores reported a 3 per cent jump, and TJX rose 4 per cent.A few stores did exceed expectations, notably higher-end retailers. Nordstrom jumped 7.5 per cent, versus a 6.5 per cent forecast. Limited Brands reported a 4 per cent rise against expected flat growth.The rise in sales matches an uptick in consumption generally. First quarter US consumer spending rose 0.6 per cent, and personal consumption represented 2.6 percentage points of the first-quarter GDP growth figure of 3.2 per cent.“The trend is still upwards, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride,” said Julia Coronado, senior US economist at BNP Paribas. “There will be less government support for incomes going forward, but we are starting to see the labour market turn the corner.”The US is expected to have added jobs again in April, which would provide support for shoppers. The forecast is that Friday’s non-farm payroll figures will show growth of 189,000 jobs.

132;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-04-06T22:00:24Z;Two men and a baby business;Friends’ online brand with focus on delivery;When Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara launched Diapers.com, a US e-commerce website selling nappies and a few other baby products in 2005, one of the biggest challenges was getting hold of the goods. As a small, unknown start-up, says Mr Lore, “we couldn’t buy direct from the manufacturers, so we had to buy from Costco and BJ’s [the discount, bulk-sales warehouse clubs]”.The high school friends started by picking up supplies in a car, before upgrading to an open-backed truck, a van and an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. “We cleared out BJ’s stores up and down the east coast,” Mr Lore says. “The managers would ask us to leave some for the rest of their customers.”Even when sourcing from discount clubs, the high shipping costs on bulky boxes of disposable nappies meant the fledgling company was losing money when it met orders. But demand was so high that the two entrepreneurs took it as a sign that their project was going to work.They came to the venture with previous experience of launching businesses. After college, Mr Lore became a banker, working in London at Credit Suisse First Boston and at Japan’s Sanwa Bank. Mr Bharara became a lawyer with Cahill, Gordon & Reindel in New York and worked on the distribution of the $1.25bn (€935m, £820m) settlement bet­ween Swiss banks and victims of the Holocaust. But in 2000, they left their jobs to launch ThePit.com, an online marketplace for collectables, which they sold a year later to Topps, the entertainment company best known for its baseball cards. Both worked at Topps before deciding to launch another start-up.“We came across the baby market,” says Mr Lore, chief executive of Quidsi, the parent company that owns the Diapers.com site. “It was a $40bn market and incredibly fragmented online, with lots of players but no number-one brand. So we thought: ‘We need to build a brand, and not do it by beating rivals on keyword marketing [to attract internet searches].’ ”Instead, says Mr Bharara, they focused on developing “killer” backroom logistics and high levels of customer service focused on their specialised category. The plan was to attract a loyal customer base with the efficient shipping of low-margin products such as nappies and wipes, promising “fast service and no headaches”, before introducing higher margin baby products, such as cribs, strollers and carseats to an audience that would by now trust the brand.Five years on, Diapers.com is forecasting sales of about $275m in the 12 months to March, making it one of the top US “pure play” e-commerce sites not associated with a traditional retailer, and one of the fastest growing. “We think we can continue to double our sales annually for the next three to five years,” says Mr Bharara, who serves as chief operating officer of Quidsi.The company has yet to record a profit as it continues to invest heavily in marketing and expansion, although it has raised more than $50m in commitments, including $30m in a financing round last year led by New Enterprise Associates, the venture capital group. But with leading baby product brands such as Huggies and Pampers now on board – after many rebuffs including scores of frustrating phone-calls – the pair no longer have to worry about where the next nappy is coming from.Their new challenge is that the site now faces a range of competitors eager to attack its first-mover advantage. Walmart, the largest retailer, started shipping baby products from its website last year. Procter & Gambles now testing selling its Pampers brand from its own direct-shipping e-commerce site. Diapers.com’s free shipping offers are matched by CVS and Walgreens, US national drugstores.Mr Lore and Mr Bharara argue that their business has built-in strengths that will enable it to fight off rivals. Although it trawled the eastern US seaboard in a truck initially, the start-up focused on developing logistics that were low-cost and fast, enabling it to keep customers with the lure of next-day delivery in most of the US while keeping down costs.The first $4m raised from outside investors was spent on new systems – rather than marketing – including developing Boxem, a proprietary software program that calculates the most efficient of 23 available box sizes for any order. In addition, recruitment has benefited from the company being based in Montclair, New Jersey, making it one of the few e-commerce companies hiring on the east coast. It now has, for example, a disproportionate number of Harvard MBAs in top management and working in the “special ops” unit that is entirely focused on ways to improve back-office logistics.In September 2008, Diapers.com also became one of the first US retailers to switch its distribution centres to a robotic order fulfilment system developed by Kiva Systems, that is now also used by Staples, the office supplies retailer, and Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store.At the other end of the business, the company set up its own customer-service operation rather than subcontract it to third parties. It also hired staff, says Mr Lore, who were “empathetic” over those with experience. “They are empowered to help the customer at any cost,” he says.The company’s customer-service narrative includes an anecdote in which the associate director of customer marketing personally delivers nappies from the headquarters in New Jersey to a young mother at a hotel in Manhattan.Since 2008 the site has been making the transition from consumables, such as nappies and wipes, to include “everything baby”, with new products such as $389 jogging strollers and $229 cribs. Its product range has passed a target of 15,000 different productsand will reach 60,000 by the end of this year, with a target of 120,000 at the end of 2011 – roughly equivalent to the entire stock assortment of a Walmart superstore. They claim the site has become the biggest online seller of infant carseats and sells four times as many disposable nappies as Amazon.Although reluctant to go into detail, the two entrepreneurs are now preparing an attempt to repeat the success of Diapers.com with plans for additional sites, including a beauty and health website, which will see the number of employees double by the end of 2011 to about 600.Meanwhile, Mr Lore and Mr Bharara remain sanguine about the outlook for Diapers.com: “We don’t think anyone is going to be more effective.”

As production manager at Unique Collection, a rose farm in the sierra, north of Bogotá, he understands the selling power of special occasions.Unique Collection sells 65 per cent of its roses to Russia, 20 per cent to the US and the rest between Hungary, Belgium, the UK, Taiwan, Ukraine and Japan.“The Russians love long stem roses,” he says. “The longer the stems, the bigger the price.”The company is an exception in a sector that since its beginnings 40 years ago has been geared towards the US, which, with a common time zone and high disposable income, is a natural market.Eighty per cent of US flower imports come from Colombia, including many of the bunches shoppers pick up in Whole Foods, Walmart, and Costco. On Valentine’s Day, the biggest day in the US flower-selling calendar, Bogotá’s international cargo airport thrums with the sound of 28 jumbo jets laden with blooms.“The flower industry here is a success story of a relationship between the US and Colombia, and it’s a success story of the trade preferences given by the US and by the European Union,” says Augusto Solano, president of Asocolflores, the industry’s representative body.Recession in the US has underscored the need for diversification, however, and the industry is monitoring the progress of a pending trade agreement with Korea.A much-vaunted deal with the US is also seen as being very important, as the current Andean Trade Preference Act lapses each year, making it difficult to secure long-term contracts.Europe is an enticing market for Colombia, which is the second biggest exporter of flowers after the Netherlands. While US consumers spend about €26 ($35) a year on blooms, the Swiss and Norwegians fork out €100 ($135) a year.Colombia’s flower growers are a notoriously secretive bunch, but Mr Solano says some 78 per cent of exports go to the US, 5 per cent to Russia, 4 per cent to the UK and 2 per cent each to Japan, Spain, Holland and Canada.After seven years of rapid currency appreciation, the industry’s family-owned companies have had to improve efficiency and innovate to survive. Many have experimented with growing aromatic herbs and crops such as blueberries, or sought logistical improvements, such as increasing the volume of direct flights to new markets.Even so, the sector has lost 26,000 jobs in the past four years, Mr Solano says.“The main benefit of this industry for the country is generation of labour,” he says. “We’re talking about close to 200,000 people in direct and indirect jobs. About 1m Colombians depend on flowers. And these are all formal jobs.”The industry has been vocal in its concerns about currency appreciation, although Mr Solano acknowledges the peso is unlikely to reverse its trend in the near future.Up in the cool climes of the Unique Collection farm, Mr Balboa and his team are optimistic, despite a price drop of 5 per cent at “the worst moment” in 2009. The company began in 2003 with 10 workers and four greenhouses, and today 187 people work in 24 greenhouses in Colombia and Ecuador. It has targeted Germany as a market, has invested in an anti-frost irrigation system and plans to acquire more land to cope with demand.

The administrative assistant is 46, has years of experience in the workplace and was willing to try something new.Selling life insurance seemed her best option but every employer she approached insisted on a month of unpaid training. Ms Holm signed on with one company only to be told she would have to commute 100 miles even for that. To this day, she is unemployed, has no health insurance, lives on $750 in government unemployment assistance every two weeks and has few job prospects.“I’m barely able to scrape by, paying for bills and my apartment.’’Ms Holm is far from alone. The average duration of unemployment is at its highest level since the second world war.Yet Jamie Belinne, assistant dean at the University of Houston Rockwell Career Center, said she was seeing a measured improvement, following the trend of the two other recessions she had studied.“The drop-off tends to be sudden and extreme, but the improvement is slow and gradual,’’ Ms Belinne said.The Career Center has this week opened a new interview facility and today 15 of the 18 rooms are booked. “That, to me, is a great sign. It’s kind of like the first shoots of spring coming out of the ground,’’ Ms Belinne said.That said, there are many people like Ms Holm who are still in the thick of the downturn. It has taken a toll on the Houston psyche, despite the city having held up better than most.Stephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University, conducts an annual survey on Houston and found in 2009 that the number of respondents who named the economy as “the biggest problem facing people in the Houston area today” shot up to 44 per cent from 15 per cent in 2008, as the official unemployment rate in Harris County grew from 4.1 per cent to 6.3 per cent.“I was floundering, trying to decide what to do next,’’ Ms Holm says. “Finally my boyfriend said, ‘You’re good at back massages. You should do that for a living.’ ’’ This month she started at a masseuse school.From time to time, she is offered catering work but, any time she does get some shifts, the government deducts whatever she earns from her unemployment cheque and then delays the payment. It isn’t worth the trouble, she says.“Why try to work?’’ Ms Holm says.But she is only eligible for $9,000 in handouts. “I’m really scared to get off unemployment.”She cannot afford a dentist, nor a doctor to take out a fibroid tumour on her ovary. And while she knows others have found a way to get health coverage for free, she is unsure how to do that.“When you’re a middle-class person facing unemployment, you’re not familiar with the benefits available to people who have dealt with poverty for a long time.’’She buys her food and paper products in bulk at dollar stores or at Costco, the big discount chain, she rents movies from the dollar box outside supermarkets, and colours her own hair.“I would like to get working again, for the routine, to stop having to juggle the bills,” she says.
135;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-03-04T00:17:16Z;Starbucks to sell instant coffee across UK;;Starbucks will roll out Via, its instant coffee mix, across the UK starting next week and launch the product in Japan next month, signalling the company’s belief that soluble coffee will be a platform for international growth.Starting on Monday, Via will be available in the UK’s 700 plus stores.The decision to introduce the product in Britain comes after a test marketing programme in 32 Starbucks stores in London’s West End last year delivered positive results.“This almost took us by surprise, the extent to which Via exceeded its targets last year,” Brian Waring, the company’s marketing director in the UK, said.Mr Waring said that initial sales showed customers buying triple packs instead of 12-packs, presumably for the purposes of trial.By the end of the year, sales of 12-packs accounted for 80 per cent of unit purchases.“That demonstrated to us that the consumer response and satisfaction was driving demand and repeat purchase,” he said.The Seattle-based coffee group tested Via in select North American markets last year before rolling it out across the US in October.Via sales accounted for about half of the group’s 4 per cent jump in same-store sales for the most recent quarter, or about $35m.In the US, Via is sold at more than 25,000 sites including Costco and Target as well as Starbucks stores.In Japan, Starbucks is skipping the test marketing programme and going straight to launch on April 14 across the country’s 875 stores.Japan is considered a strong market for instant coffee since it accounts for approximately $2.9bn of the category’s $21bn in annual sales.“This is a category that hasn’t had a significant innovation in half a century,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said in an interview.When the product was first tested in the US last year, critics declared that Starbucks’ introduction of instant coffee was a sign of desperation from a company that had stumbled by opening too many stores.Mr Schultz, who returned from retirement two years ago to right the company, said he was satisfied that Starbucks had solved the challenge of how to create an instant coffee that tasted good.“I knew intuitively that Via would be a winner,” he said.Taking a page out of the US playbook, Mr Waring said Starbucks would use a taste test to promote trial of Via across the UK between March 12 and 15.A similar challenge in the US last year is credited with boosting sales of Via in the quarter ended December 31 2009.Traditionally, Starbucks has not spent much on advertising, but Mr Waring said the company planned to promote the UK launch of Via with advertisements in newspapers, on radio and in digital media.

The economy lost 20,000 jobs last month, said ADP Employer Services, a private monitoring company on Wednesday. Job losses during January were revised to 60,000 from an initial estimate of 22,000.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,118.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 10,396.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,280.68.Pfizer inched down 1.6 per cent to $17.32 on reports that the pharmaceutical group could make an offer worth about $4.08bn for Ratiopharm, the generic drugmaker.The stock was also under pressure following news that Dimebon, the Alzheimer’s disease drug it jointly developed with Medivation, did not meet targets in a late-stage trial.Medivation shares fell 67.5 per cent to $13.10.Novell rose 28 per cent to $6.08 after the software company received an unsolicited $2bn buy-out offer from hedge fund Elliott Associates.

The total hit to revenues from flight suspensions in February was $30m, the company said.“The revenue environment continues to show material signs of improvement with corporate booked revenue up more than 35 per cent on a year-on-year basis,” said Scott Kirby, US Airways president.Continental Airlines reported strong February traffic figures on Monday. Nevertheless its shares have fallen 0.4 per cent to $20.60 so far this week.United Airlines gained 2.1 per cent to $18.25 while Delta Airlines gained 1.2 per cent to $12.93.Costco lost 1.4 per cent to $60.68 after the largest US warehouse-club chain reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations.However, sales in stores that have been open for at least a year rose 9 per cent in February, aided by stronger petrol prices and international sales.Rival BJs Wholesale Club was one of the biggest fallers in the small-cap Russell 1000 index. It lost 5.1 per cent to $34.61 after the company announced lower full-year forecasts than analysts had expected.Walgreen gained 0.3 per cent to $35.36 in spite of the company reporting February same-store sales that missed average estimates. However, the US drugstore chain showed its first monthly rise in same-store sales since November.Joy Global gained 5.9 per cent to $54.51 after the mining equipment maker reported first-quarter results that surpassed expectations, helped by strength in the global commodities markets. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast.“We continue to see strength in the international and emerging markets for all commodities, and the US thermal coal market is correcting faster than expected,” said Mike Sutherlin, Joy Global’s chief executive.Blackstone Group gained 0.9 per cent to $14.23 as the stock was upgraded by analysts at Oppenheimer to “outperform” from “market perform”.Shares in Merck were 0.5 per cent lower at $37.21 in spite of the company reporting positive results of a late-stage trial of its drug to treat grass pollen allergies in children.In the media sector VisionChina Media, an operator of mobile digital advertising networks in China, fell 38 per cent to $5.09 after several brokers downgraded the stock following disappointing first-quarter earnings.Piper Jaffray cut its rating to “neutral” from “overweight” while Susquehanna reduced it to “negative” from “neutral”.
137;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-02-07T19:40:42Z;Investors trust in happy end to US book drama;;Barnes & Noble and Borders, the two US national bookstore chains, have both been struggling to attract customers amid changes in book-buying habits. However, they have had more luck with activist investors.In the middle of uncertainties about the future of the sector, Ron Burkle, the California billionaire, announced last month that his Yucaipa funds held a 19 per cent stake in B&N. Another California fund, Aletheia, which is headed by Peter Eichler, has simultaneously expanded its stake over the past year to 15 per cent.At smaller rival Borders, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square has held a controlling 34 per cent for more than a year, a stake steadily built since late 2006.Mr Ackman has continued to argue that Borders has a future, even as it suffers losses and a fall in its shares to about $1 from more than $20 when he first invested in the company.Mr Burkle indicated last week that he wanted to own even more of B&N, and to challenge its management, which is headed by Len Riggio, the founder and chairman who in the 1980s and 1990s led the superstore revolution in US bookselling.The developing bookstore drama is “the clash of the Titans, in terms of the actors and the personalities”, according to David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. And it is unfolding as the wider industry is focused on a dispute between online bookseller Amazon and publisher Macmillan over the pricing of e-books.Mr Schick says that the e-books challenge is just a small part of the “massive, massive problems” the two established booksellers have been facing.Poor holiday sales continued a decline that reflects intense competition not just from Amazon but also from Walmart, Target and Costco’s discount stores, which have taken a large slice out of bestseller sales.The presence of the big-name investors reflects the drastic nature of the investment proposition in physical bookstores. The stores still deliver cashflow in spite of their falling sales but risk following music store chains such as Tower Records, Virgin Megastores and Sam Goody on the road to oblivion.“These are big questions,” says Mr Schick. “And you get these big players around who are prepared to make big $500m bets.”Mr Burkle has in the past targeted his investment on consolidating retail sectors, as with his stake in Wild Oats, the natural and organic supermarket chain, before it was bought by Whole Foods in 2007, and also in Pathmark, a regional supermarket that was bought by A&P supermarkets in 2007.Mr Ackman has suggested that Borders could end up acquired by B&N, or even by Amazon to add a bricks-and-mortar store component to its online business.However, when Borders indicated in 2008 that it was prepared to consider a sale of its business, Mr Riggio at B&N did not respond.If Mr Riggio hopes B&N can profit from Border’s eventual demise, Mr Ackman insisted this week that, in spite of continuing losses at Borders, a bankruptcy was unlikely.“Ultimately, this industry may consolidate – the two companies may become one, or [Borders] may stay on its own,” he told CNBC, also leaving in a third possibility: that the entire bookstore model could collapse.

Blu-ray is finally starting to make significant advances,” says Michelle Abraham, In-Stat analyst.Blu-ray’s extra features may be enough to persuade consumers to choose its players over DVD ones at these kinds of prices.Watching a Blu-ray movie on Saturday night on a PlayStation 3, I was also able to see extra content updated over the internet. The picture quality is obviously better and services such as Netflix movie and YouTube streaming are becoming common on even the cheapest units.

Some also encourage customers to send in items for recycling that it assesses as having no resale value by providing free shipping labels.Dealtree resells refurbished products on a separate web auction site, Cowboom.com, while Gazelle, which works with Walmart and Sears, says it uses a range of retail and wholesale outlets to resell returned products.Amazon entered the trade-in market in March last year, with the launch of its own online trade-in service for used video games.Similar video-game buy-back ventures had previously been launched by Best Buy and Walmart, which were in turn following the early success in the second-hand business of GameStop, the computer video game store chain.Amazon subsequently extended the service to include DVDs, and in December started buying back and reselling college text books.Amazon reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, with analysts expecting it to report its sales to have surged more than 30 per cent to about $9bn.
140;COST;Costco Wholesale;2010-01-08T23:00:18Z;Best Buy’s sales up 9.3% in December;;Best Buy, the dominant US electronics retailer, reported a 9.3 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores in December, as consumers’ holiday enthusiasm for “must have“ items such as smartphones and computers defied their broader economic concerns.The strong performance outstripped the better-than-expected average 3 per cent comparable sales growth seen by other leading US retailers that reported December sales numbers on Thursday.Best Buy’s US online sales grew by 34 per cent, while total US sales increased 13 per cent to $6.7bn. Sales overall, including its stores in China and its joint venture in Europe with the UK’s Carphone Warehouse, also rose 13 per cent to $8.5bn for the month.In the US, the retailer’s strong sales growth was supported by the demise of Circuit City, its former US rival, which liquidated its 537 stores in January last year.But it also reflected strong demand from shoppers for notebook computers and mobile phones, which resulted in Best Buy’s home office category seeing a 28.5 per cent comparable-store sales increase.Sales in its consumer electronics category, which includes home entertainment, were boosted by strong sales of flat-screen televisions, in spite of the impact of lower unit costs.On Thursday, Costco, the warehouse club retailer, said it had seen unit sales of TVs up 15 per cent in December, although lower prices led to an overall decline in total sales value.Best Buy’s emerging appliances category experienced a 16.2 per cent comparable-store sales increase, contrasting with the sales declines reported on Thursday by Sears, the department store, that sells Kenmore, the leading US home appliance brand.Sales of entertainment software, DVDs and CDs declined 0.6 per cent, with increases in gaming being more than offset by continued decreases in music and films.The strength in gaming at Best Buy underlined the poor performance of its rival GameStop during the holiday period, which saw comparable sales at its more than 6,000 stores fall 8.6 per cent in November and December. GameStop blamed the economy, bad winter weather and unexpected shortages of new gaming consoles.Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse, argued in a note to clients that Best Buy was well positioned for the coming year, given its focus on educating customers on the increasingly interconnected emerging consumer devices, and from new products such as 3-D televisions and e-readers.”We envision a role for a retailer that can explain these products and Best Buy has become the only one in that position,” he said ina note to clients.

Separate data showed that the US trade deficit had also unexpectedly narrowed to $32.9bn.“The market is acting positively because of the trade balance but the real movement will probably come [today] on the retail sales numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust. Data is expected to show that retail sales growth, excluding cars and petrol, has slowed slightly to 0.2 per cent in November.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,102.35, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 10,405.83. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,190.86.Concerns over the restructuring of Dubai World, Greece’s downgrade and the revision of Spain’s outlook had weighed on the market this week.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Some of the fears surrounding sovereign debt continue to ease for now, although lingering concerns over debt issues and treaty negotiations may continue to overhang the market in coming sessions.”The consumer discretionary sector also helped push the market higher throughout the day. AOL, the internet group, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, drawing to a close its controversial links with Time Warner.In 2000, AOL bought Time Warner, one of the world’s largest producers of entertainment and news. The acquisition ended up destroying more than $100bn in shareholder value and came to epitomise the excesses of the dot com era.Time Warner climbed 4.2 per cent to $30.45 on Thursday but AOL was less popular, falling 0.6 per cent to $23.52 in its trading debut.Gannett, which publishes USA Today, jumped 7 per cent to $12.84 after the group said profits from the fourth quarter would be higher than analyst estimates due to an improvement in advertising revenues.Dollar weakness lifted commodity-based groups higher in early trading. But even after the dollar flattened, Chevron closed up 0.5 per cent to $77.42 and Peabody Energy gained 2.1 per cent to $43.01.Anadarko Petroleum also rose 2 per cent to $58.23 after the oil and gas producer announced a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.Citigroup was in focus after it emerged that the bank was in advanced talks with regulators over plans to raise more than $15bn in an equity offering.

A total of 338 turbines are to be built at the the Shepherds Flat wind farm in Oregon by 2012. After early strength, the group’s shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $15.61.United Technologies, which makes power generation equipment, bought a 49.5 per cent stake in Clipper Windpower, the British wind-turbine maker. United shares were up 0.8 per cent to $67.93.In the retail sector, shares in Costco Wholesale edged 0.2 per cent higher to $58.76 after strong international sales helped the group increase profits. The weaker dollar helped flatten its sales abroad, compensating for declining revenues from its petrol stations.Dollar General, the recently listed discount chain, fell 1.3 per cent to $23.70 after the group swung to a profit in the third quarter but disappointed analysts’ estimates. Budget retailers operating at the very bottom of the market such as Dollar General, which sells a quarter of its stock for less than $1, have thrived in the recession.The company, which was bought by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007, went public last month. The offering raised $716m and ranked as largest US retail IPO in more than 12 years. Since its listing, the shares have risen more than 10 per cent.
142;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-12-10T00:12:59Z;Dozens more accused in other cases;;If not for Bernard Madoff, men such as Thomas Petters and Scott Rothstein would probably be household names. They are among the dozens of individuals who prosecutors recently have accused of running “Ponzi” schemes cheating investors out of billions of dollars.A jury last week found Mr Petters, a Minnesota businessman, guilty of orchestrating a $3.65bn Ponzi scheme from at least 1995. The scheme involved inducing investors to lend him and other people money to purchase merchandise such as electronic goods to be resold at a profit to retailers such as Costco and Sam’s Club.Prosecutors said the scheme, which paid off early investors with money from newer arrivals, was used in part to fund Mr Petters’ lavish lifestyle. In one of the tape-recorded conversations played during his trial, Mr Petters was heard saying the purchase orders were “fake” and claiming “divine intervention” was the only explanation for how he and others “got away with this for so long”.Mr Rothstein, a well-connected attorney in Florida, who returned to the US last month from Morocco, was accused last week of masterminding a $1.2bn Ponzi scheme for four years. The now-disbarred lawyer allegedly told investors he was using their money to buy shares in civil case settlement funds but instead spent it on himself and generous political and charitable donations.Money was also allegedly used to buy lavish gifts for members of his law firm, Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler, hire local police officers to provide security, and provide gratuities to high-ranking members of police agencies. It also went towards buying controlling interests in restaurants and to socialise with politicians, prosecutors claimed. Mr Rothstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.Ordinarily, such Ponzi schemes would mark significant moments in white-collar crime, not least because of their size and the fact that some of the accused are prominent figures in their local communities. Many of the alleged Ponzi schemes unearthed this year also have plenty of shock value.Marc Dreier, a once-prominent lawyer who was sentenced to 20 years in prison this year for running a $400m Ponzi scheme, was helped by a former enforcement lawyer with the US Securities and Exchange Commission who last month admitted to impersonating a representative of the Canadian pension plan and a representative of an Icelandic hedge fund to help Mr Dreier.But the rules appear to have changed after the sheer size of Mr Madoff’s $65bn fraud. “Madoff set the bar really high for financial misconduct,” says Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and a former federal prosecutor.“People used to look at a $100m fraud as a Hindenburg-type disaster but now, ‘here comes another one’ is the reaction. To be moved when you hear allegations these days, you look for more zeros on the number than you would have looked for before.”Schemes of varying sizes are still being unearthed across the US. This week, the SEC filed a lawsuit against a New York company that allegedly solicited about $11m from investors through cold calls and a website telling them that money would be invested in personal injury lawsuit settlements but instead shipped the money overseas. Last month, the regulator filed charges to stop an alleged $30m Ponzi scheme in Denver that involved selling investors environmentally-friendly investment opportunities.In September, the SEC filed a lawsuit in relation to an alleged $250m Ponzi scheme in Michigan that allegedly lured elderly investors after convincing many of them to refinance their mortgages.The economic downturn has made Ponzi schemes harder to hide. Jacob Frenkel, an attorney with Shulman, Rogers, said: “It was the economy that caused Madoff to collapse, and the Madoff mania and fall-out caused widespread investment verifications that in turn caused the smaller Ponzi schemes to implode.’’The SEC has brought civil charges in more than 55 Ponzi cases since last December. Some of the alleged scammers have also been criminally charged.
143;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-12-03T16:09:34Z;US retailers report tough November;;Leading US retailers reported November sales that were broadly lower than expected, as a post-Thanksgiving rush failed to offset earlier weak demand.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly comparable sales figures, said its index for the month rose just 0.7 per cent from last year, when sales slumped. Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the “the bottom line is that comp store sales were very disappointing ahead of the critical December holiday shopping season”.“The standard line from many retailers was a stronger year-on-year Black Friday [post-Thanksgiving] weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month.”JC Penney, the low price department store, reported a 5.9 per cent fall in its comparable sales, in line with its forecast of a drop of 4 to 7 per cent, but on top of last November’s 11.9 per cent decline.“Strong sales for the Black Friday weekend offset slightly weaker sales beginning mid-month and leading up to Thanksgiving,” the company said.Kohl’s reported a 3 per cent increase in comparable sales, while Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store chain, reported a 6.1 per cent fall in comparable sales. Macy’s said its post Thanksgiving sales had been “below expectations”, which it attributed to competing sales promotions, and also highlighted the impact of the unseasonably warm weather on winter clothes sales.Target, the second largest discounter, said its comparable November sales were down 1.5 per cent against last November, with softer sales in the first three weeks “substantially offset by better-than-expected sales during our post-Thanksgiving Two-Day sale”.The retailer said it has seen strong sales of consumer electronics, toys and apparel, as well as household goods, small appliances and beauty. It also said that while overall sales levels had decreased, the number of transactions had increased.Walmart, the largest US retailer and Target’s rival, does not report monthly same store sales.Costco, the discount warehouse club that has been one of the beneficiaries of households seeking to cut spending, reported flat comparable sales at its US stores. The company noted that its top line sales were affected by lower food prices and by continuing deflation in flat screen TV pricing, where unit sales were up 15 per cent, while dollar sales saw a mid single digit percentage declines.Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in comparable sales, far worse than analysts’ expected. Aeropostale sales were slightly worse than expected, with a 7 percent rise, and its shares fell over 10 per cent in New York after its quarterly earnings forecast disappointed market analysts.Low price and discount retailers continued to outperform full price rivals, with both Ross Stores and TJX Companies reporting comparable sales up 8 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported overall comparable sales that were flat, but saw a 6 per cent increase at its low price Old Navy stores, offsetting comparable 4 per cent declines at its US Gap and Banana Republic stores, and a 5 per cent decline in its international business.Luxury retailers Neiman Marcus and Saks reported comparable sales declines of 7.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent, on top of the declines of around 30 per cent seen in November and December last year in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Saks said it still expected comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single digits.

The founder of Walmart set his company on course to become the world’s largest retailer by using low prices to attract shoppers, and the buying power of those new shoppers to lower prices. Yet, as the company gathers analysts in north-west Arkansas for its annual two-day briefing, investors need reassurance that it is not tied to pursuing sales for their own sake.The problem is partly one of success. Walmart initially had a good recession, increasing its share of the US market as consumers sought to save money. Yet growth slowed in the second quarter, and its shares, among the few that did not fall in 2008, are down 8 per cent so far this year. Consumers who initially cut back by shopping at Walmart are getting into the habit of thrift – falling basket sizes suggest that they are still trying to reduce spending on discretionary items.Attempts to revive growth for a company that will make more than $400bn in revenues this year would be risky, however. Costco, another discounter, learned the risks of aggressive pricing in the second quarter, where the boost to sales it received was insufficient to offset the hit to margins. Indeed, the central danger of a deflationary economic environment is that consumers continually expect prices to fall, meaning price-cutting no longer stimulates extra sales and profitability is slowly eroded.Instead, a company with limited room to expand domestically should concentrate on improving returns, with the now year-long store remodelling programme to improve profitability indicating the route to continued growth in earnings. If Walmart can convince investors that profits come first, a historically low valuation of 14 times prospective earnings will seem cheap indeed.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
145;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-10-07T20:40:45Z;Wall Street mixed in choppy trading;;"A shake-up in the telecoms sector and mixed results from consumer groups
created uncertainty on Wall Street on Wednesday, causing the market to stall after its two-day rally.Investors were also bracing themselves ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, due to start officially with results from the aluminium producer Alcoa after the closing bell.Telecoms stocks led the declines in early trading after AT&T reversed its policy on internet voice applications. Bowing to pressure from regulators and consumers, the network provider said late on Tuesday that it would allow inexpensive internet phone calls to be placed through its networks from Apple’s iPhones. AT&T lost 2.1 per cent to $26.18 and concern spread to the rest of the sector. Verizon Communications, the largest US mobile phone company, lost 1.1 per cent to $29.38.Over the previous two sessions, US stocks gained almost 3 per cent on rising commodity prices, deal activity and encouraging data from the US services sector.“From a technical standpoint we’ve had a pretty big run-up, and we’re just consolidating now,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global. He added the market was also in a frozen state as it responded to mixed corporate news. “Companies are containing costs, but there are still pockets of disappointment. There have also been some changes in telecoms, and the market seems to be taking that a little bit adversely.”After a day of choppy trading, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,057.58. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1 per cent at 9,725.58 and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 per cent to 2,110.33.Consumer stocks helped to lift sentiment after a series of companies beat estimates.Costco Wholesale re-ported lower fourth-quarter profit due to weak demand for fuel and non-food items. However, its results still beat Wall Street forecasts and the shares rose 1.9 per cent to $59.Family Dollar Stores also reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst estimates, but after early gains the shares closed 1 per cent lower at $28.21. The retailer said it had benefited from stocking more food and consumable goods, which had been popular with frugal shoppers.Helen of Troy, which owns personal-care brands Vidal Sassoon and Revlon, posted better-than-expected quarterly results, mainly due to cost cuts. The shares rose 12.5 per cent to $22.50.Yum Brands, owner of fast-food chains KFC and Pizza Hut, reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast. The group said it had benefited from falling food prices and particularly strong demand in China. However, after early gains, the shares fell 1.4 per cent to $34.37.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank upgraded Coca-Cola to “buy”, helping to lift its shares 0.9 per cent to $54.81.Wyndham Worldwide, the holiday company that owns about 7,000 hotels, gained 7.4 per cent to $17.47 after Goldman Sachs boosted its rating on the stock to “buy”. Goldman said the company would be likely to benefit from its shift away from the timeshare business toward a fee-for-service structure.Financial stocks led the market higher for most of the day in spite of losses from government-backed mortgage lenders. Freddie Mac lost 1.1 per cent to $1.79 and Fannie Mae was down 2 per cent at $1.48 after reports that they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Avis Budget Group, the car rental company, weighed on the market, falling 5.9 per cent to $12.50 after it warned of weaker earnings. On Tuesday the group offered $250m in notes along with a warrant transaction, which it said would dilute earnings.Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, reported a loss that was not as deep as expected, but revenues continued to slide on weak demand for its herbicide product. The group’s shares lost 1.4 per cent to $74.33.In the technology sector, Ciena announced it was buying Nortel’s Metro Ethernet Networks business for $390m in cash and 10m Ciena shares. Ciena rose 3 per cent to $13.44."
146;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-10-01T18:41:22Z;Death is certain, but far from recession-proof;;American investors may have shortened their list of sure things after the recent financial tumult, but human mortality remains a certainty.However grand or modest, everyone must have a funeral and publicly listed “death care providers” offer a way to profit from nature taking its course.Yet even this $15bn a year business has not been recession-proof. Operating earnings of the four largest vertically integrated operators of funeral homes and cemeteries fell by between 10 and 38 per cent over the past six months, compared with a year earlier.At an average cost of $7,323 for a traditional burial, plus another $2,500 or so for a cemetery plot, funerals are typically the largest purchase an American makes aside from a house or car.It would be tempting to assume profits are down because cash-strapped mourners are economising, but that is not the case.Even in a slumping economy, those in the funeral business say it is rare for bereaved relatives to haggle, and prices have even risen moderately.The exception is the large numbers of “pre-need’ customers, who pay for their arrangements in advance. Not only are some opting to shop around on items such as coffins, now available at discount retailer Costco, but more are postponing their purchases.This squeezes a key profit source for the industry because pre-purchased funerals, while allowing buyers to avoid inflation until the time of death – typically 10-12 years – are not sold at a discount.The funds are held in trust and invested, with any excess income accruing to the funeral provider.Financial market performance is therefore a key component of profitability. Industry-leader Service Corp International had sales of $2.1bn last year, but enjoys an unrealised “pre-need” backlog of $6.3bn. Its earnings on these funds dropped by a third last year from 2007.Other trends are threatening profits. America has gone through a “death trough” in the past decade, with around 2.4m people dying each year. A wave of ageing baby boomers should push this to 3.4m in the next quarter century.But the boomers’ attitudes towards burial are different from their parents’ generation.Cremations, which cost less than half traditional burials, were frowned upon 40 years ago, with less than 5 per cent of Americans choosing to dispose of their earthly remains this way.But cremations have since risen to 35 per cent of all funerals and the National Funeral Directors Association expects them to reach 60 per cent by the time baby boomers start to die in large numbers.The trend has tempered investors’ enthusiasm over the coming wave of funerals. The industry had a near-death experience after it expanded furiously in the 1990s, scooping up thousands of family-owned businesses. Heavy debt and weak acquisitions nearly sent the consolidators into bankruptcy.“Wall Street was rewarding us just for growing, without looking at the quality of growth,” said Terry Sanford, chief financial officer of Carriage Services.Those owners who sold out often saw their fortunes vanish when the shares crashed, making remaining family-run funeral businesses wary of selling out.Then there is the ever-present threat of cheaper alternatives taking hold. Since the 1963 best-seller The American Way of Death sparked an outcry over costs, average funeral prices have risen sevenfold, outpacing inflation.But the industry remains creative about selling expensive accoutrements, including elaborate urns to those choosing cremation. It has even been marketing the opportunity to have artificial diamonds made from loved-ones’ ashes.Keen to express their individuality, even posthumously, baby boomers may yet prove a profitable group for the death care providers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,497.34.From the opening bell, the materials and energy sectors led the market after oil prices rose and the gold price crept above the psychologically significant $1,000 level.United States Steel gained 2.2 per cent to $43.28 while ExxonMobil rose 2.1 per cent to $70.65.The industrials index was buoyed by General Electric. Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $14.5 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock.EOG Resources, the oil and gas producer, also climbed 4.5 per cent to $73.64 after Barron’s, the influential investor magazine, said the company may benefit as it shifts from natural gas to potentially more lucrative oil production.Investor confidence was further boosted by a flurry of M&A activity, which has slumped during the recession.Shares in Intellon, the semiconductor company, surged 42.4 per cent to $7.12 after Atheros Communications agreed to buy the company for $244m in cash and stock. Atheros, which makes wireless communications chips for Hewlett-Packard computers, fell 2 per cent to $27.43.Kraft Foods, the biggest food group in the US, fell 5.9 per cent to $26.45 after its £10.2bn ($16.7bn) takeover bid for Cadbury was rejected on Monday.Hershey rose 1.3 per cent to $39.13 on speculation that it could also put itself forward in the bidding war for Cadbury, which produces chocolate bars such as Flake and Wispa as well as chewing gum.The British company has vowed to mount a staunch defence against the unsolicited takeover offer, which comes in the middle of rapid consolidation in the confectionery industry.Elsewhere in the consumer industry, Smithfield Foods, the pork processor, reported a first-quarter loss of $107.7m compared with a loss of $13.2m last year.The company blamed its deteriorating performance on concerns over swine flu and weaker demand for pork. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $12.75.Costco Wholesale, the biggest warehouse club chain in the US, added 2.3 per cent to $56.73 after two broker upgrades.Its membership-only stores, which sell branded food, household and electronic products, have been picking up business as
middle-class Americans seek to save money by buying groceries and other essentials in bulk.The tech sector was buoyed by a report from Morgan Stanley, which raised the US systems and PC hardware sector to “attractive” from “in line”.Apple rose 1.6 per cent to $172.93 after the company raised its price target from $195 to $200.Although Dell was one of the companies that was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, it benefited from the sector’s momentum,
rising 1.7 per cent to $15.96.IBM was also downgraded and lost 0.3 per cent to $117.16, even though the group said it was “well ahead” of its plan of achieving earnings per share of $10 to $11 for 2010.The healthcare sector was the only S&P 500 index group in the red.Health insurance stocks continued to suffer ahead of President Barack Obama’s address to Congress today, when he is expected to
outline his proposed reforms of the healthcare system.WellPoint, one of the largest US health insurers, fell 4.3 per cent to $51.84. UnitedHealth Group fell 3.6 per cent to $27.84.A report late in the day showing US consumer credit had dropped by more than forecast did little damage to the day’s rally. According to the Federal Reserve, consumer credit fell by $21.6bn in July, compared to a revised decline of $15.5bn in June."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day 0.7 per cent higher at 9344.61.The major indices initially climbed on strong gains in China, helping the market to stabilise after this week’s falls.Positive news from the retail sector on August sales, and data from the services industry helped to lift the market but uncertainty lingered throughout the day. A weekly jobless claims report was also worse than expected, leaving investors jittery.“No one wants to take any real position ahead of tomorrow’s number,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. The US economy is expected to lose 230,000 jobs in August, while the unemployment rate is forecast to have risen to 9.5 per cent from 9.4 per cent.After suffering some of the steepest declines over the past few sessions, financial shares led the market’s gains throughout the day.Bank of America was up 3.5 per cent at $16.84, Citigroup rose 4.6 per cent to $4.77, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 3.1 per cent to $42.11.Investors in the materials sector also looked towards China. While the gold price, which hovered around a three-month high, helped boost mining stocks, Alcoa also lifted the mood in the sector. America’s largest aluminium producer raised its forecast for global demand, citing stimulus spending in China. Its shares climbed 4 per cent to $12.Retailers also performed well because even though many posted sales declines, the results were better than had been expected. According to Thomson Reuters, the same-store sales index for August fell 2.9 per cent, better than an expected decline of 3.9 per cent. However, of the 30 retailers
surveyed, 15 missed their sales targets.Costco, the wholesaler that posted its numbers before the bell, was up 8.6 per cent at $54.99 after it beat expectations by a wide margin. The group saw a 2 per cent decline in same-store sales after analysts had forecast a 5.7 per cent drop.Target, another discount retailer, also reported strong numbers from the back-to-school season and was up 1.7 per cent at $47.1.Although Wal-Mart no longer contributes monthly sales figures to the index, its shares climbed 1.6 per cent to $51.74 as the retailer was also expected to have been popular with frugal back-to-school shoppers.There were more surprises for analysts from the consumer sector. Del Monte Foods rose 7.5 per cent to $11.14 after clocking up its biggest intra-day gain since February. The company, which makes canned fruit and pet food, reported
better-than-expected profit from its first quarter.The group attributed its improved performance to the rising popularity of pet snacks and to price increases it implemented last year in order to compensate for higher commodity costs.Meanwhile, deals activity continued to pick up.Sepracor was up 0.2 per cent at $22.85 after Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma agreed to buy the drugmaker for $2.6bn. The deal is the second-biggest overseas acquisition made by a Japanese company so far this year.Shares in Pilgrim’s Pride, the maker of prepared chicken products, rose 5.4 per cent to $5.43 following reports that JBS SA, the world’s largest beef exporter, was in talks to buy the company. Analysts said the Brazilian company could pay more than $2bn for Pilgrim’s Pride.Credit rating agencies were hit by a ruling late on Wednesday by a judge in Manhattan which allowed an investor lawsuit to proceed against them.With numerous investor lawsuits looming in the aftermath of billions of
dollars of losses on triple A rated securities which proved to be riskier than investors had thought, rating agencies remain in the spotlight. Moody’s Corp shares fell 7.05 per cent to $24.26, with McGraw Hill, owner of Standard and Poor’s, down 10.21 per cent to $29.01."
149;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-09-03T17:56:15Z;US retailers battle through August;;"US retailers on Thursday reported increasing signs of steadying consumer demand, tentatively signalling the end to the steep year-on-year sales declines that have forced waves of store closures and cost-cutting since last September.August’s comparable sales numbers from leading retail chains again declined during the month but by significantly less than in the preceding months.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of the monthly sales numbers showed a 2.3 per cent decline compared with the 4-5 per cent falls seen in recent months, the best performance for the index since September last year.Several retailers, including Costco, Gap, Target and Kohl’s, delivered better than expected sales numbers, despite the absence of a boost from pre-Labour Day holiday sales.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the numbers suggested the decline in US retail sales may have “bottomed out” in July when the index fell 4.7 per cent.Mid-price and discount retailers also reported anecdotal evidence of renewed interest in discretionary spending – such as strong television sales at Costco, the warehouse club; and stronger women’s clothing sales at JC Penney and Kohl’s, the department stores; and stronger accessory sales at Target, the mass discounter.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said he believed the monthly sales reports showed a shift in the fundamental mood, and “may indeed be the start of a recovery for the industry”.“I think there is a turning point of sorts that will only get better as we look ahead.”Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount stores, reported a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month, while Old Navy reported a 4 per cent rise.Target, with more than 1,700 large discount stores, reported a 2.9 per cent fall in comparable sales, against Wall Street’s expectations of a drop of more than 5 per cent. Costco, the largest US warehouse club, said comparable sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, were flat, again better than analysts expected.Retailers’ year-on-year comparable sales figures will improve from September as they contrast with the sharp monthly declines seen after last year’s financial crash. However, overall sales volumes will remain at levels significantly below last year, and most retailers have cut back on inventories for the autumn and holiday seasons.Luxury spending remains depressed. Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, again reported sales sharply down from last year, with comparable declines respectively of 16.6 and 19.6 per cent.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports same store sales on a monthly basis."
150;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-08-06T19:04:37Z;US stores suffer gloomy July;;Leading US retailers had another month of year-on-year comparable sales declines in July, and several said they managed to maintain or improve profit margins on leaner inventory levels and reduced price markdowns.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales, said on Thursday its index for July was down 4.7 per cent against the period last year. The index excludes Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.Consumer concern over rising unemployment and the economy hit sales, but other factors were the later start to the back-to-school shopping season than last year and the fact that several states moved annual sales-tax-free shopping days to August.Only a handful of retailers reported comparable sales gains, including the “off-price” stores TJX and Ross. Off-price stores, which buy excess stock from other brands, have performed well throughout the recession.Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount-style department stores, also reported a 0.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, its first gain since April last year. Its rival JC Penney said its comparable sales fell 12.3 per cent, while Target, the discounter, reported a 6.5 per cent drop, and Macy’s was down 10.7 per cent.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent fall in comparable sales at its US stores, excluding petrol, as lower prices for food and large electronics items including televisions offset continued gains in transactions. Costco’s unit sales of TVs were up 30 per cent on July last year.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks department stores reporting comparable sales down 27 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.Several retailers reported strongest sales in the southwest and north-east of the US but continued weakness in Florida, the south-east and in the Midwest. Kohl’s said its stores in the south-west had recorded double-digit sales gains in comparable stores.In spite of the overall sluggishness, several retailers raised conservative earnings estimates, including Gap, Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said retailers’ attention was focused on the back-to-school selling surge, from the end of August and to the first week of September.“I think inventories are going to be lean, and they could leave some sales on the table as a result …But if I were them, I would take that bet,” he said, noting that in July sales “remained in a rut”.
151;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-04-12T17:01:13Z;Rare beast ploughs its own furrow;;Metro Cash and Carry is a strange beast. It operates 655 of its distinctive blue and yellow “big box” stores in 29 countries and contributes half of the total revenues of its parent, Metro Group, the German retail group.But, for all its success, no would-be international rival has ever tried to copy its recipe.US-based Costco and Sam’s Club are international wholesale-type clubs. But they target the end consumer, not hotels and restaurants, or owners of small convenience stores, as MCC does. While the UK’s Booker Group does fit that description, it remains a national rival to MCC’s Anglo-Dutch subsidiary, Makro.“For 45 years, we’ve occupied our own niche,” says Frans Muller, a Dutchman who has been MCC chief executive and a member of Metro’s executive board since 2008.“Our business is more complex than it looks. You’re not allowed to be afraid of new markets,” he says. The art was to transplant “tested knowledge”.The idea is to be a “first mover”, to set up branches in nations on the cusp of being labelled fast-growing “emerging markets” before big retailers like Wal-Mart and Carrefour.“We’ve been in Poland for 15 years and we entered Russia in 2001,” says Mr Muller. “The way Poland developed provides a blueprint for Russia.”MCC has pushed its operations deep into eastern Europe, including Ukraine in 2003 and Kazakhstan later this year. It trades in five Asian countries – China, India, Japan, Vietnam and Pakistan. Some 20 stores are planned this year. Most will open in Asia, although one will mark MCC’s first foray into Egypt.Success has by no means wiped out competition. MCC faces strong national rivals in many markets – from the likes of Booker in the UK, via the “wet markets” – huge open markets selling fresh or even live produce – frequented by restaurant owners in China, to specialist wholesalers in Germany, who supply hotels and restaurants with meat, milk or machines.However, Mr Muller believes the crisis could accelerate consolidation in wholesaling.“We do think that our rivals are being hit harder than we are,” Mr Muller says.“We think this crisis is a great opportunity to grow market share – we’re well-positioned with our clients.”MCC’s markets have “good long-term prospects”, although Mr Muller admits that it is still “impossible” to say when growth might reappear.MCC hopes to ride the dip with cost cuts and improved client service. By providing a sharper focus on the needs of restaurants and hotels, and of small convenience stores, the company aims to boost its share of these customer groups, which already account for two-thirds of sales.The plan is being tested at a store in Siegen, northern Germany. It no longer stocks toys, textiles or DIY equipment. To help hoteliers and restaurateurs, it offers more non-food items – cooking equipment or accessories for hotel rooms. But the biggest change has come in its approach to convenience shop owners.Apart from selling them stock, MCC offers advice about marketing, furnishing shops and even brokering finance.“We’ve been able to raise their sales by 40 per cent in some cases – and when they sell more, we sell more,” Mr Muller says. “Some 50 per cent of food sales in Poland go through small shops or kiosks.”This is perhaps the strangest thing about MCC. It is an international chain that is reliant on independent retailers fighting off other international chains.As Mr Muller says: “When a big chain opens next door, we can help [convenience store owners] fight off the competition” – which will be bad news for Wal-Mart if he is proved right.

He may be the deciding vote in over-riding Republican objections to the Employee Free Choice Act, a law that would make it far easier to unionise workplaces.But controversial provisions that would discourage secret ballots and possibly allow unions to pressure undecided employees have business groups crying foul. They face an uphill fight. Unions are harnessing populist anger over the economy and Democratic control of both Congress and the White House to push aggressively for the passage. The 10 largest unions alone have given politicians about $280m since 1990, with about 95 per cent going to Democrats. Unions are also the largest supporters of so-called “527 groups” that skirt campaign contribution limits. A victory could usher in a union renaissance. Nationwide membership among workers has dropped to 12 per cent from more than 20 per cent a quarter century ago, with only the public sector ranks experiencing growth. Some 42 per cent of local government employees are unionised, against 8 per cent of private sector workers.There is a stark geographic split, too, with southern states eschewing unions as much as ones in the northern Rust Belt seem to lionise them. Only 4 per cent of North Carolina’s workers are members, compared with 25 per cent of those in New York. This may be one reason why industrial jobs have flowed disproportionately to the south.Three retailers, Costco, Whole Foods and Starbucks, have floated a compromise that would contain many elements of the EFCA, while still allowing a secret ballot to join or to decertify a union. This sensible position sadly stands little chance of success as labour sees no reason to settle for less than complete victory.

153;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-04-08T18:58:34Z;‘New’ US shopper to emerge from crisis;;As the recession dramatic­ally alters where and how Americans spend their money, there is an emerging consensus on the likely profile of the “new” US consumer who will emerge on the other side of the crisis.A Citigroup report, for example, argues that US consumers are shifting towards “conscientious consumption”, embracing a “thriftiness” focused on value and quality, not quantity.Euro RSCG, the global advertising group, says a recent survey of 500 people in the US, the UK and France pointed to a shift to “value” combined with a desire for “voluntary simplicity”. And consumer anthropologists suggest Americans will seek to “un-stuff” their lives, and focus more on the community.Andrew Benett, of Euro RSCG Worldwide, says the changes are likely to be long-lasting. “I don’t think we are going to go back to the behaviours of the past, which were about excess and not thinking things through…we have moved on as consumers.”The behavioural changes have included cutting back on “aspirational” luxury shopping. People are using cash and debit cards more than credit, while favouring lower-cost stores such as Wal-Mart and Costco. At supermarkets, well-known national brands have lost ground to retailers’ lower-cost own-brand products.A survey carried out in October and November by TNS, the market research group, also found the frugal mood had affected US consumers who do have the money to spend – with families earning more than $100,000 using discount coupons more often and seeking out money-saving offers.Joan Lewis, head of consumer and market research at Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, says there is a remarkable consistency in these shifts, in both developed and developing markets. “We think that many of these changes we have seen will remain for a long time,” she says.In the US, tighter limits on consumer credit will underpin behavioural shifts. A recent survey of 5,000 US consumers by Alix & Partners predicted that post- recession spending would go back to just 86 per cent of pre-recession levels: about a 10 per cent drop in spending, or a $1,000bn (€760bn, £680bn) annual reduction.Ed Kerschner, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management, says the US has passed an “inflection” point, marking the end of an acceptance of conspicuous consumption that he traces back to the Reagan presidency of the early 1980s. The end of easy access to consumer credit will, he argues, lead to “thriftiness” focused on “value”, rather than “frugality” focused on low prices.“It’s going to be about thrift…it’s not about being frugal or cheap,” he says.Context-Based Research, which sent its cultural anthropologists out to US cities in December, said it heard consumers talking of “community”, “hard work”, and “taking responsibility”.Robbie Blinkoff, Context’s principal anthropologist, says he expects to see the emergence of a new “reflective consumerism”.He also says it is still hard to gauge the inevitable impact of the recession on young people. “When I pull out a credit card, my eight-year-old daughter says, “you are using debit, not credit, right, Dad?” It’s funny. But that will stick with her for the rest of her life.”
154;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-03-17T18:03:15Z;Lindt closes lid on most of its US stores;;Lindt & Sprüngli, the Swiss maker of chocolate truffle balls and Easter bunnies wrapped in gold foil, is to close nearly two-thirds of its retail boutiques in the US as people switch from its fancy chocolates to cheaper brands.Lindt’s shares tumbled 7 per cent to SFr20,125 – their lowest level for more than three years – as the company also warned it would not achieve long-term financial targets because of slowing sales growth, ending several years of record sales and profits.Underlying sales are forecast to rise between 2 and 5 per cent this year, below Lindt’s long-term target for growth of between 6 and 8 per cent.Meanwhile, 2009 earnings are estimated at between SFr260m and SFr280m ($220m-$237m), down some 29 per cent on 2008 earnings of SFr361m.Lindt’s gloomy forecast contrasts with more upbeat outlooks by mass-market chocolate manufacturers such as Nestlé and Cadbury, both of which have reported rising sales for mainstream brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Kit Kat in recent months.To save money, the company – which also owns the Ghirardelli brand – is to shut 50 of its 80 US retail boutiques, concentrating on boutiques in shopping malls. It first started exporting chocolate to the US in 1987 and began opening its own stores in 1994 to raise awareness of its brand.Lindt said it no longer needed the boutiques because most of its US sales were now made through well-known retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Target and Walgreens, and because shoppers were unwilling to pay the higher prices charged at its own stores.It plans to keep its own stores in upmarket downtown locations, as well as in outlet malls, where consumers can shop at discount stores.In England, Spain and Italy, bankruptcies among retail distributors hurt sales, while in Lindt’s home market – where chocolate prices have risen to their highest levels in more than two decades as manufacturers have tried to recoup rising cocoa and transportation costs – sales volumes rose just 0.9 per cent. This compares with growth of 7.7 per cent in 2007.Lindt plans to focus on expansion in emerging markets such as Russia, South Africa, China and Mexico, as well as “high potential” markets such as the US and the UK.Lindt’s 2008 earnings before interest and tax margin rose 40 basis points to 12.3 per cent, and underlying group sales increased 5.8 per cent to SFr2.94bn.Green & Blacks, the organic chocolate brand owned by Cadbury, has also suffered sales declines, with the group reporting flat sales growth last year in the UK after previously having recorded annual sales growth of as much as 30 per cent.Shares in Lindt closed down 5 per cent at SFr20,560.
155;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Reaching for the Starbucks;;The decision of Starbucks to begin marketing Via, its own brand of instant coffee, is a powerful symbol of something – either of the unexpected resilience of innovative companies or the collapse of the whole logic of the consumer economy.The struggles of Starbucks are well known. Its stock lost half its value last year, and store sales were off 9 per cent in the most recent quarter. The company announced in January that it would shed 6,700 jobs and close 300 more outlets, after shuttering 600 last year. Other espresso chains are nipping at its heels, some with better services (such as Caribou in the US, where high-speed internet is free), some with lower prices (such as Dunkin’ Donuts). Home-grown competitors are rising in important markets – for example Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero in Britain. People differ on whether Starbucks has expanded too fast – losing sight of the bohemian ambience that was its main selling point – or whether peddling coffee for several dollars, or pounds, a cup is a non-starter in this straitened economy.Whatever the problem is, it is hard to see how instant coffee could be the way out of it. One prong in the Via marketing strategy is to sell it through the discount retailers Target and Costco for about $1 a sachet. That is a lot of money. While there is a logic in selling premium coffee at a premium, there seems to be little in selling so-so coffee at five times the price of other so-so coffee. The second prong is to sell it, starting in March, in Starbucks stores in three cities – Seattle, Chicago and London. That makes sense: 81 per cent of the coffee drunk in Britain is instant, and the world instant coffee market generates $17bn (€13.5bn, £11.9bn) in sales. So perhaps Starbucks can sell enough in prestige markets to convince shoppers elsewhere to buy it in bulk.That would be in character. Ever since it began expanding, Starbucks has worked by paradox and misdirection. It is supposed to be a chain of espresso bars but, in the US at least, it has been years since most Starbucks have stocked proper espresso cups. A shot of espresso comes as a little puddle rolling back and forth at the bottom of a pint paper cup meant to hold some other concoction, most likely one with lots of steamed milk and syrup. Starbucks is basically a malt shop and this should not surprise us. Creamy foods are always popular in booms. The great food fad of the 1920s, the historian Frederick Lewis Allen tells us, was “Eskimo Pie”, and US ice cream production rose 45 per cent in the seven years to 1926. The genius of Starbucks is to keep its identity as a coffee shop, letting its customers feel more virtuous than if the place they habitually nip off to at 10:15am were called the Dairy Tub, or something like that.This makes the shift to instant coffee easier. If you are selling milkshakes, the quality of the coffee is not that important, any more than the quality of scotch is important to someone whose favourite drink is scotch-and-coke. But there is a problem with instant, too. Part of what Starbucks founder Howard Schultz calls “the Starbucks experience” has always been a matter of class. Starbucks has managed to give its customers the feeling they are “in” in two ways.The first is through its reputation as a “responsible corporate citizen”. Starbucks offers health insurance to employees who work 20 hours a week or more and has been punctilious about trading only with ethical coffee growers. These choices are defrayed through higher retail prices. Since people who care about corporate responsibility tend to be well-educated, and hence well-paid, caring is a class marker. Corporate responsibility and conspicuous consumption are near relations. You can “feel good” about ordering Starbucks in more ways than one.The second link to class is through real estate. This may hold the key to the company’s difficulties. Starbucks has had a genius for sizing up properties and picking locations. The company starts, according to the writer Taylor Clark with “a database ranking every US metropolitan area according to the qualities Starbucks found especially desirable – high income, high population and high education”. In plotting its expansion this way, Starbucks not only collected information but generated it. An up-and-coming neighbourhood would have a Starbucks: a superficially similar but stagnant one would not. In the very act of its site selection it became a sort of rating agency. One extraordinary side-effect of Starbucks’ retrenchment is that, as outlets have closed – particularly in struggling cities such as Newark, New Jersey – protests have arisen to “Save Our Starbucks”. Naturally! A closed Starbucks signals a downgrading of the neighbourhood. But picking real-estate winners is not as lucrative now as it was a couple years ago.Starbucks may have come up against the limits of its model. The chain will have to serve a different function in the bust economy than in the boom. Maybe espresso bars could thrive as purveyors of “cheap luxury”, the way cinemas did in the 1930s. A lot of people thought that the collapse of phoney equity values would make people turn to healthy, high-value food. But, really, that almost never happens – the natural food craze of the late 1970s was a cultural coincidence, not an economic effect. As this paper has reported, people today are turning to fast food, fish and chips and other comfort foods. “The less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food,” George Orwell wrote in The Road to Wigan Pier. “When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty’.” The taste for the kind of sweet drinks Starbucks serves is unlikely to wane any time soon.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly StandardMore columns at www.ft.com/christophercaldwell

157;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-02-04T22:17:36Z;Wall Street appetite for staples wanes;;"Consumer staple stocks led Wall Street lower on Wednesday as the latest batch of glum corporate earnings took in erstwhile defensive food companies.Disappointing results from Kraft along with peer Sara Lee, stoked investor fears that the sector was far from immune to weakening consumer demand during the recession.“They’ve not held up as we expected,” said William Rutherford, who has about $30bn of assets under management at Rutherford Investment Management in Oregon.Shares in Kraft, which makes Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee among other products, tumbled 9.2 per cent to $26.11 after the group warned that sales volumes fell across several categories and cut its outlook for 2009, citing higher pension costs and a stronger dollar.Sara Lee, a peer, fell 7.2 per cent to $9.68 after it, too, cut its profit forecast for the year.Meanwhile, Costco Wholesale tumbled 6.8 per cent to $42.98 after it warned that second-quarter earnings would be substantially below existing analyst estimates and said it would not provide forecasts for the rest of the year.Several other stocks were hit in the fallout. Archer Daniels Midland was among the worst-performing in the sector, in spite of well-received results earlier in the week.Shares in the food processor shed 7.6 per cent to $25.54 after JPMorgan analysts downgraded their view of the stock to “neutral”.“We are becoming increasingly cautious on the forward outlook and, given the stock’s recent performance, believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines,” wrote the analysts.Consumer staples shed 2.6 per cent overall, while healthcare – another traditionally defensive sector – also underperformed.Consumer discretionary stocks also did badly. Walt Disney shed 7.9 per cent to $19 as analysts took a dim view of the group’s first-quarter results. The figures prompted Citigroup analysts to cut their price target to $18 and retain a “sell” rating. Retailers did badly, down 2.3 per cent overall, ahead of a glut of closely-watched sales figures due for release on Thursday.Still, economic data that, although glum, was not quite as bleak as feared helped support the market early in the session and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.6 per cent.The market advanced after data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US service sector once again shrank in January but at least at a slower pace than expected.Some private sector unemployment data that was also marginally better than
forecast provided some additional supportYet an afternoon sell-off left the benchmark index 0.8 per cent lower at 832.22 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.5 per cent at 7,956.66. Strength in the technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index stay in positive territory for much of the day but it, too, succumbed to close 0.1 per cent weaker at 1,515.05.Trading in the financial sector was particularly volatile amid uncertainty over the Obama administration’s plans to shore up embattled banks. Certain institutions did especially badly on persistent concerns over the threat of outright nationalisation.Bank of America hit a fresh low for the decade, down 11.3 per cent to $4.70. Among the regional banks to do poorly, Fifth Third and Huntington Bancshares lost 14 per cent to $1.54 and 20.4 per cent to $1.54, respectively.Developments in Washington remained at the forefront of investor concerns elsewhere as the Senate edged closer to passing the $900bn stimulus plan.Strength in the materials sector, up 1.5 per cent overall, provided support to the market while energy stocks also found positive territory following the latest weekly inventories data.Technology stocks also outperformed as investors snapped up cash-rich names. Intel and Microsoft climbed 2.1 per cent to $13.88, and 5.1 per cent to $18.63, respectively.Cisco added 1.4 per cent to $15.80 and a further 1.2 per cent after the market closed, when the network equipment maker disclosed results that topped forecasts.However, media stocks came under pressure after Time Warner forecast flat profits this year. Its shares dipped 3.7 per cent to $9.42."
158;COST;Costco Wholesale;2009-02-02T01:46:32Z;Banker confesses to Wall Street mistakes;;"In the Davis Advisors office in midtown Manhattan, there is a wall of plaques – but not the usual ones celebrating company successes. The plaques record the influential money manager’s biggest mistakes.One is being ordered for AIG.“AIG was the biggest mistake we have made in some years, it took 6 per cent off our returns over the past five years,” says Chris Davis, who manages $40bn and is one of the largest holders of financial stocks in the US.“It really drove home that the chief executive officer has to serve as the chief risk officer …it went from a CEO that knew when any sparrow fell, to a CEO who had little experience outside property and casualty.”“There was also the leverage of collateralised debt obligations [vehicles used to repackage portfolios of other debt]. We didn’t move quickly enough to understand the impact of that.”Ken Feinberg, who co-manages Mr Davis’s flagship New York Venture fund, says: “A lot of the problems with AIG weren’t knowable from the disclosures.”“The stock-lending business, they were lending stock, taking collateral and investing in illiquid assets. Most prudent organisations would not engage in that behaviour. It was many tens of billions of dollars and yet there was not a sentence of disclosure that that was what they were doing.”After outperforming its peers for close to 40 years, the New York Venture fund last year lost 40 per cent in value – slightly worse than the average.The founding Davis family has $2bn of its own money in its funds, so Chris Davis, the grandson of founder Shelby Davis, lost money too.“We spend all our time talking about what we did wrong,” says Mr Davis, adding that last year’s result could have been much worse.“We didn’t own CountryWide, [Washington Mutual], Fannie and Freddie, Lehman or Bear Stearns …we went into the cycle reducing our financial stocks to about 30 per cent of the total, from more than half.”Mr Davis says many of those stocks were avoided because of the management’s excessive pay – an issue that has been highlighted by the financial crisis.“CEO compensation is often a good indication of management character. It played a role in why we didn’t hold Lehman. I’d like to say that we had some stunning insight into the risk they were taking but really we disliked their compensation philosophy.”“Employee options were huge, 20 to 25 per cent of shares outstanding, with no expense charged.”Mr Davis added that Merrill Lynch was “another company that had terrible [compensation] practices and we weren’t comfortable with the practices. We did make an investment in Merrill after John Thain came in; we bought stock at $48 in a private placement.”“We had never felt before Merrill had the right combination of management and price. They had bad comp practices for years and the price didn’t reflect the risk that was being taken on the balance sheet.”“When Thain came in, we thought it had changed, the price was way down, and there was better management. We were wrong.”“We were wrong about the business and the risks in the business. We bought more stock in the $20s. It was a terrible mistake – not our biggest in dollar terms – but we still got our head handed to us.”But Mr Davis, whose fund is one of JPMorgan Chase’s biggest shareholders, is enthusiastic about Jamie Dimon, chief executive.“He has been a stunning leader in the area of compensation …We bought Bank One after he went there. I am not concerned that Jamie Dimon won’t lead from the front on comp practices.”“He waived all bonuses at Bank One, he bought stock in the bank in the open market after it was announced he was CEO, which most people don’t do – they get their options and then there’s an announcement and the stock goes up.”“There’s plenty to worry about in JPMorgan’s business, in their portfolios, the environment, the consequences of government intervention, how bad could the economy get, but senior management compensation policy there is not something I worry about.”Mr Davis, who originally planned to become a priest before joining the family firm, describes the low-profile Davis Advisors as “a quirky place”.Like most value investors, his fund takes big holdings in a few stocks and holds them for years, with little turnover. He also owns shares in American Express, Wells Fargo and Berkshire Hathaway.He sees buying opportunities now in consumer stocks such as Johnson & Johnson, Schering Plough and Procter & Gamble, which can pass on costs to customers.The fund’s biggest holding is Costco, one of the largest US discount retailers, which it has been adding to in recent months.“We were always a great admirer of it but it was overpriced. Then, about six years ago, it closed at $40 or $41, and opened [the next day] at $27, because they missed a quarter. All the momentum guys got out – we bought 17m shares in one day.”Costco shares are now trading at close to $50."
159;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Wal-Mart cuts earnings forecast;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Thursday, citing the impact of slower than expected sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores and international units.The retailer, whose low cost Supercenters have outperformed other retailers since the start of the consumer slowdown, said comparable sales in the US grew by 1.7 per cent in December, lower than Wall Street had forecast. Sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 1.9 per cent, while its Sam’s Club discount clubs saw an increase of just 0.1 per cent.The retailer cited the impact of the economic slowdown and bad weather across the US in the week before Christmas, which led to the closure of several stores. But Eduardo Castro Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart USA said the retailer believed it had continued to gain market share, and that customer numbers increased for the third month in a row.It forecast a US same-store sales increase for January of between 0 and 2 per cent.Wal-Mart’s total sales for the month edged down by 0.1 per cent to $46.51bn, reflecting the impact of a 10.4 per cent fall in the value of its international sales in dollar terms.“The current economy remains challenging for all businesses, and retailers have already seen customers pull back on discretionary spending,” said Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s finance chief. “Consumers are very focused on value and necessities.”Wal-Mart said it now expected fourth quarter profit from continuing operations between 91 cents and 94 cents a share. It had already reduced earnings forecast by 6 cents in November, citing the impact of the strong dollar on international earnings, and by a further 6 cents last month due to its settlement of 63 lawsuits over pay and conditions.It said it expected its overall operating performance for the year to be at or ahead of its fourth quarter last year.Shares of Wal-Mart were down almost 10 per cent at $50.35 in pre-market trading on Thursday.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores excluding fuel sales. At BJ’s Wholesale Club, comparable club sales were up by 1.6 per cent in December, its lowest monthly increase for the year. The company said sales would have been 1.5 per cent higher if not for severe snow and ice storms during the month.Target’s December same-store sales fell by 4.1 per cent. The retailer said this was in line with their expectations and that it had to slash prices to clear inventory.“These markdowns, combined with additions to our accounts receivable allowance, will put additional pressure on our profitability in the fourth quarter,” the company said.Clothing retailers also struggled in December as customers trimmed spending. Macy’s said on Thursday it would close 11 stores and that same-store sales in December were down by 4 per cent. The company also slashed its full-year earnings forecast.Limited Brands, which own Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw same-store sales fall by 10 per cent in December as it offered deep discounts to clear inventory. The company also slashed its fourth quarter earnings outlook.
160;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-12-22T20:07:47Z;When managers say suit yourself;;"When a case was made for Chubb employees to choose the hours that suit them, John Finnegan, chief executive of the US insurance group, was unconvinced.“To be honest, I initially viewed the reported benefits of flexible work hours with some scepticism,” he says. “As most CEOs would, I saw it as an employee accommodation programme with a cost. I didn’t know you could at the same time maintain or increase productivity.”He was persuaded to back a trial of a programme devised by the Bold Initiative, a New York non-profit organisation, because it incorporated targets for improving performance and held teams and their managers accountable for achieving these.The results convinced him the approach could work even in tough times, because of its positive impact on productivity and employee engagement. Under the programme, managers set the parameters and approve the work plan, but team members collectively determine “leaner” ways of working that accommodate individual flexibility.The impact of flexible working in a downturn is the subject of fierce debate. When the UK government announced this month it would press on with extending the right to request flexible working to parents of children up to 16, some business lobbies protested that the measure would impose additional costs. The EEF manufacturers’ body called it “a bad message to business”. A government official countered that the benefits outweighed the costs and would help the economy through recession.Since its first pilot with 17 people in 2004, Chubb has brought 400 of its 10,000 workforce into the programme and now plans to extend it further.“It’s a business initiative first and foremost,” says Rolando Orama (pictured left), a senior vice-president who heads Chubb’s Chicago operation, handling claims across the Midwest. Of his team of 163 people, 120 work non-standard schedules. The others stick to a regular 8am-5pm routine by choice.One team member starts at 6am and finishes at 2.30pm so she can complete her college studies. Another spends Fridays in summer working from his boat on Lake Michigan, using a laptop, mobile phone and instant messaging. A third has cut eight hours of commuting by working at home twice a week, which gives him more time for his young family and essentials such as doctors’ appointments.Everyone’s schedule is available to view on a shared calendar, so the team knows whom to call in an emergency. The programme is suspended for business presentations that everyone must attend and during holiday peaks.Mr Orama, who works a day a week from home, reels off a list of improvements in the team’s productivity: an increase from 82 per cent to 91 per cent in customers contacted within 24 hours; a jump from 90 per cent to 100 per cent in timely benefit payments to claimants; and business cover extended by three hours a day thanks to some employees starting earlier and others finishing later.Team members have also become more adaptable to change – useful in today’s economic turbulence – and more willing to act on their own initiative. “If there’s an unexpected absence, they jump in,” he says.In the US, Barack Obama, the president-elect, has spoken positively about flexibility. The Washington Post last month cited a letter he wrote to Department of Labor employees, saying: “I believe that it’s time we stopped talking about family values and start pursuing policies that truly value families, such as paid family leave, flexible work schedules and telework, with the federal government leading by example.”Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve and head of Mr Obama’s economic recovery advisory board, is also a board director of the Bold organisation. Bea Fitzpatrick, Bold’s chief executive, believes its emphasis on business benefits, as well as individual employees’ needs, makes it a tool for the downturn. “We’re finding the more constrained companies are financially, the more interested they are in spreading this approach,” she says.Employees have come up with more efficient ways of working at the headquarters of Costco, says John Matthews, head of human resources at the warehouse club chain. Traditionally, for example, people in the accounting department worked overtime during peak periods and were underemployed at slacker times. “When we turned the issue over to our employees, they designed a schedule to eliminate all overtime, speed up the [book] closing process and maintain the high level of accuracy in the reports,” he says.Productivity has improved, and overtime has fallen by 42 per cent year on year. About 10 per cent of the 3,000 staff at the Seattle HQ are enlisted in a Bold programme, and more will join them next year. “People generally appreciate us listening to them and not wasting their time,” Mr Matthews says.Flexible schedules offer another business benefit in difficult economic times, according to Patty Dudek, vice-president of IBM’s WebSphere development, which develops software for customers’ e-business applications. The company recently introduced round-the-clock software development, with work passing between 1,000 developers in different time zones. The global team can update a product in four to six months, versus 18-24 months five years ago.Rather like the Bold initiative, IBM’s approach combines a focus on productivity with individual flexibility. Many developers split their working day into chunks around their personal duties and this makes the team more responsive, Ms Dudek says.“Customers need something different than they said they needed three months ago, and they need it in days to respond to new business priorities,” she says. “If we did not support flexibility, I’d be so constrained by how quickly I could react.”As a senior executive, she also works a flexible schedule and believes it is a way of retaining and motivating good people. “If we want top talent to work on something and we give them all the flexibility they need to balance their lives, they’re then more willing and able to step up to the challenge when we need them to drop everything.”At Chubb, Mr Finnegan does not easily envisage flexibility applying to top executives such as himself, on the grounds that “it’s tough to measure what I do every day in terms of output”.But he is convinced of the advantages of a performance-driven approach. He likens it to the way Toyota gained competitive advantage in the global motor industry in the 1980s with its “lean” manufacturing methods.“It’s making people more responsible and accountable for what they do, like the Toyota breakthrough in the way cars are made,” he says. “The test is that they can do it better than they’ve done it before.”"

JPMorgan Chase sank 10.7 per cent to $29.94 after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, told CNBC Television the bank has endured a “terrible” December.Real estate investment trusts sustained particularly heavy losses. The FTSE REITS index sank 15.5 per cent and came under pressure from a bearish Citigroup note on the banking sector.“We now forecast a severe credit cycle in commercial and commercial real estate,” the analysts said.XL Capital, which sank 33 per cent on Wednesday to the lowest level since the company went public, fell a further 11.8 per cent to $3.44. The insurer said it expected to report losses of at least $200m from its alternative investment portfolio and appointed Goldman Sachs to “explore value-enhancing opportunities”.Visa was one of the bright spots for much of the day after the credit card group reiterated earnings forecasts for next year, but it too succumbed to stand 2 per cent lower at $52.09 by the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 2.9 per cent at 873.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.2 per cent lower at 8,565.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.7 per cent weaker at 1,507.88.Advances in oil stocks had helped the wider market stay broadly flat for much of a session as crude rose sharply ahead of the Opec meeting next week.However, the sector finished lower after a heavy sell-off into the close. Exxon Mobil, at one point on course for its highest close since August, finished 0.1 per cent lower at $80.02.Elsewhere, glum economic data, downbeat corporate outlooks and signs that political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the ailing car industry held the market back.General Motors and Ford fell 10.4 per cent to $4.12 and 10.8 per cent to $2.90, respectively, amid fears that Republican critics could scupper $14bn in emergency loans to the industry.“The risk of Senate non-passage remains substantial,” wrote JPMorgan’s car manufacturing analysts in a note to clients.Meanwhile, the number of new workers filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped more than forecast last week to a 26-year high, according to the Labor Department. The figures came after traders were shocked by last week’s non-farm payrolls figures, which showed the biggest drop in 34 years.Meanwhile, industrial stocks suffered following a glut of gloomy news from companies in the sector.Reduced earnings guidance from Cummins and Stanley Works pushed shares in the pair down 7.1 per cent to $24.92 and 5.9 per cent to $32.30, respectively. The sector was one of the worst performing, down 4.2 per cent overall.Consumer stocks also performed badly. Among the heaviest losses, Urban Outfitters sank 20.6 per cent to $14.98 after the clothing and housewares retailer warned sales could worsen over the crucial festive season.Costco lost 3 per cent to $52.06 even after the warehouse chain said quarterly profit rose slightly, as strong results from its petrol stations helped the figures.Lorillard, down 3.9 per cent to $58.70, was among the losers in tobacco stocks after Goldman Sachs downgraded its view of the sector to “neutral”.Goldman analysts warned that a probable increase in excise tax could push volumes down 7 per cent next year.
162;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-12-04T20:24:02Z;US retailers suffer worst month this decade;;US retailers experienced their worst month this decade in November, as stores such as Macy’s, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch reported double-digit falls in comparable store sales amid the economic gloom.But Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, led a small band of retailers that managed to deliver comparable sales growth during the month, beating its own forecast with a 3.4 per cent increase.The retailer said it had seen rises in both customer numbers and average spending per trip, and had benefited from the rapid fall in petrol prices.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said it was “extremely difficult” to provide sales guidance in the current environment, but Wal-Mart forecast December comparable sales at the high end of its quarterly growth estimate of 1-3 per cent.Costco, a warehouse club, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent at US stores, excluding petrol. Its rival BJ’s said sales rose 6.2 per cent. Sales at Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s warehouse unit, were up 3.5 per cent.Reflecting increasingly value-focused shopping, Family Dollar, which operates a large chain of small hard-discount stores, also reported a 2.1 per cent gain in comparable sales for the quarter ending November 30.Elsewhere, the figures were largely bleak. Poor performances were exacerbated by a difficult comparison with last year, when the Thanksgiving holiday fell earlier in November and boosted seasonal shopping at the end of the month.While several retailers reported strong sales at the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales, it was not enough to make up for the weakness.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index fell 1.8 per cent, the worst monthly performance this decade. Without Wal-Mart, the index would have dropped 9.3 per cent.Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 10.4 per cent drop in comparable sales, worse than its predicted range of a fall of 6-9 per cent.Department stores also struggled, with Macy’s down 13.3 per cent, JC Penney down 11.9 per cent, and Kohl’s down 17.5 per cent. Among speciality clothing retailers, Gap was down 10 per cent, while comparable sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, dropped 28 per cent.
163;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-11-19T03:09:38Z;Call for simpler ‘ethical’ labelling on goods;;Goods produced under ethical consumer labels help too few producers in poor countries and should be supplemented by a broader standard, says a new report.The Overseas Development Institute, a London-based think-tank, says that poor farmers would benefit from a simpler “good for development” label as well as existing standards like the Fairtrade mark.“It is likely that there are many exports which are of significant benefit for developing country producers but which are not explicitly recognised as such, as they may not qualify for any of the existing ethical labelling schemes,” say the report’s authors, Karen Ellis and Jodie Keane.They point to a study of green beans purchased from Guatemalan growers by the US retail giant Costco, which benefited poor farming families but were not covered by any of the ethical trading schemes. A “good for development” label on such produce would show consumers that incomes were being raised and poverty relieved, simply by buying from developing country farmers.The report highlights a debate among development economists and experts on the best way of harnessing consumer power to help producers in poor countries. A proliferation of ethical consumer labels, such as Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and the Forestry Stewardship Council, bestow marks in return for products’ meeting certain criteria, often including environmental and social standards. Fairtrade also guarantees minimum prices to farmers.But the ODI report argues that such labels benefit too few producers. Even in the UK, one of Fairtrade’s most developed markets, Fairtrade-labelled produce made up less than 0.5 per cent of food and non-alcoholic drinks sales in 2007. The certification fees charged to producers who sign up for Fairtrade and the cost to retailers of establishing new supply chains and trading relationships, appear to have restrained the growth of the market, the report said.Barbara Crowther, a spokeswoman for Fairtrade in the UK, said: “We think that Fairtrade is already a ‘good for development’ mark.” Simply labelling all developing country exports as being good for poverty reduction could reduce pressure on buyers to raise standards, she said.Gareth Thomas, UK minister for trade and development, said: “We need to look at ways of expanding beyond labels such as the successful Fairtrade mark to look at environmental and workers’ rights issues.”
164;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-10-08T21:58:57Z;US high-end retailers battered;;Cut-backs by America’s wealthiest shoppers amid Wall Street’s woes drove down sales at the country’s most exclusive stores in September, according to sales data released on Wednesday by leading retailers.Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based retailer which operates 64 luxury stores, said comparable sales at its stores fell 15.8 per cent during the month, while its overall revenues fell 11.1 per cent.The retailer’s monthly sales declines are the worst reported by the retailer since September 2002.Neiman Marcus warned last month that it expected its three New York area stores, which include Bergdforf Goodman in Manhattan, to be hit by Wall Street’s troubles ands by a decline in spending by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar.Its September sales also reflected the hurricanes that affected its Texas stores.Burt Tansky, CEO, said that “based on our September performance and the current economic environment, we expect customer demand will remain weak for an extended period of time”, and warned that the retailer had higher than expected inventory levels.Saks, which derives 20 per cent of its revenue from its flagship store in New York, reported a 10 per cent fall in its comparable sales and a 11.1 per cent fall in total revenues. Nordstrom, which targets a more mainstream affluent customer, reported a 9.6 per cent drop in comparable sales and a 5.8 per cent fall in revenues.Saks said in a statement that it “anticipates the extremely challenging economic environment will continue”, and said it was now expecting sales in the second hald of its fiscal year to drop below its estimate of a low-single digit decline.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that ”the consumer environment has been impacted by events in the financial markets over the past month”, as the retailer lowered its third quarter earnings forecast by 17 cents, to 32 to 37 cents per share.The dramatic slowdown in spending at Neiman, whose holiday gift catalogue this year includes exotic luxury items such as a $60,000 personalised portrait Lego replicas, contrasted with the more robust performance at Wal-Mart and at discount warehouse clubs focused on low cost food and basics.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s stores and supercenters rose 2 per cent during the month, while sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores rose 4.6 per cent. Costco and BJ’s, the discount club stores, saw US store sales excluding fuel increase by 6 and 5.6 per cent respectively.Richard Galanti, Costco’s CFO, told investors that the retailer was seeing high double digit sales of food and grocery items, while sales of bigger ticket items such as televisions, jewellery and furniture were declining.Stores more focused on discretionary purchases struggled. Target, the discounter that has a heavy focus on fashion and housewares, saw its comparable sales drop 3 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 12.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Both retailers cut their third quarter earnings forecasts.Clothing retailers - some of whom report sales on Thursday - have also seen falling sales. American Eagle said its comparable sales were down 6 per cent, and lowered its earnings forecast, while youth brand Zumiez reported a 9 per cent drop.The gloomy same store sales numbers followed consumer spending data released earlier this week by MasterCard Advisors’ Spending Pulse, which reported declines in all sales categories in September.The report, based on MasterCard credit card spending data and estimates of other forms of payment, said sales at speciality retail stores - which include clothing sellers and department stores - fell 7.7 per cent aganst the same period last year, following a 4.1 per cent decline in August.
165;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-10-08T21:30:50Z;Climbing Wal-Mart;;As the world financial system is crashing down around investors’ ears, it may be wise to put spare cash into stocks of soup, rather than soup stocks. Even Wal-Mart, the biggest retailer in the world with sales last year topping $370bn, will not be immune to a global economic slowdown. Yet for those who have to keep money in the stock market, the resilience of the discount retailer from Bentonville, Arkansas, is a rare outpost of security.That is not entirely surprising. Wal-Mart has a reassuringly strong balance sheet. A large user of commercial paper, markets have tightened, but not closed to the double-A rated issuer. With $7bn of cash on the balance sheet, debt due next year could be simply repaid, rather than refinanced if necessary. Fixed charge cover – a measure of a company’s operating profit relative to its financial obligations – is over seven times, more than double the retailing average.The group also benefits from consumers rediscovering thrift – autumn advertising campaigns in the US are heavily emphasising value. Monthly sales data from retailers out on Wednesday confirmed the bleak picture for discretionary spending. Wal-Mart, and discount club Costco, reported solid growth, while clothes retailers and department stores are starting to discover that not even steep discounts can tempt shoppers through the doors.Yet, handily for Wal-Mart, the shift in consumer attitudes comes at a time when a three year plan to improve performance is bearing fruit. Under Wal-Mart USA head Eduardo Castro-Wright, centralised control has been loosened. Marketing efforts now appear to match what is happening in-store. In a timely move, the group began to scale back openings last year to concentrate on raising returns. Expecting a return to the ten year median earnings multiple of 25 times would be nonsensical. Such exuberant valuations are long gone. But on 15 times forward earnings, Wal-Mart is music to panicked souls.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

166;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;FX in Singapore: it’s all about long hours and volume;;"Mustafa is one of the shopping delights of Singapore. The 75,000 square foot main shop in a group of historic buildings in Little India has a reputation for having the best prices on goods from jewellery to cameras to milk from the city-state’s only dairy herd.It is also open 24 hours a day. Tour operators schedule night-shopping trips to Mustafa for foreign visitors.Arie Adler, global head of foreign exchange sales for UBS, is one of Mustafa’s biggest fans. FX dealers, he thinks, could learn a lot from Mustafa’s “pile it high, sell it cheap” business model.He makes foreign exchange dealing seem unattractive. “Would you want to invest in a business that has razor-thin margins that collapse by 10 per cent every year?” Mr Adler says.“If you don’t think that’s bad enough there’s competition like the Olympics, and there’s total transparency.”However, he says, that is not so different from the environment in which Mustafa, or some of his other favourite retailers, such as the US warehouse club Costco, operate, and still make profits.“It’s all about about pumping as much volume as we can,” he says.Financial companies are too often dazzled by high-margin businesses, such as private banking, and focus on growing sales without thinking about profits or the risk involved.The Harvard Business School professor, Michael Porter, identified three types of generic strategies companies can follow: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.Most financial companies concentrate on differentiation – for example, by offering better service than their competitors – or by focusing on one particular sector.Few aim to be the lowest cost provider in an industry, by ruthlessly focusing on economies of scale. But that seems to be what Mr Adler is trying to do.The secret, in both discount retailing and foreign exchange trading, he says, is computerisation to identify costs and keep them under control. These days almost all the tickets are processed without human intervention – that includes electronic credit checks “that take a millisecond”, an update to the bank’s risk data base, and an electronic instruction via the Swift network that asks for payment two days later.“Nine years ago, we were trading it all manually,” Mr Adler says. “We, and others, transformed the business by using technology. We know exactly, to the cent, how much it costs to generate a trading ticket.“I can squeeze that cost and improve margin, or I can produce more volume. Ideally I do both.”That takes a lot of money. He says UBS invests around $85m a year on its trading systems. “It’s a huge barrier to entry. That’s why new players are not coming in. They can’t compete with the likes of us or Deutsche Bank, so they tend to focus on a niche.”Smaller FX dealers may, for example, focus on creating better software to present prices.The improvement in technology opens up new market segments. Mr Adler is looking at extending FX services directly to small and medium size enterprises. He has already hired one person in Singapore to develop
the business, and is about
to hire another in Hong Kong.“SMEs are growing around the world. They are not serviced properly. I think they will become a major force – in Asia alone there’s humungous demand.“That demand doesn’t exist in the US where SMEs usually try to sell to other companies within the US rather than exporting abroad. [Asian SMEs] need to manage their cash.”Few, if any, SMEs in places like Indonesia or Malaysia have treasury departments.“Often the finance director has breakfast with the owner, who might well be a relative, who then signs the checks.”The lessons learned in FX trading can also be applied to trading other asset classes, such as equities. “In foreign exchange, we are the only business that’s open 24 hours a day, five days a week.“The more hours we operate, the more we are able to leverage our cost base. This can be replicated for other financial products.”He thinks it is very likely that within 10 years shares will be traded around the world much as FX is today. “I don’t think there’s a product less sexy than FX,” he says.“But it can generate a huge amount of profit if you do it right. And there’s a lot that other people [in the financial industry] can learn from us.”"
167;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-09-04T18:36:25Z;Thriftiness boosts US lower-cost stores;;US shoppers maintained their focus on keeping costs down as they embarked on the “back-to-school” shopping season, favouring Wal-Mart and other low-cost retailers over department and fashion stores, according to August sales figures.Wal-Mart saw sales at its supercentre and discount stores open at least a year rise 2.8 per cent, led by its grocery and health sales, which includes pharmacy. Together with its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, sales rose 3 per cent, ahead of its forecast of between 1 and 2 per cent growth.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said the retailer had gained market share as a result of the relative strength of its business. The retailer forecast comparable sales growth of between 2 and 3 per cent for September.Wal-Mart again outdid Target, its main rival, which aims at attracting more discretionary spending. Target’s comparable sales fell 2.1 per cent.JC Penney and Kohls, the department stores, reported comparable sales falls of 4.9 and 5.8 per cent respectively on Wednesday.However, other price-focused stores did comparatively well, with the Family Dollar chain reporting a 3.6 per cent increase in sales at its network of small neighbourhood stores. Costco and BJ’s, the bulk warehouse club stores, reported US comparable sales gains of 6 per cent and 7.7 per cent, excluding their fuel sales.At BJ’s, bulk food sales far outstripped other goods, up 11 per cent, against a 2 per cent increase for general merchandise, in another indication of shoppers focusing on saving money.In teen fashion – normally a beneficiary of back-to-school spending – the lower-priced Aeropostale chain reported a 13 per cent in­crease in comparable sales, while Abercrombie & Fitch saw comparable sales fall 11 per cent.Ken Perkins, of Retail Metrics, said the data showed that “necessities have taken centre-stage against a backdrop of rising prices and less discretionary income”.Retail Metrics’ monthly index of same-store sales rose 2 per cent.Sanjay Srikanth of retail consultants AT Kearney said the back-to-school performance underlined concerns about the coming holiday season. “Everyone is tightening their inventories and expecting a fairly difficult holiday season relative to last year.”The S&P 500 was down 1.8 per cent on Thursday at lunchtime amid broad-based weakness. The S&P retail index was down 1.4 per cent, led by a 6.6 per cent fall in TJ Maxx and a decline of 5.9 per cent in Abercrombie and Fitch. Wal-Mart was up 1.3 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
168;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-08-10T16:59:22Z;Frugality steals into richest US households;;The mood of frugality that has led US consumers to seek out discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Costco has increasingly spread to the affluent and wealthy, according to a survey of attitudes in some of America’s richest households.The research, based on interviews with 625 respondents who represent the wealthiest 10 per cent of US households, found that 80 per cent said they were looking closely at every spending category to see where they could save – up from 68 per cent in April.The survey, carried out at the end of June by Harrison Group and American Express Publishing, focuses on households with discretionary income of at least $100,000, after taxes, mortgage and education costs and other regular payments.Fifty six per cent of respondents said they were buying fewer big-ticket items now than they did six months ago, while 82 per cent said they waited for something to go on sale before they bought it – a 15-point increase since December 2007.Jim Taylor, of Harrison Group, said the results showed that “contrary to reports on wealthy families’ inoculation against the effects of recession, many at the top of the wealth spectrum are cutting back as well”.In an indication of the softening luxury demand in the US, Neiman Marcus, America’s most exclusive fashion department store, reported that its sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.4 per cent in the three months from May to July.With sales flat at $982m – following a decline in overall sales in the previous quarter – the first half of the year has seen Neiman’s worst sales since 2002, when luxury sales collapsed after the September 11 attacks.Harry Winston, the jeweller which sells diamond pieces ranging from $18,500 to several million dollars, has also been hit by the broader economic downturn, with US transactions down in the first three months of the year. Tiffany has also seen comparable sales fall outside New York.European luxury brands, however, have continued to report comparatively strong revenues in dollar terms from the US, which will be supported by both tourist spending, and by new store openings.LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton handbags and Dom Pérignon champagne, said last month that at constant exchange rates its US revenue increased by 7 per cent during the first half of this year. PPR’s Gucci Group said that its US revenues increased 10 per cent in its second quarter from April to June, improving “significantly” on its first quarter. Richemont, owner of Montblanc and Cartier, saw US sales increase 20 per cent in the same quarter in dollar terms.These leading luxury brands may take comfort from evidence of brand loyalty in the Harrison/AmEx Publishing survey. While the majority of respondents said they were cutting back on most categories, Cara David, co-director of the study, said there was continued spending on trusted brands.“In fashion, the well-to-do are making sure they need what they buy and reducing the number of items they buy without shifting away from the brands they prefer,” she said.The wealthy’s focus on trusted brands seems to reflect similar behaviour in the wider market. Executives at Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, argue that austerity-minded US supermarket customers will still opt for proven brands of items such as toilet paper and nappies against cheaper alternatives.
169;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-08-07T21:06:44Z;Wall Street stocks fall on AIG losses;;US stocks fell back for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as further losses at AIG hurt the financial sector and Wal-Mart posted disappointing July sales figures.AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime losses, slumped as much as 19.1 per cent, its biggest one-day drop in 39 years, after posting a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss of $5.4bn. By the close, the stock was down 18.1 per cent to $23.84.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Although we would be surprised to see large writedowns of the same magnitude over the next two quarters, we believe that the risk of additional impairment remains, adding to investor concerns about capital deficiency. In addition, we believe that further downgrades could be on the cards.”Meanwhile, Citigroup said it would buy back more than $7bn worth of auction rate securities and take a $100m fine as part of an agreement to settle claims that it mis-sold the instruments to clients. Citigroup lost 4.3 per cent to $18.85.The sell-off in financials gathered pace in mid-afternoon after Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade American Express’s debt rating and the sector closed down 5 per cent.JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent to $39.81, Bank of America dipped 5.8 per cent to $31.52 and American Express slid 4.2 per cent to $36.40.Consumer-facing stocks faced headwinds from volatile oil prices and some poor sales data from retailers.Wal-Mart said same-store sales grew less than expected last month and forecast slower sales growth in August, which suggested that the temporary fillip from tax rebates was beginning to fade.The shares slid 6.3 per cent, the most in six years, to $56.96 on that bleak prospect.Meanwhile, Whole Foods and Kimberly-Clark dipped 5.9 per cent to $18.88 and 3.5 per cent to $58.48 respectively.That overshadowed better-than-expected July sales for Costco Wholesale and an improved outlook from JC Penney. Costco shares rose 0.2 per cent to $65.82 while JC Penney added 6.1 per cent to $33.53.The consumer discretionary sector fell 2 per cent as Target and Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 4.7 per cent to $45.76 and 10.6 per cent to $49.80 respectively after they posted disappointing same store sales in July.Markets took another leg down after the release of the latest batch of numbers on employment.The number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 7,000 to 455,000 from 448,000 a week earlier. That is the highest level in six years.All 10 leading industry groups closed in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1.8 per cent to 1,266.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.9 per cent to 11,431.43 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,355.73On Wednesday stocks climbed to their highest levels since the end of June, shrugging off morning worries about wider-than-expected losses at Freddie Mac as oil prices dropped and positive results buoyed the technology sector.So far this earnings season, more than 400 S&P 500 companies have reported results and, on average, profit has declined by about 21 per cent.Information technology companies have posted some of the best performances. Their profits have grown by an average of 18 per cent this quarter.On Thursday, Teradata led the sector higher. The data storage software provider reported second-quarter profits that beat analysts’ estimates and its shares rose 6.6 per cent to $24.40.The sector was among the best performers, giving up only 0.1 per cent.Semiconductor stocks also made ground after Citigroup analysts suggested Intel was on course to meet “aggressive” third-quarter revenue growth targets thanks to the popularity of its Atom chip.Intel climbed 3.8 per cent to $23.67, Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.8 per cent to $5.03 while SanDisk added 6.1 per cent to $16.17.Markets also took a measure of solace from the most recent housing data, which showed an unexpected bounce in pending home sales, although homebuilder stocks themselves were largely unmoved.
170;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-08-07T18:26:30Z;Hard-up US shoppers spurn bigger stores;;The boost to US retailers from about $100bn of tax rebate cheques has proved short-lived, with leading chains on Thursday reporting sluggish or falling sales in July, while Wal-Mart warned of slowing sales ahead.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said it expected August sales in stores open at least a year to grow by between 1 and 2 per cent, after reporting 3 per cent sales growth in July.“With the end of the stimulus checks, we know consumers are spending more cautiously, and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month,” said Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US business.Consumers received about $100bn in rebate checks between April and mid-July as part of the Bush administrations’ economic stimulus package from earlier this year. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its index of comparable retail sales for July rose 2.3 per cent.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that positive factors such as warm weather and the back-to-school shopping season “could not overcome broader macro-economic drags”.The latest monthly sales figures from retailers underlined shifts in US shopping habits identified by Procter & Gamble and other suppliers, as more frugal consumers turn to discount stores, warehouse clubs and to hard discount “dollar stores” and make fewer shopping trips to reduce fuel costs.Mr Castro-Wright said Wal-Mart was also continuing “to see improvement in our customer traffic, relative to last year”, an indication that the low-cost stores are attracting shoppers from rivals.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller and more upmarket competitor, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in comparable sales, and predicted a further decline in August.Costco, the largest US warehouse club, also reported healthy results for the month, with same store sales excluding fuel sales up 6 per cent in the US.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small hard-discount stores, saw its comparable sales rise 4.6 per cent, following an 8 per cent increase in June.Department stores and clothing retailers continued to feel the pressure on their monthly sales figures, as they try to stock less, in response to slower demand, and avoid ending up with excess inventory that has to be cleared at sale prices.JC Penney, the mid-range department store whose performance has tracked the broader decline in consumer spending, reported a 6.5 per cent fall in comparable sales, although last July’s numbers were boosted by a shift in reporting of back-to-school sales. But the company predicted sales growth in the low single-digits in August. It also raised its earnings guidance for the current quarter, from 38 cents to 50 to 52 cents, citing effective cost management and inventory control. Its shares rose more than 7 per cent.Its rival, Kohl’s, reported a 10 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. Larry Montgomery, its CEO, said that the reduced inventory had depressed sales but led to improved gross margins.Gap, the largest speciality retailer, said its comparable sales fell 5 per cent, while the figure for its Old Navy stores was down 16 per cent. However, the company said it had successfully increased its margins, it also raised its earnings guidance, to $1.30 to $1.35 from its previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.27.
171;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-25T18:59:46Z;The lost decade;;"The S&P 500’s earnings season is in full swing, but for US equity investors, the outlook is hardly clearer than it was a month ago.Investors who made short-term punts on financial stocks in the past fortnight could have made a killing, or been killed, depending on the day of the bet: financial shares had gained more than 20 per cent in 10 days, and then on Thursday suffered their worst fall since 2000. At such times it is tempting for amateur day-traders to ride the roller-coaster. That temptation is worth resisting: bear markets are unforgiving playgrounds.For the longer-term investor, a mixed earnings season has provided little information. Few investors, anyway, are setting too much store on recent earnings. Commodity companies are enjoying windfalls that may or may not be repeated. Bank results are viewed with suspicion, because too much lies beneath the surface to provide great confidence. For the record, they were awful, but not as awful as investors had expected.Outside those two headline-grabbing sectors, the news has perhaps been mildly better than expected – a statement that owes as much to expectations as to any true signs of recovery. Some bellwether companies such as Costco and American Express disappointed; others, such as Whirlpool, provided more reasons to be cheerful.What is a patient investor to make of it all? There is as much reason as ever to recommend the time-honoured strategy of gradually buying a diversified portfolio of stocks and then holding them for the long haul. In fact, there is more reason than there has been for half a generation. Such a strategy, a no-brainer in the 1980s and 1990s, has looked less robust since then. The past 10 years have been a lost decade for US equities: the S&P 500 has recently been at risk of falling below the levels of a decade ago; it is already well down on where it was in 1999 and 2000. Total returns have failed to beat inflation over the past decade. This is not the bill of goods that patient investors thought they were buying.But that can hardly be surprising. By 1999, it was clear to the few remaining level-headed stock-watchers that the ratio of price to long-term earnings was not just high, but far higher than it had ever been before. From such heights disappointment, even over the long term, was all but inevitable.It is too soon to call the bottom of the bear market, despite a cheerier couple of weeks. And yet: equities have been too expensive for much of the past 10 years. There is at last the prospect that may change."
172;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-23T21:56:45Z;Costco warning adds to US retail gloom;;Costco, one of the largest US discount retailers, on Wednesday warned that its fourth-quarter profits would be “well below” expectations due to rising inflation and higher energy prices.Costco’s US sales have been strong as consumers “trade down” to less expensive stores in the face of the slowing economy.But the company has been reluctant to pass on rising costs to its customers - a sign that it is seeking to protect market share against rivals such as Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ Wholesale Club.Costco said it was “holding selling price points to help drive sales and [to] maintain the confidence of our members”.The retailer said its earnings would also appear weak as higher oil prices affected earnings by its petrol stations, compared with strong results from petrol sales last year.But the company said it would increase its share buyback plan by $1bn, in addition to the $5.8bn plan previously announced.Costco also said it would open fewer stores next year, signalling lower expectations for consumer spending.The warning by Costco, which sells products in bulk to more affluent shoppers, adds to indications that the slowdown is hurting even higher-end consumers. Credit card company American Express said it saw weakness among its wealthiest cardholders when it published earnings this week.Shares in Costco, up almost 18 per cent over the past year, fell by almost 11 per cent in morning trading. Its warning also sent shares of Wal-Mart and BJ Wholesale Club lower on Wednesday on fears that weakness in the sector was spreading.“Factors negatively affecting our fourth-quarter earnings outlook arise largely from inflation, particularly as to energy costs,” said Richard Galanti, chief financial officer. But he said he foresaw “no meaningful changes” to sales.Costco now expects fourth-quarter earnings to fall far short of current Wall Street estimates of $1 per share.“Margin is the issue,” wrote David Strasser, a Bank of America analyst, in a note about Costco.Food prices could also take a toll. About 60 per cent of Costco’s sales come from its supermarket business. Mr Galanti said Costco’s vendors had raised prices. The company was forced to raise prices quickly on goods such as rotisserie chicken.The warning comes after Supervalu, the second-largest US chain, said earnings would be lower than expected because of higher commodity costs and weaker spending.Safeway, the third-largest supermarket chain, has also reduced its sales forecast.
173;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-23T21:39:09Z;Wall Street advances as oil prices drop;;US stocks advanced for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices dropped sharply and lawmakers moved closer to a deal on legislation to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Crude oil prices fell back for a second day, slipping below $125 a barrel and helping to offset some mixed earnings reports from consumer-oriented companies.In the consumer discretionary sector, Whirlpool shares added 12.5 per cent to $76.69 after the appliance maker said second-quarter profits had fallen less than expected. The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent
174;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-23T20:06:55Z;Discounter cash blow;;Here’s a new financial indicator - the $6 chicken. Explaining the profit warning that caused Costco shares to drop by 12 per cent on Thursday, finance director Richard Galanti talked about the difficulty of raising prices on customer favourites like the hitherto $5 chicken. Unfortunately, the largest US warehouse discount retailer is stuck between cash-strapped consumers on the one hand, and suppliers pushing through price rises on the other. Traffic through stores is up, as the group uses competitive petrol pricing to lure shoppers, but Costco is struggling to pass on rising costs.Such weakness from a big discounter, which up until now has benefited from consumers trading down, adds to the darkening economic outlook. Costco aims to sell high quality branded products at bargain prices, and its customers largely represent America’s aspirant middle class – typical household income is $85,000, compared to the US average of about $67,000. Consumers are clearly watching every penny, and appear to be moving from merely trading down to cutting back on spending altogether.Meanwhile, rising energy and food costs are prompting manufacturers to push harder for price increases. Pockets of deflation remain in consumer electronics and clothing, but otherwise the pressure is broadly spread, with many suppliers demanding price rises of 5 to 10 per cent or more in recent weeks, according to Costco.The time lag between coughing up the extra money and then passing the increase onto customers eats into profitability. Costco talked up the tactic, arguing that it has customer loyalty and its long term prospects in mind. But the reality is that competition between retailers leaves it with little choice. Producer price inflation is running well ahead of the consumer variety, and someone has to take the hit. Slimmer margins for retailers point to who that is. The list of sectors that can remain resilient in the face of a slowing economy continues to shorten.Post and read comments on this Lex
175;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-21T20:58:15Z;Rising oil prices weigh on US stocks;;US equities ended a three-day winning streak on Monday as rising oil prices hit consumer-facing stocks and results from Bank of America failed to whet investor appetite for financial stocks.The day began positively, after Bank of America said second-quarter profits dropped 41 per cent to $3.41bn – a better result than analysts expected.American International Group also advanced strongly after Bank of America recommended buying the stock on the basis that Robert Willumstad, the new chief executive, might lead a turnround.Four of the five biggest banks in the US have reported estimate-beating results, allaying fears about the severity and duration of the credit crunch.Financials advanced 11.4 per cent last week and the Bank of America results added to that strong run – but only briefly.Bank of America shares rose 3.9 per cent to $28.56 and AIG climbed 5.8 per cent to $26.53 but the moves could not sustain a broader rally. The sector as a whole slipped 0.9 per cent.Investment banks fell 2.6 per cent led by Morgan Stanley. It lost 5.5 per cent to $36.46 after a stock offering for HBOS that it underwrote was undersubscribed, leaving it (and partners) with billions of dollars of stock in the UK bank.According to analysts at Barclays Capital just less than 20 per cent of the S&P 500 has reported, and earnings are down 32.6 per cent on a share-weighted basis year on year.Financials earnings have slumped 94.3 per cent. Excluding financials, earnings rose 12.4 per cent.Ian Scott, a strategist with Lehman Brothers, cut his end of year target for the S&P 500 by 11 per cent to 1,450 but said: “With stocks valued the way they are it might not take much of an improvement in either the oil price, interest rate expectations, earnings or the assessment of risk to bring forth a strong recovery.”The Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche Holding offered to buy the rest of Genentech, which makes cancer drugs, for $43.7bn. Genentech shares rose 14.7 per cent to $93.88.The healthcare sector fell 0.76 per cent after a study showed that Merck and Schering-Plough‘s cholesterol drug failed to reduce the risk of heart valve disease in a study. Schering-Plough sank 12.3 per cent to $18.80 while Merck fell 3.5 per cent to $36.36.The benchmark S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses but closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,260 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 11,467.34 points, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,279.53 points.Last week, US stock markets ended a six-week losing run after several banks reported solid earnings. Radical government measures to help mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a sharp drop in oil prices also helped.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rose again on Monday after Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, said Congress must pass his rescue plan for the two government-sponsored entities.Fannie rose 5.5 per cent to $14.13 while Freddie swung from early gains to a loss of 4.7 per cent to $8.75.Oil moved higher, bouncing off a six-week low and helping energy stocks. Schlumberger, the oil services company, added 5.4 per cent to $105.95 while the oil producer ExxonMobil rose 1.8 per cent to $82.98.The moves hurt consumer-facing stocks. The consumer discretionary and staples sectors slipped back 1.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. Expedia, the online travel agency, slipped 3.4 per cent to $18.54, Sherwin Williams, the paint maker, fell 6.8 per cent to $50.45.CostCo, the warehouse club, fell 3.6 per cent to $69.66 while Sara Lee, which makes meat products such as Jimmy Dean Sausages, slid 2.7 per cent to $12.87. Technology stocks were another weak spot after the activist investor Carl Icahn accepted three seats on Yahoo‘s expanded board as part of a compromise deal with the internet search company.Mr Icahn had been trying to oust the entire Yahoo board in an attempt to force the company to return to takeover negotiations with Microsoft. The compromise makes that less likely, analysts said.Yahoo fell 3.5 per cent to $21.67 and Microsoft slid 0.9 per cent to $25.64 and the sector lost 0.7 per cent.
176;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-07-10T14:42:35Z;Wal-Mart’s sales provide bright spot;;Wal-Mart provided some rare good news from the US consumer on Thursday, delivering surprisingly strong sales for June as retail spending was boosted by federal tax rebates.In a sign that consumers were trading down to cheaper stores amid soaring oil and food prices, same-store sales at Wal-Mart’s US stores rose 5.8 per cent, excluding fuel, above its own expectations of a 2-4 per cent rise.The increase eclipsed the strong growth seen across the industry fuelled by the tax rebates. US same-store sales in June rose an average of 4 per cent, according to consultant firm Retail Metrics. The data beat forecasts by the most since September 2003. Analysts had expected 2.6 per cent.Wal-Mart had mounted a major advertising campaign to let consumers know that they could cash their rebate cheques at its stores and the company said it had benefited from the government’s attempt to boost consumer spending.Industry sales were also boosted by warm weather, which lifted summer seasonal merchandise sales, as well as heavy price-cutting and promotions.Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose in June across all of its merchandise but the strongest growth came in the grocery, entertainment and health business lines. Net sales were up 11.5 per cent, including a 16.9 per cent rise in international sales and a 10.1 per cent jump in Wal-Mart’s domestic sales. The strong international sales were driven in part by results from Asda in the UK, which grew faster than the market because of higher customer traffic, the company said.Wal-Mart raised its profit forecast for the second quarter by two cents to 84 cents a share.“The key story is that the rebate cheques finally kicked in,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. “They started to flow at the beginning of May, but gas prices were still rising fast then.”Wal-Mart said post-rebate outlook remained cloudy but it expected same-store sales to grow 2-4 per cent in July.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 9 per cent jump in same-store sales in June in the US and an 11 per cent rise including its international business. Analysts had expected an 8.1 per cent advance in US sales.As the rebate spending wanes, expectations are that spending will slow. “We’re sceptical that people will keep spending and we expect a very tough time for retailers over the rest of the year,” said Mr Perkins.
177;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-06-05T20:47:55Z;Wall St up after surprise fall in jobless claims;;US stocks decisively ended a three day losing run on Thursday after initial jobless claims dropped unexpectedly to a six-week low while a late surge in oil prices helped energy stocks to their biggest one-day gains since early March.According to the US Department of Labor, first time claims for unemployment benefits fell 18,000 to 357,000 last week, after seasonal adjustments. Economists had expected a rise of 3,000.The numbers, when combined with better-than-expected private employment data released on Wednesday by payroll services group ADP, will give markets a little more confidence ahead of an employment report for May.Gains accelerated after reports showed robust retail sales growth in May. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, chain store sales rose a better-than-expected 3 per cent on a year-on-year, same-store basis.The main beneficiaries were the wholesale, drugstore and discount sectors, hinting that the consumer remains under pressure.A late rally in commodity-related stocksadded to the momentum, as did news that Verizon Communications had agreed to buy rival Alltel for $28.1bn in cash and debt from TPG and Goldman Sachs.A broad rally pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index 2 per cent higher to 1,404.04 – its biggest one-day gain since mid-April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,604.45 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.9 per cent to 2,549.94.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve unnerved markets with hawkish comments on inflation while the threat of credit ratings downgrades to major bond insurers snuffed out an early rally in financials. On Thursday, financials revived thanks to a positive note on Lehman Brothers, the embattled brokerage firm whose slumping share price has acted as a drag on sentiment for much of this week.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the shares could rise, as the “worst-case scenarios” were already priced in.“Net-net, we feel Lehman is not Bear,” Mr Mayo said, as “liquidity is not a major issue, in our view, while equity risk remains but does not seem outsized”.Lehman rose 7.8 per cent to $33.85 while an index of investment banking stocks advanced 2.8 per cent and the broader S&P 500 financials index added 2 per cent.The sector briefly pared gains in mid-afternoon, when S&P cut the financial strength rankings of MBIA and Ambac, before regaining its stride.Even the two bond insurers eventually closed higher, up 7.3 per cent to $6.04 and 5.2 per cent to $2.62 respectively, as traders covered short positions.Better-than-expected retail figures buoyed consumer-facing stocks. Costco Wholesale reported a 9 per cent rise in same-store sales in May, while Wal-Mart reported a 3.9 per cent rise. Wal-Mart rose 3.7 per cent to $59.80 and Costco added 3.8 per cent to $73.50.Gains in the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors were limited to 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, by a dramatic rise in commodities prices. Oil surged $5 after the dollar dropped against the euro on statements by the ECB suggesting interest rates may rise next month. That was a boon for materials and energy stocks, which added 3.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.Nucor climbed 8.6 per cent to $80.54 after it raised its forecasts for second-quarter profit because of rising demand for steel.Monsanto made ground, rising 5.3 per cent to $138.51 after Jefferies raised its price target from $140 to $152.Exxon Mobil and Chevron jumped 4.2 per cent to $89.31 and 4.1 per cent to $99.99 respectively. Airlines were in focus after a number of analysts upgraded stocks in the sector, pointing to decisions by the big carriers to slash jobs and capacity.Continental Airlines said it would cut 3,000 jobs and reduce capacity by 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to offset rising jet fuel prices.UAL added 10.6 per cent to $10.11. Delta and Northwest advanced 12.1 per cent to $6.84 and 15 per cent to $8.06 respectively. Continental rose 4.8 per cent to $15.20.The Verizon deal boosted the telecoms sector. Verizon added 5.4 per cent to $38.96, AT&T advanced 2.5 per cent to $39.46 while the broader sector rose 2.9 per cent.
178;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-06-05T14:58:53Z;Wal-Mart sales jump at rivals’ expense;;Sales at Wal-Mart again outperformed its competitors in May, suggesting that it the US discount retailer is set to benefit greatly from federal tax refunds aimed at stimulating the economy.Wal-Mart’s US outlets open at least a year saw sales rise 4 per cent, supported by strong activity in basic goods, including groceries and pharmacy products. Including its Sam’s Club discount warehouse stores, comparable sales rose 3.9 per cent, against the retailer’s original forecast of an increase in the flat-to-2 per cent range.But a range of other major retailers saw comparable sales fall in May. Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket competitor, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in comparable sales. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw their sales down 4.4 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, saw its global same store sales fall 14 per cent, with a huge 25 per cent fall in sales at its troubled Old Navy chain, and a 7 per cent fall in Gap brand stores.Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, said Wal-Mart’s comparatively strong performance had benefited in part from spending linked to tax refund cheques cashed by the retailer during the month that had exceeded $350m.While he said that it was not possible for the retailer to know how much of this money had been spent at its stores, he noted that “there’s been a positive difference from that”.Mr Schoewe said Wal-Mart is also benefiting from improved operations, merchandising and marketing at a time when its low cost format is in-line with consumers’ need to economise.May was the first month in which American households began receiving tax refunds of up to $600 per eligible adult under the federal economic stimulus package.Mr Schoewe said that Wal-Mart had also seen an increase in store visits during the month, with greater increases continuing to come at more affluent stores, suggesting that the retailer is gaining market share from competitors as customers “trade down” to the low-price discounter.Customers, he said, remained focused on basics, such as food and pharmacy, which “is a big portion of total basket”.He also noted that Wal-Mart’s home business saw its first growth in comparable sale for two years, which he suggested might reflect reports that Ameicans are saving money by going out less.“While they’re under pressure and disposable income is down it appears to us that that family might be spending more time at home …we’re seeing prepared meals, pizzas and those kind of things ramping up,” he said.Costco and BJ’s, both discount warehouse clubs, also delivered strong comparable sales growth, as Americans turned to their low cost bulk sales. BJ’s, which operates 178 stores mostly in the east of the US, said its sales of food rose 11 per cent, while non-food sales were flat. Its comparable sales excluding fuel increased 6.8 per cent.
179;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;US consumers hunt for discounts;;Lisa Rogers has always lived frugally. A former nurse, now living on a disability pension, her shopping expeditions in Kearny, New Jersey, are shaped by the discount coupons she collects from the weekly papers.She is a member of two discount warehouse clubs, Costco and BJs, but only shops there when she knows of “something that’s really on sale”.This week, Ms Rogers took her 10-year-old Ford Escort to her local Wal-Mart to fill a prescription using the retailer’s $4-a-month generic pharmacy programme.“Today’s shop is taking me to five or six places that are all pretty close to each other,” she said. “The bank, the drug store and so on. My aim is to keep my driving now to less than 25 miles a week.”With petrol prices running at about $3.60 a gallon in New Jersey – more than 50 cents above their levels last year – Americans are changing their shopping habits. That is even more the case in rural areas, where going to the local shop means a round trip of five miles or more.Jim Converse, a semi-retired urban development consultant in Vienna, Ohio, says that ever since he spent $70 filling up his Volvo station wagon recently, he no longer makes the drive to the local store for just one or two items.“That $70 really woke me up . . . I’m trying to fill up once every two weeks now, instead of once a week. So now we try to get 12 or 15 items on the shopping list before we go. We don’t go for the one or two items on the list any more, we’ll just wait and do without. And when we drive to the mall, we try to combine that with other things we need to do, too.”Data from both retailers and the federal government back up this picture. Supermarkets, for instance, have reported declines in customer traffic, but increases in the total basket of goods purchased on a single trip.The Federal Highway Administration reports that total miles driven fell 0.4 per cent in the 12 months ending in February, marking the first drop recorded since 1980-81, in spite of the increase in the number of vehicles on the road.Once they get to the shops, consumers are also making different decisions, as they feel the additional pressures of the housing slump and credit crunch. Fewer people are eating out at restaurants such as Ruby Tuesday’s and Applebee’s.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, says people are cutting back and looking for bargains.“You have consumers saying that because my spending on essential items such as food and energy is going up, I have to cut back on discretionary items, such as electronics and clothes and so forth,” he said.The frugal mood has spread across all sectors, with sales declines last month at stores ranging from Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion store, and JC Penney, the middle-of-the-road department store chain.However, April sales figures showed both Wal-Mart and the leading warehouse discount clubs outperforming the rest of the industry, reinforcing the picture of consumers searching out cheaper shopping.Wal-Mart, the largest US discounter, also saw traffic increases at its more than 3,500 Supercenters and discount stores, with gains in stores serving more affluent areas as more middle-class shoppers “trade down” to discount stores.Safeway, the supermarket group, has also cited evidence of customers opting for cheaper “store brand” packaged food. Steve Burd, chief executive, told investors recently that store brand sales were growing at six times the rate of national brands, and that the new frugality was evident in other decisions, such as opting for regular rather than premium coffee.But while American consumers may be looking to save money, many of them are still prepared to spend it. Eduardo Castro-Wright, the head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, noted this week that sales of home electronics continued to boom, a fact he attributed to customers spending more time at home rather than eating out.“Customers do shop for things they want, not just what they need,” he said.Mr Niemira at the ICSC also warned against overstating the slowdown in demand, and noted that household income was still growing, in spite of the frugal mood. “I describe it as a stealth recession – you see it in some indicators, but not dramatically so. The rhetoric has been worse than what the statistics show.”
180;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;As food costs rise, farmers cling to their subsidies;;Every crisis, it is said, is also an opportunity. But not, apparently, where farmers are involved.The leaders of international institutions including the World Bank and World Trade Organisation have exhorted governments to use the food crisis to reform policies that distort agricultural production and trade. They argue that fewer subsidies and import tariffs would provide incentives for farmers around the world to increase production and exports.Yet the effect has instead been to entrench farm lobbies in their existing positions, defending ever more fiercely the subsidies and tariff protection that they would now appear not to need. As one former official from the administration of President George W. Bush says: “Everyone is taking this situation and using it to advance an existing interest. There has been no changing of positions.”Although higher food prices have not enriched farmers everywhere, many with access to big markets have certainly gained. Those also tend to be the producers, particularly in Europe and America, who benefit from state subsidies and tariff protection.The most obvious example is in the US, where Congress and the White House have been painfully thrashing out plans for a farm bill that will set subsidies for the next five years. Capitol Hill and Mr Bush are in a stand-off, with the president threatening to take up his rarely used veto pen if subsidies are not reformed.With the farming sector flush with cash, the time would seem ripe for reform. Farmers complain that rising input costs, largely oil and fertiliser, have limited their gains from higher farm gate prices. But as the former administration official points out, the hard data show a big boost to income and wealth.The US Department of Agriculture forecasts farm sector income to increase again this year on top of big jumps in previous years, up 4.1 per cent to a level 51 per cent above the 10-year average. Debts have increased but nothing like as quickly as assets: soaring land prices mean that net equity in the farm sector has nearly doubled in the past five years, increasing by around $1,000bn (£514bn, €647bn).So what could happen? The US doles out subsidies to its farmers in two main ways: price-related payments, which kick in when prices fall, and “direct payments” that are related to overall acreage but not current output. Payments under the first type have dropped rapidly because of stratospheric prices. But farmers are reluctant to see those falls locked in by having a lower ceiling imposed on overall payments – defying demands from America’s partners in the faltering “Doha round” of global trade talks.Bob Stallman, a rice-grower from Texas and president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents many subsidy recipients, says: “Does someone want to guarantee me from now on as a farmer that prices will stay where they are? Anyone who has been involved in farming for a long time knows that what goes up can come down.”US farmers also argue that prices are themselves also subject to the vagaries of Washington politics. Though some of the higher demand for food looks like a secular trend, because of rising consumption of meat and dairy produce in India and China – which in turn lifts demand for grain as a feedstock – there are undoubtedly some more artificial elements in play. Demand for biofuels, for example, has been increased by generous federal subsidies of 51 cents a gallon, buttressed by an import tariff of 54 cents a gallon. The reduction of that support, another item on the Bush administration’s wish list, could result in prices falling back.As for the effect on the developing world itself, American farmers argue – with some logic – that the overall effect of subsidies is to depress prices by encouraging farmers to stay on the land and produce, so taking them away is not a sensible response to soaring food costs.Their resistance to reforming food aid, however, is regarded by development experts as far less defensible. The US is the biggest donor of food aid in the world by far, much of its help being channelled through the United Nations’ World Food Programme, which administers emergency humanitarian assistance to communities struck by disaster or famine. But American food aid bears the marks of agricultural lobbying: it has to be bought from American farmers and transported in US-flagged ships, which adds considerably to costs – an inflation that looks increasingly indefensible given the rocketing price of feeding the poor.The White House has been pushing to bring the US into line with international best practice by giving cash to be used to buy food close to where it is needed. But its proposal that a quarter of US food aid be converted to cash met fierce opposition from the farm lobby and Congress, which conceded only a small pilot programme.The farm bill has barely been changed as a result of the food price crisis, not least because the main planks were agreed by Congress in the autumn before it became a highly salient political issue. Congress has gone some way to compensating poor US families for higher prices by adding some $10bn over 10 years for food stamps, a category that already makes up by far the biggest part of the agriculture budget. But that is small change in a spending programme that will total nearly $300bn over five years. Support prices for the heavily subsidised commodities such as rice, cotton, wheat, corn and soyabeans have generally been maintained or even slightly raised, while lawmakers have been resisting the White House’s insistence that farmers with an income higher than $200,000 should not receive subsidies.There is poignant irony in the adversaries’ positions. A House of Representatives led by Nancy Pelosi, a liberal Democrat from urban San Francisco, is arguing for higher pay-outs to rich farmers, the Democrats being desperate to hang on to their electoral gains in the rural heartland states. Meanwhile, a Republican White House headed by a Texas conservative not known for his levelling rhetoric or instinctive multilateralism inveighs against subsidies going to “big corporations and wealthy landowners” and warns that the farm bill will lead to America facing a wave of litigation in the WTO.Reform efforts are complicated by a quirk that puts the White House’s two stated aims, fairness and good global citizenship, at odds. Of the various types of subsidies, direct payments are the most compatible with WTO rules since they do the least to distort production, and the Bush administration prefers them to price-based support. But it looks odd at the moment to be handing out money irrespective of soaring prices and farm incomes.In an interview, Susan Schwab, US trade representative, says: “It is hard to explain politically…it is a paradox in terms of what we are doing.” She says the way to square the circle is to regard direct payments as a safety net that does not distort production.Whatever emerges out of the fight between Congress and Mr Bush, it is unlikely to produce a farm bill that looks very different from the current one. Across the Atlantic, prospects for reform of farm support look similarly dim. European sceptics of liberal trade have seized on the crisis to argue that the world markets cannot be relied on.The current incarnation of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy is due an interim “health-check” this year before it is fundamentally revised in 2013. Much of the money the EU transfers from European consumers to farmers is through import tariffs that hold up domestic prices.EU member states such as the UK that want lower protection say that the food crisis makes early CAP reform, and particularly tariff cuts, imperative. But those opposed to the European Commission offering big tariff cuts in the Doha round, particularly France, have marshalled their forces against rapid change.Michel Barnier, the French farm minister, while denying that he is in favour of autarky, argues that the food crisis underlines the need for regions to keep food production at home. “The [CAP] budget has been going down, but it needs to be high enough to keep strategic assets in agriculture in Europe,” he said last week. “Food security is not only about trade – it is about producing enough to feed yourself. If free trade were the answer to global hunger, we would know about it by now.” Irish farmers, meanwhile, threaten to vote against the EU reform treaty that will be put to a referendum in Ireland next month if farm tariffs, particularly on beef, are cut sharply as part of a Doha deal.Indeed, while most economists argue that more liberal trade policies could help reduce prices by encouraging more production in food-exporting countries, the crisis has, if anything, harmed rather than helped the chances of a deal in Doha.Even countries such as the Philippines and India, which have slashed their food import tariffs, are demanding even more strenuously than before to retain the right to raise them again. They have drawn a similar lesson to that of Mr Barnier: world markets cannot be trusted, so countries need to grow more of their own food, and that means keeping the flexibility to protect their farmers from competition.Agencies such as the World Bank argue for a grand bargain that ends in freer food trade. If agricultural importers could always be sure of having plentiful food to import, they might be more willing to fix their tariffs permanently lower. If exporters were guaranteed open markets into which they could sell, they might accept restrictions on their ability to ban or tax exports when prices were high.But such co-ordination has proved elusive, not least because substantive restrictions on export taxes have not formed a central part of the Doha talks. There are currently no restrictions on export taxes under WTO law and even temporary export quotas or bans are permitted if imposed to prevent “critical shortages” of food at home.Countries that import much of their food, such as Japan, South Korea and Switzerland, have repeatedly asked for laws controlling export restrictions and taxes. But though some agricultural exporters including New Zealand and Australia have been willing to discuss the issue, plans for strict new controls have foundered on opposition particularly from Argentina, which has used export restrictions extensively in the current crisis to stop food going abroad.All of which leaves those who believe that government intervention in agriculture has helped to cause the current crisis firmly on the back foot. For them, the policy response of governments worldwide is simple and dispiriting: more of the same.TOWARDS A ‘COALITION OF THE CARING’Americans do not have to go to the Philippines or Haiti to see how a drama can turn into a food crisis: they can find it at their local superstores. Costco and Wal-Mart, the US retail giants, were forced last month to limit the amount of basmati rice any one customer could buy from their warehouse stores after rumours of a shortage triggered a stampede of purchases. There is, in fact, no rice scarcity in America. But if a vicious spiral of higher prices and emergency stockpiling happened at the terminus of one of the most efficient supply chains in the world, it can happen anywhere.Much of the policy reaction to the global food crisis has focused on boosting worldwide food supply in the medium to long term, particularly in developing countries. But even a world with enough food to eat is vulnerable to hoarding panics. Could there be a way of preventing crises by disconnecting the feedback loop?Panic spreads easily because the reality of food distribution is often a long way from the efficient, flexible markets of microeconomics textbooks. Trade in food, particularly rice, in fact serves a relatively small part of global demand and is vulnerable to sudden shortages. Poor, landlocked countries with bad roads and creaky communications are particularly at risk, especially those dependent on a large neighbouring nation for food supply – such as Niger with Nigeria or Afghanistan with Pakistan.Some countries have reacted by building stockpiles, such as Oman, which announced recently it wanted two years’ worth of rice reserves. The world collectively used to hold a lot more food reserves than it does now, often by accident. Big stocks were a by-product of the domestic agricultural policies of the European Union and the US, which used to rely heavily on “intervention buying” where governments would support farmers by stepping in and buying food if the price fell below a certain level. As farm subsidies, particularly in Europe, were reformed and governments cut intervention, the grain mountains shrank.Food policy advisers say the crisis has pointed to a missing pillar in the architecture of global governance. But one such expert, Joachim von Braun, director-general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, says that going back to each nation holding its own physical stocks is not the answer – particularly in countries with weak and corrupt governments. He points out that officials sold off the national grain store in Malawi several years ago as a food crisis loomed. “I do not think we want this story to repeat itself. In countries with governance problems, there will always be a huge incentive to sell off stocks in times of trouble. That is the time when they are worth their weight in gold.”Nor does he think a solution will be found in the World Trade Organisation, which he says would be overburdened by questions of short-term food supply. Mr von Braun’s solution is for a “coalition of the caring” – the Group of Eight rich countries together with some of the big agricultural exporters, such as Brazil – to establish a global food bank on which the world could draw at times of crisis, under strictly predetermined criteria. As an interim step, Asia could start a rice-pooling arrangement – though quite different from the price-fixing “rice Opec” plan recently proposed and then withdrawn by Thailand.“There would be no bureaucracy and no bricks and mortar but a promissory note among governments who can trust each other,” Mr von Braun says. Just like a bank with capital requirements, it need only hold assets to cover 5-10 per cent of its promises, he says. The very existence of such an insurance mechanism, analogous to a lender of last resort in the financial system, should be enough to bring some calm to the commodity markets.One thing is clear: without a collective mechanism, countries will continue to take their own actions – and that could make the spiral of short-term food shortages and price rises worse.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 12,866.78.Analysts were looking for leading retail chains to report a 2.5 per cent gain in same-store sales in April. If stores hit the forecasts, it would mark the biggest monthly rise in same-store sales since November.Target said April same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent, missing forecasts for a rise of 4.5 per cent. The company said sales were weakest in regions getting hit the hardest by the housing market collapse. Its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $52.34.Costco reported an 8 per cent sales gain for the period, topping a forecast of a 6.1 per cent rise. But this figure was boosted by petrol sales, and shares in the company were down 1.2 per cent at $71.20.McDonald’s reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store global sales as the company cited menu variety and longer hours as drivers of growth. Shares in the fast-food chain gained 0.7 per cent to $59.77.In economic news, initial jobless claims fell to 365,000 last week, down from a revised 383,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said.Economists had expected the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time to come in at 375,000.Wholesale inventories, a measure of lag in demand relative to expectations, slipped 0.1 per cent in March, down from a revised 0.9 per cent increase in February, according to the Commerce Department. Economists had expected inventories to climb by 0.5 per cent.Stocks had fallen their largest amount in a month during the previous session after record high oil prices hurt consumer and transport stocks and financials tumbled on speculation that new regulations will force them to disclose further losses.Oil futures were steady near record highs. US crude rose 3 cents after closing at a record settlement of $123.53 a barrel.In other corporate developments, News Corp’s chief operating officer, Peter Chernin, told investors the company was not in talks with Microsoft or Yahoo about a combination involving its MySpace online unit. News Corp shares rose 2.5 per cent to $19.68.Investors were bracing themselves for what were expected to be a poor set of earnings from American International Group, due after the closing bell. The world’s largest insurer is set to post a second consecutive quarterly loss due to its exposure to the subprime mortgage market. AIG shares were down 2.1 per cent at $44.15.On the upside, shoe retailer Crocs reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue late on Wednesday and said that second quarter and full-year 2008 profit were on target to meet previous forecasts, despite slowing US retail trends. Shares in Crocs soared 14.5 per cent to $11.40.Unilever shares were up 5.8 per cent at $34.35 after the company reported a better-than-forecast 34 per cent rise in quarterly net income.Toyota said late on Wednesday that profit in the January-to-March period tumbled 28 per cent due to the rising yen and weak North American sales. Toyota’s US traded shares were 4 per cent lower at $100.56.Mortgage companies’ shares were also weaker. Fannie Mae fell 4.9 per cent to $27.63 while Freddie Mac was 2.2 per cent lower at $25.43.Best Buy shares fell 3.2 per cent to $42.05 after the company said it would form a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse to establish a consumer electronics retail presence in Europe.Among other movers, Metal, mining and oil services stocks rose. Dow components Alcoa, Chevron and ExxonMobil all gained.Shares in Fortress Investment Group, the publicly traded alternative investment business, slid by 6.3 per cent to $13.65 on the New York Stock Exchange after it reported a $69m loss in the first quarter.
183;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;US shoppers stick to the bargain basement;;US shoppers continued to veer towards cheaper stores and essential goods and away from discretionary items in April but brought some relief for retailers after a poor start to the year.Same-store sales, a key retail measure of sales in stores open at least a year, rose by 3.3 per cent against expectations of a 1.1 per cent rise according to Retail Metrics, which analyses shopping trends.The rise suggested a better period for shops after weaker sales over the past few months, but still pointed to a consumer who is contending with record oil bills and falling home prices.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and Costco, the warehouse club, in particular benefited from the upturn in sales, in a sign that cost-conscious consumers are turning increasingly to discount retailers and bulk buying as the US economy slows.Teen apparel retailers bucked the trend among clothes retailers to receive a boost from warmer April weather.Over a two-month period, retail sales growth was much weaker, after sales fell in March. This year so far same-store sales have increased 1.1 per cent on average every month, according to Retail Metrics. That comes after 2.6 per cent average monthly growth in 2007 and 3.7 per cent growth in 2006.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said: “The numbers were slightly encouraging and beat very modest expectations. But I don’t think we are out of the woods yet – there’s just too many headwinds that consumers are facing.“The broader trend is that consumers are retrenching and spending more and more dollars on non discretionary things they have to have,” said Mr Perkins.Wal-Mart said same-store sales rose 3.2 per cent excluding fuel sales, beating the high end of the retailer’s own forecasts of 1-3 per cent growth, as well as analysts’ predictions of 2.1 per cent gain.Wal-Mart said that the “economy continues to get tougher” and customers are struggling to stretch their money to the next paycheck.Eduardo Castro-Wright, Wal-Mart‘s chief executive for US stores, said: “As money gets tighter for them toward the end of the month, sales drop more than we have seen in the past.” The company said that sales of home furnishings remained weak but that it had been lifted by sales of groceries.Costco same-store sales were up 8 per cent compared with the company’s forecasts of 6.1 per cent growth, an indication that consumers are buying goods in bulk increasingly.Gap and Chico’s, which both sell mid-range clothing, saw sales drop 6 per cent and 15.5 per cent respectively.Target posted a 3.1 per cent gain in same-store sales but missed the 4.5 per cent estimate, as consumers avoided pricier items such as jewelry.Retailers are expecting a boost this year as consumers receive tax rebates as part of the package of moves put forward by President George W. Bush and Congress this year in an effort to boost the economy.

Cisco added 2.2 per cent to $24.04.Lexmark International, the printer maker, and Apple, the consumer technology giant, were also upgraded. Lexmark was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, adding 8.4 per cent to $32.91, while Apple rose 2.1 per cent to to $154.55.Long-suffering semi-conductor stocks also rallied after an analyst at Banc of America said that indicators suggested a bottom might be near for the sector. The S&P 500 Semiconductor index, which has lost about 16 per cent of its value since December, clawed back 2.8 per cent.Intel climbed 3.1 per cent to $22.08 while LSI rose 5.1 per cent to $5.61.The benchmark S&P 500 rose as much as 0.9 per cent before paring those gains at the close. The index finished the day 0.5 per cent higher at 1,360.55, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,351.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.4 per cent to 12,581.98.Wal-Mart’s success came at the expense of high-street retailers as consumers squeezed by higher energy prices and falling confidence downshifted to the mass retailers in search of value.Data showed that same-store sales at chain retailers fell 0.5 per cent in March, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Apparel and department store sales were particularly badly hit, dropping 11.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively. Gap shares fell 2.2 per cent to $18.47 but Dillards climbed 3.1 per cent to $21.14 and JC Penney added 3 per cent to $40.07.For the most part, the first-quarter earnings season has been a downbeat affair and it hit a nadir on Wednesday when United Parcel Service, a bellwether of the US economy, predicted profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Since the start of the year analysts have consistently revised forecasts downward, but at the start of the week they were still predicting first-quarter earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.Amid the broader market rally, financials were a weak spot. Banks and brokerage stocks were hit by a muted report on Lehman Brothers and news that it had bailed out five of its debt funds affected by the paralysed credit markets.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Lehman’s survival strategy of deleveraging and derisking would reduce long term returns. “This new harsh reality is sobering to those looking for a quick fix for the financial sector.”Lehman shares swung between losses and gains but by session end were down 0.7 per cent at $40.25.Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.1 per cent to $170.55 and an index of investment banks, which has fallen for six out of the last seven sessions, lost 2.4 per cent.In the healthcare sector Amgen bounced 5.7 per cent to $43.98 after analysts said efforts to overturn an injunction banning Roche from selling an anaemia medicine that violates patents owned by Amgen were unlikely to succeed.Deal activity also provided momentum. In pharmaceuticals, Tak­eda, the Japanese company, proposed a takeover of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for about $8.8bn in cash. Millennium shares rose 48.9 per cent to $24.34.Meanwhile, reports that Yahoo was edging towards a three-way alliance with Google and AOL to protect its independence or at least force its unbidden suitor, Microsoft, to pay more, buoyed related stocks.Yahoo climbed 3 per cent to $28.59, while Time Warner, which owns AOL, added 1.2 per cent to $14.61. Google rose 1.1 per cent to $469.08 and Microsoft moved up 0.8 per cent to $29.11.
185;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-04-10T20:12:49Z;US retail slog;;The US retail sector’s fight for survival may be morphing into a contest to see which companies can hold their breath under water the longest.March same-store sales data again showed that Wal-Mart, Costco and other value-oriented vendors of staples are holding up well despite the consumer spending slowdown. But department stores and other sellers of discretionary items have seen little relief. Retailers across the board have slashed inventories and costs to offset the pressure that product discounting puts on margins. Most have kept their debt at more rational levels than in past cycles.The terrain, however, is getting rougher for many discretionary goods retailers, and their risk-averse lenders will not wait indefinitely for the market to improve. Linens ‘n’ Things, for example, which is owned by Apollo Management, has been selling far too few linens and things to sustain itself over the long term.Electronics retailer Circuit City’s fourth-quarter US same-store sales plunged 11.3 per cent as customer traffic dropped even more, suggesting that it is ceding significant market share to rival Best Buy. Circuit City’s sales declines have shown signs of stabilising, but the company will probably have to bolster its liquidity by drawing down part of its $1.3bn credit line over the next few years. And it is counting heavily on an improved performance from its sales force, whose morale has been battered by a confusing, cost-slashing turnround effort.Unless consumer spending comes roaring back in the second half of the year – an increasingly unlikely scenario – the industry looks bound to consolidate, as done in past recessions. Furthermore, department stores, home furnishings stores, and retailers of women’s and teens’ apparel have over-saturated the market. Before the year is out, the spending slump will probably prompt a few of them to shut down altogether.Post and read comments on this Lex
186;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-03-06T22:37:13Z;US retail sales;;Wary shoppers once again avoided mainstream US apparel and department stores in February, choosing to spend their pared-back budgets at discount stores instead.Same-store sales at a variety of retailers topped Wall Street’s low expectations, suggesting the sector may not quite be scraping the bottom of the barrel. But as cash-conscious consumers trade down as a result of concerns about the slower economy and weak housing market, Wal-Mart and other discounters continue to be the primary beneficiaries.Wal-Mart bucked the industry trend and reported February results that improved on last year’s. Demand for groceries, electronics and health products drove a 2.6 per cent increase in comparable store sales, excluding gasoline. Wal-Mart’s turnround, highlighted by renewed focus on the rock-bottom prices that attract its core customers, seems to be working. Sales at rival Target and at warehouse chains Costco and BJ’s Wholesale also exceeded expectations. But investors with short memories should consider Wal-Mart’s less-impressive January before being over-enthusiastic. Its comparable-store sales grew just 0.2 per cent in January as shoppers used holiday gift cards to buy staple items.February’s blackest marks came from apparel retailers Gap and Limited Brands and department stores JC Penney and Nordstrom. Cracks that opened up in those two retail sectors last year have also spread into luxury goods. Saks’ February sales rose 3.4 per cent instead of falling slightly as analysts had expected. But they paled in comparison with the 24.7 per cent year-on-year sales gain Saks posted last February. Wealthy customers and tourists are still shopping, but tepid spending trends are taking their toll on Saks and Neiman Marcus.Many retailers expect conditions to improve in the second half and have set projections accordingly. Tax rebate checks should help. But there is room for disappointment: few signals thus far point to a fundamental improvement in the spending climate.Post and read comments on this Lex
187;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-03-06T19:55:46Z;Discount stores in US gain ground;;New sales figures from the leading US retailers on Thursday painted a picture of stressed shoppers “trading down” and focusing increasingly on price in the face of growing economic pressures.Monthly sales data for February showed Wal-Mart, the low-cost mass discounter, again outperforming its more upmarket rivals, reporting a 2.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year.Target, the rival discounter focused on more middle class customers, saw comparable sales increase just 0.5 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, saw their sales fall 6.7 and 3.3 per cent, respectively.“I think what we are seeing is probably the moving of shoppers from traditional department stores and speciality apparel stores over to Wal-Mart and other discount players,” said Mike Moriarty, head of AT Kearney’s US consumer goods and retail practice.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the month’s figures also highlighted the relative strength of retailers which, like Wal-Mart, sell staples such as grocery and healthcare items. “Areas of retail that are value oriented or consumer-staple oriented did well,” he said.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small stores that sometimes undercut Wal-Mart, saw its comparable sales rise 1.5 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations of a sales fall. Costco and BJ’s, the discount warehouse clubs, also reported comparatively strong sales growth.The figures apparently reinforce the findings of a recently published annual survey of US consumers sentiment by AlixPartners, the turnround consultancy. Fred Crawford, of AlixPartners, said the firm’s 2008 survey showed consumers at all levels were increasingly focused on price, rather than other factors such as quality when making shopping decisions.He said it also showed that shoppers were ready to shift “one level down” in terms of the type of stores they shop.“Consumers who were shopping at Nordstrom’s and Macy’s are now looking at JC Penney or Kohl’s, and those [who] were shopping at JC Penney are now at Wal-Mart,” he said.On Wednesday, both Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, said they were seeing signs of slowing demand even from affluent customers.“You’re going to see a lot more Lexuses and BMWs in Wal-Mart parking lots going forward,” Mr Crawford said.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable sales rose 2 per cent, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise.

Although a report on the US services sector was better than expected, this was partly offset by downbeat private sector employment figures and a decline in new factory orders. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the Federal Reserve’s beige book regional survey respondents reported weakening business conditions.The S&P 500 finished the session up 0.5 per cent at 1,333.72, having earlier gained 1.3 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,254.99 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.6 per cent to 2,272.81.An index of financial stocks retreated for a fifth consecutive session after Ambac said it would sell $1.5bn of stock and other equity instruments to boost its capital levels. Financials had moved higher before the announcement on hopes Ambac would unveil a large capital infusion, possibly from a consortium of banks.Although Standard & Poors and Moody’s Investors Service said the plan would probably suffice to save Ambac’s triple-A ratings the stock fell 18.8 per cent to $8.70 having risen 11 per cent prior its announcement. MBIA, a rival bond insurer, shed 6.2 per cent to $12.18.“I think the market was looking for something bigger and it didn’t get it. In the case of Ambac it has been ‘buy the rumour and sell the news’,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said.Concerns about the declining US housing market continued to weigh on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government chartered mortgage lenders, whose shares fell 6.5 per cent to $24.27 and 4.1 per cent to $21.64 respectively. Morgan Stanley said it expected Fannie and Freddie to make a first-quarter loss but added that results in 2009 “should be significantly stronger as guarantee fees continue to rise, helping offset peak losses”.Citigroup, rebounded from Tuesday’s near 10-year low, climbing 0.2 per cent to $22.15, but Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $37.55.The gloom in financials was in contrast to exuberant energy and metal producers which rallied as oil hit an all-time high of $104 a barrel and gold and copper gained.

189;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Feeding inflation;;The contrast between Marks and Spencer’s disappointing third-quarter results and Sainsbury’s and Metro’s upbeat reports raises a question: will the fortunes of general retailers and supermarkets diverge? Investors seem to think so. Just a year ago, European general retailers were trading on higher forward price/earnings ratios than food retailers. Since then the p/e for food and drug retailers has slipped only slightly to 17 times, while general retailers have fallen sharply to 13 times.Clearly, food retailing has advantages in a recession. While consumers can delay replacing handbags and televisions, they have to eat. In the US, however, the spread between general and food retailers’ valuations is narrower, even though economic conditions are worse.There may indeed be uniquely European reasons to be optimistic about food sellers. According to Citigroup there is a strong correlation between food price inflation and food retailers’ relative p/es – in spite of the fact that a boost to sales from inflation rarely feeds through to the bottom line.European companies meanwhile benefit from wider acceptance of private-label brands. They have higher margins and, when properly differentiated, can retain customers’ loyalty even if they spend less. House brands make up only a fifth of US sales, half the level in the UK and much of Europe, according to consultancy Planet Retail.Counterintuitively, the recent push into non-food items, which carry higher margins, could also help chains such as Sainsbury and Tesco, which reports on Tuesday. Pinched customers may pick up clothing, for example, there rather than making a second trip to the high street. Wal-Mart and Costco have benefited from a similar trend in the US.These advantages, though, can only do so much. There are genuine reasons for believing European food retailers will have a better time in 2008 than their general merchandising rivals, but their defensive charms are already well appreciated.Post and read comments on this Lex
190;COST;Costco Wholesale;2008-01-10T15:02:52Z;Wal-Mart stands out amid retail misery;;Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 2.4 per cent rise in December sales, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 2.1 per cent, amid otherwise predominantly bleak sales figures from other leading retailers.The largest US retailer said comparable store sales during the five-week December period were driven by strengths in grocery, pharmacy and electronics.Wal-Mart’s US stores saw sales increase by 2.6 per cent. Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the US stores unit said that “in a difficult retail environment, we were pleased with our comparable store sales,” and said strong food sales had helped bring in customers for other areas of the stores.Wal-Mart outperformed Target, its main rival, which reported a 0.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, after adjusting for a callendar change that saw a week of extra post-Thanksgiving sales shifted to November’s figures.Target’s sluggish performance was broadly reflected across the sector.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures said its index of retailer’s combined comparable sales figures for November and December showed a 1.7 per cent increase, the slowest growth since 2002.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said its stores sales fell 3.9 per cent for November and December combined, citing “a challenging consumer environment”.The retailer said it now expected its fourth quarter earnings to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.80 per share.Kohl’s, JC Penney’s rival, reported a 0.7 per cent decline in same store sales, on an adjusted basis, and said November and December sales were down 3.2 per cent. It also reduced its earnings guidance, saying that sales had occured later in December, leading to price cutting that would reduce its profit margins.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, posted a 1.1 per cent fall over the two months.Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy’s said “macroeconomic trends led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday”.Gap’s same-store sales adusted for the calendar changes were down 6 per cent.Costco was another rare bright spot, reporting a rise of 7 per cent, beating estimates of an increase of 5.7 percent, according to Reuters.Saks, whose New York flagship store has benefited from increased European tourist traffic linked to the weak dollar, reported a 10.2 per cent increase in comparable sales over the two month period.A number of retailers cut their fourth quarter earnings guidance after releasing poor December sales, including Limited Brands, AnnTaylor, Chico’s, American Eagle and Men’s Wearhouse.US retailers have been sounding increasingly downbeat in recent weeks, reflecting growing concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending due to a broader slowdown in the economy.US retailers from Office Depot, the office supplies company, to Zumiez, the snowboarding and skateboarding clothing retailer, have been showing increasing signs of suffering over the first weeks of the new year.Talbots, the mid-range clothing chain, said last week it planned to close 78 stores focused on children’s and men’s apparel and Macy’s has said it will close nine underperforming stores.Circuit City, the struggling consumer electronics chain, said on Monday that its December same-store sales fell 11.4 per cent.
191;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Best Buy puts spark into sales of electronics;;Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, on Tuesday underlined its leadership in the sector as it announced strong quarterly sales and earnings in spite of concerns over US consumer confidence.The retailer said US revenue had been boosted by sales of higher ticket items, including computer game consoles, notebook computers, flat-screen TVs and satellite navigation devices.“Consumer electronics seems to be once again the gift of choice,” said Jim Muehlbauer, interim chief financial officer, of present holiday sales.Net earnings during the third quarter rose 71 per cent to $228m, or 53 cents per diluted share, beating analysts’ estimates of 41 cents per share.Revenues rose 17 per cent to $9.9bn and sales rose 6.7 per cent.The retailer benefited from an extra week of post-Thanksgiving shopping during the quarter.It also said it had faced a “more rational” competitive environment during the quarter, a reference to the price-cutting that erupted during last year’s holiday shopping as Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, launched an aggressive push into the sector. Best Buy’s 750 US stores have outperformed competitors who have struggled to deal with intensifying competition in electronics from Wal-Mart, Costco and other discount retailers.CompUSA, a big-box retailer that thrived on the expansion of home computing in the 1990s, is closing down its 103 US stores in the new year.Tweeter, another national chain with 100 stores, filed for bankruptcy in June.Circuit City, which operates more than 670 superstores in the US, has been struggling all year with falling sales and has seen its share price drop from more than $23 to just over $6.Brian Dunn, president, said the quarter reflected Best Buy’s strategic efforts, launched three years ago, to shift its focus from being purely a distribution channel to a service aimed at responding to demands from specific customer groups.In addition to customising stores to reflect local customer demographics, Best Buy has also established a profitable services business through its “Geek Squad” installation and consultation subsidiary.Analysts say Best Buy’s strategy has enabled it to maintain a distinctive alternative to Wal-Mart’s low-cost, low-staffing competition.Best Buy, which operates stores in Canada and China, is planning to open its first stores in Mexico and Turkey early next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent this week to close at 13,339.85 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent over the week to 2,635.74.The Russell 2000 small cap index fell 4 per cent to 753.93 on the week, hurt by a rise in volatility. “The mindset of ‘selling into strength’ has come back into this market,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.After two consecutive weeks of gains, the major indices retreated amid widespread dissatisfaction with measures announced by the Federal Reserve and other central banks designed to help ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets.Stocks plunged on Tuesday after the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates 25 basis points, less than many investors had hoped. “It made you wonder about their [the Fed’s] sophistication and their ability to predict what the market reaction would be,” Ms Krosby said.Although equities posted a modest recovery the following day on news of a new term auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines, stocks failed to pare most of their losses with inter-bank lending rates remaining stubbornly high.Investors displeased with the Fed’s response were given a further jolt by data that showed a sharp spike in inflationary pressure.An index of consumer prices rose 0.8 per cent last month, its biggest rise in more than two years. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose 0.3 per cent, more than expected. The CPI data came a day after wholesale prices rose the most in 34 years.The inflation data may restrict the Fed’s ability to deliver the rate cuts the market wants and equities fell after the news.Citigroup had another bad week after Vikram Pandit’s appointment as chief executive failed to boost its flagging share price. Citi was forced to take $49bn in structured investment vehicle assets onto its balance sheet and and the shares fell 10.5 per cent to $30.70 over the week.Lehman Brothers kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks but its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $62.24 on the week, in spite of results that beat Wall Street’s estimates.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bear Stearns report next week. Analysts expect further writedowns in the sector as the value of credit-related assets declines and loan losses increase.Bank of America, down 7.1 per cent at $42.16, Wachovia, 9.6 per cent lower at $39.03, and PNC Financial Services, off 10.2 per cent at $64.81, all made negative noises about current quarter performance. Washington Mutual fell 20.4 per cent to $15.15 on the week after it announced a convertible stock offering to shore up its finances.Investors sought safety in large-cap stocks with strong international sales. AT&T rose 6.9 per cent to $41.14 on the week after the phone company increased its dividend and announced a large share buyback programme.Honeywell put on 2.5 per cent to $59.98 after the diversified manufacturer’s profit guidance pleased traders. 3M guided for double-digit revenue growth next year but the shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $85.93 this week.Microsoft was a standout technology stock rising 2.3 per cent to $35.31 after an analyst at JPMorgan raised his 2008 profit estimates.Retail stocks had a poor week in spite of November sales figures that were twice as high as economists had forecast. Office Depot fell 17.3 per cent to $14.44 after warning of a weak fourth quarter. Costco Wholesale fell 4.7 per cent to $68.49 this week. The S&P retail index declined 7.6 per cent to 410.17 amid fears of a poor Christmas shopping period.The biotechnology sector also had a disappointing week. Biogen Idecfell 21.6 per cent to $58.79 and Celgene lost 12.1 per cent to $50.41. But, BioMarin Pharmaceutical soared 30.2 per cent to $36.44 after it won regulatory approval for a new drug.
193;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-12-13T21:50:27Z;Wall Street climbs after late rally;;US shares delivered a lacklustre performance on Thursday as doubts about a plan by world central banks to help alleviate the worst effects of the credit squeeze weighed on sentiment.Inflation data also fuelled selling pressure before a late rally dragged the major indices higher. The biggest spike in producer prices in 34 years added to concerns that the Federal Reserve might be restricted in its ability to continue cutting interest rates.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,488.41, having traded lower for most of the session. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,668.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 13,517.96 after a big move by Honeywell supported the index.Utilities and industrials performed well but banking stocks endured another dismal session amid concerns about earnings prospects.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks, fell in spite of better-than-expected quarterly profits.The shares declined 2.1 per cent to $60.50 after fixed-income revenues dropped sharply and analysts said the inclusion of one-time gains meant the results were not as good as they might appear. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns report quarterly results next week.Washington Mutual fell 2.9 per cent to $15.59 after Bank of America told investors to sell and cut its price target 46 per cent to $13.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell 4.1 per cent to $23.84 after it entered a $29bn reinsurance agreement with Assured Guaranty. The S&P financial index fell 0.5 per cent to 399.88.Bank of America, down 0.9 per cent at $43.05 and Wachovia, 0.8 per cent lower at $40.19, contributed to a downturn in sentiment the previous day after they issued negative forecasts for this quarter’s performance.The downbeat sentiment in equities on Thursday was further sparked by a vital index of producer prices, which rose 3.2 per cent in November, its largest gain since 1973 and twice the increase forecast by economists.Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.4 per cent, against expec-tations of only a 0.2 per cent increase.“What’s disturbing is really the rise in core inflation,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said. “Everybody was kind of confused about why the Fed reacted the way it did, but now you see the reason.”But the Fed’s plan to tackle a reluctance by banks to lend to one another remained the main focus of investor attention on Thursday. Some analysts said central banks had not gone far enough as interbank lending rates remained stubbornly high.Stocks fluctuated wildly after the plan was unveiled on Wednesday, continuing a recent trend for large intraday price swings. “I think this volatility is going to continue,” said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab.The Vix volatility measureis not moving down as much as it normally would when the market rallied. Mr Frederick said: “That’s a sign of fear on the part of market makers. They’re not convinced that any rally we might get on a given day is sustainable.” The Vix was flat at 22.48 on Thursday.Retail stocks were a talking point after retail sales rose 1.2 per cent in November, twice the expected 0.6 per cent increase. The data helped ease concerns about a disappointing Christmas shopping period but the S&P retail index fell.Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, fell 2.4 per cent to $68.54 after an 11 per cent increase in quarterly profit failed to satisfy investors. The shares are up 30 per cent this year.Shares in Biogen Idec, the biotechnology group, slumped 23.7 per cent to $57.91 after efforts at exploring a possible sale yielded no serious offers.Honeywell jumped 5 per cent to $60.65 after the diversified manufacturer’s 2008 profit guidance cheered investors. But Ciena fell 12.1 per cent to $37.04 after the network equipment maker forecast revenue growth to slow in its new fiscal year.JetBlue, up 14.4 per cent at $7.15, provided support to a range of airline stocks after Lufthansa acquired a 19 per cent stake in the low-cost airline.
194;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-11-23T02:10:31Z;Vizio eclipses bigger rivals in LCD TV sales;;A small California TV manufacturer will be fighting it out with consumer electronics giants Samsung, Sharp and Sony to be the leading seller of LCD televisions during the US holiday season.Going into Black Friday sales, Vizio was the number-one brand for the second quarter in a row in North America, according to a report by the iSuppli research firm this week.Vizio, which employs just 90 people in a southern suburb of Los Angeles, had a 13 per cent share of North American LCD (liquid crystal display) TV shipments, followed by Samsung with 12.8 per cent, Sharp on 12 per cent and Sony with 10.1 per cent.Vizio has won its leadership by beating its rivals on price and selling its sets through warehouse club channels such as Costco.It cannot compete with the massive research and development budgets of its bigger rivals and assembles its TVs from other manufacturers’ parts. But the quality of the sets and their award-winning design have been praised. It has provoked a response from the likes of Sony, which began offering cheaper LCD TVs with non-Sony parts in Wal-Mart stores.“We believe it will be difficult for larger competitors to continuously pass along similar value propositions to Vizio HDTVs when you consider their massive operating and marketing expenses,” says Laynie Newsome, Vizio’s sales vice-president. “We are very lean and mean and we make decisions and react to the latest in product development very quickly.”But iSuppli noted Vizio’s lead narrowed markedly in the third quarter as the bigger makers introduced new models and increased their market share from the second quarter by two to four percentage points.“Vizio continues to succeed based on its combination of low-cost products and high-profile sales channels,” said Riddhi Patel, iSuppli television analyst.The research firm predicts LCD TVs will overtake the traditional cathode ray tube sets in global sales in 2009. It estimates 76m LCD sets will be sold this year compared with 116m CRT sets, 11m plasma displays and 4.7m rear-projection TVs.
195;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-11-15T22:05:56Z;Wall St falls on JC Penney warning;;Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday after JC Penney, the department store operator, warned of “dramatically” weaker sales and financials were sold amid continued concern about credit-related losses.Major equity indices once again succumbed to a late-session sell-off with volatility spiking higher as shares declined.“Consumer stocks have been weak all day,” said Jim Herrick, manager of equity trading at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Investors are nervous, there is a lot of headline risk.”Meanwhile technology, energy and materials stocks, until recently among the best performing sectors, continued to feel selling pressure.The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 1,451.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 13,110.05 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1 per cent at 2,618.51. The CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer, jumped 9.3 per cent to 28.4.Financials continued to weigh on the broader market after the Barclays, the UK bank, became the latest bank to declare credit market losses. It announced a £1.3bn writedown on its exposure to credit-related securities, although this was less than many had feared.General Electric, 1.8 per cent weaker at $38.31, said a $5bn short-term bond fund run by an asset management subsidiary had run into trouble because of losses on asset-backed securities.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors remained jittery about credit market turmoil.“It’s almost universally accepted that we are going to have major fallout from this,” he said.Companies exposed to the mortgage sector suffered further sharp falls after the chief executive of Wells Fargo, the second-biggest US mortgage lender, warned that the housing slump was now the worst since the Great Depression. The company’s shares shed 3.9 per cent to $31.97.Washington Mutual slid 4.4 per cent to $20.43, Countrywide Financial fell 8.7 per cent to $12.21 and Fannie Mae, the mortgage agency, shed 10 per cent to $43.04. Among the big banks, Citigroup was down 4.1 per cent at $34.58 while Lehman Brothers declined 3.8 per cent to $62.97.JC Penney helped to depress equities after it raised fears of a consumer slowdown by posting a 9 per cent decline in quarterly profit.The department store operator warned that sales had declined “dramatically” in the past two months and cut current quarter and annual guidance due to expectations of a weaker retail environment.Its shares fell 5.1 per cent to $44.33, with the S&P retail index down 1.1 per cent at 420.21.JC Penney’s disappointing results came a day after Macy’s cut its sales forecast for the quarter. Investors are nervously watching for signals that the housing slump has led to a fall-off in consumer spending.Wal-Mart, however, 0.7 per cent weaker at $46.20, beat earnings expectations earlier this week. Home Depot also outperformed – only 0.2 per cent lower at $28.98, after a fund controlled by Edward Lampert, the billionaire investor, disclosed a stake.Fears of an economic slowdown drove a brisk trade in shares in the consumer staples sector. Costco, the discount retailer, rose 0.4 per cent to $66.34 while Supervalu, the grocery retailer, jumped 1.3 per cent to $39.81.In the technology sector Applied Materials’ latest quarterly profit declined as sales of its tools were hit by a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry.Citi Investment Research upgraded the stock to “buy”, saying fundamentals in the semiconductor equipment sector had “finally reached a trough”. The shares advanced 0.3 per cent at $18.87.Genzyme rose 2.9 per cent to $72.84 after it was revealed Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, had acquired a stake.In economic news, consumer price inflation data showed a modest rise last month. Overall CPI rose 0.3 per cent in October, while core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose just 0.2 per cent, in line with estimates.Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose 20,000 to 339,000 versus the 320,000 forecast by economists. The Philly Fed manufacturing index rose from 6.8 to 8.2 this month, indicating an expansion of activity. Economists had predicted a slowdown.
196;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-10-30T22:50:06Z;Tesco launches first dollar bond;;Tesco has launched its first dollar-denominated bond as the UK supermarket group seeks to raise its profile in advance of the opening of its first stores in the US next week.Britain’s biggest retailer, which raised $2bn in bonds, plans to expand aggressively in the US by opening 50 neighbourhood stores.Tesco, which has about £5bn of bonds outstanding, said it chose to issue in the US dollar market because it wants to introduce US bond investors to Tesco, to establish itself in a new market and diversify its investor base.“[We wanted] greater awareness of our product in the US,” Tesco said. “The bond markets also look pretty healthy at the moment.”The retailer, which is to roll out its Fresh & Easy chain in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix Arizona and Las Vegas, issued $850m in 10-year notes and $1.15bn in 30-year paper.The bonds were heavily oversubscribed as investors were impressed by the company’s performance and its plans to develop small local stores rather than trying to compete directly with the so-called big box retailers in the US such as Safeway, Wal-Mart, Costco and Target, which operate huge, largely out-of-town supermarkets, bankers said.Tesco, which dominates the UK retail scene, reported a rise of 18 per cent in pre-tax profits to £1.29bn in the six months to August 25 on the back of a 9.2 per cent increase in sales to £24.7bn.The bonds, which will pay coupons of 5.5 per cent on the 10-year and 6.15 per cent on the 30-year, will include a so-called “poison put” that would allow investors to sell the bonds back at 101 cents on the dollar if there was a change of control at the company.Moody’s Investors Service gave the bonds a rating of A1, its fifth-highest, and Standard & Poor’s assigned them an equivalent A+. Citigroup and JPMorgan managed the sale.Tesco has priced a euro-denominated bond and a sterling bond this year.In March it priced a €600m 40-year issue – the longest dated euro issue from a retailer.The company also priced a £500m 50-year bond in February. The bond ranks alongside only a handful of other 50-year sterling corporate bonds, including a 2002 deal by French rail network operator Reseau Ferre de France and a 1994 bond issue by British Gas.
197;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-10-29T20:47:33Z;US retail gloom;;Most US retailers have seen sales growth slip only modestly. Their share prices tell a very different story. Employment and wages continue to grow, and consumers appear only slightly more reluctant to open their wallets. But fear is playing a strong role in deciding retailers’ valuations. The sector’s shares now trade at a 5 per cent price earnings discount to the S&P 500 on expectations that macroeconomic worries and higher fuel, housing and credit costs will inevitably take their toll on spending.The picture at the retailers is mixed. Sales of consumer staples are holding up reasonably well at the likes of Costco, Wal-Mart and BJ’s Wholesale. But September sales were disappointing at department stores, which made big markdowns on discretionary items to reduce swollen inventories. JCPenney and Nordstrom both cut their third-quarter profit expectations after missing September sales goals, as did Target. A bout of warm weather made matters worse by propelling customers into parks rather than malls.Home improvement leaders Home Depot and Lowe’s have taken a particularly harsh beating as the housing market continues to suffer and consumers shy away from using home equity to finance big-ticket purchases and new projects. Fallout from the housing slowdown should continue to hit sales of discretionary goods more broadly for months to come. Shares of electronics retailer Circuit City, for example, have dropped 73 per cent in the past 12 months, Office Depot is down 59 per cent and JCPenney is down 26 per cent, all hit by weak demand.All is not lost, though. Federal funds futures are pricing in a strong likelihood that interest rates will be cut further this week. Retailers have historically outperformed the market during periods of monetary easing. And, after several unnaturally warm weeks, there is now a nip in the air on the East Coast.
198;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Wal-Mart nibbles at online grocery sales;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is dipping its toes into online grocery sales, with the expansion of a home shipping service for products including Perrier water and free-trade coffee at Sam’s Club, its membership warehouse store.Sam’s Club, which targets both small businesses and families, has expanded its offering of non-perishable items, which now includes Campbell’s V-8 juice, Kellogg’s snack bars, dried fruit and popcorn, as well other non-food items such as washing-up liquid.The retailer delivers by parcel service, following the model adopted by Amazon, the largest online retailer, which launched an online grocery store for bulk orders of non-perishable food last year.Amazon now sells more than 22,000 different items on its US website. It does not break out sales for the category.Sam’s Club said its drinks and snacks are aimed primarily at its office clients. Office Depot, one of the largest US office suppliers, offers a similar range of online goods. Sam’s Club also sells meals and gift baskets that are shipped by third-party suppliers, as does Costco, its main rival.Amazon’s online bulk groceries frequently undercut supermarket prices by about 30 per cent, and also offers free shipping for larger orders. Sam’s Club, which charges an annual membership fee of $40 for families, is undercutting Amazon by about 5 per cent.The development of direct shipping of groceries contrasts with the slow growth of home delivery of online groceries, where the US has lagged behind the UK and parts of Europe.However, this summer Amazon also started testing home delivery of a full range of groceries in select neighbourhoods in its home town of Seattle using its own trucks.In the US, the online grocery sector witnessed the spectacular bankruptcy of WebVan in 2001, after it lost more than $800m as it tried to build a national distribution network.

The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 1,562.47 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,811.61.Large-cap companies with a high proportion of international sales attracted buyers as concerns mounted about the health of US corporate profits.Procter & Gamble, up 0.5 per cent at $71.40, Microsoft, 0.4 per cent firmer at $30.23, and IBM, 0.3 per cent higher at $118.62, were among the Dow’s best performers.But Boeing weighed on the index, falling 2.8 per cent to $98.68 after it announced a six-month delay to deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.The defensive mood saw transport and consumer discretionary stocks sold down while consumer staples gained.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index climbed 3.4 per cent to 16.67.Alcoa kicked off the third-quarter earnings season late on Tuesday, reporting a 3 per cent rise in its third-quarter earnings but missing analysts’ expectations. The group also said it planned to boost its share buyback programme to 25 per cent from 10 per cent of its outstanding common stock.Standard & Poor’s cut its 2007 earnings estimate on the stock, citing the third-quarter shortfall and concerns about a weak fourth quarter. The shares declined 2.5 per cent to $38.73.Costco, the wholesale retailer, cheered investors with a 5 per cent rise in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit, a result that matched estimates. Its shares climbed 9.2 per cent to $69.13. But PetSmart fell 4.1 per cent to $31.06 after it lowered its third-quarter and full-year earnings estimates.Energy stocks recovered later in the session, in spite of profit warnings from Chevron and Valero Energy.Chevron’s shares fell 0.8 per cent to $92.08 after it warned late on Tuesday that third-quarter earnings would be “significantly below” the last quarter because of declining refining margins. Valero cut its third-quarter earnings estimate but closed 2.9 per cent higher at $74.25.International Paper, down 2.4 per cent at $36.18, also warned that third-quarter earnings would miss expectations.The series of profit warnings and lower-than- expected actual results drove the third-quarter outlook for the S&P 500 perilously close to negative territory yesterday. S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to expand at an average 0.1 per cent annual rate for the quarter according to Thomson Financial. This is down from an estimate of about 4 per cent just over a week ago.The last quarter of negative S&P earnings occurred in the first three months of 2002, when profits declined 11.5 per cent.Since July 1, estimates of third-quarter earnings have been lowered from 6.2 per cent.Financials are one of two major sectors that have experienced the largest downgrades. Average earnings for financials are seen as falling 8 per cent, while consumer discretionary stocks are forecast to see earnings slide 7 per cent. Energy earnings are forecast to decline 4 per cent.Healthcare, up 12 per cent and technology, up 10 per cent have the highest forecast earnings growth for the third quarter said Thomson.Interest rate futures price in about a 30 per cent chance that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee will lower rates when it meets at the end of the month. A cut in the 4.75 per cent Fed funds rate to 4.5 per cent is still priced in by year end.Automakers were in focus yesterday after the United Auto Workers began strike action at Chrysler. Workers at General Motors, down 0.5 per cent at $38.13, are voting on their own tentative contract agreement after a two-day strike last month.Ford, 1 per cent lower at $8.23, must also hold talks with the UAW.In the technology sector, VMware gained 5.3 per cent to $107.04 after UBS raised its price target from $92 to $120.

200;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Wall St slumps amid subprime downgrades;;US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, hurt by retail and housing sector earnings warnings. Financials were roiled by more bad news from the subprime mortgage market.Selling gathered pace at midday, as a speech on inflation by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not address current policy and failed to arrest investor gloom.The S&P 500 index fell 1.4 per cent to close at 1,510.12. It was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month. Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index surged 15.9 per cent. All major S&P sectors closed lower, led by telecoms and financials.Worries over banks’ potential exposure to the mortgage market and a possible credit crunch flared when S&P announced it would place $12bn in rated subprime securities under review for downgrade. That sparked safe-haven buying in government bonds and maintained pressure on the stock market.“It makes sense that financials are bearing the brunt of the S&P ratings review story,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. “It’s hard to see any resolution soon and that makes it hard to love the financials. They have been lagging [behind] the market all year and will continue to do so.”The S&P financials sector is now lower by 3.1 per cent this year and is the only major group in negative territory for 2007. Among investment banks, Lehman fell 5 per cent to $71.10 and Bear Stearns was down 4.1 per cent at $137.96.The retail sector was also in focus and a bearish tone in trading was set by Sears’ second-quarter guidance that was below estimates, due to lower sales of appliances. Sears said it planned to buy back up to an additional $1bn of its stock, but at the department store chain fell 10 per cent to $154.21.Other retailers fell, led by Macy’s, off 3.7 per cent at $40.12, Wal-Mart, down 1.9 per cent at $47.58, and Costco, lower by 1.4 per cent at $60.51.Home Depot, the home improvement chain, cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year due to a weak housing market. Its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $40.25, as the company sought to buyback 250lm shares.The bearish news on housing was underscored when DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder, said orders for new homes fell 40 per cent during its fiscal third quarter. Shares in the homebuilder fell 2 per cent to $19.40 as the company said it now expected to post a loss in its third quarter. The stock set a 52-week low of $19.16 and other home builder stocks set fresh 52-week lows on Tuesday.Technology and blue chips were not spared from worries over the upcoming earnings season. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,639.16 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,501.70.Earnings expectations for S&P 500 constituents revolve around a rise of 4.4 per cent seen for the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Earnings estimates have edged up from 3.9 per cent since the start of April.“Such low expectations should be favourable for the market, since management has beaten estimates for more than three years running,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Among blue chips, Alcoa fell 1.7 per cent to $41.66. The aluminium group reported a 3.9 per cent decline in second quarter profit compared with a year ago. While the result matched estimates, sales were less than expected.Alcoa also extended its $28.6bn bid for Alcan until August 10. Alcoa’s hostile bid, which the Canadian rival has already rejected, was originally set to expire on Tuesday. Alcan fell 0.9 per cent to $86.14 on Tuesday.A bright note for earnings was Pepsi Bottling, which reported a 9.5 per cent rise in the second quarter. The stock rose 3.8 per cent to $35.74.WD-40, the maker of lubricants posted a third quarter rise of 8.5 per cent that was below estimates. It also lowered its outlook for fiscal 2007. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $33.25.Greenbrier, a maker of railcars, said its fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 22 per cent amid higher production. The result exceeded estimates and shares surged 15.8 per cent to $33.15.Akamai rose 4 per cent to $49.45, as S&P said the company would enter the broad S&P 500 on Wednesday. The stock will replace Biomet, which has been purchased by private-equity funds.DirecTV rose 1.6 per cent to $24.79. Jason Bazinet, analyst at Citigroup, upgraded DirecTV to a “buy” from a “hold”, amid the strong likelihood that “Liberty tenders for DirecTV within 12 months”. A likely offer price is $30 per share, said Mr Bazinet.
201;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-05-10T20:36:05Z;Wall St slides on retail worries;;Wall Street suffered its largest one-day decline in nearly two months on Thursday, as sentiment soured in the wake of much weaker-than-expected monthly retail sales in April.Traders said the poor shop sales and a worse-than-forecast US trade deficit in March provided some investors with an excuse to sell stocks after the market’s recent strong performance.The sharp pull-back in share prices failed to attract significant buying on the dip, as was seen on Tuesday.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 had closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,491.47, its worst daily loss since a 2 per cent fall on March 13. Energy and healthcare stocks led the major industry groups lower.The Nasdaq Composite was 1.65 per cent weaker at 2,533.74.Since the rally in stocks that gathered steam in late March, analysts say some investors have missed out on gains and have been looking for a buying opportunity in the event of a pull-back.“Our conversations with institutional clients yield interesting anecdotal evidence that many investors have not been positioned long enough, and thus haven’t experienced robust portfolio performance,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“Indeed, it has been pretty commonplace to hear fund managers complain that the market needs to take a breather or consolidate gains, a tone that implies a desire to buy more shares, but at lower prices than today’s.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,215.13, after it had set its 21st record close for the year on Wednesday.Major retailers reported same-store sales figures for April on Thursday, and the Thomson Financial same-store sales index fell 1.8 per cent last month against an expected 0.4 per cent rise.Of the 51 retailers who revealed their sales, 85 per cent missed their estimates, according to Thomson. “Most retailers have missed expectations and blamed the Easter effect and unfavourable weather,” it said.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the much weaker-than-anticipated chain store sales had led the bank to reduce its forecast for total US retail sales in April, due on Friday. The bank expects headline and ex-auto sales to fall 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart was in the spotlight with a sales fall of 3.5 per cent last month, worse than expected. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $47.75.JC Penney closed down 1.8 per cent at $76.80, and Federated Department Stores fell 3.9 per cent to $42.10 after posting weaker than forecast sales.Shares in Gap fell 0.8 per cent to $18.28 after the clothing retailer said April sales fell 11 per cent.In contrast, Costco beat estimates as it delivered a 7 per cent rise in like-for-like sales. Its shares closed a fraction higher at $54.95, down from a high of $56.21 earlier in the day.Thomson said sales prospects for May were looking better and that “the majority indicated stronger sales towards the end of the month, when weather improved.” Mr Greenlaw said: “The near-term health of discretionary buying will probably be closely tied to developments at the gas pump. Some relief on that front finally appears to be in sight, but probably not for a few more weeks.”In earnings news, Whole Foods’ first quarter profits fell 11 per cent year on year, missing estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the organic food retailer slid 10.2 per cent to $41.15.EchoStar Communications said first quarter earnings rose 6.7 per cent, but missed estimates and shares in the satellite-television provider rose 0.3 per cent to $48.32.Shares inJohnson & Johnson and Amgen both slid 2.5 per cent to $62.50 and 9.1 per cent to $57.33 respectively, after a Food and Drug Administration panel said their anti-anemia drugs should face further restrictions.Viacom said first quarter net income fell 36 per cent, amid higher production and restructuring costs at MTV. Its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $41.49.Shares in Sara Lee fell 0.4 per cent to $17.02, after the maker of food and household goods said its third quarter profit nearly tripled.Meanwhile, Hershey said higher dairy costs would damp profits this year, sending shares down 3.8 per cent to $52.93.Shares inBarr Pharmaceuticals rose 2 per cent to $53.28 after a broker upgrade in the wake of the company reiterating its earnings outlook on Wednesday.
202;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-04-12T20:53:19Z;Wall Street rallies amid earnings and data;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as investors sought a silver lining in a mix of earnings, monthly retail sales figures and economic data.Stocks moved lower in early trade after economic reports showed higher import prices, fanning inflation worries, and lower weekly labour hiring.The negative mood reversed as healthcare, pharmaceutical, railroad, energy and industrial stocks attracted buyers.MedImmune, jumped 15.3 per cent to $43.63 as the drug company said it would consider being sold.The S&P 500 rail index rose 4.4 per cent, as investors reflected on Berkshire Hathaway’s recent purchase of stakes in several rail companies.Scott Wren, senior analyst at AG Edwards said the market could trade up or down around current levels until more earnings and significant data arrived next week.Late on Thursday the S&P had gained 0.6 per cent to close at 1,447.80.

But after the closing bell, Merk fell 1.3 per cent to $45.92 when Federal officials ruled against approving the new painkiller Arcoxia.The Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.85 per cent, and its gain of 3.5 per cent so far this year outpaced the 2.1 per cent rise in the S&P. That said, analysts warned bearish positions in the Russell were at their highest level since September 2003, and were five times greater than negative trades in the S&P.Ipsco jumped 11.5 per cent to $145.96 after the maker of steel pipes said there could be a sale of the company. Market speculation focused upon Evraz, Russia’s second biggest steel company being a potential buyer. The S&P steel index rose 1 per cent and has gained 28.1 per cent this year amid talk of industry consolidation.Earnings results released late on Wednesday overshadowed activity on Thursday, and Research In Motion fell 8.2 per cent to $134.10. The maker of the BlackBerry personal organiser missed fourth-quarter estimates and its guidance for the coming quarter disappointed some analysts.Genentech eased 1.3 per cent to $81.63. While the biotech group’s first-quarter profits beat estimates, quarterly sales of two cancer treatments fell.Bed Bath & Beyond fell 1.8 per cent to $40 after the retailer said fourth-quarter profits rose 4 per cent, but missed analyst estimates.The retail sector was in the spotlight as March same-store sales figures arrived. Thomson Financial said its index of 51 retailers was expected to show a rise of 4.1 per cent in same-store sales, but the actual increase came in at 6 per cent, boosted by teen retailers and department stores.Wal-Mart reversed its recent run of lacklustre sales as its 3.4 per cent rise beat estimates of a 1.4 per cent gain. The stock slipped a fraction lower to $47.26 as the nation’s largest retailer forecast that sales this month would range from steady to a 2 per cent decline.
203;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-03-09T22:05:06Z;Subprime fears dampen Wall Street gains;;A weaker yen helped Wall Street claw back some losses this week but fears about the possible collapse of a big subprime mortgage lender yet again checked resurgent investor confidence.Although many analysts expected a small recovery – or technical bounce – after the plunge in global equities last week, the strength of the rallies took some bears by surprise.Materials, financials and cyclical stocks that had suffered particularly steep losses during the market turmoil made a neat about-turn on Tuesday to help stage the biggest one-day rally since July. The advance was led by Ford, the carmaker, Nucor, the steelmaker, and Lehman Brothers, the bank.However bouts of alarm about subprime mortgage lenders, triggered by New Century Financial’s apparent slide towards bankruptcy, once again punctuated the week. Each sell-off in the sector reverberated around the market and soured the mood.An unexpected fall in the jobless rate helped to give the market an early lift on Friday. But stocks later sagged as investors reduced their holdings in anticipation of a testing week ahead.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,402.85, up 1.1 per cent this week. The bounce recouped about a third of the S&P’s losses since February 23. Yet many analysts remained cautious.“It is hard to believe that the technical damage that was done last week could be overcome so quickly,” said Alexander Paris, market strategist at Barrington Research. “The market correction made a lot of sense and it doesn’t make a lot of sense that it will bounce right back.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,276.32 to stand 1.3 per cent stronger this week. The Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,387.55 on Friday.The unwinding of the global carry trade – the practice of borrowing in currencies with low interest rates such as the yen and reinvesting in higher yielding currencies – was regarded as one of the most important factors behind the sell-off.The weaker yen this week, which made the carry trade more attractive once more, helped to ease concerns.“It is interesting how movements in the yen have presaged movements in the stock market,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC wealth management. “There is some relationship there that has perhaps been exaggerated by hedge funds.”Under pressure from its creditors, New Century Financial said it would no longer make new loans. Its shares fell 78 per cent to $3.21 this week.This put a brake on the mid-week advance of companies active in the mortgage sector. But shares in Lehman Brothers still rose 6.6 per cent this week to $75.83 while Morgan Stanley, which lends to New Century, was 6.1 per cent up at $76.Ford stock was in demand after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first-quarter loss might be smaller than expected. The shares made additional gains on Friday on reports that it was close to selling Aston Martin, the luxury car brand. Ford stock rose 4.5 per cent to $7.93.Steelmakers returned to form after a gloomy fortnight. Upbeat remarks from Nucor on expected demand for steel products lifted the entire sector, with Nucor stock jumping 11 per cent to $64.26 and US Steel rising 6.1 per cent to $91.24.Goodyear continued to race ahead. Hardly dented by the stock market sell-off, shares in the tyremaker have climbed a further 4.5 per cent to $28.51 this week, up 25 per cent on the year. Analysts said the surge was helped by data that showed Americans were replacing their tyres more frequently.Retail sales in February were largely weak. Costco stock slid 2.5 per cent to $54.34 after its underlying sales figures and profit disappointed analysts.In deal news, the battle to buy Caremark heated up after Express Scripts and CVS raised their rival bids for the US drug benefits management group. Shares in Caremark rose 1.4 per cent to $61.90.Shares in Yahoo slipped 5.2 per cent to $29.12 on Friday after reports that it was in talks with AT&T that could lead to big changes in their partnership.Deere & Co stock made big advances on optimism about sales of farming equipment rising with demand for ethanol. Shares in Deere were up 7.4 per cent at $113.00.
204;COST;Costco Wholesale;2007-03-08T22:41:44Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;The tentative recovery in US stocks gathered pace on Thursday as Wall Street cheered rising overseas markets and signs of improved corporate profits.The rally was given extra vigour by speculation that Citigroup might be attempting a further acquisition in Asia, while the weaker yen eased concerns about the global carry trade.However, the gains were checked in the afternoon as the spectre of subprime mortgage lenders returned to spook investors.Rumours that New Century Financial was close to bankruptcy weighed down the entire market and sent shares in the struggling subprime lender down 25 per cent to $3.87.Led by materials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to close at 1,401.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 12,260.70. The Dow was boosted by AT&T, which rose 3.1 per cent to $36.51 after analysts at AG Edwards lifted their rating on the telecoms company from “hold” to “buy”.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,387.73.Retailers gave a mixed set of trading updates for February but investors largely reacted positively, sending the S&P retailers index up 1.2 per cent. Wal-Mart shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $47.88 after its underlying sales growth last month fell short of analysts’ estimates.Shares in Costco were also on the defensive after the retailer said second quarter profits had declined because of charges related to stock options. The group’s shares fell 3.3 per cent to $54.26.However, while trading in February was also sluggish at JC Penney, its shares surged 4.1 per cent to $81.86 after the retailer said sales in March would rise sharply.Shares in Ford rose 4 per cent to $7.93 after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first quarter loss might be smaller than expected.Steelmakers made big gains after Nucor said it saw “healthy demand” for its products, sending its shares up 5.3 per cent to $63.12.In deal news, an executive of Taiwan’s Bank of Overseas Chinese said Citigroup would buy the bank “very soon”. Shares in Citigroup pared early gains to stand 0.6 per cent up at $50.50.The battle for Caremark heated up after Express Scripts raised its hostile offer for its larger rival in the US drug benefits management sector by offering to pay interest on the cash component of its $26.1bn bid.The sweetened bid comes as Express tries to trump the deal already agreed between Caremark and pharmacy chain CVS. In response CVS on Thursday increased the dividend it intends to pay Caremark shareholders.CVS stock rose 3.3 per cent to $54.26. Shares in Caremark and Express rose by 1.4 and 1.7 per cent respectively to $62.16 and $76.

The S&P Homebuilders index closed down 2.7 per cent.HSBC’s announcement coincided with a warning from New Century Financial, another big US sub-prime mortgage lender, over weaker results because of rising defaults. Its shares plunged by 36.21 per cent to $19.24.Financial services groups also suffered, with shares in Wells Fargo down by 0.9 per cent to $35.56 and Lehman Brothers down 1.3 per cent to $84.42. Sub-prime lender Accredited Home Lenders fell by 6 per cent to $27.25.Toll Brothers, the homebuilder, undermined hopes of a quick housing market recovery by saying its first-quarter sales had fallen by almost a fifth to $1.1bn. Its shares were down 3 per cent to 33.39.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,448.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.2 per cent at 12,637.63. The tech-led Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,488.67.Some investors were unfazed by the falls. “The market fundamentals have not changed,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “This is a case of profit taking.”Early sentiment was also depressed by a disappointing sales figures from Costco, the retail group. Underlying sales rose by 2 per cent in January, well below analysts’ estimates. However, Costco’s shares trimmed an early decline to stand 0.9 per cent lower at $56.62.Gap reported better sales, sending the retailer’s shares up 2.6 per cent to $19.75, but wider fears over consumer spending weighed on the sector as a whole.The $2 rise in oil prices to $59.71 did boost energy groups, sending the American Stock Exchange Oil Index up 1.1 per cent.Shares in Walt Disney retreated from early gains to trade 0.5 per cent softer at $35.29 on profit taking after the group said that its quarterly net income had more than doubled to $1.7bn.Warner Music disappointed investors after it said first-quarter profits had slumped 74 per cent to $18m. Worries over the pace of growth of its digital music business sent its shares down 5.8 per cent to $20.27.Shares in EMC jumped 6.62 per cent to $14.50 after the storage systems group said it plans to sell a 10 per cent stake in its VMware subsidiary through an initial public offering.

Uncertainty over the economy and interest rate policy has buffeted sentiment for stocks, outside of technology, in the first week of trading this year.“Stocks don’t seem to have the robust feel they showed during the fourth quarter,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. He expects equity volatility to continue rising as the debate over the economy and Federal Reserve policy plays out.The S&P 500 settled 0.1 per cent, or 1.74 points, firmer at 1,418.34.

Its shares slipped
3.1 per cent to $66.07 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.On the up was Altria Group, which set a 52-week high for the second consecutive day on expectations of solid fourth-quarter earnings this month.The stock rose as high as $87.87, before closing $87.65, up 1.3 per cent.In earnings news, Monsanto posted fiscal first quarter 2007 net income of

Sales at its US store network rose 1.3 per cent.Wal-Mart said that it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November. But it said that apparel and home sales had been “soft” as expected, although price cuts in apparel had helped to boost sales. Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range, but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Retailers’ holiday sales are vital because the two months before Christmas can make up for 20 to 40 per cent of annual sales.Costco, the warehouse club that compete’s with Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, delivered a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, beating analyst’s forecasts of 5.7 per cent growth. Sam’s Club sales rose 5.6 per cent. But BJs, the third largest warehouse club, saw its shares drop 14 per cent after it reported sales growth of just 0.6 per cent, and cut its profit forecast.Gap said same-store sales fell 8 per cent, a worse figure than expected, despite swingeing price cuts designed to bring shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. Out of all of its brands and regions only Banana Republic in the US and Canada reported sales growth, with an increase of 2 per cent on last year. In North America Gap and Old Navy saw sales fall 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and internationally sales fell by 8 per cent.The struggling retailer also cut its outlook and said it was reviewing its brand strategies for Gap and Old Navy.Department stores delivered a mixed picture. Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.But Federated Department Stores owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said sales at its stores, excluding the May stores acquired in 2005, rose by 4.4 per cent, below its own forecast. The company said sales at more than 300 former May Department Store locations, which have been converted to the Macy’s banner since their acquisition in 2005, “remained weak”, without giving details.JC Penney said same store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expecations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent. Children’s clothing and jewellry proved popular with shoppers. Its rival Kohl’s saw sales rise 3.4 per cent, below forecasts.AnnTaylor, another major apparel seller, said it had suffered a 5.3 per cent drop in same-store sales and said its full-year earnings will come in lower than its original guidance of $2.07 to $2.12 a share.Pier 1, the home-furnishings retailer, saw a 10.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, even worse than the 9.4 per cent fall Wall Street had anticipated.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw a 4 per cent gain, well below the 9.3 per cent Wall Street expected.Zale said sales increased by 2.3 per cent for the combined months of November and December. It said profit margins were lower than expected because of price cutting.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer, said on Wednesday that same store sales grew 13 per cent for the month, beating Wall Street’s expectations for 8.7 per cent growth.

He warned that investors faced November inflation data due today. Gains were broad-based and technology reversed its recent lacklustre performance.Shares in Ciena jumped 11.5 per cent to $27.83 after the telecommunications equipment maker returned to profitability in the fourth quarter, beating estimates.Advanced Micro Devices soared 12.6 per cent to $22.71 after the chipmaker said it expected a 10 per cent rise in microprocessor demand in 2007.The rally prompted a further decline in equity volatility as measured by the Vix index, which fell to a new low of 9.64 for the year, approaching the all-time low of 9.31 set in 1993.It has slumped 21 per cent in the past week, reflecting an easing of concerns that stocks were set for a sharp fall.Traders noted that the cash market might have been boosted by positioning in equity futures and options contracts that expire and settle today.The S&P 500 gained 0.9 per cent, or 12.28 points, to 1,425.49, a six-year high. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.9 per cent, or 21.44 points, to 2,453.85.The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched up another record high, rising to 12,431.26, eclipsing the previous peak recorded on Wednesday.The Dow subsequently eased slightly to trade up 0.8 per cent, or 99.26 points, at 12,416.76.Citigroup raised its 2007 targets for Dow and S&P 500 to 1,600 and 14,000, respectively.Wholesale retailer Costco gained 1.8 per cent to $54.11 after its fiscal first-quarter earnings of 51 cents beat estimates of 50 cents.In the brokerage sector, Bear Stearns rose 2.6 per cent to $159.96 after its fourth-quarter earnings of $4 a share trumped estimates of $3.36.Lehman Brothers announced earnings of $1.72 a share, beating estimates of $1.68 a share.

A 2.9 per cent increase in November has extended gains in the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised stocks to 15.7 per cent for the year.The Dow lagged behind last month, rising just 1.2 per cent, for a rise of 13.8 per cent this year. The S&P is up 11.9 per cent, while the Nasdaq trails, up 9.4 per cent.Stocks were hit this week by mixed economic data. A contraction in several manufacturing surveys and no ebb in some measures of inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting rates should activity soften further.“The market has concerns about inflation and the risk of a recession” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “We seem to be walking a fine line between a hard and a soft landing.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,396.72, and down 0.3 per cent for the week. The Nasdaq was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,413.21, a fall of 1.9 per cent for the week. The Dow was 0.2 per cent weaker at 12,194.13, a slide of 0.7 per cent for the week. The Russell index closed down 0.9 per cent at 778.64, down 1.9 per cent for the week.The retail sector was in the spotlight this week, as same store sales for November were released.Front and centre was Wal-Mart. The largest retailer in the US helped spark a big sell-off in stocks on Monday, when it said sales fell 0.1 per cent in November, its first drop since 1996.The company later said it expected sales in December to rise by no more than 1 per cent. Its shares fell 4.2 per cent for the week to $45.87.Other retailers with disappointing sales numbers slid, led by JC Penney, down 5.5 per cent to $76.33, and wholesale retailer, Costco, down 2.4 per cent at $52.20.Federated Department stores slid 5.8 per cent to $40.60, in spite of reporting better sales.No major deals were announced this week but talk of a $100bn buy-out shrouded Home Depot on Friday and its shares briefly jumped 5.2 per cent. They were 2.6 per cent higher for the week at $38.97. Communications chip maker, Broadcom announced plans to buy privately held LVL7 Systems Inc for $62m in cash. Its shares slid 8.4 per cent to $32.84.The Philadelphia semiconductor index was 3.2 per cent lower for the week.The energy sector did well this week, as oil prices hit a two-month high before sliding a touch on Friday.The Energy Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund, hit an all-time high of $60.83 on Thursday and was 5.5 per cent firmer at $60.72 for the week.“Don’t count your oil wells before they gush, but this is potentially a big upside breakout,” said CynerTrader’s Mr Tower. Oil prices advanced after weekly supply data on Wednesday showed that US inventories fell more than expected.Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $77.20, ConocoPhillips gained 4.8 per cent to $67.37 and Chevron was up 6.2 per cent at $73.11.Shares in Palm fell 12.1 per cent to $13.99, after the maker of hand-held devices said a delay in shipping its new Treo 750 smartphone would slice second quarter profit and revenue forecasts.Shares in the tightly controlled New York Times endured a choppy week.Spurred by talk of a buy-out, they rose 6.7 per cent to $24.76 on Wednesday, only to slide as those hopes floundered. For the week, shares were 0.7 per cent lower at $24.09.In the health sector, shares in Pfizer rose 3.6 per cent to $27.86, after the drugs company upgraded its fiscal 2006 earnings per share forecast and said it would cut 20 per cent from its US sales force. Shares in Cardinal Health rose 5.3 per cent to $65.49 after the company said $1.8bn in restructuring proceeds would expand a stock buy-back.Shares in General Motors fell 4.9 per cent this week to $29.69, as investors contemplated Kirk Kerkorian selling his entire stake.Tracinda. his investment company, disclosed the sale of 14m shares on Thursday, reducing its stake by a third to 4.95 per cent. Tracinda last week lowered its stake to 7.4 from 9.9 per cent.Early Friday afternoon, GM reported US sales in November rose 6 per cent for the past year, and the company said it expects to produce 1.110m vehicles in the first quarter of 2007, down 9 per cent from a year before.Shares in Ford slid 5.6 per cent to $8.04. November sales unexpectedly fell sharply, compounding bearish sentiment for the carmaker.Exchange stocks, which have soared in recent weeks amid a rush of deal news for the sector, fell back.

211;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-11-30T18:49:44Z;Wall Street recovers, tech leads rebound;;Wall Street stocks were recovering at mid-afternoon on Thursday, after sentiment was hurt by higher oil prices, mixed retail sales reports, a rise in a closely watched measure of inflation and a sharply weaker regional manufacturing survey.Bright spots for the market were stocks in the semiconductor, energy and technology sectors, while health was being boosted by the solid peformance in Pfizer.In mid-fternoon trade, the S&P 500 was up 2.98 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 1,402.46, up from an earlier low of 1,394.24. The Nasdaq Composite was 7.76 points or 0.3 per cent firmer at 2,439.99.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.61 points higher at 12,228.34.A drag on the Dow was Dupont, off 2.5 per cent at $46.94.The Russell 2000 index of small capitalised stocks had rallied 0.1 per cent to 785.The rebound in stocks was helping boost November’s gains. Returns in stocks for the month have been led by the Nasdaq index, with a gain of 3.1 per cent. The Russell 2000 index is up 2.4 per cent, with the S&P higher by 1.8 per cent and the Dow up 1.2 per cent.Still, trouble may be brewing for small and middle sized companies.“The ratio of insider selling to insider buying…spiked in November for US stocks broadly, and small to mid caps in particular,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup.“Recent insider activity suggests that small/mid caps could see further weakness before the year is up or early in 2007,” he said, adding that insider wariness was “broad-based’’ with the exceptions of the energy, homebuilding and semiconductor sectors.Retailers were in the spotlight as they reported sales for November, and the results have been mixed.Analysts at Thomson Financial noted that so far among the 51 retailers who have published sales data, 48 per cent have missed expectations, while 30 per cent have beaten forecasts.Kicking off the sales numbers on Thursday was Costco. The wholesale retailer said same store sales rose 5 per cent, under analysts’ expectations of a 5.7 per cent rise. Shares were 1.8 per cent lower at $52.36.The largest retailer in the US, Wal-Mart, forecast its December same-store sales gain would be no better than 1 per cent. That came after the company confirmed same store sales fell 0.1 per cent in November, the first such decline in a decade. Shares were 1.2 per cent lower at $46.35.Discount rival Target posted a gain in sales of 5.9 per cent, beating estimates of a 5.7 per cent rise. After falling to a low of $56.65, shares were nearly unchanged at $57.82.Shares in JC Penney slumped 2.4 per cent to $77.69 after its November sales rose 1.4 per cent, below estimates of a 3.7 per cent gain. Meanwhile, sales jumped 8.5 per cent for Federated, beating a forecast rise of 4.8 per cent. Its shares were 3.5 per cent higher at $42.28.Speciality retailer Pier 1 shares were 1 per cent lower at $6.73 after it said its same store sales declined 15.3 per cent, worse than an expected decline of 13.6 per cent.In earnings news, HJ Heinz reported profit for the three months ending November 1 fell to 57 cents a share, from 60 cents a share a year ago. Analysts had expected 60 cents a share for the recent quarter. Its shares had rebounded from an earlier low of $43.99 and were 0.6 per cent firmer at $44.25 as the company raised its full fiscal year earnings estimate to $2.39 a share from a prior $2.35 a share.Shares in the New York Times were 1.7 per cent lower at $24.33 amid reports that former American International Group Inc. chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg will not increase his stake in the company. Shares in the newspaper rose 6.7 per cent to $25.15 on Wednesday amid buyout talk.Shares in drug maker, Pfizer rose 2 per cent to $27.62, after the company increased its fiscal 2006 earnings per share forecast, due to lower costs and higher revenues for the fourth quarter.In data, the Chicago Purchasing Managers index for November, fell to 49.9 from 53.5 in October. It was the lowest read in activity since April 2003 and surprised economists who had forecast a rebound to 54.4. Investors now await the monthly employment report due on Friday.In earlier economic news, personal income and spending for October rose 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent versus expected gains of 0.5 and 0.1 respectively.The personal consumption expenditure index, a measure of inflation closely followed by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2 per cent in October, versus estimates of a 0.1 per cent increase. The core PCE rate, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.2 per cent, versus a forecast 0.1 per cent gain. For the year to October, core PCE rose 2.4 per cent, above an expected reading of 2.3 per cent.Economists at Bear Stearns noted said it was “significant that core inflation did not moderate, given that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday that ‘the level of the core inflation rate remains uncomfortably high’”.Stocks had recorded healthy gains on Wednesday, as the market welcomed the release of an upward revision to estimates of third-quarter gross domestic product.The S&P 500 index settled 12.63 points, or 0.9 per cent higher at 1,399.35 while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 19.62 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 2,432.23.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 90.28 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 12,226.73.

Shares in the retailer closed down 1.2 per cent at $48.29.Gap also missed sales and Citigroup downgraded the clothing chain to a “hold” from a “buy”. Its shares fell 5.5 per cent to $19.50.Wholesale retailer Costco and other retailers, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’smissed analyst expectations.Costco rebounded and setteld up 0.2 per cent at $53. Target was off 1.3 per cent at $56.96, Dillard’s was down 1.7 per cent at $29.29 and Kohl’s was 0.75 per cent lower at $70.54.In contrast, Nordstrom and JC Penney enjoyed a solid October, with their shares up 1 and 2.4 per cent at $46.76 and $76.93 respectively. Federated beat sales but fell 3.9 per cent to $41.35 on a weaker sales outlook. Saks also enjoyed good sales and rose 1.5 per cent to $19.48“It’s striking that the discounters are seeing disappointing sales, while high-end retailers are holding up,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Beyond monthly sales figures, he believes the real test for the consumer will come when a spillover from the slowing housing market into job creation occurs. “The consumer will follow the economy into a slowdown, not lead it.”The next test for stocks will be the October employment report on Friday.The S&P 500 settled 0.47 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 1,367.34, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.33 points, or 0.01 per cent, lower at 2,334.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.48 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,018.54, having earlier slipped below 12,000.To date, 385 of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings, with 74 per cent above estimates, according to Thomson Financial.Earnings for the third quarter are running 18.6 per cent higher versus a year ago, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Shares in Intel were off their lows, down 1.6 per cent at $20.68, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the chipmaker from “buy” to “neutral” amid weakening demand and persistent excess capacity. By contrast, Dell shares were up 3.3 per cent at $24.80 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the group from “sell” to “neutral” citing disciplined pricing and attention to sales mix.In earnings news, International Paper missed estimates as it reported 39 cents a share versus a forecast 43 cents. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $32.50.
213;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-10-27T16:27:10Z;Whitney Tilson: Opportunity to sample the treats;;"When it comes to owning stocks of the best-known businesses in the world, value investors usually feel like children looking through the window of the candy store, unable to afford the treats inside because they refuse to pay the prices such high-quality franchises typically bear. But a rare opportunity appeared over the past year for value investors to go inside the store and sample the treats.As recently as mid-July, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both heavily weighted in large-cap growth stocks, were roughly flat for the year, and this category was the worst performing over the previous one, three and
five years. Such underperformance is hardly surprising, given how overvalued blue-chip growth stocks had become during the bubble in the late 1990s. By early 2000, companies such as Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Dell and Microsoft were trading at absurd multiples, with price/earnings ratios well above 50. Since then, while earnings for companies such as these have grown, the stocks are down because multiples contracted dramatically as the market herd moved on to small-caps, real estate and commodities.As contrarians who like to buy quality on the cheap, we began investing in a range of blue-chip stocks last year and accumulated positions in Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Anheuser-Busch, Wendy’s, Costco, Tyco, Foot Locker, Dell and Heinz, all of which we still own. This strategy has particularly started to pay off in the latest market rally, to the point where our mutual fund, the Tilson Focus fund (TILFX), was the top performer of 833 funds in its Multicap Core category over the 12 months ending September 30, according to Lipper.Have such blue-chip “growth” stocks had their run? Alan Abelson, the Barron’s curmudgeon, thinks so. “Mutual funds and their more adventurous, far more addicted to debt and often more feckless younger kin, hedge funds, have piled into the big-caps because the consensus has opined that the big-caps are the place to be,” he wrote last weekend. “This has proved rather a self-fulfilling analysis since their very piling in has been very much one of the reasons the big-caps have been the place to be. How long this ring-around-the-rosy, Wall Street-style, can go on before it all falls down is anybody’s guess. Ours is: not very long.”We respectfully disagree. The S&P 500 is trading at a modest 18 times trailing earnings, relative to 35 for the Nasdaq and a more ridiculous 36 for the Russell 2000. Particularly in a late-cycle period of moderating growth, large, high-quality businesses should trade at a premium, not a discount to technology and small companies.In addition, the cycles between large-caps versus small-caps, and growth versus value, tend to last for many years. Rich Pzena of Pzena Asset Management has identified four distinct periods since the beginning of 1969 in which the S&P 500 (ie “growth”) stocks dominated and four in which buying low price-to-book (ie “value”) stocks did. (Value stocks were defined as the 200 stocks among the largest 1,000 that had the lowest price/book ratios.)These data suggest some interesting things. First, buying low price-to-book stocks has produced superior returns over extended periods of time but there have also been periods of significant underperformance. Second, the average time in which growth stocks dominated was 37 months, whereas when value stocks returned to favour, they remained in favour for an average of 76 months. Interestingly, 76 months from the beginning of the latest value cycle in March 2000 took us to the middle of this year, which is when large-cap growth stocks started to outperform and traditional low price-to-book stocks started to underperform.Are growth stocks due to outperform for another two or three years? I don’t know and, as a bottoms-up stock picker, I don’t really care. But I can say that value investors such as me continue to see more “value” today in stocks that have traditionally been characterised as “growth”.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.

214;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-10-26T17:11:02Z;The Short View: Corporate America - red or blue?;;Should investors care about the political beliefs of executives? According to the managers of the Blue Fund, a mutual fund launched in the US in time for the mid-term elections, they should. The name (as in “blue states”) shows it is designed for Democrats. But its also shows republicans how to invest in line with their politics.Blue Fund looks at the political donations a company has made from corporate political action committees, and from the pockets of its three most senior executives. It argues that companies that consistently give the bulk of their political donations to one party, even when they are out of power (excluding those bidding for a share of the pork barrel), show true commitment.The research has yielded lists of “red” and “blue” companies, which gave 95 per cent of their donations to Republicans and Democrats respectively over the past 10 years. The bluest include Google, Apple Computer, Starbucks and Costco. The reddest include Exxon Mobil, Union Pacific, International Paper, Halliburton and Dell.Democrats will be pleased to know that the index of 76 “blue” companies has thrashed its “red” rivals under the Bush administration. Over the five years to June this year, the blue index gained 139 per cent, compared with 34 per cent for the S&P 500, which in turn beat the red index. Even excluding recent stars Google and Apple, the blues are easily ahead.How seriously should we take this? It may be a fluke. Republicans could argue that after such a rally it looks time to sell blue stocks, and they should dispute the Blue Fund’s contention that Apple’s principles have helped it to be more innovative than Dell. Dell’s political conservatism did not stop it from revolutionising its industry in the 1990s.Over a longer period, Dell and Apple do look principled. Both have been donating against their apparent self-interest. Under President Bill Clinton, Dell grew at 93.8 per cent per year, according to Bloomberg data, while Apple fell at a 4.6 per cent annual clip. Under President George W. Bush, Dell has limped along at 3.8 per cent a year, while Apple grew at 47.5 per cent. Go figure.

Aeon’s shares gained 3.6 per cent to Y2,760 and Daiei 3.7 per cent to Y1,955. After the market closed Aeon confirmed it would hold talks about buying a 15 per cent share.Strong results reported by US consumer companies such as McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Costco reinforced the Fed’s commentary that consumer spending was rising in the US, acting as an impetus for Japanese consumer goods and retailing shares.Matsushita Electric Industrial, maker of Panasonic brand electronics, rose 2.9 per cent to Y2,635 and Hitachi rose 1.3 per cent to Y699. Rival Sony climbed 3.7 per cent to Y4,760, benefiting from a ratings upgrade to ”overweight” from “equal weight” by Morgan Stanley.Bucking the trend, game machine maker Sega Sammy plunged 7.7 per cent to a new low of Y3,100 despite raising its earnings forecasts, as investors focused on disappointing sales of pachinko machines.Among other retailers, Seven & I, operator of the 7-11 convenience store chain, climbed 2.6 per cent to Y3,880. Discount chain Don Quijote gained 7.2 per cent to close at Y2,310, with help from a ratings upgrade to “outperform” from “neutral” by Credit Suisse.Fast Retailing, Asia’s biggest clothing retailer, however, lost ground despite reporting a 19 per cent improvement in annual earnings and forecasting another 10 per cent gain next year. Fast’s shares slid 2.9 per cent to Y11,240 after Mizuho Securities downgraded it, citing the recent rise in the share price.Shares of mid-sized banks did well after the Bank of Fukuoka said it was in merger talks with Kyushu-Shinwa Holdings. Bank of Fukuoka’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to Y896 and Kyushu-Shinwa soared 10.6 per cent to Y156. Chiba Bank gained 1.9 per cent to Y1,058 and Bank of Fukushima rose 3.4 per cent to Y150.The Mothers board of smaller growth stocks surged 5.3 per cent to 1,140.02 at the end of a turbulent week. On Tuesday and Wednesday the Mothers and other Japanese growth markets fell sharply as hedge funds and other investors threw in the towel and dumped shares in underperforming small-caps. But Friday’s jump suggests other investors have stepped in to fill the vacuum, attracted by the growth opportunities of many smaller companies.

There was some bullish news for oil with a fall in distillate stocks of 1.6m compared with expectations for a 100,000-barrel rise.

218;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-09-29T15:42:58Z;Dinner for 18, reception for 200;;"Georgette Mosbacher is a cosmetics tycoon, socialite, author and tireless Republican fundraiser. Formerly chief executive of La Prairie, she is now focusing her efforts on resurrecting Borghese.How many homes do you own?Two. One is in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue and the other is a small farm in [New York’s] Hudson River Valley. I just bought that and it’s not inhabitable yet. I’m going to make it a weekend place.Sounds like a major project.I’m taking the barn and converting it into my home and the old farmhouse I’m restoring as a guesthouse. I just like the idea of one big open space – even in my apartment, which has a 40ft living room with a 20ft ceiling.No wonder you’re so well known for entertaining at home. How does your party schedule influence the design of your apartment?I like continuity and a sense of flow. All three of my public rooms – the library, living room and dining room – are off a big gallery and the colour scheme is the same. It has versatility and intimacy. I can do a small dinner for 18 at a round table in the dining room or a reception for 200 because they all open into each other. My apartment is designed for that flow. I mean, if you called me and said could you have a reception here for 100 people on Friday and today is Wednesday, I’d say no problem. I don’t need to move furniture. The only thing I have to move into the back of the apartment would be my dining room chairs and they’re very lightweight. My apartment doesn’t have to be reconfigured to do that.What about the mood?What does distinguish my apartment – even though it’s bland to say it – is that you do feel you can put your feet up. I don’t know if that’s the decorating or the hostess. I don’t think you can have one without the other. But I have silk sofas and my dog Eve crawls all over them. She can do whatever she wants. After all, I can replace the sofa.Absolutely.I’m not a minimalist. I’m very much a memorabilia freak. You’ll walk into my apartment and I have little things everywhere – keepsakes from anything and everything. I leave a dinner party and take the menu home with me and write a note on the back of it.That sounds suspiciously like a pack rat talking.Oh no! I don’t have problems going through my closet and getting rid of anything I haven’t worn for two years. But when it comes to keepsakes – photos, menu cards, a memento from some place – yes, those are sacred.Memorabilia aside, what can’t you live without in your home?Only two things. One: air conditioning; two: water pressure. After that, all of it is secondary. I don’t care how gorgeous an apartment is, it wouldn’t be a comfortable apartment for me. I tell my architect: “Whatever you think about air conditioning, double it! I want to be able to have 200 people in here when it’s 100ºF outside and the room still be cold. And if my mother’s in the guest room and we’re both taking showers at the same time I don’t want water trickling out of my shower. Put in the biggest pump you can find!”Good thinking. Tell me about your dream home.I’m living in it. When I walked into this apartment, I knew I had found my fantasy house. I saw that 20ft ceiling, which had been frescoed by the original owner, and knew instantly. I like that feeling of majesty. It had such glamour, with three double-height windows overlooking the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its neoclassical façade. That view could be anywhere in the world; you don’t know whether you’re in Paris, Rome or New York.Have you owned overseas?I have not – I have rented houses abroad but my ideal vacation is on a boat. To escape from my everyday living, I want to be on the sea, not near it.I know you’ve moved around in America. Where else have you lived apart from Manhattan?Oh my God . . . I’ve lived in the four largest cities in America plus our capital. I grew up just outside Chicago and worked my way through college there every day in the summer. Right after college, I lived in Beverly Hills. I married a Texan and lived in Houston for 15 years. In between, I was in Washington DC for four years during Bush 41 [the presidency of George H.W. Bush], when my ex-husband [Robert Mosbacher] was secretary of commerce.When you’re not travelling and entertaining, what’s your favourite room at home?My closet. I took an entire bedroom and made it into a dressing room and my at-home office. My friends call it my cocoon. It’s my safe place where I feel comfortable. I don’t have to be dressed or made up to sit at my desk. No one is going to intrude or just pop in.What a pleasure.I really live in this room. My desk, my laptop, my massage chair is here. I’m very, very organised. I have a cubbyhole built for everything. And I like to see it all. My clothes are not behind covers, everything is glass panels. I have one of those little refrigerators with an ice-maker in it even though the kitchen is 5ft away. I have my flat-screen TV, my iPod. It’s so self-contained, God knows how long I could live here. I think of it as a bunker. God forbid I die here, it’ll be a long time until anyone finds me!"
219;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-09-01T17:32:05Z;On Wall Street: Not such a bad dream;;You know about the American Dream. How about this for the American Nightmare?Prodigal US shoppers, worried about high gasoline prices and a declining housing market, keep their credit cards in their wallets.The slump in the propensity of consumers to swipe their Amex cards causes sharp falls in company earnings, putting the brakes on the economy.The stock market falls victim to the same malaise, as groups’ stuttering earnings fail to keep up with their rich valuations.Scared? You should be. This week’s sharp deterioration in the mood of consumers brought the nightmare scenario a step closer to reality.The Conference Board consumer confidence index recorded its lowest reading since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina last year.Consumers’ predictions for the next six months were similarly gloomy and consistent with another widely watched survey released by the University of Michigan.On Wall Street, companies have done their best to confirm forecasts of a consumer-led slowdown.On Wednesday, Costco – the warehouse retailer that had been one of the sector’s star performers – stoked fears that higher-income shoppers are feeling the pinch with a surprise profit warning.It is in good company. Household names such as Home Depot, Starbucks, Wal-Mart and organic grocery chain Whole Foods have been wounded by reluctant consumers.With evidence like this, it is hard to disagree with predictions of an impending stock market correction.But I am going to try.For a start, the leading indicators of consumer confidence – Michigan’s and the Conference Board’s – often contradict one another and have diverged spectacularly as recently as April.But even when they agree, they are lousy indicators of future stock market performance. A study by Thomson Financial reveals that when consumers are bearish about the economy, stocks rally.On the four previous occasions when the University of Michigan’s index showed consumers in roughly the same pessimistic groove, the S&P 500 embarked on prolonged bull markets.It is true that consumer sentiment surveys are correlated with the business cycle and have correctly predicted the last two recessions in the US.But there is no guarantee that they will be third-time lucky, especially if the drivers for the current pessimism do not have a meaningful, lasting impact on the economy and the stock market.The first worry of the average Joe and Jane is higher petrol prices. With the precious liquid hovering around $3 a gallon for the past few months, those trips to Costco and Wal-Mart have somehow looked much less attractive.But the oil price now appears to be on the retreat. It fell below $70 a barrel for the first time in two months this week, adding a new, more romantic meaning to the term “sweet crude”.With Hurricane Ernesto demoted to tropical storm and harmlessly moving away from the Gulf of Mexico, pump prices should soon come down, leaving petrol-addicted Americans feeling better.The other consumer woe – the declining housing market – is more worrying, as unsold housing stocks are rising fast and price rises are moderating.But while economists are right to be concerned about the nasty wealth effects of a housing slowdown, investors can rest a little easier.The bursting of previous housing bubbles claimed just one, obvious stock market victim: the housebuilding sector. This time has been no different. Housebuilding stocks are down some 40 per cent from their peak, but other sectors have largely been left alone.But if the consensus is right and the economy slows down, why should companies and stocks remain immune?It is a question of degree and valuations. If the economy takes a gentle path towards slower growth, corporate profits will not suddenly collapse.With the S&P 500 still cheaper than its 10 and 20-year average, the resilience of earnings should prompt value-based and index-tracking investors to keep buying.For all the current doom and gloom, the American Nightmare may prove just as elusive as the American Dream.
220;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Pressured US shoppers grow more selective;;August sales figures from leading US retailers on Thursday suggested that middle- and lower-income consumers were responding to higher energy prices and interest rates by making selective spending cutbacks.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index for the month rose 3.1 per cent, slightly better than forecast. But Ken Perkins, president, noted that the 52 per cent of retailers who exceeded market forecasts represented a fourth consecutive month in which the number had fallen.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, noted that overall sales growth had slowed over the first six months of the year.“We have seen some moderation: not dramatic and it’s very uneven. But there’s enough to say there’s something going on and that something is likely to continue for the rest of the year.”In possible signs of the stress on middle-income consumers, Target, the second largest US discounter, missed Wall Street’s sales target for the second consecutive month. Target, whose customers have a median family income of $58,000, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, against the 3.1 per cent expected by analysts.The company said home decoration items as well as women’s clothing, costume jewellery and accessories were its weakest categories.JC Penney, the mid-range department store with a similar customer demographic to Target, also surprised analysts with a 0.5 per cent fall in August comparable store sales, citing slow sales of big-ticket items, including furniture - echoing comments from Costco, the warehouse shopping club.Dollar General, which operates 8,000 small-format discount stores across the US, gave one of the starkest indications of the state of the battle for the hard-pressed lower income consumer. The retailer said lower sales of home products and clothing had contributed to a 40 per cent fall in its profits during the second quarter.“We also expect consumer discretionary spending to continue to be negatively affected by high fuel prices and by higher interest rates as well,” the retailer said. It added that it expected “aggressive marketing and discounted pricing by competitors” to continue.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its overall August sales rose 2.5 per cent at its US discount stores and 3.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores.But the continued strength of the higher end of the market was demonstrated by Nordstrom, the fashion department store, which recorded a 7.1 per cent increase in August comparable store sales, against the 3.6 per cent expected by analysts.

The stock shed 4.2 per cent to $47.18.Nymex crude ticked higher but data showing unexpectedly high inventories of crude oil and gasoline still depressed energy stocks. Marathon Oil declined 3.4 per cent to $84.18 and Weatherford International fell 2.1 per cent to $43.35.The Nasdaq was helped by gains from Ebay and Amazon, which added 4.7 per cent to $28.45 and 3.9 per cent to $30.67 respectively.Chipmakers also staged a rally. National Semiconductor jumped 4.6 per cent to $24.80 and PMC Sierra added 5.7 per cent to $6.68.At the close, the S&P 500 was unchanged, down 0.01 points at 1,304.27, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 12.97 points, at 11,382.91.The Nasdaq Composite fared slightly better, gaining 0.6 per cent, or 13.43 points, to 2,185.73.US gross domestic product growth was revised up to an annualised 2.9 per cent in the second quarter from the first estimate of 2.5 per cent, roughly in line with analysts’ estimates of 3 per cent.However, the data failed to give much impetus in either direction to the market, which traded nervously and without clear direction throughout the day.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said investors remained cautious amid uncertainty over whether the economy faced a hard or soft landing after such a long bull market.“The average bull market lasts 25 months, and this one has lasted 47 months,” he said. “This puppy is very long in the tooth.”Mr Goldman added that given geopolitical uncertainty, equities were surprisingly resilient. “The market does well not to go down to zero and start over,” he said.ADC Telecommunications, maker of telecom equipment, lost 7.3 per cent to $13.68 after it cut its full-year earnings guidance, and was lowered from “outperform” to “neutral” by Credit Suisse. The stock is down 40 per cent this year.However, the rest of the telecoms sector was more buoyant. Motorola rose 1.8 per cent to $23.86 and Lucent gained 3.5 per cent to $2.38. The S&P Communications Equipment Index rose to its highest level for more than 10 weeks.Electricity and gas distributor Public Service Enterprise Group sank 3.3 per cent to $68.58 after the company’s would-be purchaser Exelon said wrangles with regulators in the state of New Jersey were decreasing the likelihood that it would complete its proposed takeover.
222;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-08-30T20:09:14Z;Costco;;"Times are getting tougher for US retailers. That, it seems, is even true for stores catering to relatively prosperous shoppers. Costco on Wednesday became the latest retailer to warn of disappointing profits.The largest US warehouse club has built a neat business by selling top-notch goods on the cheap to its
47 million members. Members’ fees and resilience among high-spenders have tended to cushion profits. Lately, however, selling big-ticket items such as flat-screen TVs or home furniture has required even larger discounts than usual.On top of that, Costco has to deal with fierce competition, a one-time tax charge and rising energy costs. The retailer’s policy of undercutting nearby petrol stations with cheaper fuel can be a neat way to lure drivers and boost store traffic but seems to have taken quite a toll on margins.Given Costco’s record of running a lean operation and responding swiftly to changing customer demands, such issues should prove manageable. Indeed, the fall in Costco’s share price of about 5 per cent yesterday partly reflects investors’ lofty expectations. Having consistently outperformed the shares of rivals such as Wal-Mart, Costco is still trading at more than
20 times underlying earnings for the fiscal year just ended, well above its peers.However, the fact that investors should put such a multiple on a fairly mature retailer, most of whose profits come from the US, says a lot about market perceptions. In spite of the belated outpouring of fear about the housing market, the consensus view remains that the fallout will prove rather limited even if the slowdown gathers pace. That continues to look unduly optimistic, not least when it comes to the spending patterns of wealthier households in the aftermath of their lengthy shopping spree."
223;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-08-30T17:45:59Z;Costco alert points to lower US spending;;Costco, the US retailer, on Wednesday provided further evidence of weakening US consumer spending as it warned that quarterly profits would be hit by poor sales of furniture, electronics and jewellery.The warning followed Tuesday’s report from the Conference Board, which showed consumer confidence in August at its lowest level for nine months.Yields on the 10-year US Treasury bond also slipped on Wednesday to their lowest levels since March – reflecting expectations of a slowdown.Costco – whose warehouse clubs have 47m members, mostly on higher income – said it had been forced to cut prices on furniture items selling for more than $1,000 during the quarter, in response to slower sales.Jim Sinegal, chief executive, said higher petrol prices were to blame. “Obviously it has to be a factor. We have customers at the higher end of the demographic scale and so we feel that our customers are generally influenced later than other consumers across the country. But they have to be mindful of it.“Furniture seems to be a discretionary purchase and we saw that fall off a little bit. The jewellery seems to be discretionary: we saw that fall off. But toys and electronics seem to be doing well, so it is a mixed bag.”Jim Galanti, chief financial officer, said he was optimistic that petrol prices would move downwards, given the end of peak summer demand in the US and the easing of tensions in the Middle East.Costco’s overall store sales grew by 7 per cent during August – more than analysts had expected. But the retailer said its profit margins had been hit by price markdowns and that it was now expecting earnings of 68-71 cents a share, against the 77 cents expected by Wall Street.Separately, a survey published on Wednesday by Boston Consulting Group highlighted the far greater impact of higher fuel prices on middle- and lower-income consumers, with substantial reductions in eating out, holidays and spending on entertainment and impulse purchases.Michael Silverstein, an economist at BCG, said the results highlighted, in particular, the impact on the lowest-income group of families earning less than $35,000 a year.But he noted that the core of families earning $50,000-$150,000 annually, who account for 66-67 per cent of consumer spending, was adjusting purchasing habits to maintain lifestyles, while worrying about the future of energy prices in particular.

The ruling clears one of the hurdles to Altria spinning off its 86 per cent stake in Kraft, which fell 2.5 per cent to $30.37.Railroad stocks came under pressure after an investigation into a train crash encouraged government regulators to prevent railworkers from working irregular hours.

226;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-05-17T23:05:34Z;Converting consumers who are spoilt for choice;;Paula Ilardo, who works for the local government in Goodyear, Arizona, does most of her grocery shopping at the local Safeway.The traditional supermarket has recently been remodelled by the retailer to give it a more upmarket feel. But she has also been to the new Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, a 40,000 sq ft store that opened this month just opposite the Safeway.And she also drops in regularly to Fry’s, part of a chain run by Kroger, the largest US grocery group. “I run into the Fry’s on the way home because it’s just across the street from my office,” she says.Paul Schickler, meanwhile, in Los Angeles’ Manhattan Beach suburb, has plenty of choices for groceries for his family of three. He lives within a mile of Ralph’s, a traditional supermarket also owned by Kroger.“Someone is always running over there for something every two or three days,” he says.He also lives two miles from a Costco, the discount warehouse club that sells bulk groceries, and is close to two smaller high-end stores – Trader Joe’s, a gourmet store where he says they go for “the quirky stuff” – and Bristol Farms, a local natural and organic chain.The two shopping worlds reflect the scale of the challenge facing Tesco in Los Angeles and Phoenix as it searches for what it believes is another niche in US shopping habits with its planned “Fresh & Easy” concept. These will be a range of 15,000 sq ft stores that target the time-starved shopper the retailer serves in Europe with its smaller Tesco Express range – normally about a fifth of the size.The markets in the two US regions may both be competitive, but they have different dynamics.LA and southern California is already a mature and highly competitive grocery market that has been shaken up by Wal-Mart, which has struggled to win planning permission for 210,000 sq ft Supercenters against political opposition.About 370 miles to the east, on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, Phoenix, Arizona, represents a different sort of challenge. There, the leading supermarket operators are involved in the modern equivalent of a gold rush – seeking to stake out territory in one of the most rapidly expanding urban areas in the US.The Valley of the Sun is a contiguous sprawl linking Goodyear with Phoenix, Scottsdale, and some 20 other Arizona communities, and is filling up with 150,000 new residents a year, doubling its population since 1990 to nearly 4m.In the city of Goodyear alone, the number of residents is growing at 18 per cent a year. “The supermarkets are trying to keep up,” says Ms Ilardo, who is the city’s information officer.One of the city’s most prestigious new master-planned developments is Estrella Mountain Ranch, which offers residents golf courses, a lake and tennis courts but is still eight miles from the nearest grocer.“They would be happy if one of the supermarkets opened up near them,” she says.The local grocery business remains dominated by Fry’s, followed by Basha’s, a privately owned regional chain that also operates Food City, which is a range of stores aimed at the area’s rapidly growing Hispanic population.Phoenix has already attracted Wal-Mart. The retailer opened its first Supercenter in the area about four years ago, and it now has 10 stores. It has also chosen Phoenix as one of the sites for developing its new Neighborhood Market store concept, with two others in addition to the new Goodyear store. The Target chain, Wal-Mart’s rival discounter, has also opened two of its SuperTarget Supercenters in the area.Wal-Mart sees the 40,000 sq ft grocery market as a “convenience” alternative to the vast 200,000 sq ft Supercenter. This highlights the niche that Tesco is seeking to fill with its own smaller-scale stores.At Goodyear, Ms Ilardo’s regular trips to Fry’s are one sign of how the conventional 40,000 sq ft US market – with its vast range of more than 30,000 products – is vulnerable to competition from the more focused alternative that Tesco is working on. Tesco could have the ability to sell a more limited range of more profitable products, including prepared meals.The affluent and organic-conscious middle class of the Phoenix metropolitan area – whose population some developers say could reach 8m by 2020, or larger than London – has its needs also catered for by nine Trader Joe’s, two Whole Foods Markets and four Wild Oats Markets.There appears to be plenty of demand to keep up. “The city is growing by at least 100,000 people a year,” says Bob Pearlstein, of CB Richard Ellis.Additional reporting by Elizabeth Rigby
227;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Wall St up as retail earnings offset rate rise fears;;"US stocks gained on Thursday as a drop in crude oil, along with strong earnings from the retail sector offset economic data that had raised fresh interest rate fears.Unit-labour costs – an indicator of inflationary pressure – showed a bigger than forecast increase in the first quarter, adding to speculation that the US Federal Reserve, chaired by Ben Bernanke, would continue to raise interest rates. However, data also showed an increase in productivity.“One of the statements in Bernanke’s congressional testimony [last week] was that it was important that productivity continue to outpace inflation,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist with Cantor Fitzgerald, who suggested that the productivity data was a bright spot for the markets. “You can handle the inflation because the economy can produce more goods with the same number of employees.” At the close the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, or 4.40 points, at 1,312.25; the Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.9 per cent, or 19.93 points, at 2,323.90.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent, or 38.58 points, to 11,438.86 – a fresh six-year high. At one point, the Dow was up 62.80 points, the highest one-day gain since January 2000.The Dow Jones Transportation index touched an all-time high, gaining 3.4 per cent. It is up 19 per cent for the year.Freight shippers Expeditors International soared 18.3 per cent to $103.80, after it raised its dividend by more than 40 per cent and reported earnings per share 20 per cent higher than analysts had forecast.Other transportation companies gained, with Federal Express up 3.5 per cent at $118.20.The market was also boosted by falling crude prices, after data showed an increase in gasoline supplies for the first time in nine weeks. Crude for June delivery fell below $70 a barrel.A buoyant retail sector was led by organic foods supermarket Whole Foods. It posted a 27 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating forecasts, and raising its sales forecast for 2006. The shares gained 13.3 per cent to $70.42.Among the other retailers to gain from robust earnings reports was wholesale club Costco, which added 2.9 per cent at $55.53 and teen clothing chain Abercrombie and Fitch, which rose 4.8 per cent to $62.26.Archer Daniels Midland fell 7.7 per cent to $40.00, after Prudential downgraded the stock to neutral, citing concerns about the sustainability of its oil seed business.The stock was further hit by news that the US government is considering lifting the tariff on ethanol imports. This followed a lengthy rally.Electronic Arts plummeted 10.9 per cent to $48.55 after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss, and Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock. The video-game maker forecast revenue and earnings well below Wall Street’s previous forecasts."
228;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Amazon adds soup to its online offerings;;Amazon, the online retailer, has begun selling Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup, as it continues its push to establish itself as the dominant online one-stop shopping destination.The retailer’s US customers can now buy almost 2,000 basic packaged foods online, including 12-packs of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup for $12.99, and multi-packs of 70 individual servings of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes for $28.The retailer will also pay for the delivery of most grocery orders of more than $25 – underlining the degree to which it is absorbing costs as it expands its online presence into everything from sex toys to loose diamonds.Amazon said it had gradually expanded the “food and snacks” segment of its online “health and personal care” store in recent months. It said the move mirrored the increasing availability of basic food items at mainstream US drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens.“We look on this as a drug store, and you are going to find food items in a drug store,” said Tracy Ogden, an Amazon spokeswoman.By focusing on bulk purchases of non-perishable items delivered by parcel service, Amazon’s grocery sales contrast with the limited number of online grocers in the US such as Peapod, a unit of Royal Ahold, and Safeway.com.The move also reflects the development of websites such as 1800diapers.com which order bulk sales of low margin packaged items such as baby supplies, creating online competition for discount clubs such as Costco and Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club.Amazon’s food selection – beyond canned soup – is also dominated by more upscale, higher-margin brands in line with the demographics of its typical users, with organic products from Wild Oats, the second largest US organic and natural grocery chain, and from Paul Newman’s Natural Organics.But its bulk purchase pricing is also undercutting its online competition. Campbell’s Beef and Rice chunky soup, for instance, sells for $1.57 a can on Amazon, compared with $2.69 per can on Peapod, the largest US online grocer.However, one online grocer commented that Amazon’s bulk strategy didn’t seem to present a direct threat to a service that stressed fresh products and reliable and convenient delivery.Amazon offers a range of estimates for delivery of its food items, with the Campbell’s soup taking up to five weeks. Without free shipping, it would incur standard delivery costs of $9.65.Online grocery services have been less successful in the US than in Europe, reflecting lower population densities and differing shopping habits.
229;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;US March retail sales disappoint;;Leading US retailers reported disappointing March sales on Thursday, with bad weather and high petrol prices adding to the impact of a late Easter holiday.Wal-Mart Stores, the largest US discount retailer, said its US same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1.4 per cent, slightly higher than the 1.3 per cent figure it issued over the weekend.Same store sales at its US stores rose 0.8 per cent, and were up 4.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse clubs. Its main rival, Target, reported a 2.2 per cent increase in same store sales.Costco, the warehouse club, beat market expectations with a 7 per cent increase in same store sales.For April, Wal-Mart said Easter demand would help drive 4 per cent to 6 per cent same-store sales growth, while Target predicted a 9 to 11 per cent increase.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said his index of overall same store growth for the month rose 1.9 per cent, missing the forecast of 2 per cent growth. He noted that 60 per cent of retailers reported figures below forecasts that already took account of the Easter holiday.“There may be a bit of a consumer spending slow down coming in, with high-energy prices, rising interest rates and a softening of the housing market,” he said.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, again produced disappointing results, with a 13 per cent slump in same store sales at its US Gap brand stores, 7 per cent at Banana Republic and 15 per cent at Old Navy.Total overall sales for the five week period also fell, down 9 per cent, to $1.35bn.Sabrina Simmons, head of investor relations, said the performance “reflects the challenges we face to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores”.Teenage clothing retailers, which have strongly outperformed the rest of the industry over the past two years, showed signs of weakness for a second month, according to Retail Metrics’ figures. Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Aeropostale all reported sales numbers below forecasts.
230;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-03-16T19:33:57Z;Observer - US;;"The heavy truck industry usually values the ability to handle a four-way wrench nut more than academic qualifications.But Dana, the vehicle components manufacturer, appears to be going for that most niche of niche markets: the Latin-speaking truck parts buyer.Since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two weeks ago, the commercial vehicles section of the Toledo, Ohio, company’s website has switched to Latin, a move it said yesterday was a leftover from a test site not meant to go public.But the text, from Cicero, reads “nobody likes pain for its own sake, or looks for it and wants to have it, just because it is pain”. Was Dana trying to send a message to its shareholders, who have watched their shares plummet from almost $15 a year ago to just 66 cents?Alternatively, it could be linked to the appointment of Ken Hiltz, a restructuring specialist, as chief financial officer. Hiltz was educated at Harvard and Xavier University, a Jesuit college in Cincinnati with 26 Latin courses on its curriculum.Either way, it was not very good marketing: there was no mention of carrus, Latin for chariot – the nearest the ancients got to today’s big rigs.Costco isn’t giving up on Pablo Picasso.The retail chain says it is looking into reports questioning the authenticity of a supposed Picasso sketch, Drawing Arles, sold for a characteristically nine-heavy price
of $39,999.99 via the Costco website last year.It has also pulled a second sketch, which was going for $145,999.99
until this week. It was supposedly certified by Maya Widmaier-Picasso, the artist’s daughter, who told The New York Times that both certificates were forged.But Costco’s card-holding Picasso-fanciers shouldn’t despair. Jim Tutweiler, the fine art dealer who was the seller of both works, is still offering a far more modestly priced limited edition etching for $1,799.99 (shipping and handling included). There’s also La Petite Corrida, a plate-signed stone lithograph, for $1,459.99, and L’Age du Soleil, another stone etching. Luckily, none of the above require the Widmaier-Picasso stamp of approval.The liberal Netherlands’ tough stance on immigration got tougher this week with the introduction of a compulsory entrance exam for would-be entrants seeking to join family members or marry.The idea is for newcomers to take the test in their homeland so they have a basic grasp of Dutch society and language before being allowed in.Contrast that hardline stance with trends in the corporate sector, where controversial company takeover defences are quietly being dismantled to drag the Netherlands into line
with Anglo-Saxon governance standards.That trend, coupled with the rise of private-equity deal-making, has left Dutch blue-chips dangerously exposed to foreign raiders and bankers.VNU, the market researcher that has attracted a €7.5bn takeover bid, is only one of the companies targeted. Private equity has almost certainly crunched the numbers on KPN, the telecommunications company, and TNT, the mail group, too.Naturally, the homegrown old boys network that has bossed Dutch business for decades, is beginning to look uneasily over its shoulder.So how long can it be before some wag proposes an entrance exam for the business world?The questions could be similar to those posed to immigrants, which include these gems: “Do the Dutch live mostly indoors or outdoors?” and “Is the Netherlands mostly
wet or dry?”.Meanwhile, the simmering US debate over the status of illegal immigrant workers found its way into New York’s St Patrick’s Day celebration – an event known more for green beer and revelry than politics.A group called the Irish Lobby
for Immigration Reform will meet today outside – where else? – an Irish pub called O’Neill’s to protest against expected changes to US immigration law. Their rallying cry is “green cards, not green beer”.The rally, organised by Niall O’Dowd, has drawn support from US senators Ted Kennedy and John McCain. But illegal immigration has become a hot issue in many of the mid-term elections this year and many others are taking a hard line.Ironically, the ILIR is not allowed to march in Manhattan’s St Patrick’s Day Parade. Apparently, there is a rule prohibiting advocacy groups from marching – even if they’re Irish."

Gap, which unveiled an 11 per cent drop in February sales, saw its shares fall 2 per cent to $18.28, while teenage fashion retailer Abercrombie tumbled 9.2 per cent to $61.55Discount retailers and department stores provided some relief for the sector, however, as Costco Wholesale gained 1.2 per cent to $52.80 and Kohl’s rose 0.5 per cent to $49.03.Along with retailers, investors also had their collective eye on energy stocks, which rose as concerns over possible disruptions to supplies and the threat of further violence in Nigeria pushed crude futures above $63.Energy service providers were among the top gainers in the sector. Schlumberger climbed 2.9 per cent to $121.42 and Halliburton jumped 3.3 per cent to $71.69.By contrast, financial stocks came under pressure amid renewed concerns over interest rate raises. Citigroup lost 1 per cent to $46,05, Wells Fargoretreated 1.3 per cent to $63.84 and Bank of America lost 1 per cent to $45.15.On the upside, Google continued to rally from Tuesday’s sharp sell-off. Its shares moved up 3.2 per cent to $376.45 as a bullish outlook from Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer, soothed investor concerns about slowing growth.Dana was the worst performer on the S&P. Its shares plunged 43.8 per cent to $1.04 after the ailing auto-parts maker failed to make a $21m bond payment, fuelling speculation that the group might have to soon file for bankruptcy protection.Detroit auto-makers slid on the news. Ford lost 3.7 per cent to $7.66 while General Motors shed 2.5 per cent to $19.41.CBS’s class B shares fell 2.4 per cent to $24.06 after Citigroup advised investors to sell, citing valuation concerns. The investmen firm added that it expected
revenue from CBS’s radio business to come under pressure after the departure of radio show host Howard Stern.Chicos FAS, the women’s casual-clothing retailer, slumped 14.1 per cent

232;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

This compares to the $263.4m, or 54 cents per share it achieved the previous year, excluding one-time items.Sales at stores open at least a year rose by 8 per cent in February, outpacing Sam’s Club as Costco cashed in on its reputation for selling high-margin items such as digital music players, flat-screen television sets and furniture during the vital Chirtsmas shopping season.Net profits that include exceptional items fell 3 per cent compared to the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, revenues rose 11 per cent to $13.8bn.Costco also narrowed selling, general and administrative expenses by two basis points to 9.5 per cent of sales, while gross margins, or the percentage of sales left after the cost of goods sold, shrank to 10.75 per cent, from 10.93 percent.For the six months to February 12th, Costco’s net profits increased 2.7 per cent to $512m on revenues that advanced 11 per cent.
234;COST;Costco Wholesale;2006-02-28T19:15:51Z;Report from Orlando: shoppers get selective;;"Mildred Sjostrand may be the future of the American food retail business. On a warm evening last week, Venezuela-born Mrs Sjostrand and her husband were loading shopping into the back of their car in the palm-tree shaded car park of the Publix Sabor supermarket in Kissimmee, Florida.The supermarket, which opened last year, targets the region’s Hispanic community with a broad range of fresh and packaged Latino foods. It stocks Colombiana brand soda, Publix’s own brand malt drink, maize flour mix for tortillas and several varieties of taro, the root used in Cuban and Central American cooking.“I like the wider range of foods I can find here; there are more Hispanic products – plus, it has good prices,” says Mrs Sjostrand, a local resident who visits the store once or twice a week, particularly to stock up on perishable products.She does not visit the Publix store for other basic items, such as washing powder and paper towels, though, preferring to drive about seven miles to the Costco warehouse club. “You get a big quantity and . . . you get good prices,” she says, adding that she is also a regular visitor to her local Wal-Mart Supercenter.Mrs Sjostrand’s shopping habits reflect how the way Americans shop for groceries has changed over the past 10 years – with a mix of shopping destinations now taking the place of the traditional single weekly trip to the local supermarket.She is also shopping in a market that serves as a model of how the rise of Wal-Mart in particular has changed the regional market. And the fragmentation that results creates new opportunities – opportunities now being targeted by Tesco, the UK grocer, with its plans to establish a range of “convenience” stores on the US west coast next year.Wal-Mart has expanded aggressively around Orlando since entering the market 20 years ago. The area has a greater density of Wal-Marts than most areas of the US – with 20 locations in a 22 mile radius of Orlando’s centre.Wal-Mart now controls 31 per cent of the supermarket sector in the Orlando/Daytona Beach market region where it has 42 stores selling groceries, according to TDLinx, a retail analyst.But Publix, which is privately held, remains the market leader, with 37 per cent of the market from its 107 stores in the region.Winn-Dixie, the regional chain that was previously Publix’s main competitor, has fared less well. It sought bankruptcy protection last year – citing the Wal-Mart effect – and its 87 stores in the region are struggling with just 14 per cent of the regional market.Darrell Rigby, head of the retail practice at Bain, the consultants, says Orlando reflects what has happened elsewhere in the US – with Publix managing to hold on to its market by opening more stores and focusing on local market needs.David Marks of Marketplace Advisers, an Orlando-based retail consultant, points out that Winn-Dixie was dependent on a lower income customer base than Publix, making it particularly vulnerable to Wal-Mart.“It’s really been a two-man race between Publix and Wal-Mart,” says Mr Marks, who shops for groceries at Publix or Wal-Mart.In addition to its high marks for customer service, Publix is regarded as one of the US supermarket industry’s masters of localisation.Its Sabor store, for example, includes a small British foods selection, with bottles of HP Sauce, Marmite and Heinz Salad Cream aimed at local British expatriates and visitors to Disney World.In addition to its new Hispanic format, Publix is also remodelling stores in the prosperous Florida communities of Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton to sell natural and organic foods.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is piling on the pressure in the Orlando market, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the US. The area’s population of 1.8m is expected to increase by 14 per cent by 2009, with prosperous housing developments springing up in East Orlando where most Wal-Mart stores are based.The region is also one of the few areas in the US where the retailer is expanding its network of smaller Neighborhood Market stores. At 35,000-40,000 sq ft, the format is roughly a quarter the size of a Wal-Mart Supercenter, the format that remains the focus of Wal-Mart’s expansion.“In general, we try to site the Supercenters . . . and after that we look to in-fill with the Neighborhood Markets,” says Eric Brewer, of Wal-Mart’s Florida real estate development team.The retailer has four Neighborhood Markets among its 20 Orlando stores, with two more planned for this year. The first opened at the junction of South Chickasaw Trail and Lake Underhill Road last year – less than two miles from the nearest Supercenter. The site is also opposite an older Publix supermarket.The Neighborhood Market, with its architectural facade in place of the usual Wal-Mart plain big blue box, is roughly the same size as the adjacent Publix and stocks the same wide range of about 30,000 items.But in spite of the presence on its shelves of five brands of peanut butter, Wal-Mart argues the format is not trying to be a traditional supermarket but rather a more convenient version of a Supercenter.Publix, meanwhile, is preparing to build a new store on its adjacent site to replace the ageing unit, which continues to draw customers. The store may have higher prices overall but it has its own butchers and bakery counters, and offers complementary coffee, while its staff continue the chain’s tradition of offering to carry shopping to the customers’ cars – under a strict no tipping policy.“Wal-Mart may be cheaper by a few pennies,” says Sigismundo Isidro, a retiree picking up a few groceries at the Publix store. “But I don’t buy so much when I shop. I’m more comfortable at the Publix – I’ve shopped at Publix most of my life.”But while Wal-Mart and Publix dominate the Orlando market, they are not alone at the junction of Chickasaw and Lake Underhill: a neon sign outside the Walgreen’s drug store advertises a dozen eggs for 99 cents and a gallon of milk for $2.49 – a dollar less than at Wal-Mart.Inside, the store has half an aisle of less competitively priced packaged food, including flour, pasta, tins of vegetables and tea and coffee – part of a broad push by the main US drug store chains to win extra business from their customers.Research by Retail Forward, a leading US retail consultancy, estimates that while the number of shoppers visiting traditional supermarkets weekly fell from 56 per cent to 46 per cent between 1999 and 2004, the percentage visiting drug stores increased by 4 per cent and those visiting gasoline convenience stores increased by 8 per cent.This, say retail analysts, is the market that Tesco’s US strategy is aimed at, with its plans for a range of small shops that will focus on the “grab and go” business.However, Publix, Winn-Dixie and Wal-Mart all remain committed to the large format stores with extensive ranges that Americans are used to – in spite of the increasing evidence that more customers such as Mrs Sjostrund are using the traditional format for “top up” shopping.“It is still the most common shopping format,” says Bain’s Mr Rigby of the traditional store. “But customers are learning to appreciate a variety of alternatives as well . . . such as convenience store formats. They are using different stores for different shopping occasions.”Retailers see the pros of convenienceWal-Mart currently operates just 100 of its smaller Neighborhood Market stores – a fraction of its total US store base of more than 3,800 stores. But Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, says the format will play an increasingly important role in the retailer’s future growth by focusing on “convenience”.Wal-Mart, he said in an FT interview in November, will be “looking at the Neighborhood Market format as a vehicle . . . to serve customers who need convenience for a key reason for shopping at Wal-Mart.”In Orlando, Wal-Mart’s Eric Brewer sees the markets as being for “people who walk in and ask what they are going to have for dinner tonight. We offer a lot of grab and go items, such as pre-prepared meals.”At 40,000 sq ft, the typical Neighborhood Market is about the same size as a regular US supermarket and vastly bigger than the Tesco Express store format used in Europe, which Tesco says will be the model for its US line of convenience stores.At just 3,000 sq ft, a Tesco Express is roughly the size of the US 7-Eleven or Circle K convenience stores that crowd the US urban landscape. But Tesco’s stores sell a premium range of 7,000 lines, including both ready-to-eat meals and packaged and perishable foods and ingredients – something no US supermarket retailer has yet attempted.“I think when Tesco opens their stores, US shoppers will be surprised at how they define ‘convenience’ store,” says Darrell Rigby of Bain, the management consultancy."

The chipmaking sector has enjoyed a healthy rally in November on reports of strong demand for consumer electronics goods in the run up to the holiday shopping season.Overall, the Amex semiconductor index shed 1.7 per cent as the other chip stocks also lost ground to the consolidation.Intel pulled back 1.7 per cent to $25.70 ahead of its mid-quarter guidance report, due after the close, while Xilinx fell 1.7 per cent to $26.02 after it too improved its forecast for the current quarter.The losses weighed on the wider market, which closed decidedly lower after having hovered around its Wednesday closing level throughout much of the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 0.5 per cent, or 55.79 points, to 10,775.12, dragged down by General Motors’ precipitous 4.5 per cent decline.The broader S&P 500 also backtracked, easing back 0.1 per cent, or 1.53 points to 1,255.84, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3 per cent, or 5.56 points to 2,246.45.The Amex oil index gained 1.5 per cent after crude futures rebounded as cold weather in the US northeast bolstered demand for heating oil.Homebuilders, which have seen heavy speculative activity in recent weeks as investors gauge the likelihood of a bursting of the housing price bubble, found respite in a drop in bond yields.The Philadelphia Homebuilding index bounced back 0.8 per cent, after slumping 2.3 per cent in the previous session on concerns over interest rate rises.Toll Brothers rose 3.6 per cent to $35.55 after unveiling a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit on a 40 per cent rise in revenue. However gains were limited by the company’s cautious outlook for fiscal 2006.Still on the earnings front, Brinker, owner of the the Chili’s restaurant franchise, had to lower its profit forecasts for the second quarter and the full year after a steak promotion lured in fewer customers than expected.The news drove shares down 9.7 per cent to $36.71.Retailer Costco slumped 2.2 per cent to $48.29 after its first-quarter profits came in below market expectations.Blackberry maker Research in Motion gave up early gains to close 1.4 per cent lower at $60.75.Its shares initially rose following reports that the company was in talks with NPT to end their long-running patent dispute.
236;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-12-06T18:54:33Z;US companies fall prey to religous lawsuits;;At the centre of the company organisation chart is Jesus: all department heads report to Him. Preferred Management, a home healthcare company in the Midwest, is an example of what has become an increasingly common phenomenon in America: employers and employees who bring religion into the workplace.Religious diversity in the American workplace has increased dramatically since a wave of immigrants came to the US in the 1990s. But legal experts say greater diversity has also brought more lawsuits under America’s tough job discrimination laws.“More workers are expressing religious views at work … and more employers are bringing their religion into the workplace,” said Peggy Mastroianni, associate legal counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the US employment watchdog. Complaints of religious discrimination received by the Commission have risen by 27 per cent since 2000.The war in Iraq has focused attention on cases involving Muslims. But the issue goes well beyond Islam: US companies also employ more evangelicals, more members of African and Asian Christian sects, and more agnostics and atheists than ever before, legal experts say.That had its advantages, Ms Mastroianni said last week at a conference of employment lawyers organised by Ali-Aba (the American Law Institute-American Bar Association). “On Christmas, the Muslims and Jews can work and on Muslim and Jewish holidays the Christians can work,” she said. But it can also cause tensions if employees feel that their boss – or their co-worker – is harassing or penalising them for their religious beliefs, refusing to accommodate their religious needs, or even trying to convert them.EEOC v Preferred Management was one such case: the owner required all employees to conform to her fundamentalist religious beliefs. She refused to hire a Unitarian and required another employee to read the Bible daily as part of a company-mandated self-improvement plan.Employees were asked to share their religious experiences in public meetings and, according to the EEOC, those with “non-conforming religious views” were chastised as being “sinful, weak” or “not walking in God’s path”.The jury found that the owner’s attempts to impose her beliefs on employees violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits job discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex or national origin. The company had to pay $250,000 (€208,000, £147,000) in punitive damages and $20,000 each in compensatory damages to seven employees.There are also a growing number of complaints brought by employees who claim their religious rights have been compromised at work – either because employers fail to give them time off for religious observance, or prohibit forms of dress tied to their religion.The biggest recent court ruling in this area involved Costco, the wholesaling chain, which sacked an employee for displaying her body piercings at the cash register.She claimed this was required by her religion, the Church of Body Modification. Costco said this violated its clean-cut brand image and insisted she cover piercings with a Band-Aid. A federal appeals court ruled in favour of Costco for sacking her – because she refused to co-operate with the Band-Aid plan.Though the court ducked the issue, the real dispute was whether her religious beliefs were genuine, legal experts say. According to Peter Panken, an employment law expert at Epstein, Becker & Green, courts sometimes struggle to determine what constitutes genuine religious belief.He says the Ku Klux Klan would not qualify as a religion – but a white supremacist belief in a system called “Creativity” might, according to one recent ruling.Generally, a religious belief is “whatever the plaintiff alleges that it is”, he says, but adds that a preference for cat food definitely does not meet the criteria (despite one recent attempt to make such a case).But sometimes, when employers allow workers to express their religious beliefs at work, this can cause problems with co-workers.One case involved an employee who insisted, for religious reasons, on wearing an anti-abortion button showing a foetus. A federal appeals court found that the job discrimination law does not protect an employee who wants to “impose (her) religious views on others.”Courts have split, however, on whether employers can prevent employees from evangelising the customers: for example, by using the phrase “have a blessed day”.Ms Mastroianni recommended that the best way to avoid lawsuits over religion in the workplace was for companies to make sure their harassment policy covered religion, and to act immediately if they knew that an employee’s religious expression was unwelcome to others. But legal experts say they expect the number of such lawsuits to continue to grow.

There were no upside surprises, nothing to move the needle.”The good economic news prompted investors to snatch up blue chips such as Alcoa, up 3.2 per cent at $28.28, and McDonald’s, up 4.4 per cent at $35.33.The gains pushed up the Dow Jones Industrial Average 107.74 points, or 1 per cent, to 10,913.61, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 15.35 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,264.80. The Nasdaq Composite index, helped by Intel’s advance, jumped 34.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 2,267.17.A bullish note from Bear Stearns drove shares in Intel up 1.9 per cent to $37.26. The broker said it expected Intel to raise its guidance for fourth-quarter sales on greater demand from PC companies. The news lifted the overall semiconductor sector, which surged 4.2 per cent on the day.On the downside, some retailers fell despite strong sales growth. Concerns that intense discounting would hurt profit margins limited gains for some, while pushing shares in others lower.Wal-Mart fell 1.1 per cent to $48.03, as did Costco, the wholesaler, down 2.3 per cent to 48.79. The overall S&P retail index gained 0.6 per cent.Consumer products manufacturers remained popular however, with Procter & Gamble tacking on 0.8 per cent to $57.64, while Kellogg rose 0.8 per cent to $44.44.Energy stocks rose along with crude prices. The heavily weighed oil index rose 3.4 per cent, with Exxon Mobil up 2.1 per cent to $59.22.This week’s spike in crude prices did not help the embattled auto sector.Both General Motors and Ford Motor reported double-digit drops in November sales, adding more gloom to a sector which has been struggling with high labour and health costs.GM rose 3.2 per cent to $22.61 - still down for the week - while Ford edged down another 0.4 per cent to $8.10 after their shares slid nearly 5 per cent in the previous session.Apple Computer added 5.6 per cent to $71.60 as demand for its iPod music player continued to rise in the run-up to Christmas.Google bounced back, its shares rising 2.3 per cent to $414.09 as investors dismissed warnings that the company might be overvalued.
238;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-10-06T20:30:15Z;Wall St gives up gains despite bright retail news;;Wall Street surrendered earlier gains to close lower on Thursday, after comments on inflation from a Federal Reserve official overshadowed a continued decline in oil prices and major retailers calming fears over a sharp slowdown in US consumer spending.After a bright start, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both fell to fresh three-month lows, with the Dow off 0.3 per cent at 10,284.38 and the S&P 500 0.4 per cent lower at 1,191.13. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,083.14.Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, once again expressed his concern at rising inflation. His speech reignited worries about tighening monetary policy and its effects on corporate profits.An index for the banking sector, which benefits from higher interest rates, rose 0.4 per cent.Even before the reversal, upbeat sentiment had been laced with caveats. Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the initial rally had been fuelled by relief that retailers’ sales figures were a little better than expected, as well as falling oil prices and a view that the recent market sell-off had been overdone.However, he warned of dangers ahead as consumers faced higher heating bills and companies were forced to pass on energy-related cost increases.Wal-Mart was a bright spot among retailers, rising 0.9 per cent to $43.91 as its like-for-like sales rose 3.8 per cent in September, boosted by higher gasoline prices.Strong gasoline revenues also boosted turnover at Costco, which reported a 7 per cent increase in same-store sales in its fourth quarter, helping push earnings 20 per cent higher. Costco rose 4.7 per cent to $44.92.Federated Department Stores, the owner of Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, also rose 2.2 per cent to $65 as September like-for-like sales rose 1.3 per cent, beating analyst expectations.But women’s clothing retailer Talbots slid 7.8 per cent to $26.70 as like-for-like sales tumbled 5.1 per cent in September, with third quarter earnings likely to come in well below last year’s figure.But Guess jumped 16.4 per cent to $24.15 as the clothing retailer bucked the trend by reporting a 14.2 per cent jump in September like-for-like sales.Starbucks rose 3.7 per cent to $51.67 as same-store sales leapt 10 per cent in the five weeks to October 2.Pharmaceuticals outfit The Medicines Co slumped 22.3 per cent to $17.03 as it blamed disappointing sales of Angiomax, its blood-clotting agent, for a projected full-year loss of $10m. The company previously had forecast a profit of $27m.JPMorgan, 0.8 per cent better at $33.73, and Morgan Stanley, up 0.3 per cent at $53.15, benefited from a note from Prudential suggesting the duo could merge.
239;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-10-06T11:48:40Z;Oil prices have mixed impact on US stores;;"US retailers largely managed to overcome the impact of higher fuel prices and unseasonably hot weather in September, according to new monthly sales figures, despite growing anxiety about the resilience of consumer demand.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the ICSC’s sales index for the month rose by 4 per cent, against the ICSC’s original forecast of a 3 per cent increase.But he noted that half a percentage point of the sales gain could be attributed to higher value petrol sales by retailers including Costco and Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, reflecting the increase in fuel prices since last year.“When I step back, I see more of the same story…it’s not good news, not bad news; it’s more of the same,” he said of the overall figures.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported a 3.8 per cent increase in sales, but noted that sales increased by only 3.2 per cent if the impact of fuel sales at its Sam’s Club stores were excluded. Without fuel and international sales, Costco’s sales increased by 8 per cent.Wal-Mart also said the costs of store closures and related relief work following hurricanes Katrina and Rita would reduce its third quarter earnings by one cent, while maintaining overall earnings guidance of 55 to 59 cents. Wal-Mart also said it was expecting an increase of October sales in the 2 to 4 per cent range.Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival, reported a 5.6 per cent increase in same store sales, and also maintained its $1.50 earnings forcecast for the second half of the year. Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said the retailer expected strong profit rates seen in the third quarter to offset “more modest earnings growth in the fourth quarter”.Among the retailers who reported disappointing figures, Talbots, the mainstream clothing retailer, said it was cutting its third quarter earnings forecast after a 5.1 per cent fall in comparable September sales and lower customer traffic. It said that concerns over the hurricanes and high fuel prices had led to customers deciding to postpone autumn season shopping.Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent fall in sales, citing in part the impact of unseasonably warm weather on autumn fashion sales.Federated department stores, said September’s hurricanes and the impact of high fuel prices had contributed to a sales increase of just 1.3 per cent at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, below the 2 to 3 per cent it had expected.Federated shares rose more than three per cent after the company also issued a stronger than expected forecast of earnings for the third and fourth quarters, following the completion of its merger with May department stores.Mr Niemira said he believed that higher gas prices were continuing to weigh on overall sales, despite the relatively strong performance of the sector, estimating their impact at around one percent. “High energy prices are a deterrent to the pace of spending,” he said.* Costco, the discount warehouse club, yesterday said its board had approved a $1bn share buy back programme, as it reported a 20 per cent increase in its fourth quarter profits.The retailer reported net income of $354.7m, or 73 cents a share, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of around 65 cents a share, as it benefited from a tax adjustment worth 7 cents per share."
240;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-09-01T20:45:16Z;Wall Street resilient as energy woes persist;;US stocks showed resilience on Thursday in the face of a catalogue of market-negative developments.Participants reacted calmly to disappointing economic data, rising oil prices and mounting concerns about the effects of Hurricane Katrina, focusing instead on a potential silver lining: an end, or a severe curtailment at least, to the interest-rate tightening policy of the Federal Reserve.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had edged up 1.26 points to 1,221.59 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.97, or 0.2 per cent, to 10,459.63. The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 4.19 points to 2,147.90.The mixed performance comes after major market measures rallied about 1 per cent on Wednesday.On the economic data front, consumer spending rose 1 per cent in July, buoyed up by deep discounts on offer from auto makers.Personal income rose 0.3 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent in June. The combination of rising spending and slowing income growth sent the personal savings rate to minus 0.6 per cent, the lowest level in the 46 years the US government has tracked this measure.Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index posted an unexpected fall to 53.6 in August.Ed Yardeni, economic strategist for Oak Associates, suggests that investors believe that gas prices and potential shortages over the Labor Day weekend will slow the economy enough to curtail the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases.He says Wall Street also believes the economy will rebound when the energy infrastructure is restored, adding: “I agree with this upbeat outlook following the grim disaster.”Banc of America strategist Tom McManus agreed that the prospect of a curtailed rate-hiking cycle was cheering Wall Street.He said that the yield on the two-year Treasury, a sentiment gauge on rate moves, had fallen from just over 4 per cent to 3.7 per cent, suggesting that the market was “betting that there’s only one tightening left”.Energy stocks remained among the hottest performers. Valero Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $109.50, XTO Energy climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.77 and ExxonMobil tacked on 2.97 per cent to $61.68.Another big winner was Chiron, whose shares were up 17.81 per cent to $42.93 after Novartis made a $4.5bn bid to buy the remainder of the drug company. Shares of Novartis added 1 per cent to $49.19.Elsewhere, retailers had a mixed day as strong August sales reports were offset by concerns about September.Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $45.09 after posting a 3.3 per cent rise in sales, Costco edged up 0.5 per cent to $43.18 and Target declined 1.8 per cent to $52.78 despite posting a 6.3 per cent sales increase.
241;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-07-28T07:54:15Z;Thomson losses widen as restructuring continues;;The exit from its loss-making television unit continued to affect profits at Thomson, the French media technology group, which reported a net loss of €471m ($567.8m) in the six months to the end of June.However, without the losses from the discontinued TV business, pre-tax profits fell by a third to €65m from €97m last year.Total sales were down 12 per cent at €2.97bn, although the group said revenues at core businesses rose 11.8 per cent to €2.85bn on a constant currency basis. Thomson claimed that the total sales figure was not meaningful because of the discontinued TV and other related operations.Frank Dangeard, chief executive, said that the group had put in place most of the essential elements of its two-year strategic plan, in particular the exit from displays and related activities. The root and branch restructuring will see the group refocus on professional media services from consumer electronics.“Our core business delivered a strong performance in the first half, with growth in revenues across all two-year plan activities, stable margins and significantly increased cash flow,” he said.Separately, Thomson announced the acquisition of PRN, a market leader in video advertising in public places, for about $285m in cash. The company manages in-store networks in over 6,000 locations in the US including retailers Wal-Mart and CostCo, and reaches 200m viewers each month.In late June, Thomson sold its loss making picture tube division to Videocon, the Indian consumer electronics group, for €240m, signalling its final withdrawal from TV manufacturing.Looking forward to the second half of the year, Thomson reiterated its expectations of 10 per cent growth at its core businesses. The group added that it expected a stronger performance from services than the systems and equipment division, because of acquisitions and the weak audio/video market. However, there would be charges related to disposals of about €30m.In early trade in Paris, shares were down 2.78 per cent to €18.89.
242;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-07-10T17:59:21Z;Pile high, sell cheap and pay well;;Look!” said the first little boy to walk by with his parents. “Awesome!” the next child, a little girl, said to her mother, pointing at a vast inflatable backyard paddling pool suspended from the warehouse ceiling.At Costco’s Kirkland warehouse located outside Seattle, the pool dangling from the rafters was presumably apparently delivering what Richard Galanti, the US retailer’s chief financial officer, calls the “wow” factor – that extra bit of retail excitement that it wants to produceso as in order to draw visitors be a central part of the appeal of a visit to its cavernous, no-frills warehouse stores.“If we have a floating inflatable ring for towing behind a boat, it will be the biggest there is . . . and it will be 10ft across . . . and it will only cost $49.99,” Mr Galanti says, speaking with rapid enthusiasm in his modest office at Costco’s headquarters in the nearby suburb of Issaquah.But, in the world of US retail, it is not just Costco’s “stack ’em high, sell ’em cheap” approach to higher quality items such as organic spinach and balsamic vinegar that merits solicits attention.In a country the US, where the retail industry has been convulsed over the past decade by the rise of Wal-Mart and its rival discounters, Costco’s discount warehouse club is part of the revolution. But unlike Wal-Mart, whose low-cost labour model has provoked increasingly vocal criticism, Costco has managed to remain competitive while providing its workers with the highest wages and best healthcare plans available anywhere in the US retail industry.In the anti-Wal-Mart camp, “Costco is seen as the White Knight to Wal-Mart’s Darth Vader,” says Nelson Lichtenstein, a University of California professor of labour history, who is editing a new book on Wal-Mart’s rise.Costco was founded by Jim Sinegal, chief executive and president, and Jeff Brotman, now company chairman, in 1983 – the same year that Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, opened Sam’s Club, a his rival warehouse club. , Sam's Club.Both follow the same broad philosophy, developed for small business operators, rather than for individual shoppers: sell a limited number of items in bulk to reduce handling overheads, use mass orders to win attractive pricing from ­suppliers and sell membership subscriptions to boost returns and guarantee customer loyalty.At the Kirkland Costco on a Monday afternoon, shoppers pass the threshold every couple of seconds, flashing their $45 annual Costco membership cards at a staff membern employee at the door.Inside, there are plasma screen TVs for $3,999.99, and three pounds of bananas for 99 cents. There are clothes piled on trestle tables, surrounded by warehouse steel stacks of goods.All this is possible because Costco does not waste money on other things. There are no signs on the aisles and comparatively few staff, no money is spent on advertising, and there is no Costco does not spend money on advertising. It doesn't have an investor relations or communications department.“Anything we can do to lower the expenses translates into being able to sell the merchandise for lower cost,” says Mr Galanti. he says. ““So that we are the extreme value proposition for quality goods.”If membership fees of $960m are excluded, Costco made just $425m in operating profits from its sales of $47bn last year – less than one cent of every dollar it makes at the tills. Wal-Mart has an overall operating profit margin – which includes all its outlets, not just warehouse stores – of around 5 per cent.But Costco’s frugality does not extend to pay and working conditions. The average hourly wage for a full and part-time hourly US employee is $17.41, according to the ­company. At Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, the sum for a similar employee same employee received only is around $12 an hour. , while basic wages at Wal-Mart’s discount stores are below $10 per hour.“It’s important to pay people a fair living wage,” says Mr Galanti, “and if you do, and it’s better than everybody else, you’re going to get better people – and they’re going to stick around longer, and we see that.”Costco has a staff turnover rate of 17 per cent annually, excluding seasonal hires, compared with 70 per cent seen in the rest of the sector. Only six per cent of new staff leave within the first year, which again reduces costs. “First and foremost, it’s the right thing to do,” says Mr Galanti. “And long-term, we know it pays ­dividends.” ” says Galanti.While Wal-Mart, Target and other US discounters have vigorously resisted union attempts to organise their workers, around just under 20 about 20 per cent of Costco’s 84,000 US workers are members of the Teamsters union. Costco acquired the union-organised workers when it acquiredpurchased Price Club’s warehouses in 1993 – but, significantly, it has not sought to shun the unions.“We prefer not to have them,” admits Mr says Galanti of the unions. “But we’re not going to fight them. It’s up to the employees to make that decision, not us.”n't sought to get the unions out.Only one Costco warehouse has been organised by the Teamsters since 1993. But Roma Aloise, who heads the Teamsters Costco unit, says the company “has played it pretty straight-forward” during organising drives.“Jim Sinegal believes in treating people right,” he Mr Aloise says of Costco’s chief executive, CEOwho was a vocal supporter of John Kerry’s unsuccessful 2004 presidential bid.Wall Street has sometimes been less appreciative of Costco’s high-wage model. In August 2003, the company’s shares fell around about 20 per cent after it reduced its earnings forecast, amid intensifying competition from Sam’s Club and growing healthcare costs. Costco increased employee contributions to its healthcare scheme last year, easing some of the pressure on costs.The company Costco is also not immune to all the criticisms now being directed at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club. It rejects calls for independent monitoring of standards at its suppliers’ factories. It is also fighting a would-be class action civil rights law suit alleging a pattern of ­discrimination against its women employees.It also acknowledges shared interests with its rival - particularly on attempts to limit the development of “big box” retail locations. In 1999, when the California state legislature passed a bill - backed by the unions and large supermarket chains - that would have severely limited future development of large stores, Costco joined Wal-Mart and Target in a campaign to get the measure overturned. It spent $2m on newspaper advertising, an unprecedented move for the company, and organised a customer's petition calling for a veto by the governor. “They said it's not you we're after...our view was that its not right, its not competitive, and as soon as you succeeded there you'd come after us anyway,” says Galanti.But, for all this, Meanwhilethe price fight with Sam’s Club ­continues. A few miles from the Kirkland Costco, the Sam's Club in Aurora, Seattle, was undercutting Costco on bananas, with three pounds for just 96 cents. And it was selling bottles of 1999 Georges LaTour Cabernet Sauvignon for $59.77 - 21 cents cheaper than Costco's 2001 vintage.Like Wal-Mart, Costco pursues the goal of low prices with an almost religious zeal. It also maintains a strict limit on how much above cost price it will charge the customer – 14 per cent for branded goods and 15 per cent for its own Kirkland brand products.“We’re extremely fanatical and disciplined about prices,” says Mr Galanti, using the shirt he is wearing as an example.“We’re extremely fanatical and disciplined about prices,” says Mr Galanti, using the shirt he is wearing as an example.Costco started selling the shirt, which Mr Galanti reckons would cost about $40 in a department store, injust three basic colours under its Kirkland brand for $17.99. It was so popular that they went back with a new, even bigger order, and got a lower price.“Overnight, we lowered the price from $17.99 to $12.99. Now, as CFO, I’m going: ‘How about $14.99?’ But that’s not how it works.”“Our view is that that is how companies get in trouble in the retail business,” he says. “They turn around one day and they are their not as special as they used to be.”COSTCO AND THE ORIGINS OF WAREHOUSE CLUB SHOPPINGCostco and Sam’s Club opened their first stores in 1983. But the concept of membership-based warehouse club shopping had been launched in the US by Sol Price, one of the great figures of 20th century American retail.Mr Price, now 89, was a pioneer of the US discount shopping retail revolution, opening a chain called Fed-Mart in California in the 1950s. After selling Fed-Mart, he and his son Robert opened the first Price Club discount store in a converted aircraft hangar in San Diego in 1976.Jim Sinegal, Costco’s joint founder, was one of Mr Price’s protégés, and Wal-Mart’s Sam Walton started Sam’s Club after a visit to Mr Price in California. Mr Walton, who died in 1992 aged 74, acknowledged in his autobiography that he had borrowed “as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business”.But unlike Mr Walton, Mr Price was always sympathetic to unions and believed in paying above-market wages, reflecting what Nelson Lichtenstein, professor of labour history at the University of California at Santa Barbara, says were his roots in the postwar order established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.Robert Price is now chief executive of the family’s latest warehouse venture, Price Smart, which operates stores in Central America, the Caribbean and the Philippines.

Neiman Marcus, the leading US luxury store which is being sold to private equity investors for $5.1bn, on Wednesday reported an 11 percent jump in sales.However, same-store sales at Wal-Mart’s US stores and discount warehouses rose by just 2.5 per cent, at the lower end of its forcast of 2-4 per cent growth. Wal-Mart said that food sales grew faster than sales of other goods, and that most of the increase in comparable store sales was attributable to customers spending more dollars per visit.Target, the second largest US discount store, saw a 5.1 per cent increase in same store sales. Costco, the discount warehouse club, reported a 3 per cent increase in same store sales at its US locations, and cited the impact of poor weather on sales of seasonal goods and clothing.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, posted better-than-expected May same-store sales of 3.5 per cent, above analysts’ estimates of 1.9 per cent.Youth retailer Wet Seal saw a 57 per cent increase in comparable store sales, sending its shares up around 10 per cent in New York, while Bebe and Abercrombie Fitch continued their strong performance with increases of 40.3 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Federated and Gap both missed analysts’ sales estimates, with Terry Lundgren, Federated’s CEO, saying that cool weather hurt sales of warm-weather apparel such as swimwear and sandals at the department store chain. Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, and suggested that continued markdowns on its summer product would continue to affect its profit margins until the introduction of new autumn lines.■ Citigroup is to buy $6.6bn in credit card debt managed by Federated and May’s department stores, in a deal that will generate cash to fund Federated’s acquisition of May’s. Citigroup is to pay an 11.5 per cent premium on the credit card receivables, or about $760m, while the deal will leave Federated with $4.5bn in cash after tax. The two have also agreed that Citigroup will operate the future credit card operations by the retailer, which owns the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s chains.
245;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-05-26T18:38:00Z;Costco sees faster expansion ahead;;Costco, the US warehouse club retailer, said on Thursday it expected to increase its rate of expansion significantly in its coming fiscal year, with 25-30 new warehouses planned in the US and internationally.“Our expansion is deliberately and definitely ramping up …I can finally say with some confidence that we are going to see some good expansion next year,” said Richard Galanti, chief financial officer.Costco currently operates 452 warehouse stores, including 334 in the US, and has been seeking to expand in the face of increasing public scrutiny in the US of development of big box retailers. Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, its main rival, operates more than 550 warehouses in the US, and about another 90 internationally.Mr Galanti said Costco now expected to add 17 stores this financial year, which ends on August 31, slightly below the 19-20 stores originally predicted, with one store in California delayed by environmental concerns.He said Costco's expansion ambitions faced growing challenges in finding appropriate locations for new warehouses that were “filling in” its existing US network, and was dealing with growing regulatory attention to big-box development.“There is increased traffic mitigation and civic issues, with regard to neighbourhood issues …we're working on more units to get the same number of units opened.“Real estate efforts have doubled, if not tripled, around here in the last few years, but the challenges of real estate have also increased,” he said.Mr Galanti also highlighted growth in sales at Costco's website, which he said had increased 37 per cent during the company's last quarter, with an average transaction value of more than $400.Costco reported a 6 per cent increase in quarterly profits to $209.8m yesterday, or 43 cents per diluted share, with high fuel prices reducing income from its discount petrol stations.Net sales increased 10 per cent to $11.75bn, while sales at warehouses open for at least a year increased 7 per cent.
246;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-05-03T21:17:08Z;Funeral ‘price fixing’ lawsuit filed;;Batesville Casket, producer of 45 per cent of the coffins sold in the US, has been accused of engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy with funeral homes that has cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.A lawsuit, filed yesterday on behalf of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, also names as defendents three leading funeral companies - Service Corporation International, Alderwoods Group and Stewart Enterprises - which together operate 2,150 funeral homes across the US, with combined revenues of over $3bn.The suit accuses the funeral homes of refusing to handle Batesville and other coffins supplied more cheaply by online discounters, saying this is in violation of federal regulations. It also says the defendents have conspired to keep prices artificially high, and sought to keep out lower-cost caskets and coffins.Online discounters, such as FuneralDepot.com, have been offering dramatically lower prices on Batesville coffins, threatening both its sales and the traditional margins of the funeral homes. In a sign of the increased competition in the sector, Costco, the discount warehouse club, launched online sales of stainless steel caskets last year for $925, and yesterday launched a new range of light-weight urns for transporting ashes.Joshua Slocum, executive director of the FCA, said funeral homes had conspired for years to inflate prices. “We expect this lawsuit will put an end to these conspiracies, that it will bring free and fair competition to the casket market, and that consumers will be compensated for the damage this behavior has wrought,” he said.The FCA, which has some 400,000 individual memmbers, and a number of consumer plaintiffs also accuse the funeral homes of mounting a disinformation campaign against other low-cost caskets. “Some of the most commonly used lines…include “the handles fall off”, “the bottoms drop out”, “they're made by prisoners”, “they are tin cans” and “they are all seconds”, it says.
247;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Costco warns profit may miss forecasts;;Costco Wholesale Corp. on Friday said earnings for the rest of its fiscal year would likely miss Wall Street forecasts because of weaker profits from gasoline sales, sending its shares down 9 per cent.The largest U.S. warehouse club operator said profit margins were lower than expected, principally from gasoline sales. Costco operates gas stations at many of its 334 U.S. stores. The retailer often charges less than traditional gas stations do in hopes of bringing customers in to its stores.But with energy prices soaring, Costco has struggled to maintain profitability on gasoline sales.Shares of rival BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc., which also has gas stations at many of its warehouse stores, fell 6 percent in early New York Stock Exchange trading.Costco is the largest player in a warehouse club sector that also includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Sam’s Club. Costco has won customers by offering luxury items such as expensive French wines and diamond rings alongside the usual warehouseclub bulk items.But the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer has not always been a favorite on Wall Street. Analysts have long criticized the company’s steep labor cost, which have hurt profits.Costco has taken steps to lower healthcare and other costs and its share price has climbed more than 30 percent in the last two years, but some on Wall Street remain wary.“If it’s not one thing then it’s another,” J.P. Morgan analyst Shari Eberts wrote in a note to clients.“Costco’s operating performance is rarely consistent, putting its growth rate at risk. While earnings per share grew strongly in fiscal 2004, it was flattish in 2003 and should be less than 10 percent this year. The culprit ranges from sales misses to expense control issues to gross margin issues.”Costco said it now expects earnings per share for its fiscal third quarter, ending May 8, to be in the range of 41 cents to 43 cents. Wall Street expected 46 cents per share profit, on average, according to Reuters Estimates.Costco had said in early March that analysts’ forecasts at the time were at the high end of company expectations.For the fourth quarter, it said it expects earnings per share of 63 cents to 67 cents, below analysts’ average forecast of 70 cents.“Despite satisfactory sales and membership results, and reasonably good expense control, our gross margins were lower than planned, principally from gasoline sales,” chief financial officer Richard Galanti said in a statement.Costco also raised its quarterly cash dividend to 11.5 cents per share from 10 cents. The dividend is payable May 27 to shareholders of record on May 6.Jaison Blair, retail analyst with Rochdale Research, said the profit outlook was “disappointing” but added that fuel costs eventually balance out and Costco can still reap some benefit from bargain-hunting shoppers.“They offer cheap fuel, and that draws more consumers who are looking for a bargain,” said Blair, who rates Costco shares ”buy” and personally owns the stock. “While they’re there, they say, ‘Let’s go in and buy some crystal or china.’”Shares of Costco fell $4.03, or 9.2 percent, to $39.99 in early Nasdaq trading. BJ’s shares lost $1.79, or 6.1 percent, to trade at $27.34 on the NYSE.(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in New York)
248;COST;Costco Wholesale;2005-03-22T00:05:28Z;HP acquires online photo service Snapfish;;Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, on Monday said it had acquired Snapfish, the online photo service, in an attempt to bolster its share of the burgeoning digital photo printing market.HP said the move amounted to a ?natural and logical extension? of its photo printing strategy, which has focused almost exclusively on home printing through the sale of the company's digital cameras, printers, scanners and ink supplies.HP's imaging business, widely regarded as the company's crown jewel, accounts for about two-thirds of the group's profits.But intensifying competition from rivals such as Lexmark and Epson have put pressure on the unit in recent months.In addition, HP has been trying to fend off retailers such as Costco and Wal-Mart, which have moved aggressively to capitalise on the digital photo printing market by providing hassle-free printing at lower prices.HP did not disclose the purchase price. Snapfish, which claims more than 13m registered members, offers a range of products and services, including free online picture sharing, photo storage and management, free editing tools and software, online print ordering and more than 70 personalised photo products, such as calendars and mousepads.HP claims consumers can print photos at home for as little as 24 cents, while Costco charges 17 cents. By pre-paying, Snapfish customers will now be able to print photos for as little as 15 cents.?This is HP's response to people who go down to the local retail outlet to print their photos. It's good for people looking to develop large batches at low cost,? said Larry Jamieson, analyst at Lyra Research.HP declined to speculate on how the addition of an online photo service would impact on the company's home printing business, but officials said there was very little overlap among the two companies' customer bases.Market research shows that while the overall digital printing market continues to increase rapidly, home printing has dropped from 83 per cent of total prints in 2002 to about 64 per cent this year.Retail printing has shot up from 8 per cent in 2002 to an estimated 26 per cent in 2005.Online photo printing has remained stable at 8 per cent. Kodak's Ofoto service remains the largest online photo service, with Snapfish and independent Shutterfly rounding out the top three.Snapfish also provides infrastructure services to leading retailers such as Circuit City, internet service providers such as Earthlink and wireless carriers such as Cingular.HP did not provide details on how it planned to expand this part of Snapfish's business.
249;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Costco misses profit forecasts;;Costco, the largest US warehouse-club retailer, on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and sales just below analysts’ estimates, marking a change from the results reported this month by other big US retailers.Wal-Mart and Target, the two largest US discounters, along with JC Penney, Gap and Kohl’s all reported profits that beat expectations.Costco’s slight miss sent its shares down more than 5 per cent in morning trade in New York.Second-quarter net income rose 35 per cent to $305.5m, or 62 cents a share, from $226.8m, or 48 cents. Profit was boosted by a one-time $52.1m income tax benefit.Excluding the tax benefit and a $10m after-tax charge for changes in the company’s accounting for leases, net income would have been $263.3m, or 54 cents a share, up 16 per cent from a year ago. On that basis, the results missed analyst expectations by one penny.Daniel Barry, head of Merrill Lynch’s US retailing group, said Costco’s pre-opening expenses were much higher than expected - up 445 per cent, or nearly 2 cents a share - which “accounted for more than all of the shortfall”.Net sales, which excludes membership fees, rose 10 per cent to $12.41bn, below Wall Street estimates of $12.58bn..
250;COST;Costco Wholesale;2004-11-23T18:59:31Z;The march of the Geek Squad;;"The Geek Squad, now patrolling nearly 700 Best Buy stores across the US and Canada, has good news for the technically challenged: ""We can fix any computer - any time - any place.""The computer-fixing technicians, who drive ""Geek Mobiles"" to their house calls, are Best Buy's 24-hour, seven-day-a-week, technical support and repair ""task force"". They charge a flat rate depending on the service and fix computers regardless of where they were bought.Dressed in short-sleeved white shirts with clip-on black ties and badges, the ""agents"" are dispatched to people's homes to do everything from removing viruses to installing wireless networks. But the Geek Squad is more than a posse of techies who take being a geek to extreme levels. It is also at the core of Best Buy's strategy to extend its dominance of the consumer electronics market into services.Many large retailers - including Home Depot, Costco, Staples and Petsmart - are turning to services to bolster their sales and earnings growth and gain a competitive edge against discounters, which compete mainly on price. Best Buy, the biggest US consumer electronics retailer, faces fierce competition from its rivals - notably Circuit City and Sears, Roebuck - as well as from warehouse clubs, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, and Dell, the largest personal computer maker.""One way for a retailer to differentiate itself from the Wal-Marts of this world is to provide excellent services, which has never been a part of the Wal-Mart offering,"" says Darrell Rigby, head of the global retail practice at Bain & Company. ""The push to commoditisation by the discounters is destroying differentiation. (Offering services) is a good opportunity for retailers to differentiate from each other.""The move into services does not assure success, however. Mr Rigby says that most product companies struggle to make the service move pay off. ""They underestimate the capabilities that are required to provide good services,"" he says. ""There seems to be an assumption that people who know how to provide products will also be able to provide good service - the evidence is that this is just not true.""Moreover, the organisational structures established to provide services are often flawed. ""Either they give services too much independence and don't tie in with core products or they smother services with oversight by the products department who don't understand what is required to grow the services,"" says Mr Rigby.Even so, retailers that work to understand their customers' needs can be - and have been - successful. At Best Buy, which was struggling with very low rates of satisfaction with computer products, it became clear that future growth lay in providing solutions, not just products.""In many cases, we didn't have the solution to the kinds of problems people had when they used the products,"" says Brad Anderson, Best Buy's chief executive. ""At that point in time, we couldn't see a path to being able to provide - in a business with very little margin on the product - a solution. If there was ever a big single threat to the company, that was it. So we were looking for a solution to that dilemma.""As it happened, Robert Stephens, founder and chief inspector of the Geek Squad, was busy building his business in Minneapolis, Best Buy's home town.""Within the first six months of starting Geek Squad, I knew it was going to work because the demand was just so huge,"" he says. ""It was the basics: thank you for showing up on time, thank you for not talking down to me, thank you for not smelling bad.""One of his first customers was Best Buy, he says, which would hire them for technical support while filming television commercials for computers.Over the years, Best Buy's employees started defecting to the Geek Squad. Mr Stephens later told the company: ""Your customers are coming to us for services that they are willing to pay for and a lot of your employees are coming to work for us. They like Best Buy but they are seeking more of a challenge.""Best Buy struck on an idea: why not place highly trained Geek Squad ""agents"" in the stores and have them repair computers on site?Two years ago, it bought the Geek Squad - which was started in 1994 - after working behind the scenes with the company since 2000. The Geek Squad acquisition ties in well with the company's new ""customer centricity"" initiative, which involves identifying different customer segments, researching their lifestyles and their shopping needs and having well-trained employees focus on specific customers rather than just product categories. ""We're in this journey of moving from a product- centric to a customer- centric company,"" says Mr Anderson.Last month, Best Buy completed the roll-out of Geek Squad ""precincts"" to all of its 675 north American stores. While Mr Anderson does not speculate on how much the Geek Squad will add to the bottom line, he says the benefits are already filtering down. ""The core financial engines of the company haven't changed, but we have learned enough in terms of some of the work we have done here to begin to do enough small things better. That it is part of the reason that the income growth continues to be so robust,"" he says. ""We'll see more transformative change starting next year that will be significant to the financial engine of the company.""In this financial year, Best Buy's sales grew 17 per cent to $24.5bn (£13bn) while net income rose to $705m from $99m the year before, when the company recorded a loss for its Musicland division. In the 2002 financial year, the company earned $570m.Geek Squad agents are divided into three groups: there are 5,500 counter- intelligence agents who work behind the counters at ""precincts"" inside Best Buy stores; 820 double agents who mainly make house calls but also help out at the stores; and a handful of special agents who focus on small businesses with more complex networks that need help with their servers and firewalls. The Geek Squad also runs a dedicated, 24-hour call centre.This structure, says Mr Stephens, creates a career path for Best Buy employees. ""This is how we will attract and retain the best talent,"" he says. Having Best Buy's pool of nearly 100,000 employees to choose from is a big advantage, he says, because it gives the company access to a diverse workforce. ""The talent isn't just coming from the computer bench within the store, it's coming from (places such as) the media department and the appliances areas.""Mr Rigby says Best Buy's ability to attract, train and retain very high quality employees will be vital to their success. Geek Squad agents are selected based on their aptitude - their ability to solve problems they have never seen - and enthusiasm for technology. Training is divided into three areas: technical, clerical and behavioural.Mr Stephens says his contribution to the art of service is that one cannot make people care: either they do or they do not. The point is to pick the right people from the start. ""It is too inefficient and too risky spending money on training.""That said, he does believe in ""inspirational"" training. ""I try to give the agents a sense of purpose,"" he says. ""We're not curing cancer here and we're not ensuring world peace, but we are fixing the computers of the people who will."""

The discount chain is now building a store in the town of Teotihuacan, home to the spectacular 2,000-year-old pyramids an hour north of Mexico City.Although most Mexicans appreciate the chain's everyday low prices, a group of residents and small business owners is balking at the idea of seeing the powerhouse of consumer capitalism from the pyramids, where indigenous Mexicans and pagans venerate the ancient gods of the sun and the moon.Although the chain says the building will be discreet and carry the local Aurrera brand, perhaps it should take a hint from McDonald's, which was forced to abandon plans to open a franchise in Oaxaca's historic plaza. Or from Costco, which is still the target of shareholder resolutions after building on the site of the abandoned Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca.Otherwise, they may face the wrath of those sun and moon worshippers who won't kneel before Mr Sam.Well engineeredMemo to BMW: try not to upset customers who have a flair for publicity.Chinese advertising executive and irate 7-series sedan owner Lin Jie has been giving the German carmaker all kinds of bad press with a bid to have three skinny donkeys tow his broken-down Beemer half way across the country for service.Local media quote Lin as saying the bid to tug the luxury car from Beijing to Hangzhou city was prompted by BMW's failure to fix a series of faults.Lin has been trying to enlist nationalism as well as donkey power in the dispute, setting out recently under a banner calling for the protection of “Chinese consumers' rights” - though police soon stopped the procession.Maybe BMW, which launched a Chinese production joint venture this year and sees the China market as a vital source of future growth, should be relieved that Lin is being so restrained.After all, one unusually vindictive Mercedes Benz owner in the central city of Wuhan won headlines a couple of years ago by having his sports car towed through the streets by a water buffalo - and then paying a team of workmen to smash it with sledgehammers.Speak softlyDoes believing in George W.

Chee Soon Juan, one of the city-state's most outspoken opposition politicians, has been accused of being a tool of foreign interests that want to “attack Singapore” by a libel lawyer for former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.Chee “is acting in concert with foreign backers who will continue to fund him so long as he is prepared to be used by them to hurt Singapore,” said Davinder Singh, who is seeking $500,000 in damages for remarks Chee made in the 2001 election.What are these foreign interests?

It is no secret that some Rome-based Alitalia staff take seats on early morning flights to Milan to start their day's work in northern Italy.Yet such bizarre arrangements aren't necessarily the fault of the airline. Rather, they reflect the endless political tug-of-war between northern Italy and Rome. Northern politicians want Milan to be Italy's hub, while those in Rome favour the capital; the result is that Alitalia loses money flying its personnel between the two.As Castelli remarked: “Alitalia's situation is not just beyond market reality, it's beyond reality itself.”Legal reform?George W.

252;COST;Costco Wholesale;2004-09-02T20:25:03Z;Wall Street rallies in afternoon trade;;Wall Street rallied in afternoon trade on Thursday as crude oil prices eased. But investors were still warily looking ahead to Intel's mid-quarter update, due after the closing bell, and Friday's key monthly employment report.Crude oil prices ended 6 cents higher at $44.06 a barrel after gaining as much as $1.37 in the session. Relieved investors overlooked several disappointments in retail sales for August, higher than expected jobless claims and slowing productivity growth. Good news, such as the 1.3 per cent climb in July factory orders, shone all the brighter.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 121.82 points, or 1.2 per cent, at 10,290.28, while the S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,118.31. The Nasdaq was up 1.2 per cent to 1,873.43. The rally was broad, with every S&P 500 sector in positive territory.Intel shares were up 0.9 per cent to $21.63 ahead of the chip maker's update.Volume continued to be very light, as many New York-based market players took the week off to avoid the Republican National Convention, which ended last night.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors, said the pullback in oil seemed to have energised investors, but added: “It doesn't take much to move a market on no volume.”Retailers were in focus as markets tried to assess the impact of poor August sales. Investors have worried for some time that surging oil prices and tepid jobs growth would hurt the US consumer's desire to keep spending, and sales have been weak because of rising petrol prices and Hurricane Charley.A late Labor Day this year has pushed holiday sales into the September reporting period, also hurting results.However, several retailers had predicted soft August sales, so markets were forewarned.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 in spite of reporting same-store sales gains of only 0.5 per cent, the smallest increase in four years. Strategists said investors were taking the soft results in their stride because Wal-Mart had warned them sales would be lower than originally forecast, and the results fell within the revised range.Investors showed less understanding of Costco Wholesale, the membership warehouse chain. Shares fell 1 per cent to $40.41 after the company reported August same-store sales rose 4 per cent, missing analysts' forecasts of 7.3 per cent growth.BJ's, the third biggest warehouse operator after Wal-Mart's Sam's Club and Costco, dropped 1.9 per cent to $25.47 after posting smaller sales gains than analysts had expected.Even in the weak back-to-school season, there were bright spots but everything is relative. Investors cheered Gap for posting a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales. The shares gained 5.7 per cent to $20.08, and helped to lead the S&P 500 retail sector to the session's best showing, up 2.8 per cent.Ross Stores leapt 9.9 per cent to $23.53 as grateful investors rejoiced that its August sales slid a mere 8 per cent, rather than the 8.8 per cent they had braced for. May Department Stores gained 5.4 per cent to $25.67 in spite of seeing its August sales slide 5.9 per cent, as shoppers passed by sales on clothing and home furnishings.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, added 4.8 per cent to $49 after posting a 4.3 per cent gain in same-store sales and saying quarterly profits would beat Wall Street's expectations.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen retailer, bucked the weak trend, reporting a near 24 per cent jump in same-store sales, beating the near 14 per cent increase analysts had expected. Shares gained 6.7 per cent to $36.46.Elsewhere, Veritas DGC dropped 16.3 per cent to $20.56, the worst performance on the New York Stock Exchange, after it delayed its fourth-quarter earnings release.Even after the pullback in crude prices, energy companies still prospered, with the S&P 500 group adding 0.9 per cent on the session. Winners included Noble, up 1.1 per cent to $41.74, Unocal up 1.7 per cent to $38.65 and Transocean, up 1.9 per cent to $31.84.
253;COST;Costco Wholesale;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
