0;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2019-09-17T04:00:39Z;Marsh & McLennan insists JLT staff defections not a ‘crisis’;London-based insurance broker hit by departures since takeover by US company;A spate of staff defections at UK insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson after its £4.3bn acquisition by Marsh & McLennan was not a “crisis”, the head of the US company has insisted.MMC, which also owns insurance brokers Marsh and Guy Carpenter, has suffered a series of high-profile staff losses at JLT since the takeover was completed in April.JLT’s Hong Kong chief executive, Kurt Schreiber, has left the company, as have a number of people from JLT’s reinsurance business including Ross Howard, the chairman of the operation. Last month, two former JLT staff — London market veteran Jonathan Palmer-Brown and former head of M&A Hugh Crossland — went to insurance broker SSL Endeavour.MMC in May took legal action against rival NFP Property & Casualty Services in the US over the departure of 13 former JLT staff.Given the importance of personal relationships in insurance broking, people can often take clients with them when they switch employers.But Dan Glaser, chief executive of MMC, told the Financial Times that voluntary employee turnover at JLT since April this year has been similar to the same period last year.“There have not been more departures than I expected. It’s something that we are dealing with — it’s not a crisis,” he said.According to Mr Glaser, not everyone would be attracted by the prospect of working at as large a company as MMC: “There will be people who would rather be a bigger fish in a small pond. Our environment won’t suit everyone, but it will suit most people.”Mr Glaser said he had been pursuing JLT for seven years before he made his move in September last year.The deal cemented MMC’s position as the world’s largest insurance broker, increasing its scale in Australia, the UK, Latin America and Asia.However, this year Mr Glaser admitted the deal would cause some “near-term choppiness” to the company’s organic growth rate as the JLT teams were integrated into MMC.“We’re realistic about what big integrations mean in people businesses,” he said on an earnings call in April.Since the deal was announced, MMC’s shares have risen 15 per cent. That is ahead of the 4 per cent rise in the S&P 500, but behind the share price growth at rival insurance brokers Aon and Willis Towers Watson, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Nevertheless Mr Glaser expected MMC, which has spent about $14bn on 170 acquisitions over the past 10 years, to keep doing deals.“There are definitely more deals to come, but there won’t be something of JLT’s size for a number of years until we’ve brought our leverage down. Even in the next couple of years, we’ll spend $400m to $800m on acquisitions,” he said.
1;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2018-09-18T16:50:30Z;Marsh McLennan/JLT: going like the clappers;One of the few remaining independent Lloyd’s insurers has been sold;Ring the Lutine Bell and inscribe another name in the leatherbound register at Lloyd’s of London. No ship has been lost at sea. Instead, mark the passing of Jardine Lloyd Thompson, one of the few independent listed groups still operating in the Lloyd’s insurance market.No wonder chief executive Dominic Burke admitted to feeling emotional. Shareholders should blink back happy tears too, and unlike JLT bosses they get no retention bonuses. Marsh & McLennan, one of the world’s largest insurance brokers, is paying £4.2bn for its smaller UK rival. That is a steep price to keep consolidation at full sail.Mr Burke negotiated direct with Marsh boss Dan Glaser. Does a premium equivalent to 38 per cent of the three-month average share price reflect a deep meeting of minds? Or just the failure of City speculators to drive up the price when, for once, leaks were lacking?Either way, the pair struck a deal at an enterprise value equivalent to 16 times forecast ebitda, a cash earnings measure, according to S&P Global data. That is well ahead of multiples for larger listed brokers. It still makes sense for Marsh. The broker is targeting savings of $250m a year. Taxed and capitalised conservatively, these should cover the £1.2bn premium.Hurrah for efficiency. Pity there seems to be little enthusiasm for it among some at Lloyd’s. This is the last big, member-owned exchange in London. Aside from the Lutine Bell, quaint traditions include liquid lunches for underwriters and steep admin costs. John Neal is the latest chief executive with the thankless task of reforming the 330-year-old institution.In the absence of cataclysms bad enough to drive up demand, a flood of global capital into insurance has been pushing premiums down. Like ships, brokers and insurers must be run tightly to keep an even keel. A lesson there for members of Lloyd’s.

It values JLT at almost 30 times forecast earnings for this year.“The exit price is fabulous,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, adding that JLT chief executive Dominic Burke “deserves the plaudits for delivering a fantastic deal for JLT’s shareholders”.The news pushed JLT shares up 31 per cent on Tuesday to £18.74.JLT’s top management are in line for a windfall from the deal, which will trigger a total payout of £100m under the terms of their contracts. In an unusual move, Jardine Matheson has agreed to fund half of the payout.The buyer expects cost savings of $250m within three years as it cuts between 2 and 5 per cent of the combined workforce and also makes savings in real estate and IT. MMC has agreed to bear the costs of anything that has to be done to seal regulatory approval for the deal.Mr Burke, who has been JLT chief executive for almost 13 years, said: “This is a bittersweet day for me,” adding that the deal had only been on the table since Dan Glaser, his counterpart at MMC, came to see him on September 7.“They have run the slide rule over us several times in the past. This is the first time they have made a formal bid,” he added.Mr Glaser said: “The acquisition is about one word — growth,” adding that the deal would give MMC a bigger position in Asia and Latin America and in reinsurance, while the combination would also help JLT to grow in the US and in employee benefits.The prospect of Brexit did not put him off buying a UK-based business, he added: “The UK is a great place to do business,” he said. “Brexit creates some short-term uncertainty. So what? . . . We’re happy to bet on Britain.”The insurance industry has undergone a spate of M&A activity in recent years as brokers and underwriters react to falling prices, which have put revenues and profits under pressure. The last big deal in the broking part of the sector was the $18bn combination of Willis and Towers Watson in 2015.The headline of this article has been changed to clarify Marsh & McLennan is an insurance broker
3;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2018-06-17T07:00:32Z;AIG: The long struggle to repair its reputation;A decade after it needed a $185bn state bailout, the insurer is on the acquisition trail again, but investors remain wary;"Seventy Pine Street is an aristocrat among New York’s skyscrapers. The 66-storey art deco tower in downtown Manhattan has been a fixture on the skyline for almost 90 years.For part of that time it served as headquarters for Hank Greenberg, the chief executive who drove AIG into new markets until it became the dominant force in insurance.Today 70 Pine Street is a luxury apartment block. AIG, with Mr Greenberg long departed, has slunk off a couple of blocks down the road to an altogether more humdrum building. And after over a decade of crisis AIG is a shadow of its former self, having sold off large chunks of its business.Yet in January it spent $5.6bn on its first purchase in a decade, with a hint of more deals to come, and has used the past 12 months since Brian Duperreault arrived as chief executive to recruit a new management team and shake up the way it operates. It is all designed to restore some of the company’s swagger.“AIG is like a supertanker with a very small rudder, so it is a nightmare to turn around,” says industry veteran Stephen Catlin. Adding that he thinks Mr Duperreault “is about the only person you’d trust to do it”.The insurer has been under sustained pressure for most of the past 15 years. It lurched from Eliot Spitzer’s accounting investigation that resulted in a $1.6bn settlement in 2006 to needing a $185bn government rescue two years later just to survive at the height of the financial crisis.It has repaid the taxpayer bailout, partly via asset sales. At its peak, the insurer was worth $240bn and had a triple A credit rating. It is now worth about a fifth of that and Fitch rates it A-, six notches lower. Activist investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson agitated for a wholesale break-up of the group as recently as 2016.Mr Duperreault, 71, who spent more than 20 years at AIG earlier in his career, has already tried to retire from the industry twice, but the pull of AIG was too great to resist. “I still bleed AIG blue,” he tells the Financial Times, “it’s still part of who I am. My formative years in the business were all here.”Yet despite his arrival giving the company a lift, its share price remains under pressure, with investors wary about the speed of any turnround. And Mr Duperreault will have to deal with this scepticism against the backdrop of an industry struggling to increase premiums despite a series of natural disasters. At the same time a surplus of capital, a byproduct of low interest rates, has kept prices low.“The market is quite difficult,” says John Heagerty, analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Pricing has improved, but not as much as people had hoped . . . I think it’s going to take a long time to turn it [AIG] around.”One of Mr Duperreault’s priorities has been recruitment. During the crisis and its aftermath, AIG haemorrhaged staff, with some of the brightest in the industry walking away while many others were laid off. “We had to establish that we were a place where talent comes [again],” he says.He has lured a host of senior industry figures, many of whom he worked with in roles at ACE, Marsh & McLennan and Hamilton, as well as at AIG itself.Peter Zaffino, the former head of insurance broker Marsh, was hired last year as chief operating officer running the general insurance business. He is seen by some in the industry as Mr Duperreault’s heir apparent. Tom Bolt, a former Lloyd’s of London executive, was poached from Berkshire Hathaway.Some have been lured by a promise of more independence, a nod perhaps, to the era of Mr Greenberg and his predecessor Cornelius Vander Starr, both of whom gave employees a high degree of autonomy. In Fatal Risk, his book on AIG’s crisis years, the journalist Roddy Boyd notes that: “Fifty years before Peter Drucker and other management gurus by the boatload would preach decentralisation . . . Starr made it the centrepiece of his managerial style.”Mr Duperreault has taken those principles to heart. “The AIG that I knew was a collection of specialists, individuals who really knew a particular subject matter as well if not better than anybody else,” he says. “I’ve found that the AIG I returned to had lost some of that.”He also returned last year to an AIG that had become a selling company. Since the crisis business units from AIA, the Asia operation, to a company ski resort in Stowe Mountain have been jettisoned. The downsizing was encouraged by Washington.Regulators restricted the company’s growth because they deemed it a “systemically important” financial institution. But last autumn, as part of the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda, it rescinded AIG’s “too big to fail” status.Just four months later, the chief executive followed through on his plans to expand the business with a $5.6bn deal to buy Bermuda-based Validus. The deal adds business areas AIG had never been in, or had exited, including Lloyd’s of London, reinsurance and the fast-growing market for “insurance linked securities” such as catastrophe bonds.The deal also brought in fresh underwriting talent. “Validus brings expertise in underwriting property risk, including catastrophe risk, and has a good record of performance,” says Bruce Ballentyne, an analyst at Moody’s.Yet it has upset some. The price tag has drawn criticism: AIG is paying a premium of 45 per cent to Validus’s share price before the deal, and one banker says that it has paid “$1bn too much”.Others are unhappy that the deal is being funded with money that might otherwise have been used for shareholder payouts. Mr Duperreault’s predecessor, Peter Hancock, had planned to return $25bn over two years via buybacks and dividends. But Mr Duperreault has made clear that he would rather deploy the resources to expand.“A company should have a growth strategy. Otherwise, you’re a shrinking company, and that probably isn’t going to work out well for you at the end of the day,” he says.Despite the hires, the acquisition and talk of a more positive mood around the company investors remain sceptical. AIG’s share price has wilted since last May, down 14 per cent against a 14 per cent rise for the S&P 500 over the same period.“Most investors I talk to think if there’s anyone who can fix this thing it’s going to be Duperreault and the people he’s bringing in,” says Paul Newsome, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “[Yet] the stock price suggests a lot of people think it’s not going to happen very quickly.”Part of the reason for the share price fall may be the scaling back of share buybacks, but there are more fundamental problems. AIG has long avoided the kinds of financial products, such as credit default swaps, that turned toxic in 2008 and led to its bailout. Today, it is the traditional property and casualty insurance business, which accounts for almost two-thirds of revenues, that is the group’s big anxiety.In particular, AIG has struggled to generate a profit from business insurance in the US. It covers a wide range of commercial risks, from workplace injury claims to clean-up costs from environmental damage, but policyholder claims have proved to be higher than anticipated at the time the policies were sold, forcing AIG to boost its reserves. As a result the company has booked some of the biggest reserving charges in the industry’s history.At the end of 2015, it added $3.6bn to sums earmarked for claims payouts. A year later, and to the anger of investors, the company took an even bigger reserving hit of $5.6bn.The company’s difficulties stem partly from decisions taken years ago. Problematic policies sold by AIG, such as professional liability and workers’ compensation, are known in industry jargon as “long-tail”, leaving the insurer on the hook for potential liabilities years into the future. And while other companies sell similar policies few have had the same scale of problems as AIG.“In some lines [types of insurance], management wasn’t conservative enough; in other places it was bad luck; in other places it was underpricing,” says Mark Dwelle, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Some point the finger at policies AIG sold during the financial crisis when it was faced with an uncomfortable choice: sell the insurance more cheaply than its better-rated rivals, or give up business. In many cases, say analysts, it chose the former. One person familiar with the company says AIG was at the time taken advantage of by savvy corporate insurance buyers exploiting the “internal disarray” by securing cover from the company at attractive terms.Others argue the problems date back even further, to the company’s rapid expansion in the late 1990s. The scale of the mispricing only became clear several years later, when claims started to roll in.For all that AIG’s modern managers have been bound by the decisions of the past, analysts say more recent executives also share the blame. More than half of the $5.6bn reserve charge AIG took last year was due to losses on policies sold since 2011, for instance.Mr Duperreault has said he expects the troublesome general insurance business to deliver an underwriting profit by the end of this year.The company had already moved to stem its general insurance losses by paying Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway $10bn for reinsurance on workers’ compensation and other commercial policies. Depending on the size of future claims, Berkshire could be on the hook for as much as $20bn in payouts.That policy did nothing to reduce AIG’s exposure to a range of other risks, and it has been especially hard hit by recent natural catastrophes, including storms last year in Florida and Texas, which landed it with a $4.2bn bill. It is reducing its exposure to such risks and buying more reinsurance to protect against such losses.“I am saying where we are taking risk, let’s make sure we are properly sizing it,” says Mr Duperreault.The company is also seeking to cut costs and better exploit scale in dealing with suppliers and property expenses.Yet there are signs investors are disgruntled. At the company’s annual meeting last month, a third of votes cast went against AIG’s executive pay, including a $43m package for Mr Duperreault. The shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis says there has been a “sustained misalignment” of executive pay with performance, while ISS described changes to incentive structures as “problematic”.Mr Duperreault’s challenge is to deliver a turnround that will not only justify his pay package, but also give AIG back a little of the swagger it had at its old address.“AIG had always been known as a premier risk company — the one you’d go to if you had a problem no one else could solve or very few could,” the chief executive says. “I’d love to get the company back to being the underwriter that basically sets the standards in our industry.”AIG, which employs more than 50,000 people, has hired some of the insurance industry’s top names over the past 12 months as it rebuilds its reputation:Peter Zaffino Mr Duperreault scored a coup when he persuaded Mr Zaffino to quit as chief executive at insurance broker Marsh (part of Marsh & McLennan) and become chief operating officer at AIG. The two worked together when Mr Duperreault ran Marsh & McLennan in the wake of the financial crisis. Seen by some in the industry as a possible successor to Mr Duperreault.Charles Fry Another member of the ex-Marsh & McLennan club, Mr Fry worked at insurer Novae as chief financial officer until its acquisition by Axis Capital last year. He is now head of reinsurance, operations and transformation at AIG.Tom Bolt After spending seven years at Lloyd’s of London as director of performance management, Mr Bolt moved to Berkshire Hathaway in 2016 but was persuaded last year to join Mr Duperreault at AIG where he is chief underwriting officer in the general insurance business.Lucy Fato Deputy general counsel at Marsh & McLennan between 2005 and 2014, Ms Fato is now AIG’s general counsel, in charge of legal, compliance and regulatory affairs.Tom Leonardi A former Evercore banker and commissioner of insurance for the state of Connecticut, Leonardi joined last year as head of government affairs, public policy and communications.Mark Lyons Having worked at AIG earlier in his career Mr Lyons rejoined this month as chief actuary of its general insurance business. He joined from Arch Capital.Seraina Macia Another person with experience of working with Mr Duperreault, this time at Hamilton Insurance Group. Ms Macia was appointed last July as head of a new subsidiary looking at the use of technology and data in insurance."

Over the past three years foreign companies have made just three such acquisitions in the country, according to data from Dealogic.Mercer, which did not disclose the size of the deal, says it is seeking to capture growth in Japan’s alternative investments market and demand from the country’s institutional investors.Before the deal, BFC was a client of Mercer’s for several years, said Rich Nuzum, president of Mercer’s global wealth business. “This is a marriage after dating for many years,” Mr Nuzum said. “You can view this deal as a vertical integration play.”Mercer, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of New York-listed Marsh & McLennan Companies, has more than $200bn in assets under management. BFC was spun out of Barclays Global Investors when the latter was bought by BlackRock for $13bn in 2009.The US company is competing in Japan’s investment outsourcing market with foreign companies such as professional services group Tower Watson and asset manager Russell Investments, and with local companies such as Nippon Life.Inbound investments in Japan’s financial sector have been scarce. The largest buyout of a Japanese financial company over the past four years was Capital Group Companies’ acquisition of financial services group Orix Corp for $1.07bn in 2013. The same year, Taiwan’s CTBC Financial paid $529m for Tokyo Star Bank.In recent years many of Japan’s companies have looked to overseas financial sectors to escape slow growth and a poor demographic outlook for the country’s ageing society.Late last year, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group announced it would bolster its expansion into Southeast Asia by purchasing a majority stake in Bank Danamon, Indonesia’s fifth-largest bank by market capitalisation, for as much as $6bn.
5;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2017-07-17T03:02:25Z;Insurers look for cover from stormy conditions;Market challenged by long period of falling prices and competition from new rivals;Insurance should be a byword for calm amid a crisis. The industry prides itself on its ability to cope with the worst of times.But executives in the specialist insurance market are starting to face an emergency of their own. Tempers are fraying, business plans are being rewritten and regulators are getting worried as a problem that has been building for years starts to bite into profits.What the industry calls a “soft market” — a period of falling prices — has been going on for five years in the specialist insurance and reinsurance sector. Hopes of an upturn have been dashed time and again.Those at the top of the industry are worried. In her midyear message late last month, Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, warned that the home of British insurance was “expecting the market [to] shrink this year and next”.Insurers, she said, “must exercise strong underwriting discipline, improve efficiency and reduce costs”.James Few, global managing director of reinsurance at MS Amlin, says rates for some types of reinsurance — particularly property-related policies — have fallen 40 per cent over the past five years.“Prices are still declining and the level we have reached is not attractive,” he says.Prices are still declining, and the level we have reached is not attractiveIndustry veteran Stephen Catlin, in a forthcoming book called Risk & Reward, says “insurers find themselves in a marketplace where the level of pricing is close to unsustainable”.One reason for the low prices is a lack of the sort of large claims that tend to drive prices up. The last year of big natural catastrophe claims was 2011, when there were earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand.Added to that has been an influx of capital competing directly with traditional reinsurers. Investors have been pouring money into investment vehicles called Insurance Linked Securities (ILS) in search of better returns than they can find elsewhere.According to broker Aon Benfield, the amount of capital deployed in ILS vehicles grew 13 per cent to $81bn last year. That is more than three times higher than there was five years ago.“Supply has been growing faster than demand and that can only mean one thing for pricing,” says Neil Maidment, chief underwriting officer at insurer Beazley.Insurers are at least still profitable. According to Willis Re, part of broker Willis Towers Watson, reinsurers reported a return on equity (ROE) of 8 per cent last year. But James Vickers, chairman of Willis Re International, says that is not the whole picture.“The heart of the problem is that the way insurers report results does not reflect the underlying performance,” he says.According to Willis Re, after stripping out the effect of reserve releases and abnormally low natural catastrophes, insurers are making an ROE of just over 3 per cent. There are worries that a severe year for natural catastrophes could push the industry into a loss.In a speech last week, David Rule, executive director for insurance supervision of the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, warned: “Insurers may be underestimating risks, particularly on new business. For example, they may be too sanguine about catastrophe risks, such as significant weather events.”The heart of the problem is that the way insurers report results does not reflect the underlying performanceThe pressure is starting to show. Insurers complain that brokers are taking more than their share of the pie by increasing commissions and introducing added charges.Evan Greenberg, chief executive of insurer Chubb, used this year’s annual report to attack what he called “abusive behaviour” from the brokers, warning that “these predatory behaviours . . . are simply unsustainable from an underwriting perspective”.And the brokers have hit back. On a results call in April, Dan Glaser, chief executive of broker Marsh & McLennan, said: “Most trusted advisers and carriers can be commoditised and disintermediated if they become complacent.”Beyond the rhetoric, some in the industry are taking action. Cost-cutting is becoming more common — Lloyd’s, for example, is losing 70-80 jobs, or 10 per cent of its London workforce.Paris Hadjiantonis, analyst at Credit Suisse, says there could be more to come across the industry. “There is not really any material rationalisation yet, but it could happen if we start to see large [catastrophe] events that will drive underwriting losses.”Insurers are also changing their business plans. Some are getting out of the worst-hit parts of the market, and expanding in more promising, higher growth areas such as cyber insurance.Others are trying to keep hold of their customers by offering more generous coverage. “People want to maintain premium volume so we see parts of the market where conditions are being expanded,” says Mr Maidment. “In reinsurance for example, people are offering more multiyear deals.”The outlook for the more traditional lines of business remains depressed. Property reinsurance prices fell by as much as 10 per cent in the July renewals season for example, according to Willis Towers Watson.A long hoped-for upturn in the market has not yet arrived and some in the industry doubt it ever will. While there is always potential for big claims to eat up some of the industry’s capital, there is more waiting on the sidelines to come in. Now that pension funds and other investors have got a taste for insurance risk, many believe that they will continue to pour money in, keeping prices low — and profits down — for years.
6;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2017-02-19T18:07:03Z;Insurers warned of risks to not completing Brexit plans;Groups could be ‘timed out’ in moves to set up new operations in other parts of EU;One of London’s most senior insurance executives has warned that the industry may struggle to complete its Brexit preparations before the UK leaves the EU.Mark Weil, UK chief executive of insurance broker Marsh, said a risk exists that some in the industry will be “timed out” as they try to set up new operations in other parts of the EU.Large parts of London’s £60bn commercial insurance market use EU passporting rights to access continental European markets. These are expected to disappear after Brexit, so many insurers will need to set up new subsidiaries elsewhere. Dublin, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands are expected to be popular destinations.“They are all looking to similar locations due to talent and regulatory flexibility. But these are not places with lots of bandwidth. There is a danger that you will get timed out if local regulators get swamped with applications,” said Mr Weil.Some EU regulators have staffed up in anticipation of a wave of applications. The Central Bank of Ireland last year increased the headcount in its insurance division by 25 per cent.The clock will start when the UK government triggers Article 50, expected to be next month.Geoffrey Maddock, partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, said: “Clients are working on the assumption that there will be a pretty hard exit without any transitional period. That’s the prudent approach to take. That means at best they’ve got two years from March, but it could conceivably be sooner.”Mr Maddock said that once an application for a new subsidiary has gone in, approval in some jurisdictions should only take three to six months. But before that, they will have to negotiate with the regulators about the size of the new business: “The issue that firms are going to have to agree with regulators is what people and functions are going to go into the subsidiary.”The process could be even longer if the insurers want to transfer existing business into the new subsidiary as well as using it to write new policies. “This is what is causing people a timing issue,” said Ashley Prebble, partner at law firm Clifford Chance, who added that the process can take 15 months to plan and execute.Mr Weil said that, even if some insurers miss the deadline, there could be ways of structuring new policies so that clients do not miss out on coverage. “There are solutions we’ve been working on,” he said. “In a ‘bridge’ solution, you would have an insurer with a licence in the EU which would provide a front, and then wholesale the business back to London where the capital is.”One of the issues causing most concern to the industry is what happens to claims made on cross-border policies that were written before Brexit. Lawyers say there is a risk that insurers may not be able to pay out. “There are ways of structuring around some of these issues,” said Mr Prebble, “but they all take time.”

Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2015-10-01T23:02:30Z;Law firms look for opportunities to enhance their client relations;Collaborating with in-house legal teams and bringing fresh ideas to corporate projects are two ways firms have enhanced their client relations;"It was a sunny September day two years ago, and Michael Hatchard, a partner with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was having lunch with executives from insurance broker Aon at the law firm’s office at London’s Canary Wharf.The group was discussing the fallout since a radical move by the Takeover Panel, the UK’s mergers regulator, two years previously to enact new rules to make hostile takeovers of British companies more difficult. This had followed the contentious acquisition of food group Cadbury by US rival Kraft in 2010.“Break fees had become unavailable, which left the bidder exposed to costs,” Mr Hatchard says. Without those incentives for first bidders, an unsuccessful bid could end up costing tens of millions of pounds in some cases. The Skadden lawyers and Aon executives worried that the change was putting at risk a nascent revival in mergers and acquisitions in the UK, discouraging private equity bidders in particular.The result of the brainstorming was “topping insurance”, a new product that would act as break-up coverage for potential acquirers in deals, and pay the bidders any costs incurred — up to 1 per cent of the bid price — if a competing bidder emerged and won. “It’s about using insurance as a mechanism to reduce risk for both parties,” Mr Hatchard says.It is a rare instance of lawyers coming up with the idea for a commercial product for a client, and it helped Skadden by providing more work, boosting its standing with Aon and providing security for the sort of deals Skadden is often hired to advise on.It is also a sign of the times — lawyers are realising that to maintain and strengthen their relationships with clients they have to find innovative ways of providing value after a deal is done. That is especially true for mandates such as M&A, where the billing rates are highest.Increasingly, law firms are also being asked to leave their egos at the door by collaborating with other lawyers so that the client has the benefit of a wider range of expertise.A £1bn technology project to facilitate a move from a prime-contract to a multi-supplier model led Royal Mail Group to instruct Slaughter and May in 2011 to work with its in-house legal counsel, leading a team of up to 18 lawyers from Royal Mail’s panel law firms, including secondees from Addleshaw Goddard and DAC Beachcroft. The group was headed by Rob Sumroy, a Slaughter and May partner, and Sarah Draper, Royal Mail’s legal director for technology on the project.Pinsent Masons and Axiom have taken a similar approach with two of their clients, which effectively outsource part of their bulk legal work to the firms, which in turn allows the companies’ in-house departments to concentrate on strategic issues.Pinsent Masons has been working with one of its clients, the consultancy Mercer, a wholly owned subsidiary of professional services group Marsh & McLennan, to take on operational legal work, mostly on a fixed-fee basis. As a result, the company has saved more than £1m a year since the programme began in 2012.The partnership, dubbed “Getting Certainty”, came about after discussions on how the firm could help Mercer do some of its day-to-day work in order to free up its in-house legal department to focus on areas such as developing new consumer-facing products, de-risking pension schemes and improving internal risk and compliance systems.Up to 30 lawyers at the firm, across eight offices, may be working for Mercer at any given time, says Isabel Nurse-Marsh, a pensions litigation partner at Pinsents who has worked with the consulting firm for about 15 years.Pinsents has also signed up to conduct an annual review of hundreds of Mercer’s standard contracts with clients at a fixed price. This is to give the company easier access to information and allow it to assess risk more easily.“There’s an awful lot of collaboration,” Ms Nurse-Marsh says. “We would see ourselves as an extension of them: they have secondees from us; they have recruited people from Pinsents. We know them really well.”The arrangement means Mercer knows in advance how much the work will cost. The client will also pay Pinsents bonuses if the work meets certain efficiency targets.“It’s about sharing the risk,” Ms Nurse-Marsh says. “The more efficiently we do it, the better it is for Mercer and that ends up being better for us.”Lisa Tolaini, chief legal counsel at Mercer, says: “We believe we have developed an innovative approach to managing our legal spend without compromising the quality of the advice we receive, and which will also allow the legal function to focus more time on those areas such as product development that really add value to the business. We particularly like that our lawyers are sharing the upsides and downsides of our risk with us.”It’s about sharing the risk. The more efficient we are, the better it is for the client and that ends up being better for usAxiom, a firm whose lawyers are seconded in-house with clients on a project basis, is working with BT, the telecoms company, on a multi-million-pound project where a team of more than 30 lawyers in Northern Ireland, England, India, Singapore and the US is trying to transform BT’s contracting operations.The work of Axiom’s lawyers frees BT’s in-house team to focus on deals. The firm is using its proprietary technology, Iris, to provide BT with dashboards that allow the company to view the contracts the Axiom team is working on by type, geography, counterparty, originating requester, source of terms, business line, legal entity and date, and the status of each.The volume of work handled by Axiom has risen about 250 per cent since it launched the programme. The complexity of work handed over has also increased.Skadden’s Mr Hatchard and his team spent about 18 months negotiating with the Takeover Panel to approve the topping insurance. The product, which will cover deals with a value of up to £3bn, with potential for further coverage of up to £7bn, was packaged earlier this year along with support insurers. “It has deepened our relationship with [Aon],” Mr Hatchard says. “We can see it having applications in the US and elsewhere.”"
11;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2015-07-06T15:07:54Z;Low rates weigh on insurers even as it feeds their merger mania;Cheap borrowing and efficiency seeking fuel a boom in M&A with 2015 on track to be a record year;The announcement of three vast insurance deals within a week is a sign of the times.Last Tuesday, broker Willis said it would merge with consultancy Towers Watson in an $18bn deal. Within 24 hours, Ace struck the largest pure insurance takeover in the sector’s history with the $28bn acquisition of local US rival Chubb. By the end of the week, Aetna had topped the ranking with the $37bn takeover of Humana in the US health insurance market.The string of deals puts 2015 on track to be the biggest year on record for insurance mergers and acquisitions, according to data compiled by Dealogic. So far, so similar to countless other sectors, where a brightening economic outlook and ultra-low financing costs are combining to persuade company boards to spend record amounts on deals.In some ways, the latest takeovers are idiosyncratic. The brokerage deal is an attempt by Willis to narrow the gap with the big two in the sector, Marsh & McLennan and Aon. The Ace-Chubb combination is part efficiency-seeking, part empire-building. And Aetna’s acquisition is likely to be one of a number in US health insurance, where underwriters are seeking ways to boost negotiating power with ever heftier drugs groups at the same time as new healthcare legislation is incentivising cost savings.But there is one common theme, too. Across the landscape of insurance dealmaking, the biggest impetus for M&A is a turbocharged version of the driver behind much of the market-wide M&A boom: low interest rates.For insurers, zero rates doesn’t just mean free financing for buyers, as in any sector. There is an indirect, defensive spur, too. As investors, hungry for yield, have flocked into the underwriting market with alternative sources of capital, the added competition has driven down prices, in some areas to uneconomic levels. A merger is a natural response — done right, it should both strip out capacity and generate cost savings. Even in the broking segment of the market, low interest rates are playing their part. In their search for decent returns to match their commitments, pension fund clients are increasingly turning to the likes of consultancy Towers Watson for advice.The last time there was this intensity of deals, it did not end well. Fifteen years or so ago, Hank Greenberg, the legendary boss of AIG, was buying up the likes of American General for $23bn and SunAmerica for $18bn. It was not long before this large, sprawling group had become the biggest blow-up of the financial crisis. Last week’s Chubb takeover, driven by Ace boss Evan Greenberg, smacked uncomfortably of family rivalry and a desire to build an even larger business than his father did at AIG.All the same, the dealmaking seems pretty likely to continue. Even if interest rates start to rise, upward moves are likely to be slow. For many, cost savings through M&A look like the only way to boost returns on equity that often barely exceed 10 per cent.Opportunities abound. Insurance remains a fragmented sector, particularly in the US. Mutually owned companies are numerous, keeping pressure on commercially owned underwriters to cut costs to remain competitive.US deals, despite the complexities of state-by-state insurance regulation, are more likely than takeovers in Europe, where the incoming Solvency II regulations leave little opportunity for merger talks.The appetite for insurance M&A contrasts starkly with the dearth of deals in banking, where regulators are hostile to any combination that would exacerbate the risks of institutions already deemed “too big to fail”. Of course, big, complex insurance companies have themselves been made subject to regulatory penalties — nine insurers ranging from Allianz and Axa to Ping An and MetLife are deemed “systemically important financial institutions”, though the ramifications have yet to be detailed.For now, though, neither the risk of Sifi designation, nor the fear of bubble valuations is deterring fans of M&A.But a third danger may be looming from outside the insurance world. As those deals were being struck last week, the Financial Times held its Future of Insurance conference in London. Relatively few delegates seemed to take seriously the advent of new tech-savvy competitors disrupting the old world of insurance. Bulking up through M&A might be a decent way to thwart upstart competition. But the flipside risk — of being so internally focused that you ignore the fast-evolving market environment — is just as big.patrick.jenkins@ft.com
12;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2015-06-30T18:16:29Z;Willis tie-up with Towers Watson points to insurance woes;Tie-up underlines difficulty of brokering contracts between companies and insurers and making money;Joe Plumeri, the former Willis chief executive who led the insurance broker’s New York flotation in 2001, is variously described as colourful, forcible and irrepressible — not most peoples’ idea of a deputy chief executive.But, under a deal struck with consultancy group Towers Watson, his successor — Dominic Casserley, the suave British management consultant who took over at Willis in 2013 — will become just that: second in command to Towers’ John Haley as CEO.His role in the combined company signals just how tough it has become to broker contracts between companies and insurers, and make money in a notoriously cyclical market.It also highlights the expanding role of consultants in advising employers and staff, at a time when individuals are being made to bear more responsibility for securing healthcare and employee benefits.Tellingly, Willis’ shares have barely moved in the past year while Towers’ shares are up 21 per cent, valuing the company at 22.5 times 2015 earnings.Willis, which is in an uncomfortable third place behind fellow insurance brokers Marsh & McLennan and Aon Benfield, has struggled to grow its share of the market of top tier corporate clients. A majority of its customers remain mid-market businesses.For the 187-year old company, which started out as a marine hull broker in London’s seaport, Tuesday’s deal with Towers Watson is another route to market. Towers, itself formed from a merger five years ago, advises the world’s biggest companies on issues ranging from pensions, risk, investment and employee benefits to board remuneration and recruitment. In turn, Towers’ Mr Haley hopes to use Willis’ operations in Europe and Asia to turn itself into a more geographically diverse business.Both chief executives have their eyes on the opportunities they see in Towers’ OneExchange — the private healthcare exchange offering multiple policies to employees and retirees.Healthcare exchanges have been growing rapidly in the US. In 2015, the number of people enrolled in private health insurance exchanges doubled to 6.1m compared with a year earlier, according to Accenture — continuing 100 per cent annual growth rate recorded since 2013. Accenture estimates that 40m people will obtain their cover through this route by 2018.Willis Towers Watson, as the combined entity will be known, said on Tuesday that its exchange had more than 1m users — and its goal was a 25 per cent share of the total market.In a recent note on Towers Watson, Marc Macron, an analyst at RW Baird, said the company was increasingly seen as “the highest quality provider in the space” by employers, having saved them an average of $1,400 per employee in the first year of enrolment.In three years’ time, the introduction of a so-called “Cadillac tax” in the US, as part of the part of the “ObamaCare” reforms, is expected to prompt more companies to move their employees on to these insurance exchanges.Josh Weisbrod, a partner in Bain’s healthcare practice in New York, said: “There’s been a steady trend of employees bearing a greater portion of their healthcare costs over the past few years, as employers have re-examined their role in health benefits.”Tuesday’s deal has been under discussion for some time. Mr Casserley said that by May, the parties were ready to finalise the terms: a merger of equals based on the market capitalisation of both groups.Combined, the business will have nearly 40,000 staff in 120 countries, earning about $8bn in revenues and $1.7bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Its market capitalisation will be about $18bn.Revenue synergies have not been disclosed but Mr Haley and Mr Casserley have identified up to $125m in cost synergies over the next three years.Willis’ shareholders will get 50.1 per cent of the company. But Towers’ shareholders will get 2.649 shares in Willis, plus a $4.87 dividend — rather less than Towers’ opening share price of close to $138 on Tuesday.Industry analysts at The Insurance Insider said: “The all stock tie-up has triggered a mixed response from investors, as it looks set to be materially dilutive to shareholders in Towers Watson and accretive to Willis”.Eamonn Flanagan, insurance analyst at Shore Capital, said: “Willis appears to be struggling to deliver on its own costs savings plans without damaging its own franchise and is losing key personnel. Towers Watson appears to be highly rated at 22.5 times 2015 forecast earnings on the basis of its healthcare exchanges where we await real revenue delivery”.Both sides clearly have a lot to prove.
13;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2014-12-08T12:13:23Z;Towergate offloads aircraft cover unit Hayward Aviation;Insurance broker raising £27m from sale of Hayward Aviation to Jardine Lloyd Thompson;Insurance broker Towergate has made the first of several expected disposals as one of Britain’s biggest private companies tries to raise cash as part of a fight to stay in business.The heavily indebted group is to raise £27m by agreeing to sell Hayward Aviation, which arranges aircraft cover, to the FTSE 250-listed broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson.Towergate — chaired by Alastair Lyons, who resigned from the board of Serco last month after the outsourcer issued a series of profit warnings — is considering sales of other assets to increase cash flows.It comes as Marsh & McLennan, the US-listed broker, eyes a possible takeover of Towergate, backed by the private equity house Advent. Peter Cullum, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the business 17 years ago and is its deputy chairman, has also been considering a bid.However, it is unclear how much the equity is worth as Towergate, which has run into difficulties after an aggressive acquisition spree, heads for a capital restructuring.Investment banking advisers to Towergate, which has a net debt burden of almost £1bn, last week invited bondholders to take control of the business in what would be likely to involve a debt-for-equity swap.Hayward, which arranges insurance for regional airlines, small commercial fleets and individual jets and helicopters, is among several non-core assets of Towergate, which made almost 300 acquisitions over 16 years.JLT said it would integrate Hayward, which last year made sales of £10m and pre-tax profits of £3m, into its existing aviation business. The deal is expected to complete early in the new year.Towergate cautioned last month it might not survive as a going concern if a restructuring could not be agreed. It is in talks with lenders led by Lloyds Banking Group to renegotiate banking covenants.
14;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2013-04-21T23:15:38Z;Pension funds add to ‘cat bond’ sales rise;;Catastrophe bond sales jumped more than a fifth in the first quarter as mainstream investors including pension funds have pushed into the exotic asset class.So-called ‘ cat bonds’ are issued by insurers to hedge their exposure to particularly destructive natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes or severe storms.Property and casualty insurers issued $1.64bn worth of the bonds in the first three months of the year, according to data tracked by Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance brokerage of Marsh & McLennan, a 22 per cent increase from the same period last year.Coming after $5.85bn worth of issuance during 2012 by insurance groups, the total value of catastrophe bonds outstanding is now almost $16bn, the highest on record.Last year’s sale volume was the highest in absolute terms since 2007, and the second biggest since records began in 1997, according to the data published in a report on Monday by Clear Path Analysis.Specialist investors including hedge funds have long been tempted by returns uncorrelated with the performance of wider financial markets. The bonds pay out in the event of big losses from natural disasters, and help protect insurers from the resulting big payouts.But brokers said conservative fund managers, which control trillions of dollars worth of assets globally, were increasingly turning to the niche area because of low returns on offer from more traditional investments.The influx of funding to the reinsurance market has led some insurers to fret the new sources of capital will turn away from catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities (ILS) when interest rates rise.“Some of it might not stick around when those yields start going back up,” said Philippe Trahan, director of insurance linked securities at Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, the Canadian pension fund with about C$130bn (US$126.7bn) in assets.An index of ILS compiled by Aon Benfield returned 12.7 per cent in the year to the end of March. This compared with 2.2 per cent for 3-5 year US Treasury notes and 11.4 per cent for the S&P 500 US stock market benchmark, according to Aon Benfield.Even so, Cory Anger, global head of ILS structuring at GC Securities, argued that short-term yield chasing is not the primary driver of returns.“This stable capital has spent years evaluating the catastrophe risk asset class, looking for both stable returns and – in the aftermath of covered events – orderly payment of losses,” she said.In 2011, investors in three catastrophe bonds were left nursing losses worth a total of $500m after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and storms in the US.Still, the losses were positive for the asset class, according to Dirk Lohmann, chairman of Secquaero Advisors, the insurance investment consultants. “It helped many institutional [investors] who were sitting on the sidelines to get a better understanding and feeling for this market place,” he said.
15;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2012-10-08T14:19:05Z;Greenberg speaks out on US regulators;;US prosecutors and regulators should take a “cooling off period” before being allowed to run for public office, according to Jeff Greenberg, the former Marsh & McLennan chief executive ousted seven years ago by ex-New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer.In his first interview since leaving Marsh in 2005, Mr Greenberg expressed sympathy for Standard Chartered over the UK-based lender’s recent brush with New York banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky.In August, Standard Chartered agreed to pay $340m to settle charges that it violated US sanctions in relation to Iran. Many observers saw the case as similar to Mr Spitzer’s campaigns against Wall Street ahead of his successful run for governor of New York in 2007.“I felt great sympathy for Standard Chartered,” Mr Greenberg told the Financial Times, though he declined to criticise Mr Lawsky directly. “I’ve always felt there should be a cooling-off period before pursuing other public office for those who have worked in prosecutorial or regulatory roles.”That is not a popular position in the US, where having ambitions for public office is seen as a strong sign that such people are not in the pockets of big business. Mr Spitzer was elected as New York attorney-general in 1999, while Mr Lawsky was appointed New York’s first superintendent of financial services last year.Mr Greenberg was ousted from the top job at Marsh when Mr Spitzer was pursuing an investigation into price-fixing by insurance brokers. Marsh later paid $850m to settle a civil case and a number of executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges, but a number of others were later acquitted or had their convictions overturned . Mr Greenberg was never charged with any wrongdoing, while Mr Spitzer was later engulfed in a prostitute scandal.Mr Greenberg joined Marsh in 1995 after leaving AIG in what was widely reported as a bust up with his father, Hank, who ran the insurer for many years. Yet the younger Mr Greenberg remains loyal when it comes to the collapse of AIG, which needed the world’s biggest bail out in the 2008 financial crisis.“I can’t help but think that had my father been there, its collapse wouldn’t have happened,” said Mr Greenberg, adding that most of the credit derivatives that dragged AIG down were taken on after his father left in 2005. Since leaving Marsh, he has run Aquiline, a private equity group that is poised to create the biggest writer of catastrophe reinsurance in Bermuda by premiums.The former Marsh chief executive is also about to launch a joint venture in Hong Kong between Aquiline’s insurance-focused US asset manager Conning and Cathay Financial of Hong Kong. He expects the company, CCAM, to have $3bn-$4bn under management within its first three or four years.He said China’s insurance regulator had “just liberalised the rules to permit Chinese companies to invest in a broader array of assets” and that Conning would be in a position to help Chinese companies since they “are not equipped on their own to [do that]”.In Bermuda, Aquiline’s reinsurer Validus has grown rapidly through deals for local rival IPC and London underwriter Talbot. It is now on the verge of completing a third deal for Flagstone Re, the Bermuda-based reinsurer.
16;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2012-02-22T16:09:28Z;US business insurance rates rise;;US business insurance rates are climbing at the fastest rate in nearly four years, and are expected to continue rising, as insurers move to make up for weaker investment returns.In part, insurers are making up for more than $70bn of losses generated last year, following a record number of $1bn weather catastrophes. RMS, the influential insurance loss modelling company, has projected that weather-related losses will continue to be high through June.But they are also being forced to minimise underwriting losses because their investment divisions are struggling to produce returns that would normally cover a portion of claims. The Federal Reserve has promised to hold interest rates at near-zero in 2014, making it difficult for insurers to find relative safe assets that promise steady yield.“If you’re investing at near-zero rates, you need to get underwriting in line,” said Duncan Ellis, US property practice leader at Marsh, the global business insurance brokerage.A monthly review of midsize and large-cap US client data by Marsh has shown a 5.3 per cent average uplift in commercial property insurance rates in January from a year ago. That is ahead of US producer price inflation, which was 3 per cent versus a year ago as of December.Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan, said this was the biggest monthly increase since 2008, after which rates were falling until the second half of last year. The analysis found that 58 per cent of clients saw a rate increase in January, compared with 51 per cent in the fourth quarter last year, and just 34 per cent in the second quarter.Additionally, a January survey of US insurance agents and brokers by analysts at JPMorgan Chase published this week found that they expected a 4.8 per cent increase in commercial insurance rates over the next year. As of July, they had expected less than a 3 per cent increase.Businesses are somewhat insulated from the rate rises because they follow three years of declining rates, Mr Ellis said, estimating that rates fell 10 per cent a year from 2008 to 2011.The rate increases are most heavily concentrated for properties exposed to weather risk, particularly earthquakes and wind damage, which saw an average 5.7 per cent increase in January.Stronger employment trends are also driving an increase in rates on workers’ compensation insurance, which had fallen sharply since 2008. Jimmy Bhullar, analyst at JPMorgan, noted: “Several previously aggressive competitors are putting through price increases for renewals and new business”.The KBW Insurance index is up 11.7 per cent since the beginning of 2011, while the S&P 500 index is up 8.3 per cent in that period.
17;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2011-10-23T23:24:10Z;Risk and reward;‘Volatility is the new norm,’ says Jeremy Kroll, a recent Trium executive MBA;Propped against the wall of Jeremy Kroll’s Lexington Avenue office in midtown Manhattan is a large portrait of Bernie Madoff, the disgraced financier, looking sullen and shifty in a black baseball cap and sunglasses. The picture, upon closer inspection, is a digital mosaic made up of tiny, rectangular company logos, each one representing a corporate scandal of the past decade: Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and Rite Aid, among others. At the bottom a tongue-in-cheek admonishment reads: “Enjoy your day. It could have been a lot worse.”Kroll, the chief executive of K2 Global Consulting, a risk consultancy, says the picture “is a good reminder of why we are here: to try to solve problems, and to help people avoid getting in with the wrong partners”.Kroll, 39, co-founded K2 in 2009 with his father, Jules Kroll, who is considered the pioneer of the modern corporate investigations industry. In 1972, after an unsuccessful bid to become a New York City councilman, Jules started his eponymous company, Kroll, with $500. He soon became legendary: he is, after all, the man who uncovered the oil wealth of Saddam Hussein, the former president of Iraq, and tracked down the assets of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, the former presidential couple of the Philippines. He sold Kroll to Marsh & McLennan, the insurance giant, for nearly $2bn in 2004.Their new company, which today has 40 employees and offices in London, Madrid, New York, and Bahrain, provides anticorruption, due diligence and forensic accounting services. Their aim is to become a premium one-stop shop to help businesses identify and manage risk using both the gumshoe investigative techniques that made the old company famous, and new digital information technologies.“Volatility is the new norm,” says Kroll. “We are helping companies mine information and understand the threats they face as a result of the changing environment.”K2 also does the due diligence for Kroll Bond Ratings, a fresh venture from the father-son team. Launched earlier this year, the company is a new entrant to the world of credit ratings – an industry that has faced a blaze of criticism about whether its overly rosy ratings helped create the economic meltdown by causing billions of dollars in losses to investors.The seed of the idea for Kroll Bond Ratings came to Jeremy while he was an executive MBA student in the Trium Programme, a global alliance of New York University’s Stern School of Business, London School of Economics, and HEC School of Management, Paris. The programme gave him the opportunity to “pay close attention to what was going on in the world” and mull potential business opportunities.Kroll recalls surveying the wreckage of the credit crisis in a class taught by Ingo Walter, professor of finance and corporate governance at Stern. “One thing that struck me was the lack of integrity of the ratings process. There was so much obfuscation in terms of investment products, specifically mortgage-backed securities, and there was a lack of due diligence,” he says. “[I thought:] what can we do to bring something new to the market that would offer a private-sector solution to a public-policy question?”…Kroll has a lanky build, tousled movie-star hair and a ready smile. He wears the standard Wall Street uniform – a white shirt with a tailored dark suit – but minus the tie. A tie, he says, is not as “relevant” as it used to be.Business school was not necessarily part of his master plan. He spent a gap year in Florence learning to cook, paint, and speak Italian. He graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in Romance languages and fine arts. To this day he claims “nothing can replace the smell of linseed oil on a canvas”.After dabbling in other jobs, he went to work for his father’s company, but never reported directly to Jules. “There were many layers by design,” says Kroll. “I never hid from being his son, but I never used it to my advantage either. I wanted to learn from other people. I made sure I was the first one in the office, and the last one to leave.” (For the record, Kroll appears genuinely in awe of his father, who is 70. “Being his partner has been an incredible opportunity,” he says. “He’s always been my mentor in business.”)Eventually, Jeremy headed Kroll’s marketing and sales division, helping reposition the business into a global risk management and technology company. He took the unprecedented step of recruiting people from other industries, such as law-enforcement officers, attorneys, and journalists. “Kroll was kind of like an artists’ colony – it was an incredibly creative environment,” he says.He also pressed for the company to embrace information technology more fully, for example computer forensics. It was the dawn of electronic investigations, and Kroll saw great promise for new technologies to help clients figure out who was behind a smear campaign, prove someone was stealing from a company or find evidence of collusion.During his years at Kroll, the company grew from $65m to $1bn in annual sales.By 2006, he felt restless. The company had been sold, and while both he and his father stayed on, Kroll found that working for a bigger, more bureaucratic organisation had its shortcomings. “Embracing and holding on to a mission in a big company is a challenge,” he says. “I was looking for new energy. I wanted to spread my wings.”Up to that point, Kroll had been his classroom. He knew that to start a new business he would need not only technical expertise in areas such as finance and accounting, but also a deeper understanding of operations and marketing, and exposure to other industries, sectors and business models.…Kroll was initially reluctant to pursue the Trium EMBA because of the time commitment. The 16-month programme involves several international rotations, including modules at the three schools’ campuses, as well as stints in countries such as China and India. At the time, he had three children. (He now has a fourth.)But his wife, Nicole, persuaded him that the degree would be an “investment” in his future and a “sacrifice” worth making. “She said: ‘Go for it.’ It was the last boost of confidence I needed,” he says.The experience was “mind-expanding”. He recalls late-night study sessions with his classmates, whose average age was 41 and who came from very different professional backgrounds and cultural perspectives. Personalities often clashed. “We had to figure out how to work together,” he says. “You’re there to learn. You’re not there to play politics, or to one-up your competitors. We could have all been doing other things, but we chose to be there.”Inspiration came from unlikely sources. Kroll says that a guest lecture by an executive from Louis Vuitton, the French fashion house, made him more aware of how important a high-end, personalised experience is for customers – even in the corporate investigations business. “In this economic climate, no one is paying premium rates for commodity services,” he says.In 2008, the senior Kroll launched an unsuccessful attempt to buy back his old company. (Marsh & McLennan sold it to Altegrity, the security group, instead.) Jeremy says the failed bid was a “necessary step in the creative process, because it forced us to figure out what we wanted to do next”.One project he is working on now is a service that uses pattern recognition and forensic analysis to understand the “social graph” of a given person: who they know, the quality of those relationships, and what is being said about them online. Consider it a detailed background check for the digital world.“It’s an iterative process,” he says. “It uses digital technologies, but it also requires going back to gumshoe work and liaising with actual human beings, and not taking for granted what’s on the web. It’s like Reagan [the former US president] said, ‘Trust, but verify’. It gets to the premium part of what we do: good, old-fashioned detective work.”
18;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Suspect trades reinforce ringfencing argument;;Sir John Vickers, who just unveiled plans to protect UK retail deposits from investment banking losses, can permit himself a wry smile. Estimated losses of $2bn from alleged rogue trades at UBS are a timely reminder of the dangers of so-called “casino” banking. It is serendipitous for supporters of ringfencing, for the moment winning the political argument in the UK, that the trading blow-out occurred at a bank in receipt of a government bail-out – albeit a Swiss one – in 2008.UBS’s maverick transactions have caused too little damage to strain the bank’s stability, though a $2bn write-off could trigger a third-quarter group loss. But the ease with which deluded or dishonest traders can evidently still dodge internal risk limits will reinforce distrust of an investment banking sector where bad legitimate bets are a far greater systemic problem.The case gives a strong associative boost to ringfencing because it occurred within UBS’s City of London satellite. Kweku Adoboli, the trader implicated in the P&L implosion, specialised in synthetic exchange traded funds. These can mismatch liabilities and assets lucratively but dangerously. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite such innovations.The $2bn loss would place the culprit around third in the all-time league table of bank bad apples. Jérôme Kerviel remains the all-time champ, having run up losses of $6.8bn in European index futures at Société Générale between 2006 and 2008. The bar has risen since Nick Leeson, the loose canon immortalised in a bad film starring Ewan McGregor, dropped a paltry £830m on index futures in the 90s, though he did bring down Barings, an illustrious merchant bank.The term “rogue trader” is usually a misnomer. It implies swaggering recklessness. The reality is more often an eager-to-please young man who covers up maladroit trades to protect his workplace credibility. Mr Adoboli’s guilt should not be presumed. We do not know what his explanation of events will be. But missing out on a framed “employee of the month” certificate is now the least of his worries.Incidentally, no big investment bank has ever exposed a rogue trader who has boosted its profits with unauthorised trades. Funny, that.Spanish waiterThe wisdom of ringfencing may remain obscure to executives at Santander, which may postpone the flotation of a 20 per cent stake in its UK subsidiary until 2013. This is partly because the government needs to give banks better guidance on its preferred split between retail and investment banking. The Spanish group is best known in the UK for its branch network, but also has a City of London offshoot offering hedging and other balance sheet services.Unlikely that Santander could have gone ahead this year, anyway. Underwriters offering £3bn in fresh bank shares would hardly risk being knocked down by a rush of buyers. Santander’s Madrid-listed shares have fallen by about 50 per cent since the start of 2010. Some London-quoted rivals have done worse. Better wait for the upturn, of which Thursday’s central bank-induced rally could be a tentative harbinger. Syndicates officers have a reputation for milking market peaks to maintain.A hong goes longCognitive dissonance impedes an appreciation of Jardine Matheson’s £166m offer for 10 per cent of FTSE 250 insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson. Some high-profile dominant shareholders make life a misery for managements of investee companies. So it seems counter-intuitive that Jardines – one of the great trading houses, or “hongs”, that built Hong Kong – should wish JLT’s board well in its mission to lure market share away from international broking behemoths Aon, Marsh and Willis.The conglomerate controlled by the Keswick family plans to lift its stake to 40.35 per cent at a very acceptable 24 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Jardines, which part owns businesses such as Hongkong Land and Dairy Farm, can introduce JLT to some useful clients and reap the rewards in dividends. The broker’s Asian revenues are already growing at a fast lick – 33 per cent at the half year – albeit from a low base.The purchase, which should benefit all shareholders in the long term, will make it easier for JLT to lure staff from Big Three insurance brokers. New recruits will no longer fear a takeover by an erstwhile employer. Mendacious equity traders will meanwhile find it marginally harder to start rumours of a takeover by an insurance industry rival. A forward earnings multiple of 15.7 times makes the shares pricier than those of the Big Three and high enough for now.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
19;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2011-09-15T08:59:30Z;Chief JLT shareholder set to raise stake;;Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, has welcomed a plan by its biggest shareholder to pay £166m to increase its stake in the business, saying it would kill recurrent takeover speculation.Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, on Thursday announced that it wanted to increase its holding in JLT from 30.35 per cent to 40.35 per cent.It is proposing to buy almost 22m shares at 765p each in cash – a premium of 24 per cent to JLT’s closing price of 619p on Wednesday.Dominic Burke, JLT chief executive, said the move would help JLT in its bid to take on the three biggest operators in insurance broking – Aon, Marsh and Willis – by dispelling talk that it could be bought.Such speculation had the potential to deter potential recruits from joining the company, he said: “Rumours always circulate that we are about to be subject to a takeover offer. It creates fear in the marketplace.”“This will give confidence to new hires – the talent in their 30s and 40s who are at a promising point in their careers – that if they join JLT they are not going to end up quickly back where they came from on the wrong end of a merger.”Asked if the proposal by Jardine Matheson had been sparked by JLT finding out that one of its larger rivals was finally preparing a real takeover bid, Mr Burke said: “Not that I’ve heard about, or the board.”The move by Jardine Matheson was a “tremendous vote of confidence” in JLT’s strategy and its exposure to Asia and Latin America, he said.The partial offer will require majority support from the other shareholders in JLT in a vote separate to any individual decision to tender shares. It already has the support of JLT’s independent board of directors.Mr Burke denied that it would create a situation of creeping control, saying Jardine Matheson was not looking to increase its board representation from the two directors it currently nominates.Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, the broker, said: “We view it as a vote of confidence in the business but it will remove any bid speculation in the share price.”Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said he thought the offer would set a new floor at 765p for the stock price. “JLT is an undervalued company, with considerable opportunities for organic growth in its key markets…especially in Asia, from which it can profitably leverage the JM relationship,” he said.Jardine Matheson has been a significant investor in JLT since 1997, when it merged its JIB subsidiary with Lloyd Thompson to form JLT.Shares in JLT rose 6.95% to 662p in late afternoon trading on Thursday in London.
20;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2011-08-29T16:53:15Z;Festive sales set for early start in UK;;An increasing mood of desperation on the UK’s high streets could force some retailers to start their Christmas sales as early as November in a last-ditch attempt to get their tills ringing.With consumer spending showing no signs of recovery, pressures on the retail sector are mounting and market commentators expect a slew of insolvencies in the new year.“We are set for pretty aggressive discounting on the high street, and there’s a likelihood that shop windows could be turning red before the start of December due to early Christmas sales,” said Simon Allport, restructuring partner at Ernst & Young, which has handled the administration of retailers including Focus DIY and TJ Hughes this year. “There is a view that Christmas this year could be a last chance saloon for some retailers out there.”Fears that this Christmas will bring grim tidings come on top of last year’s winter wipeout when disruption from heavy snows caused profit warnings across the retail sector. Retailers left sitting on piles of unsold stock were forced to discount deeply, though the damage was partially offset by the looming VAT increase, as consumers pulled forward their purchases of big-ticket items.In a year in which retail sales have remained subdued, many high street stores including Debenhams took the decision to start their summer sales early in order to stimulate consumers into spending. However, the strategy does not appear to have been a profitable one.During the coming weeks, summer trading figures set to be released from quoted retailers are expected to erase any hope of a meaningful recovery in the sector, with some analysts expecting double-digit sales declines. Many brokers have already pruned back their recovery assumptions, substantially lowering sales and profit forecasts for 2013 with the realisation that the trading environment is likely to be depressed for some time.Surviving a second bad Christmas could prove too much for weaker retailers. With growing support for the prognosis that muted Christmas trading will see more casualties, the sector is facing increased scrutiny from trade credit insurers, who cover suppliers against the risk of default.“It is unlikely, having gone through a whole year of tough sales, that suddenly the Christmas peak will make it all good,” said Tim Smith, leader of the trade credit practice at Marsh, the insurer. Noting that the prospect of the post-Christmas quarterly rental demand from landlords “has always been a historic high for insolvencies”, he says budget retailers will not be immune, with the clothing sector “particularly vulnerable”.“There was a feeling earlier in the year that the cheaper clothing retailers might get a benefit from consumers transferring their purchasing power by trading down,” he added. “I don’t believe that has occurred.”
21;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
22;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2011-04-25T18:57:20Z;Brokers at odds with insurers at Lloyd’s;;Fears that brokers to Lloyd’s of London are demanding extra commissions from its insurers have led to a tense exchange between Aon, the large broker, and Lloyd’s itself.The exchange has been carried out through chief executives of insurers at Lloyd’s, leaving companies unsure how to proceed and concerned about their own potential regulatory and legal exposure.Executives said Aon, Marsh and Willis, the big brokers, were putting pressure on insurers for greater commissions as lower insurance rates and lacklustre demand eat into revenues.Several feared the industry had forgotten about the fallout from the 2004 US inquiry into so-called contingent commissions, which led to large financial penalties for some brokers.The inquiry led by Eliot Spitzer as New York attorney-general was aimed as much at curbs on competition from the dominance of big brokers as at contingent commissions in particular.This month, Tom Bolt, performance director at Lloyd’s, told chief executives to be extremely careful of the status of their contracts with brokers if they agreed to pay additional carrier charges.“Lloyd’s believes that such insurer charges can carry significant regulatory risks for managing agents and for the reputation of the Lloyd’s market,” Mr Bolt wrote in a letter seen by the Financial Times. “Accordingly, it is essential that every managing agent deals with these charges with the utmost care and, in particular, in accordance to Financial Services Authority outsourcing rules and the Bribery Act 2010, which comes into force shortly.”While he did not name Aon in the letter, many in the market assumed Mr Bolt was concerned specifically about its proposed new Aon Carrier Charge.In April, Robert Brown, chief executive of Aon in the UK, wrote to chief executives to say the broker was simplifying its charges globally and replacing different types of commission with a single charge.“Having listened to concerns, we have changed our approach …and I can confirm that in the UK the ACC will be treated as a standard commission set at 3.5 per cent, payable in addition to the normal commission agreed with each carrier,” he wrote.
23;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2011-03-07T02:27:31Z;Brokers accused of seeking extra commission;;Insurers at Lloyd’s of London fear that the biggest brokers are returning to bad habits and demanding extra commission for business they bring to the market due to competitive pressures cutting their slim fees from corporate clients.Executives have complained that the big three global brokers, Aon, Marsh and Willis, are pressurising insurers to pay greater commissions as lower insurance rates and lacklustre demand caused by the economic slowdown eat into their revenues.They fear the industry has forgotten about the fallout from the 2004 US investigation into so-called contingent commissions, which led to large financial penalties for some brokers.Robert Hiscox, chairman of Hiscox, the London-listed insurer, said brokers were reluctant to charge corporate clients a proper fee for finding insurance cover and looked to insurers to make up the deficiency.“There is real pressure from brokers now to get their commissions up,” he said. “Insurance brokers don’t have the self-confidence to value their own advice and charge a proper fee [to their clients].”Mr Hiscox pointed to Aon’s attempts to add a 3.5 per cent brokerage charge across all contracts this year as one example.Aon denies this was an additional charge, arguing that it was an attempt to replace three separate elements that were not always transparent, with a single, standard charge.“We were just trying to increase transparency, to simplify and standardise our carrier charge,” the company said. “It was never to be put on top of other charges.”But others have expressed fears that the biggest brokers are again using their dominance of the world’s insurance markets to threaten insurers’ access to business.“Some brokers provide very good management information that can help underwriters, others ask for money just for turning up,” said one senior executive.The 2004 investigation, led by Eliot Spitzer as New York attorney-general, was aimed as much at the potential restrictions on competition from the dominance of the largest brokers as at contingent commissions in particular.“I worry that people have short memories of the reputational damage the industry suffered as a consequence of the Spitzer investigation,” said Sean McGovern, general counsel at Lloyd’s. “At Lloyd’s we have made it clear that no matter what remuneration arrangements exist they must all be transparent to clients.”Charles Philipps, chief executive of Amlin, another UK-listed insurer, expressed confidence that his underwriters could resist pressure from brokers: “We are only interested in our net premium price …what brokers charge gross to their clients is not our concern,” he said.
24;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Autonomy misses out amid growth doubts;Broadly positive earnings news from both sides of the Atlantic;Autonomy was a laggard on Thursday as the FTSE 100 hit a six-month high.Shares in the maker of search software reversed a recent rebound after Morgan Stanley said organic growth was unlikely to bounce back to the level management expect.“We believe Autonomy has started a journey from high-growth to maturity,” said analyst Adam Wood.Regulatory markets had slowed and marketing business had so far disappointed, as demonstrated by a recent profit warning, said Mr Wood. He argued that, with profit margins already near record highs, a sales slowdown looked set to drag heavily on earnings.The broker also questioned whether Autonomy could deliver the 20 per cent earnings boost investors expect from a pending acquisition. Technology stocks are a “very hot market” and transformative deals are going to get more difficult to deliver going forward, it said.“We believe there is still a meaningful de-rating to come as the market re-evaluates its growth outlook for the company,” said Morgan Stanley. It set a £12 target on Autonomy stock, which fell 2.9 per cent to £14.61.Broadly positive earnings news from both sides of the Atlantic helped to lift the wider market. The FTSE 100 closed up 0.5 per cent, rising 28.93 points to 5,757.86.Consumer goods makers jumped after results from Danone beat expectations. Reckitt Benckiser, which posts third-quarter earnings next month, climbed 3.9 per cent to £35.50. Unilever was ahead 2.6 per cent to £18.46 and Associated British Foods took on 2.6 per cent to £18.46.Smirnoff maker Diageo firmed 2.3 per cent to £11.87, helped by French peer Pernod lifting earnings guidance. Diageo shares had spiked as high as £12.40 in morning trade, a move traders connected with rumours that one trader had been trying all week to cover a large number of options contracts priced at £13.InterContinental Hotels took on 3.7 per cent to £12.15, after French peer Accor raised its full-year profit target.A relief rally carried BT Group higher by 4.1 per cent to 156¼p after the High Court ruled the government must stand behind liabilities for employees who joined its pension scheme post-privatisation.While BT emphasised that the ruling had no effect on agreed payments, analysts at Merrill Lynch said the lower risk may result in a deficit reduction of around £1.5bn, or 20p per share, at the next review.Prudential led the insurance stocks, up 3.7 per cent to 653p, on expectations that the flotation of closest peer AIA would be priced at the top of the range having been 11 times subscribed.Among the fallers, Tullow Oil was 2.1 per cent weaker at £12.27 after drilling of a high-risk reservoir in Ghana, estimated to contain up to 700m barrels of oil, struck water.The news overshadowed reports from Uganda suggesting the government was ready to approve Tullow’s plans to sell part of its acreage and effectively resolve a tax dispute.The resignation of its finance director sent Tui Travel tumbling 11 per cent to 205p. Paul Bowtell left after the group wrote off £88m in revenues due to a software problem, which resulted in its 2009 earnings being restated lower by 7.9p per share.“This is disappointing news and will do little to dispel the feeling that the tour operators are low-quality businesses,” said Numis Securities.Afrenled the mid-cap risers, up 2.6 per cent to £18.46, after buying a stake in a Nigerian oil field from Shell and Total.Micro Focus edged up 0.1 per cent to 382½p amid rumours the software support group was a takeover target for a US competitor.Wednesday’s main source of bid speculation, insurer Jardine Lloyd Thompson, drifted back 0.8 per cent to 529½p as sector watchers played down recent talk that it was a target for Marsh & McLennan.Ahead of results, Provident Financial was down 3.3 per cent to 773p as brokers including Collins Stewart warned of the effect on its customers of the welfare budget cuts in Wednesday’s comprehensive spending review.Luminar added 24.5 per cent to 16½p after the nightclub operator said it expected to complete refinancing in the next couple of weeks.“With regards to the new strategy, management has laid out a clear plan to help increase footfall, expand the group’s offer, market more effectively and improve customer experience,” said Altium Capital.Jelf Group gained 5.8 per cent to 54½p on the back of a reassuring trading statement, and as Cenkos analysts argued that the insurance consultancy could be a takeover target.Eaga fell a further 16.2 per cent to 70p as analysts cut 2012 forecasts in the wake of the government’s decision to cut funding for the Warm Front insulation and heating initiative. The contract has accounted for about half of Eaga’s sales.Xaar, the ink jet printing group, jumped 23.2 per cent to 218p on the back of a positive trading statement and a £15m fundraising, which will be used topay for expansion. “This should see annual capacity raised from 20,000 units at the end of 2011 to 45,000 units by the end of 2012,” said Panmure Gordon.Hardy Oil & Gas added 8.4 per cent to 203p even after founder Sastry Karra declared the sale of stock to be worth £4.5m.Parkmead rose another 112 per cent to 6¼p, which valued the oil investment group at £38.5m against a net asset value of £8.5m. The shares have spiked by 290 per cent in two days on news it was to appoint Tom Cross, the founder of Dana Petroleum and Parkmead’s largest shareholder, as its new chairman.Bond International Software was up 24.3 per cent to 66½p after announcing a deal to buy VCG, a supplier of software to the staffing industry. The company is funding the deal via a £6m share placing at 75p a share with Toronto-based Constellation Software. Once the acquisition is completed Constellation will own a 24 per cent holding in Bond International.
25;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-09-06T21:13:59Z;Altegrity in frontline approach on security;;As the US military ends combat operations in Iraq and pressure increases for it to do the same in Afghanistan, a business opportunity is looming.Civilian contractors will be needed to provide security and police training, and Michael Cherkasky, chief executive of Altegrity, the fast-growing global security group, believes his company is well positioned to take advantage.Hot on the heels of its all-cash $1.13bn purchase of the Kroll investigative company in June, Altegrity has bid for several multimillion-dollar overseas police training contracts.Unlike its main rivals, which are largely logistics companies, Altegrity specialises in law enforcement and security. With the addition of Kroll, it is the leading purveyor of background checks to both the US government and private industry. Its 11,000 employees operate in 30 countries and offer litigation support and corporate investigative work.“We have different people who have different training and we think we will have different results [than our competitors],” Mr Cherkasky said of the private equity-owned group, which has $1.5bn in annual revenue balanced between government and corporate clients.William Bratton, formerly chief of police in both New York and Boston, is on board to serve as the Kroll subsidiary’s new chairman. The company has used its contacts with US police unions to recruit up to 11,000 current and retired police officers who would be interested in coming to work for it, should the company win a large contract.While the bid process is secret, Altegrity may well find an encouraging welcome. Two contractors that have previously won big overseas security and policing contracts – Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, and DynCorp – have drawn heavy criticism for their work in Iraq and Afghanistan.Altegrity is in the middle of integrating Kroll into the rest of its business, using the parent company’s 400 software engineers to help automate and improve some of its work. “We’re going to make Kroll so much more efficient and we are going to give clients the chance to see exactly what they are paying for,” Mr Cherkasky says.The Kroll purchase is something of a homecoming. Mr Cherkasky joined the investigative company in 1994 and served as its chief executive from 2001 to 2004, when he sold it to Marsh & McLennan. Shortly afterwards, a bid-rigging scandal in another part of MMC caused the ousting of the parent company’s chief executive and Mr Cherkasky took over. Although he won plaudits for leading the company out of scandal, he was unable to fix MMC’s ailing Marsh insurance brokerage arm and lasted just over three years.“Nobody likes to be fired, but I told the board it was good for them and good for me. When you are not an expert you can’t take out the costs. I had to rely on other people at Marsh,” he says. Altegrity, he says, is different. “This is my lane. I know this industry and I care about this business passionately,” he says.The company uses its extensive technological expertise to retrieve, link and store data from around the world, making background checks and investigations easier to do and less expensive.One of Altegrity’s other divisions, USIS, was the first employee-owned company to be spun off from the US government, and it retains a multiyear contract worth about $300m-$400m a year to do background checks for government agencies. That contract is due to be rebid next year. Once that process and the integration of Kroll are finished, Providence Equity Partners, which owns Altegrity, may well want to cash out, either through a sale of the entire company or through an initial public offering.

26;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-09-03T21:37:56Z;Lloyd’s brokers weigh up iPads;;For centuries Fenchurch Street in the heart of the City has bustled with armies of insurance brokers clutching their trademark slipcases, the flimsy leather sheaths that bulge with bundles of papers.But the traditional case could soon be superseded by the latest high-tech gadget. Lloyd’s of London will this month test whether Apple iPads could replace the paper slips containing all the information on bespoke policies sold at the 300-year-old insurance market.For years Lloyd’s has been trying to improve efficiency among the hundreds of underwriters and brokers who arrange an array of extreme or unconventional insurance for companies and rich individuals.Brokers flood daily into the Lloyd’s building on the corner of Lime Street and Leadenhall Street between about 11am and 3pm carrying details of the risks for which they want to buy cover.They criss-cross the floor, visiting individual underwriters at their desks – known as boxes – as they try to persuade different insurers to provide a share of the protection their clients desire. The brokers can often be seen in long queues, waiting to see an underwriter, with their slipcases hefted under one arm.The slips are scribbled on, signed and literally rubber-stamped by underwriters when cover is agreed. But each party must still enter the policy details in their own systems and check for discrepancies later.The three brokers involved in the iPad trial – Marsh, Cooper Gay and RK Harrison – hope that Apple’s tablet computer will be able to carry all the documents that a broker needs to negotiate with underwriters, allowing both parties to review documents and annotate them where required.Sue Langley, Lloyd’s director of market operations, said it was a next step in applying technology in the market.“By simply replacing the paper with something easier to carry, but which allows amendments and links to other services, we continue to support the underwriting and face-to-face negotiation that makes Lloyd’s unique,” she said.Martin South, chief executive of Marsh UK, said that his company was “committed to ending the inefficient practices that remain in the London insurance market”.About 30 brokers will initially take part in a trial expected to last about three months, although others are expected to join in once it gets under way.
27;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-09-02T21:30:39Z;Wall St backs Dinallo for NY attorney-general;;Wall Street is backing the right-hand man of Elliot Spitzer, its previous scourge, in the race for one of the most powerful financial law enforcement jobs in the US, the New York attorney-general, according to new analysis of campaign contributions.Mr Spitzer became known as the “sheriff of Wall Street” during his time as state attorney-general, and the voters’ choice of a successor to Andrew Cuomo, the current holder of the post, could affect the financial sector profoundly.Eric Dinallo, who led Mr Spitzer’s enforcement charge and was New York’s insurance regulator during the financial crisis, is one of five Democratic candidates for the job facing off in a September 14 primary. Dan Donovan is the Republican candidate.An analysis of campaign donations shows Mr Dinallo has attracted $109,000 from financial companies – significantly more than any other candidate, including Kathleen Rice, the Nassau county district attorney, who leads the overall fundraising race. Ms Rice has raised $65,000 from financial companies.In addition, eight of the 10 biggest individual donors to Mr Dinallo’s campaign come from a financial background – a higher proportion than for any of his rivals, the analysis shows. His supporters include Jim Chanos, the noted short seller, who has donated $50,000 individually and $16,500 through Kynikos Associates, his hedge fund. Brian Duperreault, chief executive of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker, has donated $37,800. Jon Winkelried and Marc Spilker, formerly high-profile employees at Goldman Sachs, have donated $25,000 and $18,100, respectively.Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which undertook the analysis, said it showed that Mr Dinallo was using the contacts made policing the financial sector “to shake the money tree. He’s clearly raised a lot more from Wall Street than anybody else.”Mr Horner said: “The issue is, if he becomes attorney-general, what happens to those relationships then?”Mr Dinallo told the Financial Times that his support from the financial services sector was partly a recognition for the work he carried out during the crisis. He said that his Wall Street backers knew that he had “been incredibly tough on people who’ve cheated, who’ve had conflicts of interest …but ultimately I am fair.”
28;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-07-12T20:04:26Z;Aon / Hewitt;Hewitt shareholders should take the money and run;“Synergies” are all too often treated like corporate fairy dust that can transform an underperforming business into a world-beater. The word was used liberally by the management of insurance broker and consultant Aon in justifying the 40 per cent premium it is paying to acquire human resources specialist Hewitt Associates in a deal with an equity value of $4.9bn. While Aon’s three main competitors – Marsh & McLennan, Willis Group and Arthur J Gallagher – have generated average total returns for shareholders of 30 per cent over the past year, Aon’s modest gain over the same period was erased on Monday morning after announcing the Hewitt deal. Analysts questioning lofty operating margin goals and cross-selling opportunities received only nebulous answers.Luckily, there are more mundane and tangible benefits to the transaction. Much of the gains will come from redundancies, with overall “synergies” generating $355m a year by 2012. Hewitt will triple Aon’s consulting revenue to about $4.3bn, making it a far more significant player. Aon’s dependence on volatile (and lately moribund) insurance revenue will drop from about four-fifths to three-fifths.Which highlights another bit of corporate-speak – “diversification”. Normally a weak excuse for bolt-on acquisitions, it probably makes sense in Aon’s case. Once debt from the deal is paid down, Aon should be more financially stable than pure insurance brokers, which are alternately exposed to natural disasters or soft markets. Even if Aon shareholders feel that actual synergies will be less than promised and that management’s projection of the deal’s net present value of $1.5bn is too optimistic, they have little reason to sell into the current weakness. Hewitt shareholders should take the money and run.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Financial stocks were among the day’s worst performers on reports that investment banks were likely to lose a key battle in the US over whether they would be forced to spin off their swaps desks.Defeat has become more likely since Paul Volcker, an influential former Fed chairman, softened his opposition to the proposal to force banks to create a separately capitalised subsidiary to house their derivatives dealing operations.Financial stocks underperformed the main indices.Morgan Stanley was 2.6 per cent lower at $25.33, while JPMorgan Chase fell 2 per cent to $37.33, Goldman Sachs fell 1.6 per cent to $133.44 and Citigroup was flat at $3.88.US-shares in BP were 9.7 per cent lower at $30.67. The company has yet to announce a decision on whether it will pay a dividend to shareholders.Barack Obama, US president, wants the oil major to set up an escrow account to pay the claims for damages caused by its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Helix Energy Solutions climbed 10 per cent to $11.59 as it was hired to help BP in its efforts to clean up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Cablevision Systems advanced 5 per cent to $24.57 as the cable network provider agreed to buy Bresnan Communications, a cable services operator, from Providence Equity Partners for $1.37bn to expand in the western US.Ocwen Financial, a provider of residential and commercial mortgage loan servicing, added 5.6 per cent to $10.98 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Jefferies with a target price of $13 per share.The company recently bought HomEq, Barclays Capital’s subprime residential mortgage servicing unit, for $1.35bn.Positive comments by analysts at Deutsche Bank boosted airline stocks as the bank initiated coverage of the sector.AMR, the parent of American Airlines, increased 2.3 per cent to $8.45 as it was rated a “buy” by the broker.Delta Air Lines, a big network airline, was also rated “buy”, sending its shares up 1.8 per cent to $13.69.Referring to these national airline stocks, the analysts said: “We think the names are highly leveraged to an economic recovery; will benefit from balance sheet deleveraging; focused on growing margins rather than gaining market share (i.e. capacity-less recovery); and attractively valued.”JetBlue Airways, a low-cost airline, rallied 2 per cent to $6.63 after the stock was rated “buy” by Deutsche and upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at Bank of America.Industrial stocks led the market’s rise, with Caterpillar climbing most. The construction and mining equipment maker rose 1.3 per cent to $61. Fluor, an engineering and construction company, gained 0.4 per cent to $45.81, while rival URS added 2.1 per cent to $42.95.Marsh & McLennanrose 3.5 per cent to $22.85 as Mercer, its consulting unit, agreed to pay $500m to settle a lawsuit brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board.Mosaic, a leading fertiliser maker, was 2.8 per cent lower at $43.97 on reports it was in talks to acquire Grupo Fertinal, a Mexican fertiliser company, in a deal worth up to $1bn. It would give Mosaic its first presence in Mexico."
30;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-06-08T00:11:48Z;Marsh & McLennan sells Kroll for $1.13bn;;Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker and consultancy company, has sold Kroll, its corporate investigations division, for $1.13bn to Altegrity, a global security group based in the US.The all-cash deal comes three months after the Financial Times reported that MMC was seeking $1.3bn for the unit. MMC bought Kroll from its founder Jules Kroll for $1.9bn in 2004.Altegrity is owned by Providence Equity Partners, a global private equity firm focused on media and information companies.“The combination of Kroll and Altegrity broadens our capabilities with the addition of a portfolio of industry-leading services to help clients identify and manage risk,” said Mike Cherkasky, Altegrity’s chief executive.For Mr Cherkasky, the acquisition brings him back to Kroll, where he had served as president and chief executive from 2001 to 2004 before taking over as chief executive of MMC.“I know these folks so well,” Mr Cherkasky said. “This is for us a unique position to be in, where we had more insight into management and the products than anyone in the market place.”Mr Cherkasky was ousted from MMC in 2007 after its performance faltered and its reputation was damaged by securities lawsuits brought by investors led by the state pension funds of New Jersey and Ohio.Kroll has about $650m in annual revenues but was seen as a poor strategic fit with MMC. In May 2008, Kroll dragged MMC to a first-quarter loss, raising speculation that the group would sell parts of the unit.“Over the past six years, Kroll has been a valued member of the MMC family. However, we have determined our long-term strategy is to focus on the risk and insurance services and consulting businesses,” said Brian Duperreault, MMC’s chief executive.Ben Allen, Kroll’s chief executive, said he expected growing demand for his company’s services as hiring picked up and businesses put greater importance on doing due diligence.MMC shares had slipped 2 per cent to $20.57 by the close in New York.“They’re going to focus on consulting and insurance brokerage and anything that goes beyond that probably doesn’t fit,” Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus and Company said of Marsh. “The fact that Mr Cherkasky was CEO of Kroll is very useful because he understands the business and can extract value from it very quickly.”The deal is expected to close by September and the combined companies will have 11,000 employees.The Carlyle Group, Apax Partners and General Atlantic all made bids for Kroll at the end of February.Goldman Sachs and Apollo Investment provided debt financing for the transaction. Perella Weinberg Partners, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Marsh, while Debevoise & Plimpton LLP advised Altegrity and Providence.
31;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-06-07T20:43:43Z;Wall Street at November low as selling accelerates late on;;"US stocks closed at their lowest level since last November on Monday as Friday’s sell-off continued, and accelerated in the last hour of the session.A range of factors continued to dampen investor risk appetite, including geopolitical pressures in Europe and Asia, uncertainty regarding financial reform legislation and the economic impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of MexicoRyan Detrick, senior technical analyst with Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “Today we saw another late-in-the-day sell-off. It shows there is very little confidence and people don’t want to hold stocks overnight.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent to 1,050.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.2 per cent to 9,816.49 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 2 per cent to 2,173.90.US-listed shares in BP were 1.1 per cent lower at $36.76.The stock was cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, which said that the oil group was not only facing heavy legal and clean-up costs but would have its ability to do business and compete as an operator in the region affected.BP said it was capturing about 10,500 barrels per day of crude oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico from a damaged rig and expected to increase that over the next few days.Transocean, a deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, was down 2.1 per cent to $49.17, and Halliburton, a contractor on the rig, pulled back 1.3 per cent to $22.80.National Oilwell Varco rallied 1 per cent to $35 as the maker of oil and gas drilling equipment was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse with a target price of $49 per share. The broker said the stock was “a more defensive name for the current environment with lower near-term earnings exposure to the Gulf of Mexico and [the] valuation has become more attractive on the group sell-off”.AIG lost 1.9 per cent to $34.08 on reports that AIA, its Asian insurance business, may be worth only $25bn rather than the $36bn it had been seeking.The sale of the business to London listed-Prudential collapsed last week. Prudential denied weekend media reports that it was considering a renewed attempt to buy AIA.Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan dropped 2 per cent to $20.57 after the company said it planned to sell its Kroll unit, a security consulting business, for $1.13bn to Altegrity, a buy-out group. “Our long-term strategy is to focus on the risk and insurance services and consulting businesses,” the company said.Apple fell 2 per cent to $250.94 on the day it launched its fourth-generation iPhone at an investors’ conference in San Francisco.Talecris Biotherapeutics, a maker of protein therapies, jumped 25.7 per cent to $20.01 after Grifols, Europe’s largest maker of blood plasma products, agreed to buy it for $4bn.The deal will help Grifols expand its share to almost a third of the US market.Bristol-Myers Squibb was among the session’s best performers as it rose 6.3 per cent to $23.86 after the New York drugmaker was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” at Goldman Sachs.Drugstore chain CVS Caremark was among the session’s biggest fallers as it dropped 8.1 per cent to $31.04 after Walgreen, the largest US drugstore chain, said it would stop its participation in new prescription drug plans awarded to CVS.New participants in such plans will no longer be able to get prescriptions filled at Walgreen stores. Shares in Walgreen pulled back 2.7 per cent to $30.Goldman Sachs was 2.5 per cent lower to $138.68 after the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a government body, issued the bank with a subpoena for failing to comply with a request for documents and interviews in what it considered a timely manner.The industrials sector was the session’s worst performer as doubts about the strength of the global economic recovery persisted.First Solar, which makes solar modules, lost 4.4 per cent to $104.98; Deere & Co, a maker of agriculture equipment, fell 3.7 per cent to $54.78; and Goodrich, a supplier of aerospace components, declined 4.4 per cent to $63.80."
32;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-03-09T19:39:16Z;Kroll for sale;Private equity a natural home for private investigators;For proof that humans are inherently optimistic in the face of the facts, look no further than their peculiar desire to acquire professional services firms. Marsh & McLennan is another example of how such deals destroy value. The US insurance broker and consultancy is selling Kroll, having bought the corporate sleuths in 2004 for almost $2bn.Marsh will do well to get over half that now, having taken goodwill impairments to the tune of $855m over the past two years. Goodwill and intangible assets for the whole of Marsh totalled $7.2bn last year and the company already has flogged off small bits of Kroll.As exciting as it is to own the firm responsible for recovering loot from “Baby Doc” Duvalier and Ferdinand Marcos, the fact is that Kroll only accounted for 6 per cent of Marsh’s revenues last year. Compared with selling Putnam in 2007 when the fund manager was contributing almost 20 per cent of operating profits, the decision to flick Kroll is easy.Analysts have long said Kroll did not fit. A better question for investors in Marsh is why own a disparate collection of professional services businesses at all. What does insurance broking, say, have in common with asset allocation advice? By its very nature consulting work is project based – few meaningful synergies exist. What is more, the thing that originally made Kroll and Oliver Wyman, say, the best in their fields was culture. That fades inside a big company.So Kroll in the arms of private equity may be no bad thing if employees are managed sensitively. Recurring revenues can service debt while lumpy fees provide zing when the global economy recovers. But recover it must: Kroll’s suffering during the downturn has disproved the idea that detective work is countercyclical.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
33;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
34;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-03-08T23:31:57Z;Marsh & McLennan to sell Kroll arm for $1.3bn;;Marsh & McLennan, the global insurance broker and consultancy company, has put its corporate investigations division Kroll up for sale for about $1.3bn (£864m) and attracted a stream of private equity interest in first round bidding. The Carlyle Group, Apax Partners and General Atlantic all entered bids by the deadline for first expressions of interest in late February, while BC Partners may also be interested alongside one or two trade bidders, according to people familiar with the situation. Brian Duperreault, chief executive of Marsh, said it could sell parts of Kroll in May 2008 after a $425m writedown on the value of the world’s biggest corporate security group dragged the group into a first-quarter loss.His statement followed an approach for Kroll, which has about $650m in annual revenues, by David Buchler, its former European chairman, in partnership with BC Partners.There were other expressions of interest, including from founder Jules Kroll, who sold the business to Marsh in 2004 for $1.9bn.Mr Kroll declined to say whether he was part of the current bid process. “I am staying close to the situation,” he said. “We have the highest regard for our old mates.” The founder of Kroll recently launched a new boutique investigations firm called K2. He no longer owns a significant stake in Marsh.The auction is the latest twist in the history of Kroll, which pioneered corporate investigations and has expanded into computer security and restructuring.Almost since it was bought by Marsh, there have been rumours that Kroll was a poor strategic fit and the insurer was considering selling it.MMC has been under pressure to examine its disparate corporate structure, which includes its core insurance broking business Marsh, the consultants Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter, as well as Kroll.Washington-based Carlyle – once dubbed the ex-presidents' club for hiring political heavyweights such as former US president George Bush senior and former UK prime minister Sir John Major – has historically had a strong focus on the defence and security sectors.Experts in corporate restructuring are expecting a boom in the next few years, as private equity-backed buy-outs and other indebted companies experience difficulties as a result of the credit crunch and the subsequent economic slowdown.The purchase of Kroll was the brainchild of Jeffrey Greenberg, who resigned in 2004 amid accusations that Marsh had falsified and rigged bids on contracts and favoured insurers at the expense of clients in return for higher commissions. Marsh settled the allegations, but neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.Marsh & McLennan and all of the private equity groups declined to comment on Monday.
35;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2010-02-18T00:37:55Z;Willis attacks watchdogs for lifting ban;;Willis, the world’s third-largest insurance broker, has attacked a decision by regulators to lift a ban on controversial commissions in place since 2005, saying that such kickbacks represent a conflict of interest.The attorneys-general of New York, Illinois and Connecticut and the Insurance Departments of Illinois and New York have agreed to change the terms of an industry settlement that banned such payments.The ban had been in place since the conclusion of an inquiry by the then New York attorney-general, Eliot Spitzer.Marsh & McLennan, Aon and Willis, the big-three insurance brokers, will move to a less onerous compliance regime, although the entire broking industry will operate under new transparency rules. However, they will all be allowed to again take “contingent commissions.”Contingent commissions were paid to brokers once business they had passed to insurers reached a certain volume or produced a certain profit.Marsh ended up paying an $850m settlement after the inquiry though it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.Grahame Millwater, the group president of Willis, said he was pleased at the end of the costly administration and compliance regime, but disappointed that contingent commissions would be allowed.“We are inherently against the conflicts of interest that contingent commissions entail …we would have hoped the playing field would have been levelled by people coming to the conclusion that contingent commissions should not be allowed,” he said.Greg Case, chief executive of Aon, welcomed the move to consistent business practices for all brokers. “We strongly believe that it is in the best interests of clients that state regulators use their authority to require clear and consistent disclosure of the compensation of brokers and agents,” he said. The company said it had no current plans to begin taking contingent commissions.Marsh did not comment on the kickbacks, but said the actions by the New York State Insurance Department and the New York attorney-general helped restore a level playing field. “We commend the [regulators] for applying consistent, mandatory compensation disclosure standards across our industry.”Arthur J. Gallagher & Co, the fourth biggest broker, had a similar ban overturned by regulators in its home state of Illinois last July and has since said it would take such commissions once more.Insurance regulators in New York said the agreement came after a thorough review of the companies’ compliance with the obligations contained in their current settlement agreements.“It reflects the desire by the five regulatory and legal authorities involved to help consumers by providing a level playing field for insurance intermediaries on which they can easily be compared,” they said.

For example, Clear2Pay said it helped Wells Fargo cut time taken on its cash transfers out of the US from three days to a few minutes.The deal with Aquiline will give the US private equity group joint control of Clear2Pay with its management, as the two will together own more than 50 per cent.The €50m of new capital is designed to fund the company’s growth and strategic acquisitions until a planned initial public offering in a few years’ time.“We wanted to find a US investor, as that is an important market for us in the future,” said Jurgen Ingels, co-founder and chief financial officer of Clear2Pay.He said the company aimed to generate half its revenues in the US, up from 15 per cent currently.Clear2Pay, which is based in Brussels, employs 450 staff, has grown at 25 per cent annually and is expected to earn €55m of revenues and €4m of profits next year.Aquiline was founded in 2005 by Jeff Greenberg soon after he quit as chief executive and chairman of Marsh & McLennan, the world’s biggest insurance broker.It raised a $1.1bn fund in 2006 and its investments include Ark, the Lloyd’s insurer and BinckBank, the Dutch internet bank.
38;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-12-03T03:08:46Z;Swiss Re urges rise in insurance prices;;Insurance companies need to push through price rises for property and casualty insurance in order to combat expected poor investment returns over coming years, according to annual forecasts from economists at Swiss Re, the global reinsurer.However, the slow pace of economic recovery and companies’ desire to cut costs by reducing insurance cover will make this difficult to achieve. Brokers expect that competition among insurers to maintain market share will instead lead to further price reductions next year.Marsh, one of the world’s leading insurance brokers, last week predicted that commercial insurance rates could fall by up to 10 per cent next year even though recent declines have put rates for many business lines at their lowest levels since 2000.Thomas Hess, chief economist at Swiss Re, said on Wednesday that weak pricing meant that non-life insurance underwriting had already been loss making for the past two years and highlighted the industry’s poor combined ratios, which measure claims and other costs as a percentage of premium income, or revenues.“With very low interest rates, insurers must have combined ratios of 95 per cent or less to ensure profitability, but for example in the US they are 105 per cent,” he said. “There needs to be a hardening in the primary [insurance] market.”Property and casualty insurers generally rely on investment returns to subsidise their insurance underwriting. Swiss Re data shows that insurers globally made an underwriting profit this decade only in the four years between 2004 and 2007.Data from Bain & Co, the consultants, show that the UK insurance industry performed even worse than this, making an underwriting profit in only four years since 1983.Jonathan Hughes, a partner at Bain, said that on top of poor investment returns and a continuing rise in claims due to insolvencies and other corporate problems lagging any economic recovery next year, insurers were also running out of the reserve releases that have helped support profitability for the past couple of years.“For the next year or two we expect to see insurers posting results that are much closer to their real underwriting results,” he said.Mr Hess of Swiss Re also said the insurance industry had performed “remarkably well” though the financial crisis – taking only 3 per cent of the more than $336bn of government bail-out cash globally. The industry had revealed no systemic problems and should not be subject to extra systemic regulations, he said.The FT reported on Monday that Swiss Re was one of six insurers on a list of 30 systemically important institutions to be monitored by the Financial Stability Board.
39;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-11-14T00:43:04Z;MMC agrees to settle lawsuit;;Marsh & McLennan, one the world’s largest insurance brokers, on Friday said it would pay $400m to settle a securities class-action lawsuit brought by investors led by the state pension funds of New Jersey and Ohio.The investors sued MMC after the company’s share price dropped by about half in October 2004 as Eliot Spitzer, then New York attorney general, investigated price fixing in the industry.The investors claimed they had lost money because the company made “false and misleading statements to investors” related to the commission payments it received from insurers. The alleged scheme involved steering business to certain insurance carriers in exchange for kickbacks known as “contingent commissions”.MMC admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, which remains subject to court approval.Richard Cordray, Ohio’s attorney general who acted as counsel for the Ohio state pension fund, said the settlement “holds Marsh accountable for its wrongdoing and requires Marsh to compensate investors for their injuries”.Brian Duperreault, chief executive of MMC, is tackling an overhang of legal cases that predate his taking the top job from Michael Cherkasky last year.The company separately agreed to a $35m settlement on Friday in a case filed on behalf of MMC’s employees to compensate them for losses in their retirement plans.The company said in a statement: “After more than five years of litigation, [Marsh] believes these settlements to be in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. While the company continues to deny all of the claims in these lawsuits, the resolution of these matters puts the litigation arising from the events of 2004 largely behind us and reduces the company’s ongoing legal costs.”MMC said it expected to cover about half of Friday’s settlement costs from its insurance and the rest would be paid with cash on hand, which would be tax deductible.Shares in the company fell 0.21 per cent on Friday at $23.94.
40;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-10-18T20:58:42Z;Kroll to launch credit ratings business;;Jules Kroll, the man who reinvented the detective agency as the modern multinational corporate security firm, now intends to apply his powers of deduction to the credit ratings industry.Mr Kroll plans to start a business to challenge the big three credit rating agencies in the first quarter of next year.The company, which aims to have $100m in annual turnover by the end of its third year, will specialise in giving second-opinion ratings on complex securitised products.While it will employ quantitative experts much like those used by rivals Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, Mr Kroll also intends to bring his well-known investigative skills to bear. His analysts will not only construct models to predict the likelihood of failure, they will examine the underlying investments.For a mortgage-backed security, this might mean finding out how many borrowers failed to make their first payment or spot-checking whether property valuations are in line with nearby homes.Newly released from a noncompete agreement with his old firm, Mr Kroll is funding the start-up with some of the money he made from selling it to Marsh & McLennan. But he is also seeking between 10 and 20 large institutional investors to put in some seed money and give the as-yet-unnamed agency credibility and punch.“I have no illusions about replacing the big guys,” he said. Rather, he hopes discerning investors will demand a Kroll-backed rating as an additional guarantee.“What I am telling institutional investors is you basically have to take charge. This is your money. When people come to sell you products and offer you ratings from the oligopoly, you say to them you want a Kroll,” he added.Just as the original Kroll attracted a higher calibre of investigator by paying bigger salaries, Mr Kroll hopes to hire top experts out of hedge funds and buy up specialist research houses.He said: “The people who are selling these things are PhDs from MIT. If I can’t put the same kind of talent on the field [to challenge their assumptions], I can’t compete.”The agency will be affiliated with K2 Global Partners, the risk consulting business that Mr Kroll opened last month in New York and London with his son Jeremy and Alan Bernikow, a former senior Deloitte & Touche executive.
41;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-09-15T22:43:01Z;SocGen bankers quit to launch hedge fund;;Thirty senior bankers from Société Générale’s alternative asset management team have left to set up their own hedge fund business with backing from an American private equity firm.The team – including the head of SocGen’s $12.7bn global hedge funds business, Arié Assayag, and several of his most senior colleagues – have left amid growing pressures at French banks to curtail the bonuses of top employees.The French government has recently clamped down hard on bankers’ compensation as a result of considerable public outcry – and hopes to persuade fellow G20 economies to follow suit at the Pittsburgh Summit.Both SocGen and rival BNP Paribas, France’s two largest investment banks, have promised to curtail payouts to employees. So-called “golden hellos” – signing on bonuses for new staff – have already been mothballed.Nexar Capital – the name for the new hedge fund venture – will be headed by Mr Assayag, with Eric Attias, the former chief executive of SocGen’s New York Asset Management business, as its chief investment officer.The firm will be headquartered in Paris with an office in New York.Nexar has been backed with seed capital by US private equity firm Aquiline partners – set up by Jeffrey Greenberg, the former chairman of Marsh & McLennan, the American insurance group, and son of Hank Greenberg, the former AIG chief.Aquiline has also backed Nexar with a significant war chest to fund all-cash acquisitions, according to people familiar with the situation. The company will be looking for opportunities to acquire fund of funds businesses – many of which have struggled in recent months after massive investor redemptions from high net-worth clients damaged by the financial crisis.Sources say that excluding acquisitions, Nexar aims to have raised $10bn in assets under management within five years.The business faces a difficult market, however, with many questioning the ongoing viability of the funds of funds model in the wake of client outflows – or else demanding more from it.Alongside a core fund of funds business, Nexar will also run its own specialist volatility hedge fund.The volatility arbitrage fund, which will be used to diversify clients’ exposures and provide additional protection against severe market disruptions, will be run by a team of traders also poached from SocGen.Mr Assayag’s departure from SocGen will be a blow for the bank’s alternative asset management division.Mr Assayag joined the firm in 1999 and built the $12.7bn hedge fund investment business from scratch.The bank has been scaling back, however. The UK arm of SocGen’s asset management business was sold to London hedge fund GLG earlier this year.
42;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-08-12T16:41:29Z;Global insight: New world of supply chains;;"What do securitised mortgages and manufacturing supply chains have in common? Not a lot, it may seem. After all, the art of repackaging debt is part of the arcane field of complex finance, while the business of shipping widgets round the world is a tangible, get-your-hands-dirty activity.But in one respect complex finance and modern manufacturing have much in common: namely their embrace of globalisation. Western manufacturing has become ever more dependent on cross-border systems of production intended to make business more efficient, by placing each stage of production in the region where it can be most profitably performed. Likewise, western finance has embraced a vision of globally integrated capital markets in the name of more efficient banking.The recent financial turmoil has shattered many of the previous assumptions in the 21st-century banking world. It has become painfully clear that moving credit risk round the world in complex chains did not make the system safer and more efficient – as bankers once claimed.So, as bankers reel in shock, this poses an intriguing new question: will recent experience now force a rethink of assumptions in non- financial spheres too? After all, in recent years so-called “Davos man” has taken it for granted that globalisation, free market capitalism and innovation were all thoroughly good things. But as faith wilts, might business leaders rethink their dependency on, say, cross-border manufacturing supply chains, too?There are hints of a change afoot. This week, for example, Gerard Kleisterlee, chief executive of Philips, the electronics group, told the Financial Times he expects large companies to move away from far-flung globalised supply chains. He blamed the shift on “green” issues, explaining, “a future where energy is more expensive and less plentifully available will lead to more regional supply chains”.But green issues may not be the only factor at work. In recent years, western manufacturers have scrambled to streamline their operations in ways that were often similar (e.g. all turning to China for cheap manufacturing). But this concentration has created new vulnerabilities and forms of contagion risk. Or, as a fascinating report* prepared for the World Economic Forum last year notes: “The economic optimisation of supply chains, with the geographic concentration of risk as a frequent corollary, has enhanced the systemic vulnerability to a supply chain failure.”Until quite recently most business executives did not appear too concerned about such aggregations of risk. When Marsh & McLennan surveyed global companies with operations in Asia two years ago, for example, they found only a fifth had business continuity plans to guard against natural disasters or terrorist attacks. But the searing experience of the credit crisis has shown business leaders and policymakers that it can be dangerous to ignore seemingly remote risks, particularly when those risks are embedded in complex chains that are poorly understood. Contagion no longer seems merely an abstract idea.Nor does concentratıon rısk. (Look, for example, at how Porsche, the carmaker, was recently forced to suspend ıts productıon for a perıod after the manufacturer of the thread used for ıts seat belts went bust.) And what manufacturers are now realısıng ıs that dealıng wıth a crısıs ıs doubly hard when companıes are scattered round the globe.That does not mean the concept of globally integrated supply chains is going to die, any more than the idea of trading financial risk round the world will disappear. Busınesses are under ever more pressure to cut costs. But any chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So stand by to hear plenty more debate on the “supply chain” issue. And if manufacturers can learn lessons from the banking crisis on the potential pitfalls of globalisation and innovation, that would be a thoroughly good thing.

43;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2009-02-11T22:01:38Z;Wall Street edges higher on stimulus hopes;;Financial stocks attracted a modicum of bargain hunters on Wall Street on Wednesday, but the wider market struggled to mount a convincing recovery from the previous session’s heavy sell-off.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were among the winners as buyers returned tentatively to the sector. The two largest US banks by market capitalisation climbed 6 per cent to $26.09 and 7 per cent to $17.50, respectively, while regional banks advanced 7.3 per cent.Traders said there was little fundamental to drive buying in the sector following the sharp decline in the week, which came after the bank rescue plan from Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary, failed to inspire confidence.“I haven’t heard anything today that says, after further review, he had some substance there,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “I’m not finding any particular catalyst out there.”Still, optimism over the economic stimulus package helped the S&P 500 index close 0.8 per cent higher at 833.74. The benchmark index drifted between positive and negative territory in a choppy yet relatively subdued session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.6 per cent at 7,939.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.4 per cent at 1,530.50.The advance in financials came as the heads of eight financial institutions testified about the Treasury rescue plan before a House committee. The KBW Bank Index rallied 6 per cent.Better fourth-quarter results than expected from Marsh & McLennan pushed shares in the insurer 14.4 per cent higher to $21.41 and helped prop up the sector.XL Capital surged 61.4 per cent to $4.68 after the group disclosed plans to let go of 10 per cent of its staff and a cut in its dividend. Standard & Poor’s affirmed key credit ratings.Offsetting the bounce for financials, however, the energy sector was hurt by a sharply lower oil price after release of inventory figures and lost 1.3 per cent overall.The technology sector also underperformed, hit by a downbeat assessment of prospects from Research In Motion. The US-listed shares sank 14.5 per cent to $48.76 after the BlackBerry phone maker warned that fourth-quarter profit would come in at the low end of its targets, signalling the company had sacrificed margins to gain customers.Elsewhere in the sector, Nvidia lost 12.6 per cent to $8.15 after the graphics chip maker disclosed a worse fourth-quarter loss than expected.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said of the downbeat technology news: “These data points are a reason to sell on the surface, although RIM’s volumes are strong and a plus for component demand.”Applied Materials, the computer chip tools maker, warned late on Tuesday that chipmakers would spend 50 per cent less this year for its products. The company also posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of nearly $133m and said it would cut 14 per cent of its workforce, about 2,000 jobs. The shares edged 0.8 per cent higher at $9.77.Also weighing on the market, a report from the commerce department showed that the US trade deficit shrank 4 per cent in December as the global financial crisis cut imports and exports for the fifth consecutive month.On the plus side, shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition, the Bristol-Myers Squibb unit that is the world’s largest maker of infant formula, began trading after it raised $720m, more than expected, in the first US flotation since November. The shares rose 10.1 per cent to $26.43 in their debut session.In the consumer sector, shares in Best Buyadded 1.7 per cent to $29.19 after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction buy” list. The analysts noted that the electronics retailer stood to benefit from the bankruptcy of rival Circuit City.Results from Coca-Cola Enterprises pushed shares in the soft drinks group up 9.6 per cent to $13.10.Yet Nike edged 1.6 per cent lower to $44.31 after the sporting goods group said a global restructuring might result in the loss of 1,400 jobs, or 4 per cent of its workforce globally.Elsewhere, luxury homebuilder Toll Brotherseased 1.1 per cent to $18.37 after it emerged that first-quarter home-building revenue fell by more than half.
44;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-12-14T19:59:59Z;Kroll seeks a new conquest;;Jules Kroll is biding his time. Three decades after he brought detective agencies out of the back alley into the boardroom, almost single-handedly creating the corporate security industry, the founder of Kroll Inc is looking for another challenge.He sold Kroll to insurance giant Marsh & McLennan for $1.9bn four years ago and retired in July when Marsh’s leadership turned down his offer to buy it back. Now he is on gardening leave, waiting out a year-long, non-compete agreement.But, at 67, Mr Kroll has no interest in settling into a rocking chair.Instead, the self-described “serial entrepreneur” is prowling the globe looking for new opportunities. “In certain respects it’s an awkward time,” he says over coffee. “The excitement at the moment is not having that responsibility and being able to think [and] learn. Then the question is how do you put that into practice.”In some ways, he is more relaxed these days. Lynn, his wife of 40 years, says he leaves for his new Manhattan office half an hour later and comes home half an hour earlier. He has also ditched the red braces and fat cigar that helped reassure Kroll’s Fortune 500 clients that they were dealing with one of their own.Instead, he meets me at the Horse Guards, a quietly posh London hotel, in a sober suit, pink shirt and a soft gold tie. His schedule in London also reflects his new circumstances. Mr Kroll has been making quarterly visits for decades to show the flag at Kroll’s UK offices. But this trip is one of the first where he and his wife have spent afternoons at art exhibitions and evenings at West End shows.“In the afternoons, I can be a human being again,” he says, smiling at Mrs Kroll as she pulls out the morning paper and reads him the glowing review of the play they plan to attend that night.Mornings, on the other hand, are still about work. Mr Kroll may come across as pleasantly relaxed but he is simultaneously researching four or five possible business plans and has high hopes of finding another sector to revolutionise.“What I’d like to do is the same thing I did for the investigations business, and that was just really simple,” he says. “We brought really good people with different kinds of professional backgrounds into a rather prosaic field, which was not the most respected field on the planet.”Mr Kroll, an attentive listener who notes down information when he finds it interesting, comes across as genial and polite, a far cry from his company’s reputation as a dogged pursuer of stolen riches and guilty secrets.This London trip includes several meetings to explore new UK rules that will allow non-lawyers to own 25 per cent of law firms and eventually allow law firms to sell shares to the public.Mr Kroll, who worked as a prosecutor in his early career, scents an opportunity. In recent years, one of Kroll’s most profitable business lines was in litigation support, sorting through documents and tracking down witnesses and other evidence during the pre-trial stage known as “discovery”.The UK’s new structure might allow a novel kind of company to compete with London’s notoriously expensive law firms by using technology, non-lawyers and outsourcing to cut costs on long-running litigation and intellectual property matters, he explains. “We’re in a recession in the US. We’re in a recession here,” he says. “There will be a lot of pressures on law firms to do something about costs . . . The work that is done in reviewing documents is endless and, frankly, it doesn’t need to be done by lawyers any more.”Other potential businesses would track assets and verify identities round the world. And then there is his plan to set up a credit rating agency to rival Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.Rather than trying to cover the waterfront, Mr Kroll says, his business would focus on complicated financial products, where a rating is critical to value, and offer a far more sophisticated assessment.“There would be some percentage of ratings that could justify having leading academics, practitioners, credit people, lawyers and accountants looking at these things in a way that would get into it very, very deeply, and people could really rely on it to a much greater extent,” he says.A deep recession might be an odd time to start a business but Mr Kroll has no worries. He has ample cash from the Marsh sale and his formative business experiences were in the stagnant 1970s.As a young man in the New York borough of Queens, he was a reluctant businessman, forced by his father’s illness to join the family printing business. It turned out to be such a mess that he spent the next three years whipping it into shape to sell it. “I had no idea I would be in business. In fact, I did not want to be in business – I always thought my life would be in public service,” he says. During law school, he worked as a junior aide to Robert Kennedy and then joined a local prosecutor’s office until his father became ill.The printing experience gave him the confidence in 1972 to start J Kroll, a consulting business that quickly morphed into a firm that helped fight purchasing fraud.From there, he reached out to Wall Street, convincing the 1980s raiders and their corporate targets that they needed better intelligence on their opponents. With no direct competitors, he says he modelled his business on what he believed were the best service businesses of the time: Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Skadden Arps.When rivals began to flood the US market, Kroll expanded overseas and into new areas, such as helping companies investigate their emerging market business partners, rescue kidnapped staff and restructure troubled divisions. A brief tie-up with O’Gara, a listed armoured car company, proved deeply unhappy and the two companies parted ways in early 2001. Months later, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington led to a rush of security business.A wave of corporate scandals helped lift the litigation support side of the business and eventually drew the attention of Jeffrey Greenberg, then chief executive of Marsh. The talks went relatively quickly, in part because Mr Greenberg’s father, Hank Greenberg, then head of insurance firm AIG, had been a Kroll backer for more than a decade. Mr Kroll stayed on for four more years, as his contract required, but gradually pulled out of day-to-day operations to focus on charity work, including the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. “Virtually everybody there is the first member of their family to ever attend university,” he says.Still, it is clear that charity work is not enough. Asked where he expects to be next year, Mr Kroll emphatically plumps for being back at the helm of a business. In fact he says, he expects to have acquired a new “platform” by the time his non-compete agreement expires next summer.“Whether it’s creating a ratings agency, something exciting in the identity area or [legal] services, I would always like to accompany it with some relevant professional services. I like the combination and the traction that can occur between the different disciplines,” he says. “I love to be part of a team.”
45;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-11-24T03:13:31Z;Retreat by credit insurers takes toll;;UK credit insurers are facing a near 60 per cent jump in claims bills as more companies fail to pay suppliers.In the third quarter there was a 58 per cent year-on-year rise in the amount of claims to £97m ($144m).The figures, due to be released on Monday by the Association of British Insurers, show that 6,805 suppliers, up by a third, made claims to insurers as purchasers entered administration and failed to pay their bills.Credit insurers cover the period of credit given to companies by suppliers. As the recession bites and insurers rush to withdraw cover for suppliers to troubled companies, the sector has shot to prominence.Atradius, one of the big three credit insurers, said last week it had withdrawn cover from 12,000 buyers in one week alone.The withdrawal can hasten the demise of suppliers and buyers, and has been one of the problems facing Woolworths, the retailer.The jump in credit insurance claims is proof of how the environment has deteriorated in the past few months as more companies enter administration, leaving suppliers unpaid. The claims tally is 41 per cent higher than in the previous quarter.Tim Smith, head of trade credit at brokers Marsh, said: “The industry simply cannot sustain such a growth in claims.”Nick Starling, the ABI’s director of general insurance, said: “Trade credit insurance claims figures are a good indicator of what is happening in the UK economy and how that is affecting UK businesses.”The acceleration of claims will exacerbate suppliers’ worries that credit insurers will increasingly refuse to cover them as they act to protect themselves from further losses. That will leave them with the option of trading on uninsured credit or not trading at all.
46;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-11-12T02:58:30Z;Credit insurers grapple with risk;;As the man in charge of Euler Hermes UK, one of the country’s biggest credit insurers, Fabrice Desnos is perfectly placed to give an early warning for the future of British trade during the downturn. And the view he offers from his 36th floor office is not bright.“The problem …is this is a perfect storm,” he says. “Everything has gone wrong at the same time.”Euler Hermes has risk assessors evaluating solvency risks in thousands of businesses across all sectors in the UK.When suppliers hand over goods to other companies, it often takes up to 90 days for them to receive payment. To mitigate the risk of the buyer not being able to pay at the end of that period, the supplier can take out insurance that will cover about 90 per cent of that risk.This market is dominated by three big players, Euler Hermes, Atradius and Coface, and each of them lives or dies by its accurate assessment of the risk of buyers going under.So when Mr Desnos describes the current outlook as the worst he has seen in his working life, it is worth paying attention.“For a precedent we have to look back even before the early 90s,” he says.There is a chance he is being overly pessimistic. Companies often complain bitterly if insurers stop covering their suppliers, and sometimes claim that action causes companies to collapse. The failures of ScS Upholstery and the Fopp music chain were both hastened, if not created, by credit insurers refusing to provide cover for suppliers. Mr Desnos is defensive about such claims. “We are not here to bring companies down,” he says. “We will only cancel cover on a particular company as a last resort, if it is very serious.”But credit insurers can find themselves cast as villains as companies publicly blame them for withdrawing cover too quickly.“The buyers can be using the press to bully us into doing things we don’t feel our clients should be doing, says Mr Desnos. “We should be the first to be concerned because we are unsecured. Banks are fully secured creditors if a company goes under, but we do not have that protection.”And they have reason to be concerned. Euler Hermes recently released its results for the third quarter and they did not make for happy reading. While premium revenues rose 6 per cent to €444m (£362m), the amount paid in claims rose more steeply, leaving the company with only €23m after payouts.The other two big insurers are also suffering. Tim Smith, head of trade credit at insurance brokers Marsh, says while insurers have enjoyed loss ratios of 40-50 per cent in the last few years, that has risen to an average of 60 per cent and is due to rise again next year. Euler Hermes suffered a loss ratio for the third quarter of just over 70 per cent.But insurers continue to write policies. Mr Smith estimates a 15-20 per cent rise across the board in premiums written as suppliers get jumpy about companies they were previously willing to trade with on credit.This leaves insurers facing a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, their business is to write premiums, and they all want to use the current financial problems to increase revenues. On the other hand, nobody knows where the next major collapse is coming from and, if the insurers fail to anticipate it, it could have a disastrous effect on their own businesses.
47;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-11-11T23:17:22Z;Late filing of accounts rises 25%;;British companies are struggling to meet their deadlines for filing accounts to Companies House, according to the UK body in charge of collecting such data.Figures obtained by the Financial Times show a 25 per cent increase in late filings over the four years to the end of March 2008 as companies struggle to balance their books in increasingly difficult business conditions. This has been especially marked in the past two years, both of which saw late filings increase by almost 10 per cent.A total of 238,699 British companies filed their accounts late last year.Fabrice Desnos, chief executive of Euler Hermes UK, which provides insurance for suppliers trading with other companies on credit, said: “This increase is yet another indication of the worsening financial situation in the UK.”A late filing can be a trigger for banks to cut their credit lines and for insurers to remove cover on trading supply lines.Coface, another credit insurer, said late accounts can mean automatic withdrawal of trade credit insurance for a company if there is other information that casts doubt on its ability to operate as a going concern. Xavier Deneker, Coface’s chief executive, said: “This is a very important indicator of a company struggling.”Tim Smith, head of trade credit at insurance brokers Marsh, said: “Some companies think if they don’t file bad news, nobody will know. That may have been the situation last year, but because of the current unpredictability that is no longer good enough for underwriters.”Many companies appear to be struggling to guarantee their status as a going concern as credit lines dry up and revenues become more uncertain. “Companies are having to work harder to show they have sufficient cash and sources of funding for the coming year to stay within their facilities and covenants,” said Richard Bennison, head of UK audit at accountants KPMG.Mr Bennison also accused many companies of not realising the importance of prompt filing and said they often left it too late before beginning to prepare the accounts.Companies House has enjoyed a 30 per cent rise in revenues from fines levied for such late filings over the past four years and last year raised more than £53m.

48;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-08-06T20:38:46Z;Gains in energy and materials lift Wall Street;;US stocks climbed modestly on Wednesday for a second straight session as energy and materials stocks made ground and investors cheered some decent results from technology bellwether Cisco.A small pull back in oil prices and a drop in gasoline inventories helped refiners to advance, taking energy stocks to a 1.9 per cent gain.Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero added 3.3 per cent to $43.28, 12 per cent to $17.39 and 7.3 per cent to $34.47 respectively.Materials stocks were the day’s second biggest gainers, climbing 1.6 per cent on some analyst upgrades and a bump in certain commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was the outstanding performer, adding 11 per cent to $87.67.Citigroup analyst John Hill advised clients to buy the shares, noting that they had dropped more than 35 per cent since mid-June while the company still had exposure to China, high margins and strong free cash flow.Technology was another positive. Cisco climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.93 after posting estimate-beating fourth quarter profits.Microsoft also received a boost after an analyst at UBS said the company could buy up to $20bn of stock back over the next three months. The shares rose 3.1 per cent to $27.02 while the broader sector added 1.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 index shrugged off early losses to close 0.3 per cent higher at 1,289.07 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 11,656.07. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day 1.2 per cent ahead at 2,378.37.On Tuesday stocks rose the most in four months after oil prices dropped sharply and the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent. An accompanying statement seemed to reduce the likelihood of rate rises, soothing investors concerns.In the telecoms sector, disappointing earnings news dragged the sector down 1.4 per cent on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel posted a $344m second quarter loss due to spending on discounts and advertising to win new customers. Sales fell 11 per cent to $9.06bn and the shares dived 14.2 per cent to $7.34. Qwest Communications International said profit dropped 24 per cent to $188m and cut its annual forecast. The results were in line with estimates but the shares slipped 6 per cent to $3.45.So far this earnings season more than 400 of the S&P 500 companies have reported results and on average, index members have seen an 18 per cent drop in profits.Financials have had another torrid quarter. Melissa Roberts, an analyst at KBW, said: “Results continued to be disappointing across capitalisation levels [revealing] continued asset quality deterioration, revenue growth offset by mounting expense growth, and reduced profitability.”KBW cut its earnings estimates for 2008 and 2009 by 14 per cent and 10 per cent respectively as a result.On Wednesday, there was mixed news from the embattled sector. Freddie Mac shares plunged 19.3 per cent to $6.49 after the mortgage finance company posted its fourth loss in a row and said it would cut its dividend.Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored entity, slumped 14.7 per cent to $11.60 on the news. Fannie reports results on Friday. Elsewhere in the financials sector the news was mixed but the sector was among the biggest losers of the morning session, dropping 0.7 per cent.Marsh & McLennan, said second-quarter profit fell 63 per cent to $65m owing to higher staff costs and certain writedowns at its corporate security division. The insurance broker still beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 2.5 per cent to $30.07. Nasdaq OMX Group jumped 16.9 per cent to $30.89 after the exchange operator posted results that beat analysts’ quarterly estimates.In the consumer staples sector, a drop in agricultural commodity prices helped offset a handful of disappointing results.Whole Foods, the grocer, tumbled 12.6 per cent to $20.04 after it posted annual earnings that undershot analyst’s estimates.Dean Foods dropped 5.7 per cent to $22.02 after the maker of dairy products forecast lower third-quarter profits than expected. As a whole, the consumer staples sector rose 1.1 per cent.Profit-taking and some poor results took their toll on the consumer-discretionary sector however. It lost 0.5 per cent led down by a 7.2 per cent fall to $22.45 for restaurant chain operator Wendy’s International.
49;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Founder of Kroll poised to retire;;Jules Kroll, an architect of the modern corporate investigations industry, is to retire next month from Kroll, the eponymous company he founded more than 35 years ago.“I have decided to move on and pursue other personal and professional interests,” said Mr Kroll, 67, on Friday. “I am extremely proud of the team we assembled at Kroll and what we have accomplished over these many years.”His departure from the company, acquired in 2004 for about $1.9bn by US insurance broking group Marsh & McLennan, marks the end of an era in an industry he is credited with having helped pioneer during the hostile takeover boom of the 1980s.It also comes as MMC, which has been restructuring parts of Kroll in recent months, looks to sell parts of the group. Brian Duperreault, MMC’s chief executive, has said there were parts of Kroll that did not fit with the rest of the business.Mr Kroll plans to complete a book on the creation of Kroll and the corporate security industry.In the early 1980s, his company started investigating corporate raiders such as Sir James Goldsmith and Victor Posner on behalf of the companies they were attacking. In the 1990s, it gained attention for its success in searching for assets hidden by Jean-Claude Duvalier, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, and Saddam Hussein.Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 and a rash of corporate scandals during the early part of the decade – which reinforced the message that companies and investors needed to do proper due diligence – Kroll and other corporate security groups were in increasing demand by companies.Kroll has offices in 33 countries, and employs more than 3,800.
50;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-06-12T14:44:30Z;Putnam hires ex-Fidelity executive as CEO;;Bob Reynolds, the former chief operating officer at Fidelity who was once considered the heir apparent to Fidelity chief Ned Johnson, has been appointed chief executive of Putnam Investments, the beleaguered Boston-based fund group.Ed Haldeman, who was appointed to head Putnam four years ago after the group’s involvement in the mutual fund trading scandal, will remain chairman and give up the chief executive role, Putnam said on Thursday.The appointment, which is effective on 1 July, comes just over a year after Putnam was sold by Marsh & McLennan to Canada’s Power Financial, which paid $3.9bn in cash for the group.Putnam, one of the oldest mutual fund companies in the US, was an industry high flier in the late 1990s but one of the hardest hit by the fund trading scandal in 2003 and has never fully recovered. Its chief executive, Lawrence Lasser, and several senior management members were forced to quit and it paid $190m to settle charges that it had allowed improper trading by short-term investors in its mutual funds.Putnam’s assets under management, which reached a peak of $420bn in 2000, have shrunk steadily and at the end of May were $175bn. Mr Haldeman, who is respected in the fund industry, was viewed as an interim chief to help repair the damage, but he failed to stem the tide of investor defections.Mr Reynolds said: “For more than two decades, I have known Putnam as a formidable and respected investment management company, and, quite frankly, a very tough competitor. Putnam has a strong reputation for its broad investment management capability, distribution prowess, and award-winning service. I am honored and excited to join Putnam and lead a company that has one of the great legacies in the industry.”Mr Reynolds was vice chairman and chief operating officer of Fidelity Investments from 2000 to 2007. He had been at Fidelity since 1984 and held several senior management positions. His sudden departure from Fidelity, where he was thought to be the likely successor to chief executive Ned Johnson, preceded a rush of senior management departures from the firm. Fidelity is controlled by the Johnson family and Mr Johnson is 76, but there is no clear successor to him.Jeffrey Orr, the chairman of Putnam, said: “Bob brings substantial industry experience, an outstanding record of success, and a high energy level to Putnam’s leadership team. Along with Kevin Cronin, Putnam’s Head of Investments, and Bill Connolly, Putnam’s Head of Global Distribution, we have a very strong management team to move Putnam forward.”Mr. Reynolds said: “I am very excited about the opportunities to build upon Putnam’s long-standing brand – which is among the best known in the asset management business – and to work with the outstanding Putnam employees. I see in Putnam a tremendous future.”
51;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;MMC could sell parts of Kroll;;Marsh & McLennan, the US insurance broking group, said on Wednesday that it could sell parts of Kroll, as a $425m writedown on the value of the world’s biggest corporate security group dragged MMC into a first-quarter loss.Brian Duperreault, who became chief executive of MMC in January, said there were parts of Kroll that did not fit with the rest of the business.“These are businesses that we have deemed are not as strong a strategic fit, and may have greater value outside MMC,” said Mr Duperreault. “We will therefore seek ways to divest these businesses in ways consistent with enhancing shareholder value.”The statement came in the wake of an approach for Kroll by David Buchler, its former European chairman and BC Partners, the private equity group, and other informal expressions of interest during the past year. People familiar with the situation have said no talks are under way.Mr Duperreault said Kroll’s business intelligence and investigations unit, the background screening business and the litigation support and data recovery services arm all had long-term potential within MMC.Kroll’s corporate restructuring arm was transferred to a new consulting business within MMC in March, under the leadership of Simon Freakley, Kroll’s chief executive. Ben Allen succeeded Mr Freakley as chief executive at Kroll.But other Kroll units that provided services to mortgage lenders and government agencies did not necessarily fit, Mr Duperreault said. “During the quarter I began to peel back the layers at Kroll,” he said.MMC has been under pressure to examine its disparate corporate structure, which includes its core insurance broking business Marsh, the consultants Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter, as well as Kroll.Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, has taken a stake in Marsh, while some other investors also favour a break-up.Mr Duperreault’s comments came as MMC took a $425m writedown on the goodwill in Kroll, which it acquired in 2004 for $1.9bn.This dragged MMC to a first-quarter net loss of $210m, compared with a net profit of $268m in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding the charge, net profit was $215m in the first quarter of this year.People familiar with the situation said the transfer of Kroll’s restructuring arm to MMC had triggered a test of the goodwill in Kroll. This had concluded that Kroll was worth less than previously assessed.Mr Duperreault said the charge was driven by the units that provided services to mortgage lenders and government agencies.MMC and the Marsh broking arm have struggled to recover from a 2004 inquiry by Eliot Spitzer, then New York state attorney-general.
52;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-05-07T16:25:33Z;Little value making goodwill more intangible;;How much of the inner workings of a deal do you want to know?The usual answer is as much as possible. We want price, rationale, forecasts for the combined businesses – and, if it can be had, gossip about the ego clashes and who said what to whom and why.It is only far down the line that accounting really comes into it, by which point the glamour has gone and investors are left with a couple of dull-sounding phrases discussing synergies and “goodwill”.Is this good enough? This lack of detail comes in spite of the efforts of the rulemakers, who have for a long time sought to make managers more accountable for the prices they pay, by pushing them to explain more. Efforts have focused on goodwill, the accounting catch-all that refers to the part of a business that cannot be boiled down to a hard number already in the books – factors such as reputation or customer loyalty. The more cynical call it the amount by which the acquirer overpaid.First, the authorities banned the amortisation of goodwill. This black hole of a number cannot now be written down steadily over time but is subject to annual impairment tests.Among the best-known casualties of the rule change was AOL Time Warner, which took a one-off charge of $54bn in 2002 to reflect the fall in its value since its merger just two years previously. Last year, Ebay wrote off $1.4bn of the $2.4bn goodwill it booked in its $2.6bn acquisition of Skype.On Wednesday, Marsh & McLennan announced a goodwill charge of $425m, or 81 cents per share, in the first quarter, for a fall in the value of Kroll, the corporate security firm it bought for $1.9bn in 2004 (original goodwill total: $1.6bn).Rulemakers’ attention has recently focused on so-called “identifiable intangibles” – things such as customer lists and brands that can be valued. Acquirers are now required to report “qualitative descriptions” of these. For example, the value of its brands does not appear in Coca-Cola’s books but any buyer would have to put a number on them.The net effect, as more of goodwill is explained, should be its shrinking, but it is proving a tough asset to break up. According to research by the Intangible Business consultancy, almost half the value of deals done by top European and US companies in recent years is still accounted for under goodwill.Its point is that more could be explained, some intangibles can be reliably valued, and companies should be making the effort to do just that. Mumblings about expected synergies is no longer enough.But do investors really care? The answer seems to be: “Not that much.”“Acquirers don’t look at businesses as a bucket of assets and liabilities,” said Peter Elwin of Cazenove. “The value of the deal is about future activity: cash flows combining what you have with what you’re buying, access to new markets and customers.”Mr Elwin is a member of the Corporate Reporting Users’ Forum, a group of accounting analysts. “We’re really not that keen on getting goodwill as small as possible if it simply results in new intangible assets that then get amortised.”Analysts usually add back amortisations (gradual write-offs that cover the depreciating value of assets over time) as an accounting adjustment that means nothing in the real world. Adding more of these only complicates that task.That is not to say companies could not and should not do more to provide financial breakdowns of their deals, even if they do not have to. Among the lessons to be learnt from the current climate of investor suspicion is that having a reputation for explanation and genuine, above-and-beyond openness can be a real asset, albeit of the hard-to-quantify, intangible kind.jennifer.hughes@ft.com
53;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-04-30T22:39:53Z;Turnround specialist heads bid for Kroll;;Kroll’s former European chairman is leading a move to buy the world’s biggest corporate security group from Marsh & McLennan, its owners.David Buchler, the turnround specialist, has joined BC Partners, the private equity group, to bid for Kroll, valuing the business at $1.5bn-$1.6bn (€960m- €1.02bn). Marsh bought Kroll in 2004 for $1.9bn.They approached Brian Duperreault, the new chief executive of Marsh, in recent weeks, expressing their interest in Kroll.People familiar with the matter said no talks were under way. Marsh, which has had other informal expressions of interest but has said Kroll is not for sale, declined to comment.The approach is the latest twist in the history of Kroll, which pioneered corporate investigations and has expanded into computer security and restructuring.Speculation about the ownership of Kroll has intensified since Michael Cherkasky, a former Kroll executive, was ousted as chief executive of Marsh in December.Marsh has been under pressure to examine its disparate corporate structure, which includes its core insurance broking business Marsh, the consultants Mercer and Oliver Wyman, as well as Kroll.Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, has taken a stake in Marsh. Some other investors favour a break-up, and Mr Duperreault has told investors he is looking at Kroll’s fit in the group.The acquisition of Kroll was part of a strategy put in place by Jeffrey Greenberg, who resigned in 2004 amid accusations that Marsh falsified and rigged bids on contracts and favoured insurers at the expense of clients in return for higher commissions.Although Marsh, in settling the allegations, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, it has struggled to recover from the episode.Mr Buchler sold his Buchler Phillips restructuring business to Kroll in 1999, and was chairman for Europe and Africa until 2003.
54;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-01-20T16:56:40Z;Economic uncertainty to dominate Davos;;The hot ticket at Davos last year was the “dialogue in the dark” event, when delegates at the World Economic Forum were plunged into complete darkness to experience the loss of sight. This seems an apt metaphor for the blindness of the world’s elite to the fragility of the global financial system.The business leaders and policymakers flocking to the Swiss mountain resort of Davos this week will share little of last year’s jubilation over the strength of the global economy and the prospects for companies. Though the conference is titled “the power of collaborative innovation”, it is bound to concentrate on fears of political and economic uncertainty.Even Klaus Schwab, the founder of the Davos meetings, sounds downbeat: “The discussions in Davos will certainly be very dominated by the economic challenges we have at the moment – the aftermath of the subprime crisis, the transfer of capital from energy-consuming to energy-producing countries, inflationary tendencies.”Or as David Nadler, vice chairman of Marsh & McLennan, the professional services company, echoed: “With so many potential consequences of the 2007 liquidity crunch unresolved, the outlook at the beginning of 2008 is more uncertain than it was a year ago.”With the state of the financial world having seen a dramatic turnabout in the past year, WEF organisers have staged a series of high-profile debates on financial stability and banking risk, and there will be a flurry of senior bankers in attendance, ranging from JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon to Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein – as well as some of the newly appointed Wall Street chief executives such as John Thain at Merrill Lynch.As striking is the large contingent of senior US regulators and policymakers – a reflection perhaps of the pressure the US financial community feels to convince the rest of the world that it has the country’s banking woes under control. For while Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, has had to cancel a planned appearance due to the looming US fiscal package, Timothy Geithner of the New York Federal Reserve, Christopher Cox of the Securities and Exchange Commission are among those in attendance.They will be joined by a clutch of senior European policymakers – such as Jean Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank and many European finance ministers – allowing a flurry of transatlantic behind-the-scenes debate about global policy responses to the credit crunch before next month’s crucial meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.It is in those forums that the decisions will be taken, but is at Davos where the main players can see if consensus will be possible in a less formal and more private environment.Another notable swathe of attendees – which marks a contrast with earlier years – comes from the sovereign wealth funds, and other manifestations of the cash that continues to swirl around Asia’s exporters and the oil-rich Gulf. Officials from the China Investment Corporation and Dubai International Capital, for example, will all be in attendance – and a planned debate on their investments could be a highlight of the meeting.Indeed, sovereign wealth funds could overshadow one topic that was prominent at last year’s event: the role that private equity now plays in the global economy. For while the Harvard professor Josh Lerner is due to release a landmark report on the sector – which was commissioned at last year’s Davos event – the turn in the credit cycle means that buy-out funds are no longer generating so much fear.Another sign of the shift in sentiment is the inclusion of a new set of topics on this year’s agenda: competition for global commodity resources. For the first time Davos is staging a series of debates about food supplies – a topic that could generate lively debate given the recent sharp rise in many agricultural commodity prices, and the political challenges this is generating in emerging economies.With all these important debates and discussions going on, WEF delegates might be in need of some peace during the week. Cue the “dialogue in silence” sessions, where they will learn to “communicate our messages in a clear manner and understand others beyond oral communication”.
55;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
56;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-01-09T18:09:23Z;Credit turmoil risk to global outlook;;The global outlook is currently marred by greater levels of political and economic uncertainty than at any point during the past decade, warned a report co-sponsored by the World Economic Forum, the organisers of the annual meeting in Davos.In particular, the recent credit turmoil is now threatening to trigger a US recession, the report said on Wednesday.The WEF pointed out that this could hurt parts of Europe very hard. “The role of the financial sector in the UK leaves it particularly vulnerable to financial turmoil, while large current account deficits in some central and eastern European economies may prove increasingly unsustainable in 2008.”It also stressed that “food security, at the nexus of a number of issues from energy security to climate change and water scarcity, may be emerging as one of the major risks of the 21st century.”The growing pressure on resources, from oil to food supplies, threatens to create a plethora of challenges for companies and governments.The report forecast little likelihood of any decline in energy prices soon, and a good chance of further price rises in sectors such as oil.Recent credit turmoil had also revealed major shortcomings in the global financial system, the report said.“Systemic financial risk is the most immediate and, from the point of view of economic cost, most severe risk facing the global economy,” said David Nadler, vice-chairman of Marsh & McLennan, which co-authored the WEF report together with Citigroup, Swiss Re, Wharton and Zurich Financial Services. “With so many potential consequences of the 2007 liquidity crunch unresolved, the outlook at the beginning of 2008 is more uncertain than it was a year ago.”Mr Nadler argued that one lesson from the credit crisis was that it had become crucial for private sector banks to collaborate more actively with regulatory authorities to address some of the weaknesses in the current financial architecture.Although this decade’s burst of financial innovation had made the system more resilient in “normal” markets, “fundamental changes in the architecture of the system has also made it more vulnerable to certain kinds of shocks”, Mr Nadler argued.More ominously still, recent innovation had made it harder for regulators to understand or respond to financial turmoil – implying there were unlikely to be any easy remedies to the current credit turmoil, he added.
57;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2008-01-01T22:06:36Z;Reinsurance renewal prices fall;;The price of reinsurance fell across the board at the crucial January 1 renewal, amid few signs that the crisis in credit markets is affecting reinsurers’ appetite for risk, Willis, the insurance broker will say on Wednesday.Peter Hearn, chief executive of Willis’s reinsurance arm, will say that the industry “is showing signs of reverting to its historic pattern of feast or famine”.Willis will say that while prices are falling across the board, some areas are faring better than others. While the cost of marine reinsurance is falling only slightly, and the price of reinsuring reinsurers against property losses is also holding up, other areas, such as US property reinsurance, are “posting more precipitous declines”.Even the cost of reinsuring US insured portfolios against catastrophe risks, which spiralled after the 2005 hurricane season, is coming under pressure, with rate reductions of 10-15 per cent.In contrast, parts of reinsurance programmes that were hit by the UK’s £3bn ($5.95bn) of flood claims, are seeing price increases of about 5 per cent.“Despite a valiant attempt by reinsurers not to give in too much, they have cracked, but not in all areas,” said James Vickers, chairman of Willis Re International.Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance arm of Marsh & McLennan, will also say that property catastrophe reinsurance rates fell 9 per cent on average across all markets at January 1.“Barring large catastrophe losses in 2008, we expect to see the downward drift in rates that we have seen recently to continue through 2008 and into 2009,” Chris Klein, Guy Carpenter’s global head of business intelligence will say.Willis and Guy Carpenter will say that issues in the credit markets have not had a meaningful impact on the January 1 renewal.Willis will also say that the turmoil has not stopped reinsurance risks being passed on to capital market investors.“The downturn in the wider credit markets has in no way dampened capital market appetite for insurance risk, as $1.4bn of catastrophe bonds were issued in the last three months,” Mr Hearn will say.Overall, Willis estimates that $6.4bn of catastrophe bonds were issued in the public markets in 2007, ahead of 2006’s figure.This level of activity comes on top of special reinsurance contracts, collateralised with cash, often by hedge funds, where investor appetite continues to be “robust” according to Willis.
58;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2007-12-21T21:47:12Z;CEO ousted at Marsh & McLennan;;"Marsh & McLennan, which owns one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, has ousted Michael Cherkasky as chief executive in a move that could pave the way for a sale or break-up.The group, which owns insurance broker Marsh, said its board of directors had “determined that a change of leadership will best enable MMC to move forward and enhance shareholder value”.Mr Cherkasky stands to receive between $19m and $26.7m, although people familiar with the situation said the amount was more likely to be towards the lower end of the range.The shares rose $0.89 or 3.6 per cent in morning trade to $25.78, on expectations the move could spur a change to MMC’s conglomerate structure, which also comprises Mercer, the consultancy, and Kroll, the security company.One investor said it was possible the move could precipitate a break-up, although conditions for dismantling companies were more difficult than before the crisis in the credit markets.“From a timing standpoint they may not have as many options as they may have had six months ago.”Stephen Hardis, non-executive chairman, said: “MMC’s financial performance in 2007 has fallen far short of our expectations. The board has taken this performance into account, and listened to concerns raised by some of the company’s largest shareholders in recent quarters in making this change.”He said the board would “continue to actively oversee MMC’s portfolio of businesses and evaluate strategies to enhance shareholder value, including optimising the company’s capital structure, reviewing its mix of businesses and improving operating performance,
particularly at Marsh”.Mr Cherkasky will remain as chief executive until a replacement is found.MMC and the Marsh broking arm have struggled to recover from a 2004 inquiry by Eliot Spitzer, then New York state attorney general. Mr Spitzer alleged Marsh falsified and rigged bids on contracts and favoured insurers at the expense of clients. In settling the allegations, Marsh neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but did offer a statement of contrition.Mr Cherkasky was parachuted in as chief executive at the height of the crisis."
59;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2007-11-11T20:02:26Z;Insurers to pay $2bn in subprime cases;;The cost to insurers of claims brought against directors of companies caught up in the US subprime mortgage crisis could be more than $2bn, according to Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance broker.Guy Carpenter, part of Marsh & McLennan, estimates that this level of insured losses could be incurred on directors and officers (D&O) policies, which protect a director or officer of a company from paying out from their own pocket in a case arising from their duties as a director of a corporation.“There was never any doubt that the subprime mortgage market collapse would have an insurance impact. The question was one of extent. While estimates vary from $1bn to $3bn, it looks like the reality may settle at the upper end of the scale. The final answer will not come until 2008 or maybe even 2009, but history, litigation tendencies and capital markets point toward the worst case scenario,” Guy Carpenter said in an update on the professional liability market.The estimate comes amid growing worries about insurance and reinsurance claims arising from the subprime mortgage crisis, following the slew of write-downs announced by investment banks over recent weeks and a broadening of the impact of the subprime debacle.It also comes as American International Group, the world’s most valuable insurer and one of the biggest writers of D&O policies, requests information from insured companies about their exposure to the suprime crisis.AIG said this was routine and that when it became aware of a new area of possible exposure among its customers and potential customers, it conducted an information gathering exercise. It had carried out similar research with regard to stock option backdating.“We have received claim notices related to subprime events. At this point it is not a significant claim issue, however …we continue to monitor the activity,” it said.Thomas Sheffield, technical director in Aon’s global directors and officers division, said that, across the market, claims were being brought against those originating and writing subprime mortgages under so-called professional indemnity policies, which protect against claims of negligence in the performance of professional services.However, the most serious claims would be those arising from class actions against directors and officers of companies caught up in the crisis, which were also being brought.
60;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Who’s who: Of bankers, builders and fortune makers;;"Emilio Botín
The executive chairman of Banco Santander is Spain’s most powerful banker, the boldest dealmaker, and at the age of 73, shows no sign of slowing down or retiring.Now that Royal Bank of Scotland has succeeded in its €71bn ($101.12bn) bid for ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, Santander, as part of the winning consortium, will add Banco Real in Brazil and Antonveneta in Italy to its international stable.Mr Botín’s overseas empire spans the old and new worlds with €885bn in assets. In 2003, Santander became the first Spanish bank to buy a British one. Mr Botín persuaded Abbey National shareholders to exchange their sterling shares for equity in a Spanish bank that few had heard of and which had a sizeable exposure to Latin America. That takes chutzpah.Juan Abelló
The chairman and CEO of Torreal, an investment company, is not the richest man in Spain – that slot is taken by Amancio Ortega of Inditex, the holding company for the Zara fashion chain – but he does seem blessed with the Midas touch.Forbes estimates Mr Abelló, who began his working life in the family-owned pharmaceutical business in the 1960s, is worth €2.7bn.Torreal, his holding company, has been involved in some shrewd investments, including an early bet on Airtel, a mobile telephony startup that was sold to Vodafone in 2000 at a vast profit.If there is a secret to Mr Abelló’s success, it is in timing his exit as much as in knowing when to invest. In 1989, he sold his stake in Banesto, then Spain’s largest bank. In the early 1990s, the regulator stepped in to run the bank and its chairman was jailed for fraud.More recently, Torreal was being courted by the flock of international private equity groups hovering over takeover targets such as Iberia, the privatised national airline, and Altadis, a tobacco group. But with funding drying up for leveraged buyouts, it is uncertain whether any of the deals touted at the beginning of the year will materialise.Mr Abelló eschews the limelight, but he is the real power behind many a corporate throne. He made a significant investment in Sacyr Vallehermoso, giving that builder the financial muscle to become the biggest shareholder in Repsol, a Spanish oil group, and to mount a takeover bid for Eiffage, a French engineering group.Alejandro Agag
In Spain, as in many countries, good contacts are important. And Mr Agag, the son of an Algerian-Belgian banker, has them by the dozen.Despite being a political hopeful, economist, banker and indefatigable dealmaker, Agag, 36, is best-known in Spain as the husband of Ana Aznar, daughter of a former prime minister José María.Rupert Murdoch, Silvio Berlusconi and Julio Iglesias were among the guests at his wedding, held in the 16th century Monasterio de El Escorial, near Madrid, five years ago. This family tie, and his close affiliation with Spain’s centre-right Popular party, has made him few friends among the country’s old guard left, which is one of the reasons he lives in London, and not Madrid.The move has helped his latest career, as a Formula One impresario working closely with Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. Betting on the promise of a young Asturian called Fernando Alonso, he and his partners bought local transmission rights in 2002, when Spain’s motor racing fans would have fitted in a large town. Fast forward to last year, when 10m Spaniards tuned in to watch their hero win the Formula One championship, and it is clear that he was on to something.From his base in London, Agag dedicates most of his time these days to chasing sponsors, promoting GP2 racing, and finding money for new teams and venues. He is backing Formula 1’s first Chinese team, and was instrumental in inserting Valencia, the Spanish city, into the circuit for next year.Away from the track, Messrs Agag, Ecclestone and Briatore recently paid €60m for Queens Park Rangers, the west London football club they hope to coax from the First Division into the Premier League over the next few years.Connections aside, those who know Mr Agag say he is social, bright and unaffected by his wealth and status.Oscar Fanjul
If discretion is the greater part of valour, then the CEO of Omega Capital and founding chairman of Repsol, a Spanish oil and gas group, is its ultimate practitioner in Spain.Mr Fanjul’s discretion is well appreciated by Alicia Koplowitz, a construction heiress who entrusts her family endowment to the Chilean-born wealth manager. By common consent, Omega Capital, an investment holding company that has grown out of Ms Koplowitz’s family office, is the best of its class in Spain. It has €5bn in assets under management.Mr Fanjul combines his duties at Omega Capital with several independent directorships. He is a member of the boards of the London Stock Exchange, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Lafarge, Areva, Acerinox and Colonial, a Spanish real estate group with big investments in France. He was on the board of Unilever for 10 years. Few businessmen in Spain can match his breadth of experience and international contacts.Omega Capital, already an investor in global hedge funds, is poised to start its own hedge fund activities in Spain. Where Mr Fanjul leads, others may follow.This is not an association he relishes, but the head of Spain’s most international infrastructure group has no regrets about the deal that landed him in the spotlight.Ferrovial led a consortium last year that paid £10.3bn for BAA, which runs London’s three main airports, in a highly-leveraged transaction that is about to test appetite for jumbo collateralised bond issues in a difficult market.If all that were not enough, UK regulators are threatening to force a break-up of BAA’s crown jewels and tighten the cap on how much Ferrovial can make on its investment in the airports.Mr Del Pino’s strengths, including fluent English and a cool head, have been tested, while the company founded by his father has become the flag-bearer in Spain for old family-controlled conglomerates looking to take risks on the global stage.With an engineering degree from Madrid’s prestigious Universidad Politécnica and an MBA from MIT, Mr Del Pino represents a new generation of industrialist heirs who have had to earn their keep.One of his first jobs at Ferrovial was as a glorified site manager on a motorway project in Libya. After seven years as chief executive, he succeeded his father in 1999, when Ferrovial was still largely a domestic construction and toll road group.He promptly took the company into North America, Australia, the UK, and eastern Europe. Some say BAA was a deal too far. Mr Del Pino prefers to see it as Ferrovial’s defining moment.Luis del Rivero
Described variously as strategic genius or financial cowboy, Mr del Rivero inspires adulation and suspicion in equal measure. Either way, it is hard to ignore the 57-year-old executive chairman of Sacyr Vallehermoso, the construction, property and infrastructure group.Recent attempts to take control of Eiffage, the French group, have landed him in a legal battle that could end in an embarrassing retreat from Paris or an expensive cash-sweetened bid.If the French affair does end in tears, it would not be the first time. In 2004, Mr del Rivero tried to muscle his way on to the board of BBVA with options equal to a 3 per cent stake in Spain’s second largest bank. BBVA was furious and sent him packing – but he picked up a tidy capital gain for his trouble.Self-dubbed “master of the tran-tran” – or expert in going with the flow – he borrowed heavily to buy a 20 per cent stake in energy group Repsol because his competitors had already snapped up equity in the more reliable electricity companies.Like any self-respecting construction baron, Mr Del Rivero was trained as a civil engineer, and later did a management course at Spain’s IESE business school. His professional career started in 1972 in a cement group. In 1974, he joined Ferrovial, now a competitor, where he stayed for 13 years, before helping found Sacyr in 1987.As chief executive of the group, he led a reverse takeover of Vallehermoso, the property company, in 2003.Known as a straight talker with few airs, Mr Del Rivero is ready for a battle royal.Miguel Blesa
What will the 60-year-old chairman of Caja Madrid do with the €4.3bn that the country’s largest savings bank will pocket from the sale of its 10 per cent stake in Endesa, a Spanish utility?The question has investment bankers salivating. Caja Madrid stands to make a record €2.5bn capital gain from the bidding war for Endesa that ended recently with the successful completion of the €41 a share offer by Enel of Italy and Acciona of Spain.Will Caja Madrid invest the proceeds abroad, or will it buy more equity stakes in Spanish companies? Will it bet on further consolidation in the energy sector?Mr Blesa has proved a deft tactician. During the battle for Endesa, he resisted political pressure to show his hand until the shares had doubled. He is showing the same discretion in handling the Endesa jackpot.Juan María Nin
If one were to value an executive by the number of times he has been poached, then Mr Nin, director general since June of this year of La Caixa, the largest savings bank, would probably be the country’s most desirable asset.An energetic, outspoken banker, he was recruited from Banco Sabadell, a fast-growing Catalan commercial bank, where he had been chief executive since 2002. Before Sabadell, he worked at Santander – the country’s largest bank – where he was in charge of the huge Spanish retail operation, and later, the merchant banking division.A frequent gripe against La Caixa, Spain’s third largest financial group with assets totalling €232bn, is that it has ignored business clients in favour of the more humdrum business of taking savings deposits and doling out mortgages. Mr Nin could shake things up on this front.So it is refreshing to reflect on the career of Pablo Isla, the 43-year-old chief executive of Inditex, the fashion empire founded by Amancio Ortega, Spain’s wealthiest businessman.Like many of the Enarques who run corporate France, Mr Isla’s career has spanned both the private sector and public service. He is a member of an elite corps of civil servants known as abogados de estado (state lawyers), and was a director of state assets at the finance ministry in the mid-1990s.The distinguishing feature of his career, however, has been its diversity. He has been legal counsel for Banco Popular – a mid-sized bank – co-chairman of Altadis, a Franco-Spanish tobacco group, and since mid-2005, CEO and first deputy chairman of Inditex.Mr Isla took over a well-run, fast-expanding international fashion powerhouse with sales of €8bn last year and almost 70,000 employees. Zara, the group’s flagship retail store, has thousands of outlets in Europe, the Americas and Asia. Under his leadership, Inditex is expanding strongly in Asia.Luis José Pereda and Miguel Pereda
If two heads are better than one, real estate developer Grupo Lar is well-positioned to survive the current downturn in the property market.Smart, highly-educated and discreet, brothers Luis José and Miguel Pereda have, in the past 20 years, helped build one of Spain’s most respected property developers and managers.Lar is known in the business as the group that everyone wants to work with: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Axa, Acciona, Ferrovial, UK property group Grosvenor, and Sonae of Portugal are among its associates.Luis and Miguel were among the first Spaniards to sense an opportunity in central and eastern Europe, and today have properties, projects and alliances in Germany, Hungary, Romania and Poland.Last year, they expanded into France, buying control of Grupo Ogic, a mainly residential developer.At home, meanwhile, the brothers have always eschewed risky land speculation in favour of quick rotation and a balanced portfolio of commercial and residential properties.With Grosvenor, Grupo Lar has become a reference for quality development and management in the country’s still-buoyant markets in shopping and leisure centres, office blocks and industrial parks.Group pre-tax profits last year were €41m, up from €26m in 2005."
61;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Dangers of Spitzer’s rough justice;;"Eliot Spitzer, governor of New York and former scourge of Wall Street, is fond of quoting the aphorism of Louis Brandeis, a former Supreme Court judge and social campaigner: “Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”Mr Spitzer arrived in Albany, the state capital, this year promising to bring the same reforming zeal to his new post as he did to the job of New York attorney-general. He had scared the life out of Wall Street banks by holding press conferences at which he quoted damning e-mails, and pressured enterprises Marsh & McLennan and the New York Stock Exchange to ditch their chief executives.But sunlight is now shining on the methods used by Mr Spitzer’s team and it is not a pretty sight. An inquiry by Andrew Cuomo, his successor as attorney-general, found that two Spitzer aides had the state police collect information about an Albany politician, planted it in a newspaper and then lied about it. One, his public relations director, has been suspended, the other reassigned.Mr Spitzer has apologised but has insisted that he did not know what they were doing. In an article in The New York Times last week, he admitted that “we made mistakes” but insisted that “on my first day in office, I brought my staff together and told them what our guiding principles must be: ‘First, we’re going to fight for what we believe in. And, second, we’re going to maintain the highest ethical standards while doing it.’”Pull the other one, governor. Like a general commanding troops, he may not have planned this particular skirmish, but he devised the strategy and set the take-no-prisoners fighting style. Given all that we know about how he took down business leaders who stood in his way using press leaks, he clearly bears responsibility.The fact that his team’s unsavoury methods are being exposed is welcome because of the collateral damage he did to Wall Street’s workings as a financial centre. Until recently, it seemed as though he might eventually be able to parlay his period as a crusading attorney general into a run at the presidency. That would have been an undeserved reward because, although he did Wall Street some good, his brand of rough justice equally did much harm.The Spitzer problem was not that he aimed at the wrong targets but that he fought dirty. Rather than proving his case in court, he bludgeoned his enemies (as he appeared to regard them) into settling by holding open the possibility that he would issue criminal indictments against companies, a step that destroyed investor confidence in Arthur Andersen and Drexel Burnham Lambert. The clear moral was: in London, a suspect gets due process; in New York, he gets beaten up.That has been the pattern in Albany since Mr Spitzer arrived. He found what is tactfully called a dysfunctional culture there: a place where special interests rule and bills get bogged down by financial and political horse-trading. On top of the morass sits Joe Bruno, the Republican state senate leader, a veteran in-fighter whose business dealings are under federal investigation.So when Mr Spitzer’s aides got the state police to collect information on Mr Bruno’s use of New York state aircraft to fly to private fund-raising events, they were not ambushing a political innocent. It transpired that Mr Bruno had been meticulous: each trip included a political appointment that justified the outlay. Instead of Mr Bruno being disgraced, Mr Spitzer’s aides were the ones who ended up with their reputations tattered.The lesson that many have drawn from this is that Mr Spitzer is a better lawyer than politician. As attorney-general, he could get away with issuing threats such as his overheard boast to a lawmaker in Albany that “I’m a [expletive deleted] steamroller and I’ll roll over you and anybody else”. As governor, they say, his power is not absolute and he must learn to work with others.But his weakness in both jobs is the same: a spicy cocktail of ambition, aggression, self-righteousness and willingness to push the law as far as it will go. He defends his conduct by saying it is like playing hard on the sports field but shaking hands with an opponent when the final whistle blows. As attorney-general, however, he hustled others off the field by wielding newspaper headlines and the 1921 Martin Act, a vaguely-written New York securities law.Some aspects of US financial regulation are always going to be awkward. One is the rivalry between federal and state governments, with state attorneys-general vying with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice. Another is that attorneys-general are elected officials and have an incentive to play up their aggressive pursuit of companies and financial institutions on behalf of the little guy.Mr Spitzer has shown signs of recognising the problem he helped to create. He has set up a commission to examine how his state can streamline regulation and ensure that Wall Street retains its strength as a global financial centre. More predictability and consolidation of regulation would help institutions, both domestic and foreign, that are caught among competing supervisors.But justice also depends on the fairness and sense of balance of those doing the job. Mr Spitzer says he has learnt his lesson and recognises that his efforts “will succeed only if our means for changing the status quo are as honourable as our ends”. It is a shame that it took until now for him to take this principle seriously.john.gapper@ft.com"
62;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2007-04-17T21:04:24Z;Dow nears all-time high;;Wall Street stocks maintained their upward trajectory on Tuesday as investors cheered solid corporate earnings and softer-than-ex­pec­ted inflation data.The buoyant mood pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within five points of its all-time high while the Russell 2000 index of small companies and the S&P mid-cap index set records.Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson led the way upwards after the companies, Dow constituents, reported upbeat profit estimates.“The expectations for the earnings season were brought down so low that the odds of missing them are not great,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is pumping to a new high to confirm that everything is okay, but after this is done we may fade.”The Dow closed up 0.4 per cent at 12,773.04, after touching 12,790.02. The S&P 500 Index rose 0.2 per cent to 1,471.48 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,516.95.The morning rally was sparked by a smaller-than-expected rise in March core consumer prices.Some economists had worried that rising inflation would make it much harder for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy if economic growth weakened sharply. “The soft core CPI report will allow the market to refocus on growth risks,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Homebuilders made strong gains as data on the number of new-builds in February partly allayed fears about the severity of the market downturn. In addition, Fannie Mae said it would help defaulting subprime mortgage borrowers to refinance.The S&P Homebuilders index, which approached its lowest point in three years last week, rose 2.8 per cent. DR Horton gained 3.6 per cent to $22.45 and KB Home rose 4.1 per cent to $43.04.Johnson & Johnson stock was up 2.4 per cent to $64.55 after the healthcare group reported a sharp rise in sales.Shares in Coca-Cola advanced 2.6 per cent to $51.57 after the drinks group beat analysts’ expectations with a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter profit.IBM, which rose 1 per cent to $97.12, reported profits after the closing bell broadly in line with forecasts.Keycorp, the Ohio bank, was the laggard for the day, falling 5.8 per cent to $36.36. The group cut its earnings forecast for the year as its fee and new loan trends deteriorated.Fortress gained 1.3 per cent to $31.30 after the hedge fund and private equity group said that its 2006 net income had more than doubled.In deal news, Marsh & McLennan surged 3.7 per cent to $31.50 amid speculation that the insurance broker might be a leveraged buy-out target. Trading in options to buy its shares jumped nine-fold yesterday.
63;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2007-02-13T21:40:44Z;Wall Street rallies on sound earnings;;Wall Street stocks rallied on Tuesday on sound earnings figures, an analyst upgrade for General Motors and reports of a possible takeover approach for Alcoa, the aluminium group.The rebound in oil prices, up $1.25 to $59.06, also lifted energy groups, with shares in Exxon rising 1.1 per cent to close at $75.45.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent at 12,639.31 on the day, with Alcoa leading the way with a 6.38 per cent rise to $35. That followed an unconfirmed report that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were preparing separate $40bn takeover approaches for the aluminium group.The sharp rise in Alcoa shares in early trading was trimmed, however, when Peter Ward, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said a deal was unlikely and reduced his rating on the stock.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch analysts raised their recommendation on General Motors, also a component of the Dow, from “sell” to “buy”, helping to lift its shares 2.5 per cent to $36.59.The brokerage reduced Ford to “sell”, however, sending its shares down 2.3 per cent to $8.45.The S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,444.26.“It’s up but it looks like a low-volume type of day,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “The gains can certainly be reversed or added on later in the week when important economic data are released.”The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,459.88.Shares in Nasdaq itself were among the morning’s biggest fallers. The exchange operator said its profits had tripled from $17.1m to $63m in the fourth quarter, on higher trading fees and gains from the nearly 30 per cent stake it had acquired in the London Stock Exchange as part of its hostile takeover attempt.But investors were unimpressed with the company’s guidance and its failure to buy the LSE. Nasdaq shares dropped more than 11.4 per cent to $31.10, following a 5.7 per cent fall on Monday.Shares in 3M were 2.5 per cent higher at $76.43 after the diversified technology group said after the bell on Monday that it intended to return $7bn to shareholders through a share buyback over two years.Johnson & Johnson investors shrugged off news that the group had informed federal prosecutors that some of its units outside the US may have made improper payments. Its shares were 0.1 per cent lower at $65.38.KB Homes said it made a fourth-quarter loss of $49.6m after $343.3m of pre-tax charges for giving up land options and writing down the value of its housing stock.But its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $53.43, helped by a reduction in the number of buyers cancelling deals.The wider homebuilding sector benefited from more positive sentiment, with the S&P Homebuilders index rising by 1.5 per cent.
64;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-12-29T19:24:54Z;Power Corp set to win chase for Putnam;;Canada’s Power Corp is poised to win the race for Putnam after reaching agreement with the asset manager’s parent, Marsh & McLennan.Power Corp is believed to have beaten competition from Amvescap of the UK and UniCredit of Italy. MMC declined to comment.The group, which owns insurance broker Marsh, is thought to have sought between $3bn and $4bn for Putnam.Power Corp’s offer is believed to be at the upper end of this range.A successful conclusion to the sale of Putnam would be good news for MMC chief executive Michael Cherkasky, who is restructuring the group in the wake of an insurance broking scandal two years ago.However, one MMC shareholder yesterday complained that the group could have got as much as $5bn if it had sold Putnam a year or so ago.MMC considered a sale then, but decided to try and wait to see if Putnam could recover some of its value. Instead, the group continued its slow slide. Many MMC shareholders were hoping for a spin-off rather than a direct sale.MMC could provide a formal update on the auction in early 2007.The value of Putnam has fallen sharply in recent years as the company, once one of the biggest fund groups in the US, failed to recover from the mutual fund trading scandal of three years ago.Putnam’s funds under management are $191bn, half the level they were at the group’s peak in 1999.Although several other fund companies implicated in the scandal managed to recover, Putnam continued to lose funds, possibly because its fund performance never fully recovered.As for Power, the acquisition of Putnam would complement and broaden its already substantial financial-services business in North America.Power, which is controlled by Montreal’s Desmarais family, already controls IGM Financial, Canada’s biggest mutual-fund distributor by far, with assets of C$105bn (US$90bn) and a 16 per cent market share.Power also controls Great-West Lifeco, a big insurance group with operations in Canada and the US.Power has a sizeable, though little-publicised presence in Europe and China. The family patriarch, Paul Desmarais, 79, is a long-time business partner of Albert Frère, the Belgian entrepreneur.Through two holding companies – Pargesa and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert – the Frère and Desmarais families own stakes in, among others, Suez, the French energy and industrial group, and in Lafarge, the world’s biggest cement maker.
65;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-12-29T17:21:55Z;FTSE enjoys fourth-straight year of gains;;"Amvescap shares bucked a falling market on Friday amid raised hopes of a take-over in the new year.The Anglo-US asset manager had been seen as a front runner to buy Putnam Investments, part of insurance broker Marsh & McLennan and one of the oldest mutual fund companies in the US.However, reports suggested that Marsh had agreed to sell the company to Power Corporation of Canada in a $3.9bn deal.A failure to buy Putnam would leave Amvescap vulnerable to a bid, dealers said. Amvescap ended 1.5 per cent higher at 596p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100.At the end of a truncated final session of 2006, the FTSE 100 closed down 20.1 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 6,220.8.The benchmark still managed to chalk up a fourth consecutive year of double-digit returns. A rise of 10.7 per cent for the 12-month period produced a total return of 14.8 per cent once dividends were reinvested.However, that performance was outstripped by the FTSE 250, which closed down 12.2 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 11,177.8.It surged more than 27 per cent during 2006, a total return of 30.4 per cent, more than double that of the FTSE 100.Xstrata took the prize for the year’s best performing blue-chip stock, surging 109 per cent over the 12-month period thanks to higher commodities prices and booming demand for raw materials from China.Other leading blue-chip gainers in 2006 included fellow mining group Lonmin,
Corus, the steelmaker that is at the centre of a takeover battle, and Whitbread, the leisure group that is seen by many as a potential break-up candidate.The year’s worst performer was Carnival, the cruise ship operator, while other notable underperformers included oil giant BPand GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company.In the FTSE 250, UK Coal and software specialist Aveva Group, up 201 per cent and 162 per cent respectively, were the biggest gainers in 2006, although both were promoted to the index only recently. The FTSE 250’s wooden spoon went to PartyGaming, which has slumped 76 per cent. The online gaming group yesterday completed the acquisition of the assets of Empire Online.BT Group was a leading blue-chip faller for the second consecutive session, down 1.6 per cent to 301½p. The fixed-line operator has been undermined by concerns over the size of its pension fund deficit."
66;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-11-29T21:13:53Z;Putnam auction in final stage;;The auction of Putnam Investments, one of the oldest mutual fund companies in the US, is in its final stage and has attracted at least three foreign bidders.However, it is possible that none of the three – Amvescap of the UK, UniCredit of Italy and Power Corp of Canada – has bid high enough to win the company, according to those close to the action. Putnam has been valued by analysts at about $4bn.Putnam, which was once one of the largest and most successful fund groups, has largely failed to recover from the 2003 fund trading scandal, despite a payout of $190m to settle charges of wrong-doing, and an infusion of new management.Putnam has been put up for sale by insurer Marsh & McLennan, but if the price offered is not high enough then it could be taken off the market, said observers of the sale.Investors withdrew $3bn from Putnam’s mutual funds in the three months to September, taking assets under management to $182bn, a big drop from the $420bn it enjoyed in its heyday in 2000.However, it has strong name recognition, a long history and a well-regarded chief executive, Ed Haldeman, who took over after the scandal.These factors appear to have made the Boston-based group attractive to foreign buyers hoping to make inroads into the big US market.Amvescap, which has close to $500bn in assets under management, already owns two fund groups in the US, AIM Investments and Invesco.AIM was also badly hit by the funds scandal and suffered big outflows.This year, Amvescap made further strong US inroads, buying WL Ross, the distressed investing firm founded by Wilbur Ross, and PowerShares, the provider of exchange traded funds.UniCredit’s Pioneer Investments has a division in the US, based in Boston. About half a dozen other firms, including Ameriprise, have also been mentioned as possible buyers of Putnam.MFS, another Boston-based fund manager, was put up for sale by its insurance parent, Canada’s SunLife, at around the same time as Putnam. Although several bids were received, it was taken off the market because none were considered high enough.Mergers and acquisitions in the fund management industry are likely to reach a record this year, according to a recent report by Putnam Lovell.There are about 600 asset managers in the US, and almost everyone agrees there are too many. However, profit margins in the business remain high and few businesses have been forced to close their doors.
67;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-11-28T00:25:25Z;General counsels feel stock options heat;;Senior lawyers at least 12 US companies have left their jobs as a result of a growing investigation into stock options backdating that has jolted corporate America.Recent departures include leading in-house lawyers, or general counsels, at a range of companies, from housebuilder KB Home’s Richard Hirst and United Health’s David Lubben to technology company lawyers Jonathan Draluck of iBasis and Joann Reiter of F5 Networks, according to a list compiled by Corporate Counsel magazine.Monster Worldwide announced last week that it had terminated the contract of Myron Olesnyckyj, its general counsel, “for cause” after an internal investigation revealed the company had used incorrect grant dates to enhance executive compensation.One senior lawyer has faced criminal charges. William F. Sorin, former Comverse general counsel, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges this month.The departures so far may be the tip of the iceberg. More than 160 companies have acknowledged that they are facing regulatory inquiries or carrying out internal investigations into the way they handed out stock options. Academic studies suggest the issue may affect hundreds more.Lawyers have always been at risk during investigations – William Rosoff, the general counsel of Marsh & McLennan, resigned after the firm’s insurance brokerage arm was accused of rigging bids in 2004. Stephen Woghin, the former senior lawyer at Computer Associates, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and misleading investigators.What makes the options backdating scandal stand out is that boards have been quicker to part company with chief legal officers than in previous financial scandals.Analysts say this is partly because some of the ousted general counsels personally profited from the backdating.But the turnover is also evidence of a sea change in corporate attitudes.Fred Krebs, president of the Association of Corporate Counsel, said: “If something goes wrong in an organisation, the Securities and Exchange Commission looks at the general counsel and says if you didn’t stop it, you’re at fault.”The Sarbanes-Oxley legislation on corporate accountability and guidelines on federal sentencing have also forced executives and directors to put a higher premium on ethics.Directors are anxious to show regulators they take their responsibilities seriously.
68;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-11-03T22:10:51Z;KKR put up €40bn offer for Vivendi;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts offered €40bn ($50.8bn) to take over the French music and telecommunications group Vivendi in a deal that would have been the world’s biggest buy-out and shown that there are few world companies now beyond private equity’s reach.The US buy-out group and Vivendi held serious talks three weeks ago, according to people familiar with the situation. KKR had lined up financing from JPMorgan and Citigroup.But the talks foundered, partly because of tax issues. In 2004, French authorities granted Vivendi a favourable tax regime, which would see its French tax bill fall. A deal with KKR could have seen the French media group lose this privilege.KKR’s move demonstrates the scale of the power buy-out firms now wield in the global mergers and acquisition markets and will put on alert some of the world’s largest companies, which might have thought their size would protect against private equity interest.So far this year, buy-out groups have raised more than $320bn, with leverage that would equate to deals worth more than $1,000bn. Private equity groups often finance deals with three parts debt to one part equity.The Vivendi talks were facilitated by an existing relationship between the two companies.Henry Kravis, the founder of the firm, is married to Marie-Josée Kravis, a French-Canadian economist, a former member of Vivendi’s supervisory board. Mrs Kravis left the board in March last year.Vivendi has a market capitalisation at close of trading on Friday was €35bn.KKR, which is investing a fund of about $15bn – one of the biggest – is hunting for companies in every corner of the world.The buyout group has recently led a number of audacious buyout deals across the globe in recent months.In August, George Roberts, one of the founders of KKR, flew to Australia to attempt to sway the board of Coles Myer, the retailer. That deal also collapsed after the board rejected the $13.8bn bid from a KKR-led consortium.That same month, another KKR-led consortium paid $33bn, including debt, for HCA, the US hospitals chain. That deal shattered the 16-year-old record for the world’s biggest leveraged buy-out - KKR’s acquisition of RJR Nabisco.Last month, KKR also approached Marsh & McLennan the world’s largest insurance broker about a buyout.Vivendi’s businesses include Universal Music, the world’s biggest record company, and Canal Plus, the French pay-TV group which last month won approval from the French competition authorities to merge the unit with its satellite TV rival TPS to form a single satellite pay-TV platform in France.Last month, Vivendi paid €1.6bn for Bertelsmann’s music publishing business, making it the industry’s largest recording company and music publisher.The deal was part of strategy of the company’s new management to put at rest its past under Jean-Marie Messier and build up the four main legs of its business: telecoms, video games, music and pay-TV.Mr Messier, the former chief executive, amassed substantial debts through several acquisitions during the dotcom boom before departing in 2003.In May, Vivendi rejected an informal break-up proposal by Sebastian Holdings, a little-known investment company run by Alexander Vik, a Norwegian businessman.Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Vivendi’s chairman, subsequently queried the feasibility of a break-up, suggesting that there would be in some cases only one bidder for key assets, limiting their auction value.He viewed Vodafone as the only likely buyer of Vivendi’s controlling stake in SFR, France’s number two mobile telephone operator, and Lagardère as the sole candidate for Canal Plus.
69;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-11-01T21:29:01Z;Wall St lower as economic data weighs;;"Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as the good mood surrounding stellar earnings from MasterCard and healthy deal activity was punctured by economic data.That in turn aggravated concerns among investors that the economy could face a harder landing in 2007.After a bright opening, shares pulled back when the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index suggested activity was nearly at the threshold separating expansion and contraction. Housing and construction activity also slowed.In earnings news, MasterCard reported an 82 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings to $1.42 per share; well above the consensus estimate of $1.07 per share. Shares in the company closed $10.97, or 14.8 per cent, higher at $85.07.Merger and acquisition activity was also in the spotlight. R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it intended to buy Banta in a deal worth about $1.3bn. Shares in Banta increased by $7.87, or 17.8 per cent, to reach $52.15. Donnelley’s shares were 39 cents, or 1.2 per cent, firmer at $34.25.Pharmacy chain CVS and pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx, which has a market value of about $21bn, said they would merge, with CVS exchanging 1.67 shares for each share of Caremark. Shares in CVS were off $2.32, or 7.4 per cent, to $29.06. Caremark shares were down $1.06, or 2.2 per cent, to $48.17, once the terms were announced, down from a high of $53.65.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research Services reiterated its strong buy recommendation for CVS. “We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS’s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business,” said analyst Joe Agnese.The news buffeted the healthcare sector. Shares in McKesson swung sharply after its fiscal second-quarter earnings topped estimates and were off $1.10 or 2.2 per cent, at $48.99. Some analysts said a CVS-Caremark merger could reduce earnings at companies like McKesson.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was 10.1 points, or 0.7 per cent, lower at 1,367.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 32.4 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 2,334.35. Both indices were off earlier high points of 1,381.78 and 2,375.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 50.3 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 12,031.59.Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings were 19 cents a share; 1 cent below forecasts. Shares were 1.2 per cent or 24 cents lower at $19.77.Insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, owner of Putnam Investments, said its third-quarter net income totalled 31 cents a share; below estimates of 35 cents per share. Its shares were up 96 cents, or 3.3 per cent, at $30.40.Shares in General Motors were off 27 cents, or 0.8 per cent, at $34.65, after October sales rose 22 per cent."
70;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-06-01T18:41:37Z;Cat bonds prepare for stormy season;;Alberto, Beryl, Chris and Debby could soon be on their way. These are the first four names on the 2006 US tropical storm list.The hurricane season officially began on Thursday and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast another above-average year.It will also be an above-average year for the catastrophe, or “cat”, bond market, since many expect new issuance to reach a fresh record this year.The bonds are structured so that investors pay in capital and receive a steady stream of interest payments for the lifetime of the bond unless pre-agreed triggers are hit – such as a level of losses taken by the issuer or by a wider index of industry losses – when investors will lose some, or all, of their capital.“As far as the cat bond market is concerned the hurricane season had already started in the sense that issuers and investors have been organising themselves since the last season,” said Dan Ozizmir, a managing director in Swiss Re’s capital markets unit.The NOAA predicts an 80 per cent chance of an above-normal hurricane season, with just a 15 per cent chance of a near-normal season, and only a 5 per cent probability of below normal activity.Cat bond issuance is hard to gauge accurately, since many of the transactions are private and observers’ measurements vary. According to Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance unit of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance group, 2005 saw record issuance of $1.99bn.“We’re already at a fast pace and if all the deals that are currently in the market get fully placed, I think it would be accurate to say we’d be close to, if not exceeding, last year’s total already,” said Christopher McGhee, head of Guy Carpenter’s investment banking speciality practice.According to Michael Millette, head of financial institutions structured finance at Goldman Sachs, cat bond issuance in May alone comes to $1.2bn, with another $750m done in the first four months of the year.Mr Ozizmir expects issuance to double from last year, meaning it could hit $4bn based on the Guy Carpenter data.The biggest single chunk of that issuance is designed to cover US wind perils. While the severity and frequency of hurricanes has been rising for several years, it was not until 2004 that more began making landfall.Last year, the damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita triggered the first hurricane-related loss of principal on a cat bond, a $190m transaction by Kamp Re, a special purpose vehicle. Although not all the relevant insurance claims affecting this issue have been processed, the bonds are trading as though complete loss is expected.The losses insurers sustained in last year’s hurricanes have not damped the cat bond market, rather they have instead boosted it – partly because cat bonds only cover very extreme losses and few have ever been triggered.Katrina spurred many insurers to change their risk models while rating agencies also toughened their views, forcing insurers to put aside more capital against potential losses. As a result, premiums rose and capacity tightened in the retrocessional market – where reinsurers buy their insurance.“You have higher demand and lower supply in the reinsurance market, so our clients are looking for alternatives,” said Mr McGhee.Mr Millette said: “Investors have become more familiar with this sector over many years and are finding opportunities at attractive rates. There are also more intermediaries, with both broker-dealers and insurers facilitating the activity.”Spreads on cat bonds have risen sharply too. Premiums on some more “out of the money” tranches of deals have doubled according to Mr Ozizmir.“That’s the right response from the market – investors should be paid more for these risks than they were a year ago,” he says. “If you want to keep existing investors and attract new ones, then you have to offer a higher coupon.”Mr Ozizmir said existing investors remained active, including some who were booking losses on the Kamp Re bond.In addition, there are new investors, including both macro and specialist hedge funds, and some private equity groups.But unlike other instruments, which tend to gravitate towards standardised structures as the market develops, cat bonds are increasingly varied. Indemnity-linked bonds – based on a level of losses taken by the issuer – have been somewhat out of favour since Katrina, and some in the market have favoured bonds whose trigger is linked to an industry-wide index of losses.“It’s fair to say we are still searching for the most efficient standardisation of risk and it’s not yet been achieved in my view,” said Mr McGhee. “There’s no one standard, the market reflects the different portfolios that reinsurers and insurers have, and the different triggering mechanisms each need.”Mr Millette said: “There’s a proliferation of alternatives, the market is trying to think through how to compare all these. Investors are having to think hard about what they want.”There are also new risks and new geographic areas being covered by the market. Mexico last month became the first developing country to offer cat bonds in a $160m deal arranged by Swiss Re. The bonds are linked to earthquake risk and allow the government immediate access to funds should disaster strike.
71;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-05-14T22:17:02Z;Putnam assets hit 10-year low as outflows bite;;Putnam Investments has seen its mutual fund assets fall below $100bn, the lowest level in more than a decade.The once high-flying fund group has left some observers puzzled over its failure to recover from the fund trading scandal of 2003.Putnam had the biggest outflows – $21bn – of any fund group in the US past year. In the first quarter of this year investors pulled out another $4bn, according to Financial Research Group. It is the only one of the 10 largest fund groups to show such losses, while most of the industry enjoys big inflows and profits.In the past five years, investors have pulled a total of $100bn from Putnam. Its mutual fund assets – excluding money market funds – fell to $99.5bn at the end of March, well down from a peak of $240bn in 1999.The decline has come in spite of strong efforts made by new management to turn around the company. Ed Haldeman, a well-regarded industry executive, was appointed to head Putnam in 2003 after Lawrence Lasser lost the job as a result of the company’s involvement in the fund trading scandal.The 70-year-old company was one of the hardest hit by the scandal and paid $190m to settle regulators’ charges that Putnam employees were improperly trading in their own mutual fund’s shares. The group’s parent, insurance company Marsh & McLennan, has also suffered, paying $850m to regulators last year after a bruising insurance investigation.However, Putnam had begun to see outflows of money before the scandal. Its growth-oriented investment style fared poorly when the stockmarket turned down in 2000.Mr Haldeman has laid off staff, cut fund fees, launched an advertising campaign and presided over the departure of more than half the group’s top executives. Many of his reforms have been aimed at lifting investment performance.Laura Lutton, a fund analyst at industry tracker Morningstar, said Putnam’s two main funds, the Voyager fund and the Fund for Growth and Income, had underperformed.“It is difficult to convince investors to return when two of your biggest funds have lousy three-year records,” she said.On Friday, Putnam announced a change at the helm of the Fund for Growth and Income, replacing two of the $15bn fund’s four managers. The two Voyager managers have been in place for barely a year.The moves follow the departure in March of three fund managers, adding to turnover at the group.Putnam said in a statement on Friday that it had net inflows in several areas of business, including separately managed accounts, and it had strong performance in several of its funds. The company was confident that flows would improve by the end of the year, it said.Putnam also manages $27bn in money market funds and about $60bn in institutional money.
72;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Record issuance for catastrophe bonds;;Insurers and reinsurers increasingly seek to transfer natural catastrophe risk to the international capital markets, mainly as a result of losses from Hurricane Katrina, says a report published this week.But record issuance of so-called catastrophe bonds in 2005 stretched investor appetite, said the report by Guy Carpenter & Co, a unit of Marsh & McLennan, whereas in previous years demand had far outstripped supply.“Prior to 2005, cat bond investor demand far outstripped supply, but the 2005 storms have reversed this trend,” said Christopher McGhee, head of Guy Carpenter’s investment banking speciality practice.“Not only did we witness record highs in terms of total risk capital issued, total risk capital outstanding, number of bonds placed and number of first-time sponsors, but the market also suffered its first significant loss to a publicly disclosed catastrophe bond,” Mr McGhee said.Catastrophe bonds are issued by insurers and reinsurers mostly to cover extreme losses from natural catastrophes: hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes and flooding.Losses on such bonds are triggered either by claims against the issuer over a certain high limit for a single event, or an accumulation of events, or by certain measures, such as wind speeds in Florida above a certain limit.Guy Carpenter estimates that investors in a cat bond called Kamp Re 2005, which was publicly disclosed but privately placed, will have seen a total loss of the $190m principal amount following Katrina, the hurricane that led to the flooding of New Orleans and caused some of the biggest insurance losses of any single storm. That would be the first total loss to a publicly disclosed catastrophe bond, the report said.There was record issuance of cat bonds in 2005 of $1.99bn from 12 deals, up from the previous $1.73bn record in 2003 and the $1.14bn seen in 2004. The total of bonds outstanding reached almost $5bn by the end of 2005.However, the rush of post-Katrina issues, which saw four deals priced in the final quarter, stretched investor appetite and led to a rise in the yields issuers had to pay on their bonds.There was also growing interest among hedge funds to invest instead in start-up reinsurance companies seeking to take advantage of the increases in premiums after losses incurred in last year’s heavy hurricane season.“A series of factors, including a tight catastrophe reinsurance market stemming from the storm losses of 2005, contributed to a substantial increase in inquiries by insurance and reinsurance companies looking to explore cat bonds as a supplement to their traditional reinsurance programs,” the report said.
73;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2006-02-14T21:35:17Z;Dow leaps above 11,000 after strong retail sales;;Unexpectedly strong retail sales data, combined with gains for technology stocks, helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its best performance of the year and drove it back above the 11,000 level.The Department of Commerce said January retail sales rose 2.3 per cent, easily beating the 0.9 per cent forecast by analysts.The Dow closed 1.3 per cent higher to 11,028.39, the S&P 500 added 1 per cent to 1,275.53 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,262.17.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was up 1.1 per cent to $21.37 after Apple Computer said it was to start rolling out its MacBook Pro laptop range Intel processors.Intel’s gains came in spite of a lowered price target from UBS. The broker said it believed competitive pressure from Advanced Micro Devices would cause erosion to margins as the company lowered prices to defend its 80 per cent market share. AMD shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $40.22.Apple benefited from news that Warner Music Group’s quarterly profit had more than doubled thanks to rising sales of digital music through outlets such as Apple’s iTunes online music store.Although Warner shares were down 1.8 per cent to $20.43 on falling revenues, shares in Apple gained 4.5 per cent to $67.65.Meanwhile, RealNetworks leapt 15.3 per cent to $8.53 after it was upgraded by Piper Jaffray from “market perform” to “outperform” ahead of its results due out after the Wall Street close. The broker cited strength in the company’s core digital music business.3M, the industrial group and maker of such products as Scotch tape, added 1.1 per cent to $73.70 after the Dow constituent raised its quarterly dividend and announced a share buyback.Among other strong performers on the Dow, aluminium producer Alcoa gained 3.7 per cent to $31.37, while Home Depot gained 3.6 per cent to $41.13, and Hewlett-Packard climbed 2.4 per cent to $32.50.Cendant, owner of the Avis car rental company, fell sharply after it announced that 2006 earnings would rise by “low single digits”, less than the 10-12 per cent guidance the company gave in December. The shares fell 6.7 per cent to $15.70.Marsh & McLennan, the world’s largest insurance broker, reported net income of $35m, beating its $680m loss in the previous year, but this fell short of expectations.The company said lower insurance premium rates, as well as currency effects and weaker equity investment sales, were responsible for the shortfall, and the shares fell 4.8 per cent to $29.09.Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, said it had revised its fourth-quarter results higher by more than a third following a lower than expected charge on an asset sale. The shares edged up 0.4 per cent to $60.07.
74;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Marsh & McLennan reports profit increase;;Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker, on Tuesday reported a 10.8 per cent increase in fourth-quarter underlying profits as it continued the recovery from a bruising investigation last year.Profits after restructuring charges and other exceptional items rose to $154m, or 28 cents per share, from $139m, or 26 cents per share, said the company, also known as MarshMac.Michael Cherkasky, chief executive, has had to rebuild MarshMac’s reputation after the probe, which saw eight of the company’s former executives indicted.Describing last year as “challenging”, Mr Cherkasky said the group “overwhelmingly retained our clients and employees”.The company said fourth-quarter net profits were $35m, or 6 cents per share, putting them below analyst estimates. The profit came after a net loss of $683m, or $1.29 per share the previous year when the company settled allegations of improper accounting and bid-rigging in auctions for its business.A 5 per cent decline in insurance brokerage revenues to $1.14bn outpaced an overall revenue decline of 2 per cent, in a possible reflection of market share erosion in the wake of the investigations in the sector. Overall risk and insurance revenues fell 7 per cent to $1.32bn.However, Marsh said “the improved business tone …is apparent in the fourth-quarter results”.Analysts and investors had yet to be convinced. As Marsh shares fell as much as 6.8 per cent in morning trade, David Small, analyst as Bear Stearns, described the results as “sloppy”.Mr Small did see a “silver lining” in the fact that revenues were better than anticipated.Among the company’s other business segments, Putnam investment funds suffered a 12 per cent revenue decline, to $360m, on average assets under management falling 11 per cent to $188bn. The Putnam division was involved in a probe of mutual fund trading practices two years ago.
75;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;FSA to warn on conflicts of interest;;The Financial Services Authority will over the next few days warn insurance brokers on how they deal with conflicts of interest across their businesses.The chief City regulator, which took over the regulation of general insurers and brokers in January, is expected to send a “Dear CEO” letter to the chief executives of insurance brokers, stressing the importance of managing conflicts of interest across their operations.Julian Adams, head of the FSA’s wholesale insurance department, said this week: “The manner in which conflicts of interest are managed is an issue in which we shall continue to take a significant interest in during the course of our ongoing supervision of firms and of the market as a whole.”He said the FSA would also set out, in its communication with brokers, the findings of a study it conducted earlier this year into how brokers that sold insurance to corporate buyers handled conflicts of interest. However, he declined to comment further.Conflicts of interest in insurance broking were thrust into the spotlight last year after New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer accused Marsh & McLennan, the world’s biggest insurance broker, of rigging bids and favouring insurers at the expense of clients in return for higher commissions.A study by Freshfields, the law firm, found no evidence of bid rigging at Marsh UK. In addition, London market sources believe bid rigging would have been difficult because London is a subscription market. This means a number of insurers each cover a proportion of the same risk, rather than placing the whole policy with one insurer.However, concerns were raised about the impact on the London market of contingent commissions - controversial bonuses paid by underwriters to brokers for bringing them large amounts of business or particularly profitable accounts.The FSA has refused to outlaw contingent commission. It has also stopped short of forcing insurance brokers to automatically disclose to their customers what they are paid for securing insurance cover for them. However, it does have rules and guidance on how brokers should deal with potential conflicts of interests, which companies are expectet to meet.Separately, Mr Adams said the FSA would conduct a “stock-take” towards the end of this year of the progress insurers and brokers were making in meeting the FSA’s demands that they end uncertainty in the exact terms of insurance contracts, or face enforced change. It would then conduct further analysis early next year.The regulator also admitted on Friday that it had not made as much progress as planned in assessing the amount of capital insurers were required to hold under a new system introduced at the beginning of this year. It reiterated that many insurers were underestimating the amount of capital they needed to meet the risks they faced.
76;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-08-02T15:46:25Z;Marsh & McLennan hit by restructuring charges;;"Second quarter profits fell 57 per cent at Marsh & McLennan, parent of the world’s largest insurance broker, as the group was hit by restructuring costs and lowered revenues across most of its businesses.Earnings at MarshMac - which controls the insurance broker Marsh, the security group Kroll, the mutual fund group Putnam, the reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter and the consulting group Mercer - fell to $166m or 31 cents per share from $389m or 73 cents in the same period last year.Shares in the financial services group have lost more than 30 per cent since New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer accused executives at Marsh of rigging bids on insurance contracts last year.Revenues from MarshMac’s risk and insurance groups fell 11 per cent in the quarter to $1.5bn as the group was hit by a slowdown in new business and falling rates on premiums.Putnam proved another trouble spot for Marsh Mac as its revenues dropped 13 per cent to $377m in the quarter. Investors continued to withdraw money from the underperforming fund manager - which also faced charges from Mr Spitzer following his investigation into abuses in the mutual fund industry - with its assets under management dropping another 9 per cent in the quarter to $196bn.In a statement, chief executive Michael Cherkasky said management was “working on all fronts” to keep MarshMac’s costs in line with revenues. “We have made significant strides across all of MarshMac’s businesses to position the company for long-term profitable growth,” he said.On Wednesday, analysts were less optimistic about the group’s prospects, citing its lower margins and limited opportunities for growth. “We think the shares will ultimately be weak …Future quarters will be messy with on-going charges and high leverage,” wrote analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton, in a note.As part of an $850m settlement with Mr Spitzer reached in January, Marsh agreed to stop accepting bonus commissions from favoured insurers, which accounted for about a third of its revenue in 2004. MarshMac’s management has struggled to find a way to make up for these lost revenues; revenues from insurance broking dropped 18 per cent in the quarter to $1bn.MarshMac has eliminated about 5,500 jobs since Mr Spitzer accused the company of rigging bids on insurance contracts last October."
77;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-05-03T21:59:38Z;Wall St mixed after Fed makes expected move;;Wall Street stocks closed mixed on Tuesday after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point and said it should be able to control rising inflation by continuing its “measured” pace of rate rises.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1 per cent to 10,256.95. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,161.17, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 1,933.07.In a bizarre twist, the Fed later said it had omitted a sentence from its closely scrutinised monetary policy statement. A corrected version of the statement, which appeared just before the closing bell, said that although inflationary pressures had increased, long-term inflation expectations remained “well contained”.David Kelly, managing director at Putnam Investments, said: “This is a case where the Fed is keeping its head when everybody else is losing theirs.”Mr Kelly said the Fed statement indicated that the US Central bank was trying to maintain an image of balance in its approach toward monetary policy.A steady stream of earnings reports ahead of the Fed meeting gave investors little to cheer about on Tuesday.Most of the companies in the S&P 500 that have reported thus far have matched or beaten expectations, but jitters about economic growth have cast a shadow over trading in recent weeks, resulting in a series of volatile swings on Wall Street.In other economic news, a government report said factory orders increased by 0.1 per cent in March, against expectations of a 1 per cent decline.On the earnings front, Tyco Internationalsaw shares decline 6.7 per cent to $28.65 after the conglomerate reported declining profits and reduced its earnings estimates.Marsh & McLennan rose 0.5 per cent after it reported quarterly profits down 70 per cent. In January, the company agreed to pay $850m to clients to settle an investigation into its insurance practices.Las Vegas Sands, a casino operator, fell 5.7 per cent to $36.10 after it revealed declining quarterly profits.Masco, which makes faucets and other household fixtures, fell 6.6 per cent to $29.89 after it reported lower quarterly earnings and cut its second-quarter guidance.Qwest Communications fell 0.3 per cent a day after it lost a protracted bidding war for MCI to Verizon Communications.In other corporate news, the US-traded shares of TV Azteca, the Spanish-language broadcaster, and Grupo Elektra, the Mexican electronics retailer, fell sharply after the companies announced plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange. TV Azteca fell 7 per cent and Elektra fell 6 per cent.General Electric fell 0.4 per cent to $36.10 after it received a subpoena related to GE insurance products from the Securities and Exchange Commission.General Electric fell 0.4 per cent to $36.10 after it received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is seeking documents related to GE insurance products.
78;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-04-06T19:23:57Z;The sentries of the marketplace;;"They are among the most powerful people in corporate America. After the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the general counsel is perhaps the most influential member of the senior management at a big US company.He or she has the daunting task of ensuring that the company and its employees stay on the right side of a myriad of laws and regulations. One bad move in the post-Enron world and a company not only gets fined and sued for huge sums of money, but its stock price can also plummet and management may be forced out.Such corporate crises as the one currently at American International Group, and previously at Marsh & McLennan, did not happen five years ago. But the bursting of the stock market bubble five years ago and the subsequent slew of business scandals irrevocably changed attitudes to corporate behaviour.For large US companies and their general counsel, minimising the risk of reputational damage is the biggest task confronting them today. For example, they know that they have to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law on accounting and governance if they want to command confidence among investors.But the potential sources of trouble are enormous. Internally, companies must contend with employment and health and safety laws. Externally, many must deal with a spider's web of domestic and foreign regulators together with laws on subjects as diverse as anti trust matters and the bribing of foreign government officials. It is therefore no coincidence that Chuck Prince, a former general counsel of the Commercial Credit Company, is chief executive of Citigroup, the world's biggest bank.Citigroup, like its peers on Wall Street, has been learning to cope with relentless inquiries by regulators since the exposure of conflicts of interest inside investment banks three years ago.Financial services is not the only sector feeling the heat from regulators. The energy and pharmaceutical industries are also coming under intense scrutiny.And when the regulators come calling, they usually go to the same person: the general counsel.Thomas Russo, chief legal officer at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, dealt with Eliot Spitzer, New York state attorney-general, on the big settlement three years ago that resolved allegations that Wall Street firms compromised the independence of their equity analysts in the pursuit of investment banking revenues.Mr Russo says that he devotes much of his time to fostering a culture of compliance among Lehman's 20,300 employees.An effective compliance culture should increase the chances that any breaches of laws or regulations are one-off difficulties rather than systemic failures.""If you look at the totality of the job at Lehman, it is really worrying about the defence of the company,"" says Mr Russo. ""The single most important aspect is to try and create an environment . . . which maintains the highest integrity possible, and which in turn helps to prevent problems.""General counsel hammer home the compliance culture via close involvement in the core business. They and their legal departments are immersed in all aspects of the business, from strategy to particular deals.Transactions are assessed not just for compliance with the law but also for their potential impact on a company's reputation.Gary Lynch, general counsel at Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, says: ""Once we have decided that we are comfortable from a legal perspective on a matter, we then go on to consider the reputational consequences of doing a particular transaction.""The close working arrangements between in-house lawyers and the core business create tensions and potential conflicts. The lawyers are supposed to be independent providers of legal advice, but their close involvement in the core business carries the risk of undermining their objectivity.Lawyers argue, however, that they can only succeed in fostering a compliance culture if they are viewed as business partners rather than police officers.It is all a far cry from 25 years ago, when general counsel remained aloof from the day-to-day business and instead gave verdicts on deals at the point of completion. Back then, the in-house lawyers lacked influence. The chief executive would rely on a senior partner at a leading law firm for advice.But during the 1980s, big companies sought to cut their legal costs by ending their reliance on outside law firms. They developed their own legal departments, and they gave pay packages to general counsel that matched those of partners in outside law firms. During the 1990s, general counsel, like other senior management, were given lucrative stock options. Today, at Fortune 500 companies they often earn more than $1m a year.It is not just the pay that is different. Today's corporate lawyers operate in a super-litigious society.Kenneth Masterson, who retires next month after 26 years as general counsel of FedEx Corporation, the courier service, expresses concern at how class action lawsuits have recently been taken up by employees as well as shareholders.He says that such lawsuits are the biggest challenge for general counsel, and expresses regret at ""the tendency in this country for there to be lawsuits filed for any conceivable wrong, no matter how unlikely"".The Sarbanes-Oxley law is meanwhile prompting general counsel to devote significantly more time to financial reporting issues.A company's chief executive and chief financial officer have to certify the accuracy of its financial statements, and they face criminal penalties if they wilfully misrepresent the accounts. While it is the CFO's job to oversee compilation of the relevant data, the general counsel must check that the corporate response meets the disclosure requirements in the Sarbanes-Oxley law. The law also requires lawyers who represent companies before the Securities and Exchange Commission, the chief US financial regulator, to report any evidence of wrongdoing to the board if the CEO fails to act on their concerns.Frank Fernandez, general counsel at Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, says that general counsel must execute policies that put ethics at the heart of business strategy.But he expresses concern that some regulators are not recognising the right of companies to withhold details of confidential discussions with lawyers, and he says that such action should be questioned. ""A lot of the fall-out from Enron and WorldCom is the government becoming a bit over zealous, a little bit over aggressive,"" says Mr Fernandez. ""When the government does that, there has to be a balance. And lawyers are part of that balance saying: 'Wait a minute, there are limits.' ""Prosecutors and regulators are putting in-house lawyers under unprecedented scrutiny. The SEC regards general counsel, like auditors, as what it calls ""sentries of the marketplace"", and it is considering cases against in-house lawyers who assisted companies in covering up fraud.Stephen Cutler, head of enforcement at the SEC, says: ""At least some of the malfeasance we have seen in recent years would not have happened if a lawyer had raised his hand and said 'Stop'."" General counsel may be increasingly powerful in the post-Enron world, but their personal exposure to lawsuits is also greater than ever before.TOUGHER RULES MEAN US MODEL OF CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER IS SPREADING TO EUROPE AND ASIAGeneral counsel in European companies have traditionally been far less powerful than their US counterparts, write Bob Sherwood and Philip Stafford. But that is fast changing as companies respond to tougher regulatory burdens and an increasingly complex legal environment.While lawyers are usually prominent on the boards of US companies, that has often not been the case in Europe, where many organisations do not have a senior management-level legal officer, let alone a legal director on the board.But an increase in legislation from the European Commission - along with a closer focus on antitrust issues, financial services regulations and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act - has meant that many organisations are turning to a more US-style of chief legal officer.Also, growing use of the “panel system” of managing external law firms - using a select group of law firms to control costs and improve service - has given European general counsel greater clout.The rise of in-house counsel is evident in the creation last month of a General Counsel 100 group in the UK. Mark Harding, chair of the GC 100 and general counsel at Barclays, the UK-based bank,says that the group was created to give in-house lawyers a stronger voice and to reflect better the increasing prominence of their roles an d the greater regulation and legal complications they were all facing.Even then, the GC 100 expects a maximum of 75 members, as about one-quarter of the FTSE 1000 companies do not have an appropriate senior legal officer.European general counsel do not earn the bumper pay packets of their superstar US counterparts. That, however, is beginning to change. Last month, the f irst ranking of the 50 most powerful general counsel in Europe was produced by Legal Business magazine. It cited Bill Friedrich at BG Group, the gas and energy group, as the highest paid general counsel among the 100 largest UK companies, with a package totalling about £1m ($1.9m).In Asia, general counselare usually considered less important than their US and European counterparts. Corporate governance has traditionally been given a lo wer priority while merger and acquisitions activity, in which corporate lawyers play a key role, is still relatively new in Asia. The general counsel who have been employed tend to be responsible for corporate housekeeping, such as complying with listing rules or drawing up contracts for business.But things are changing. Simon Davis, a managing partner for Linklaters in Hong Kong, says:”In Europe or the US, it’s quite normal to meet an in-house general counsel on an M&A deal, but in Asia you often meet other specialised teams.“Asia is gradually catching up with the rest of the world with post-Enron regulation, but it’s not strengthening at the same speed as the rest of the world. So the gap might widen in the short-term, but it will close in the future.”"
79;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-03-01T23:33:46Z;Lex: Marsh McLennan;;Short of revenue? Raise prices. That, at least, is part of Marsh & McLennan’s strategy in the wake of its regulatory woes. The company plans to charge higher insurance broking commissions to replace the contingent payments it has now abandoned, which amounted to $845m in 2003. The company says it will eventually recoup a “meaningful portion” of its lost revenue, while still offering its customers low rates.Combined with possible annual cost savings of $775m, the extra income could restore the company’s former profitability. But the market does not quite believe it. The Putnam investment unit, on a price-earnings ratio of 18, could be worth about $4.5bn if 2004 performance can be maintained and further legal and restructuring costs avoided.Assuming, say, 15 per cent profit growth and a p/e ratio of 14, the Mercer consulting business could be worth $4.3bn. Corporate costs would reduce the combined value by about $3.3bn. With the whole company worth $17.5bn, that implies the insurance business is worth about $12bn.To justify that value, the risk and insurance business would need to generate annual operating income of about $1.2bn, assuming a p/e ratio of 15. It made $1.8bn in 2003, and even last year managed more than $900m excluding contingent commissions and non-recurring charges. Planned cost cuts alone would push profitability towards 2003 levels, supporting a higher valuation. Given execution risk and continuing regulatory worries, however, investors are entitled to be sceptical for now.
80;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Lombard: Market transparency is a real virtue;;Insurers criticise FSA on disclosureIt is not every day that the chief executive of Lloyd's takes issue with the Financial Services Authority, so when he does his remarks deserve serious consideration - especially in a world changed by the Spitzer investigation of the US insurance market.Nick Prettejohn said on Monday that the FSA was mistaken in not making it mandatory for brokers to disclose all the commission they receive.The FSA instead requires commission to be disclosed to commercial customers if they demand it, and brokers may choose to be more open if they wish. The underlying philosophy seems to be that it does not want to be too heavy-handedly interventionist in a wholesale market composed of big boys.Perhaps surprisingly, a lot of large commercial buyers of insurance seem relatively sanguine with this approach, provided the FSA cracks down on any broker that fails to disclose when asked, as it has evidently assured them it will.But Mr Prettejohn and others in the industry argue that a lack of mandatory disclosure could threaten the City's competitive position, both in terms of direct loss of business to other centres and from the persistence of economic inefficiencies in the London market. Under Marsh & McLennan's Spitzer settlement in the US, it will provide clients with a comprehensive disclosure of all forms of compensation received from insurers.The FSA says it has no plans to change its approach. Yet transparency in markets is generally a virtue, leading to greater efficiency, which the FSA is usually keen to encourage. It should think again.Big bang theoryDoug Flynn, just named chief executive of struggling Rentokil Initial, and Brian McGowan, the chairman who appointed him, have what might loosely be called an explosive history: back in the 1980s Mr Flynn was a senior ICI executive, where evidently he once sold explosives to Mr McGowan, then with conglomerate Sime Darby in Hong Kong.Mr McGowan, who had forgotten the encounter until they met again, will be expecting Mr Flynn to put a charge of a different kind under Rentokil, where profits are shrinking, thanks to years of under-investment (now starting to be addressed) and intense competition in its maturing markets.Mr Flynn looks a good catch. A 55-year-old Australian, he has been chief executive of Aegis, the media planning and buying business, for the past five years, where his record was generally regarded as strong, but not above criticism in some areas. Before that, he was a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch's News International.His media and chemical industry background means he does not know much about Rentokil's support services business, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. A fresh pair of eyes may be just what the group needs, after decades of managerial inbreeding.And some of his experience should be particularly useful. Aegis, like Rentokil, is a company that has relatively small units scattered around the globe that need to be managed effectively.But Rentokil has long been micro-managed from the centre, making staff in the field unwilling to take the initiative. A big cultural shift is required, and that will take time. But investors will start to get twitchy with the course set by the board last year, when it ousted Sir Clive Thompson, the former chairman, if profits are not showing signs of improvement by the second half of this year.Mr Flynn will come under a lot of pressure from analysts to sell the parcels delivery and conferences businesses, generally regarded as non-core. But these are reasonable earners, not basket cases, and any disposals should be part of a carefully designed strategy, not fire sales that would get poor prices. Explosives experts set their charges carefully.Simple good senseTwo features stand out from the remuneration deal Rentokil has agreed to get the services of Doug Flynn as chief executive - and they do not include the overall size of the package. This could eventually pay out up to £2.4m a year, provided stretching performance targets are met for the long-term incentive scheme, and that looks reasonable for a company of its size and with its problems.More interestingly, to woo good chief executives away from their existing companies these days you need to match the value of their existing options and incentive plans, and that is costing £2.4m - though at least two thirds will be in three tranches of Rentokil shares.The other noteworthy feature is that Rentokil announced the terms of the package alongside the appointment. More and more companies are doing this, though by no means all. But it is simple good sense. A board will anyway have to reveal the details in the annual report, and will be bombarded with questions as soon as an appointment is made. So it is best to make a virtue of transparency.martin.dickson@ft.com
81;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-01-31T21:25:52Z;Wall Street boosted by optimism on Iraq;;Wall Street gained ground on Monday amid a perception that the Iraqi elections had been a success. A pick-up in domestic merger and acquisition activity after the announcement of several deals also suggested increased confidence.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 10,489.94, while the S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent higher at 1,181.26. The Nasdaq Composite index was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,062.41.Wall Street notched its first winning week of the year last week, tacking on modest advances for the five-session stretch amid warnings that a losing month could bode ill for the year.January has been a dour debut to the year, with the Dow ending the month 2.7 per cent while the S&P 500 index lost 2.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 5.2 percent.This week's meeting of US Federal Reserve policymakers is expected to yield a quarter-point rise in interest rates and a keenly studied statement. With a widely watched labour market data report on Friday, it is expected to shed light on the world's largest economy and the outlook for equities.News of multiple acquisitions on Monday suggested increased confidence in US boardrooms. In the telecoms sector, SBC Communications announced the takeover of AT&T for $16bn. The deal, which sees a current Dow component buy a former constituent, pushed AT&T shares down 2.6 per cent to $19.11. SBC Communications shares added 0.6 per cent to $23.76.Lee Enterprises announced it was buying Pulitzer for about $1.4bn in cash. Its shares inched up 1.5 per cent to $44.55, while Pulitzer gained 0.9 per cent to $63.46.Eastman Kodak announced the purchase of Creo, a supplier of printing systems, for $980m in cash. Kodak shares rose 1.2 per cent to $33.09.In the insurance sector, MetLife said it would buy Citigroup's Traveler's Life & Annuity unit. MetLife shares edged off 0.5 per cent to $39.75 while Citi rose 1.4 per cent to $49.05.Monday's deals came after a landmark merger in the consumer goods sector last week, when Procter & Gamble said it would buy Gillette. The stocks were 1.7 per cent lower at $53.23 and $50.72, respectively.The takeover news came after national elections in Iraq were declared a success by authorities in Baghdad, Washington and London. Traders and investors said there had been skittishness in the market about attacks during the polls.About half of the components of the S&P 500 index have reported earnings. A few prominent US corporations were still to report earnings this week.ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil group, saw its shares add 0.6 per cent to $51.60 after it said record crude prices helped it achieve $8.4bn in net profits last quarter.Shares in Marsh&McLennan rose 4.5 per cent to $32.50 after the insurance broker agreed to pay $850m to settle charges that it rigged auctions with insurers.
82;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-01-18T15:40:59Z;Krispy Kreme head ousted amid probe;;"The chief executive of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts stepped down yesterday amid a federal probe into an accounting scandal. The man leading the turnround of Enron is to succeed him.Scott Livengood, chairman and chief executive of the doughnut maker, retired less than two weeks after Krispy Kreme announced that a planned restatement of financial results would hurt net income more than expected. The news sent shares in Krispy Kreme up more than 10 per cent at the close on Tuesday.His replacement, Stephen Cooper, is interim chief executive of Enron and chairman of Kroll Zolfo Cooper, a turnround firm and consultancy.Mr Cooper and his Enron turnround team arrived at the bankrupt energy group in January 2002 with a track record that included Laidlaw, the Canadian owner of the Greyhound bus group; Federated Department Stores; Laker Airways and Maxwell Newspapers.Bankruptcy experts have credited him for the work at Enron, notably in maximising the sale proceeds from its remaining assets. However, he has courted controversy among current and former employees with his attempt to secure a $25m “success fee” for his work on top of the $63.4m in salaries and fees paid. A bankruptcy judge is due to rule on the claim in November.Mr Cooper heads the corporate restructuring and advisory group at Kroll, the investigative firm owned by Marsh & McLennan, which acquired his own turnround business in 2002. He will be joined at Krispy Kreme by a team from the Kroll Zolfo Cooper corporate restructuring unit.Steven Panagos, a managing director of Kroll Zolfo Cooper, has been named president and chief operating officer.The company said its lenders had agreed to postpone until January 24 a deadline for refiling a 2004 quarterly financial statement from the original January 14 date. Krispy Kreme risks defaulting on a $150m credit facility if it fails to meet the deadline. It is unable to borrow funds under the credit facility.Krispy Kreme added that “significant sales declines” could result in a loss-making fourth quarter. Substantial legal costs associated with the federal probe are also taking a toll.Krispy Kreme was one of the highest-profile non-technology initial public offerings of the stock market boom. But the company suffered a series of setbacks last year including profit warnings and a formal investigation launched by the SEC in October into how it accounted for buy-backs of some of its franchises.Correction of accounting errors from the fiscal year ending February 1 2004 would reduce net income by up to 8.6 per cent $4.9m,or 8 cents a share the company said in a January 4 filing with the SEC.The company is also the focus of an ongoing shareholder lawsuit filed in US district cout in North Carolina. The complaint alleges that Krispy Kreme misrepresented its financial condition and engaged in improper accounting that inflated pre-tax income for fiscal year 2004 by as much as $8.1m."
83;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2005-01-07T20:57:17Z;Marsh chief makes changes to management;;Michael Cherkasky, the new chairman and chief executive of Marsh & McLennan, has unveiled a series of management changes in another attempt to put the group's problems behind it.E Scott Gilbert has been plucked from General Electric, where he was in charge of preventing compliance problems, to do the same job at Marsh. A lawyer by trade, Mr Gilbert spent five years working as an assistant US attorney in the southern District of New York before he joined GE in the early nineties.Two senior executives at Kroll, the investigative group bought by Marsh & McLennan last year, have also been promoted.Michael Beber, a forensic accountant who was previously running Kroll's Background Screening Group, has been named Marsh's chief strategic development officer.And Michael Petrullo, formerly Kroll's chief operating officer, is to become the new chief administrative officer. His job is to find ways to improve Marsh & McLennan's operating performance.This week, Robert Stearns, a former broker, became the first Marsh executive to plead guilty to criminal charges brought by Eliot Spitzer as part of his investigation into improper practices in the insurance industry.The investigation by New York's attorney general has embroiled some of the biggest names in the industry.On Friday, Berkshire Hathaway said it received a subpoena from New York's attorney general, requesting information about General Re, one of its reinsurers.The request follows a similar one by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also looking at the sale of so-called finite reinsurance, a product that regulators claim is being used to manipulate company earnings.
84;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-12-27T17:09:23Z;Lex: Marsh & McLennan;;Finally, something good has happened to Marsh & McLennan. The insurance broker was caught in a storm of its own making after being sued by Eliot Spitzer over allegations of bid-rigging. But at least it has been given a vote of confidence by the banks, which have just granted it a new loan agreement.That leaves minor issues to resolve, such as coming up with a new business model and tackling a softening market for property and casualty insurance. Corporate clients may well concede they still need a broker their in-house risk managers may not be as good at gauging market trends but Marsh cannot expect them to suddenly replace the revenues it has lost through ending controversial contingent commissions. And it is hard to see how cost-cutting alone can offset the hit. Throw in the legal cloud hanging over Marsh and it seems odd that the market is taking such a benign view. The stock is currently trading at more than 15 times 2005 earnings, based on the average of consensus forecasts, close to the market rating and a premium to some rivals. With 2005 earnings still so uncertain, this rating looks like it belongs on someone's New Year wish list.

The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,212.67, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,170.86.Wall Street’s muted reaction to Sunday’s devastating tsunami, which killed more than 20,000 people when it ravaged shorelines throughout south east Asia, mirrored that of other stock markets around the world.American Insurance Group, a leading US insurer, slipped 0.1 per cent to $66.20, but other insurers crept higher, with AXA, a rival, rising 1 per cent to $24.82. Marsh & McLennan rose 0.4 per cent to $32.49.Bullish investors looking for signs of a post-Christmas rally pounced on tech stocks in pre-market trading, sending industry bellwethers Intel and Apple Computer higher.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, rose 0.4 per cent to $23.63, while Apple, the personal computer group, rose 1.4 per cent to $64.88.Sharper Image, the specialty gadget chain, plunged more than 17 per cent to $19.05 after it lowered its earnings estimates and reported weaker-than-expected holiday sales.Delta Air Lines, America’s third-largest airline by revenue, fell 3.4 per cent to $7.30 after computer problems forced its Comair subsidiary to cancel all of its Christmas day flights.WR Grace, the materials group, was flat at $13.77 after US Senator Arlen Specter called for Congress to act quickly to set up a fund to compensate victims of asbestos poisoning. WR Grace has a number of outstanding liabilities related to the dangerous insulation material.
86;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-12-23T20:36:29Z;Profile: Eliot Spitzer;;"When Eliot Spitzer told a press conference in October that the management of Marsh & McLennan was ""not a leadership I will negotiate with"", one thing was clear. Jeffrey Greenberg should start looking for another job.Within days, Mr Greenberg, the company's chief executive and one of the most powerful men in the global insurance industry, was forced to resign. He was not the only casualty. A month later, the company, whose stock price had almost halved, said it would have to fire 3,000 staff.That press conference confirmed Mr Spitzer's status as one of the most feared figures in the business world.The New York attorney-general made his name attacking conflicts of interest in Wall Street and the US mutual fund industry. But this year he showed that no company was safe as he turned his fire on a swath of international businesses from insurance and drugs to power generation and music.Such is his reputation that even a mention in the media, which he uses with great skill, that he is eyeing a particular industry causes panic. Stock prices plunge, chief executives cower and crisis management consultants cancel their vacations.Even Mr Spitzer's sternest critics admit he has exposed serious abuses in many of these industries. But as the leading crusader for tougher regulation in the wake of the scandals of the stock market boom, Mr Spitzer has played a key role in what many now see as a regulatory overreaction that threatens US competitiveness.This year came the backlash. Mounting criticism by business leaders of measures such as the Sarbanes- Oxley corporate governance legislation are being heeded at the highest levels. Earlier this month, John Snow, US Treasury secretary, called for ""balance"" in the enforcement of Sarbanes-Oxley, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the chief US financial regulator, is considering special rules for smaller companies to reduce compliance costs.Mr Spitzer says it is inevitable that the regulatory ""pendulum"" sometimes swings too far and predicts that the US has passed the ""high water mark"" of activism by state officials such as himself. So maybe it is no coincidence that he is now looking for another job.On the wall of Mr Spitzer's Manhattan office is a small but prominent photograph of his political hero, Theodore Roosevelt. ""You can't read a biography of him and not say 'wow'"", he enthuses. Roosevelt made his name by taking on some of the most powerful businesses in the land on behalf of the little guy. Mr Spitzer, the self-styled ""people's lawyer"", also stands up for the little guy, as well as the private investor. Shortly after the Marsh press conference he announced a settlement with employers to provide back pay to dozens of Central Park pretzel vendors.Now Mr Spitzer, 45, has declared his ambition to follow in Roosevelt's footsteps by running for governor of New York State. Democrats, still demoralised by defeat in last month's presidential election, are fighting to jump on his bandwagon. ""In addition to admiring him on his merits, they are smelling a winner,"" says Ed Koch, former New York mayor. Mr Spitzer's first fundraising event after his declaration was packed with such supporters as actress Glenn Close, attorney David Boies and film mogul Harvey Weinstein. ""There's a fervour for Eliot. He's one of the rising new stars of the Democratic party,"" says Mr Weinstein.The contest for governor is still two years away. But some of Mr Spitzer's fans are already wondering whether he might go further still in emulating his hero, who in 1901 became the youngest ever president of the US.Many in the business world would be delighted to see him move on. They accuse him of using regulation by terror to dictate the detail of how companies are structured, what prices they can charge and even whom they can employ as chief executive. They accuse him of imposing remedies that are worse than the problems they are supposed to solve. And they accuse him of using his job for political purposes, an odd charge to make against an elected official who proudly proclaims himself a ""partisan Democrat"".What is not in dispute is that Mr Spitzer's impact has been felt well beyond America's shores, let alone the boundaries of New York State. He has ushered in sweeping reforms of the financial services industry and has transformed the landscape of US regulation across a range of other industries. And he has made everyone think twice before sending an e-mail.It was with e-mails that he burst on to the world stage in 2002, exposing the conflicts of interests in Wall Street stock research. When his staff found the message in which Henry Blodget, a Merrill Lynch analyst, described as a ""piece of shit"" a client's stock the firm was publicly recommending, they knew the bank would have to settle. Merrill Lynch quickly buckled, paying a $100m fine, and eight months later the other top Wall Street banks settled similar charges for a total of $1.4bn. They also agreed to wide-ranging reforms of their practices, which most have adopted internationally.Damning e-mails also featured in Mr Spitzer's attacks on the mutual funds and insurance industries. Of all Mr Spitzer's cases, the insurance probe has been perhaps the most controversial. The bid-rigging suit filed against Marsh wiped billions off the market value of other insurers around the world. Many leading companies immediately announced they would scrap so-called contingent commissions, which Mr Spitzer claimed were the equivalent of kickbacks that encouraged brokers to steer their clients towards higher-cost insurance contracts.Mr Spitzer says he understands the surprise at his attack on Mr Greenberg, ""which even surprised me a little bit"", but notes it resulted from months of discussions in which Marsh's management had ""denied, dissembled and deceived"". He also denies that he forced the companies to drop contingent commissions. ""They eliminated them in an effort to reaffirm their loyalty to their clients.""Critics say this is disingenuous and that companies are now so terrified of Mr Spitzer they will do almost anything to get him to go away. Like Roosevelt, Mr Spitzer carries ""a big stick"", in his case the Martin Act, New York's sweeping securities fraud law.But Mr Spitzer insists he has been very restrained in the use of his powers. ""We have been very careful not to destroy companies. Some have criticised me for showing too much restraint.""He also disputes the charge that he moves too fast to settlements without considering the full impact of the remedies. But he does concede that the reforms agreed over Wall Street research were ""a little awkward"".Mr Spitzer says it is too soon to assess the legacy of his individual cases. But perhaps his most enduring impact will be on relations between state and federal regulators. In many instances, according to Mr Spitzer, he and other state officials have been forced to move into what should be Washington turf because federal agencies have left the field.The SEC was well aware of the conflicts of interest in Wall Street research, for example. Indeed Mr Spitzer notes that Harvey Pitt, who resigned as SEC chairman two years ago, convened a meeting of Wall Street chiefs to discuss the issue but then left it to them to sort it out.Other federal regulators, including the Food and Drug Administration, were also at fault. But they are now reclaiming the ground from state officials, something Mr Spitzer applauds. He agrees with business leaders who deplore the ""Balkanisation"" of US regulation. ""Having 50 regulators is inherently a bad thing."" Moreover, the federal agencies have more power and resources. ""We are a pop gun compared with their bazooka,"" he says of the FDA. He and most other state officials are happy to leave the field, he adds.Mr Spitzer insists that his candidacy will not change how he does his current job, although some of his supporters believe it should. ""He needs to spend the next two years focusing less on business regulation and more on politics, in particular the problems of Albany [the state capital],"" says one Wall Street backer, who fears he is seen less as pro-investor than anti-business.It is hard not to believe that Mr Spitzer has planned his career as meticulously as he prepares his cases. But he insists he never expected to go into elected politics. After Princeton and Harvard Law School, he worked as clerk to a US district judge and briefly in private practice before joining the Manhattan district attorney's office. After six years pursuing the Gambino crime family and other racketeers he moved to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, one of New York's most prestigious law firms. ""I thought I would become a partner at Skadden, do that for a few years and then go into the family business,"" says Mr Spitzer.But Lloyd Constantine, a former New York assistant attorney-general who hired Mr Spitzer as an intern, says there was never a chance he would join his father's property business. ""As soon as I saw him I knew he was headed for government. It would have been a waste of his skills to be anything other than a litigator.""Mr Spitzer's competitive nature is also seen on the tennis court and the ski slope, where the fitness fanatic is a ""formidable adversary"". But Mr Constantine says he also has more of the other skills needed in politics than is generally acknowledged. ""Eliot knows how to negotiate and compromise. He is capable of listening and changing his position.""Like Roosevelt, Mr Spitzer was born into money. His father, the son of Jewish immigrants, set up his own property business, which now operates a number of Manhattan apartment blocks - including the Fifth Avenue building where Mr Spitzer lives with his wife and three daughters. Mr Spitzer used several million dollars of family money in his first unsuccessful run for attorney-general in 1994, which he lost resoundingly. He won a closely fought battle in 1998, despite claims by opponents that he had misrepresented the money as his own.His campaign for governor will cost nearer $40m (£21m)but Mr Spitzer has proved himself an effective fundraiser, despite - or perhaps because of - his reputation among business leaders.For all his sporting prowess, there is a slightly bookish, not to say geeky, air about Mr Spitzer, magnified by his receding hairline and angular features. But even his critics praise his quick wit and self-deprecating charm, which helped him make New York magazine's list of the ""50 sexiest New Yorkers"".While there is no doubting his command of the law and subjects he knows well, some friends admit he is not yet a fully-rounded politician. ""On broader political issues he is less impressive. When he talks about foreign affairs it sometimes sounds like he just read a book,"" says one supporter. But Mr Spitzer thinks a north-eastern Democrat could still win the White House by combining a muscular foreign policy with more progressive domestic policies in the style of a Roosevelt or a Tony Blair.Mr Spitzer is the clear Democratic favourite in the race for the New York governorship. Polls this month also showed him running ahead of any plausible Republican candidate other than Colin Powell, the popular former secretary of state who has since ruled himself out. But Mr Spitzer admits there is a long way to go. ""You don't walk into the position of governor of the state of New York without a fight."" He has, however, already proved he is a fighter who likes to win.Do you agree with the FT’s choice of Person of the Year? Join the online discussion and air your views here.The political winners who lost outIn the Financial Times’ quest for the man or woman who has made the biggest impact this year, politicians are naturally the biggest single category we trawl through. But, despite the number of important elections in 2004, none of the winners emerged to gain our accolade. The accompanying chart helps explain why. Our rough guide to political impact measures, along the bottom, the country’s importance in terms of wealth, population and influence and, along the vertical axis, the degree to which the politician won on their own personal style or credo.The result is a scattershot pattern with no clear winner. It is true that George W. Bush is the best outlier. He naturally scores the maximum 100 along the bottom line and does pretty well in the personality stakes. This reflects the fact that US presidential politics are highly personalised, and voters liked his informal style on the stump. But it also has to be heavily qualified by the large electoral debt that Mr Bush owed to Karl Rove, who masterminded his campaign.The other high outlier, Viktor Yushchenko, is as yet only potential, although he is favourite to win Ukraine’s election on Sunday. Yet his perseverance through electoral fraud, intimidation and poisoning to gain the chance of a re-run vote puts him near to the top of the personality axis, somewhat offsetting his country’s modest importance.At the bottom of the chart are Paul Martin of Canada and José Luis Zapatero of Spain. This is partly because both operate in parliamentary systems that give less scope for personality politics than presidential ones. But it is more because Mr Martin inherited a large parliamentary majority, but got re-elected in June on a minority of seats, and because Mr Zapatero was the beneficiary of the previous government’s bungled reaction to March’s train bombings.In the middle, two hard men got re-elected in Australia and Russia. John Howard could not have won his fourth election victory in October without proved personal appeal to the electorate. Vladimir Putin, with all the levers of Kremlin incumbency at his disposal, hardly needed personal appeal to win re-election in March. Yet there is clearly something in him that appeals to Russian nostalgia for a strong state and leader.One of the inspirations for Mr Yushchenko was Georgia’s youthful Mikheil Saakashvili who first led street protests that overturned the previous regime, and then won January’s presidential election with 96 per cent of the vote. Hamid Karzai also owed his direct election as Afghan president in September to personal qualities of honesty and bravery as well as to broad appeal to the country’s tribes.But this pair’s overall impact on the FT chart is dwarfed by that of the victors of two mega-elections. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia’s first directly elected president in September, even though his tiny party held only a tenth of parliamentary seats. And in India the biggest electoral upset of the year brought the greatest act of political self-sacrifice. Sonia Gandhi, who led the Congress party to its surprise victory, ought to figure as high on the personal register as Mr Yushchenko, except that the contribution of this Italian-born member of the Nehru family was dynastic as well as personal. Aware of this, she handed power on to Manmohan Singh.Chen Shui-bian, who won Taiwan’s presidential election in March on a platform of greater assertiveness towards China, is the clear back marker. If, however, his election were to lead down a road to confrontation, even war, with China, that would, retrospectively, be this chart’s greatest error of judgment."
87;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-12-02T13:29:47Z;Lex: Marsh UK;;“Not guilty!” That is the message emanating from the London operations of Marsh & McLennan. Ever since Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney general, attacked US insurance practices, uncertainty has infected the European industry too. However, Marsh (UK) has cannily commissioned its own inquiry from outside lawyers and on Thursday these declared there was no evidence of bid-rigging or the false submission of quotes.So far, so heart-warming for insurance investors. However, the lawyers made an equally noteworthy observation - namely that Marsh, like other brokers, has enjoyed considerable incentives to maximise income from ìmarket service agreementsí (MSAs) in recent years. That meant brokers steered business to favoured insurance groups, creating a conflict of interest.The good news is that Marsh has now abandoned these offending MSAs, and other large brokers are following suit. The bad news is that this creates a vicious revenue squeeze and there will be no easy remedy without radical industry change. Consequently, many smaller UK brokers are clinging to the MSAs. That leaves the UK Financial Services Authority on the hook. On Thursday it promised not to implement ìretrospectiveì punishment when it starts regulating the insurance sector next month. It has also hitherto appeared to tolerate MSAs. However, Thursday’s damning comments could prompt the FSA to rethink that second stance. If so, the Marsh debacle may yet put the industry onto more rational pricing course.
88;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-12-01T21:32:19Z;Lombard: Policing Spanish practices is a difficult job;;"The FSA and general insurance regulationDoes the Financial Services Authority know quite what it is getting into when it starts regulating the general insurance industry next month?The investigations of Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general, into the US broking industry seem to be exposing a can of worms on that side of the Atlantic, and it is far from clear that the London market has been free of questionable practices.On Thursday clients of the UK subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan - the US group facing a lawsuit from Mr Spitzer alleging anti-competitive practices - will receive the findings of an independent inquiry ordered by the London firm into its behaviour. It will evidently give it a clean bill of health.Against this background, it is extremely timely that the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, the City think-tank, has just published a stimulating, iconoclastic paper on the difficulties of regulating the industry*.It is written by Shirley Beglinger, a leading City practitioner who until recently was a managing director at Swiss Re, and she pulls no punches.""Insurance,"" she writes, ""is a bitch to regulate - and as a result it has traditionally been regulated both inadequately and badly."" Spanish practices are rife - and any regulator worth its salt has to tackle them.She questions the assumption among EU regulators that the risk-weighted capital regime they are applying to banks will easily carry over to insurance, for the differences between the two industries may be more important than their similarities.And she offers 10 recommendations for improving the regulatory framework. They include ring-fencing the assets associated with retail insurance to protect Mr and Mrs Average-Homeowner - and since retail is generally very profitable, and can cross-subsidise industrial portfolios, householders could face lower premiums, while industrial ones would probably rise. This sounds fair.Following Spitzer, she rightly suggests that brokers should only accept fees or brokerage payments from clients, and that any other compensation should be disclosed in writing to the client.Perhaps most controversially, Ms Beglinger argues that since no regulator can hope to judge the adequacy of a company's claims reserves with confidence, the job should fall to teams of specialists from each company, who would conduct peer reviews of competitors.This looks a non-starter. The FSA is hardly likely to want to give up such a fundamental role, while companies would hardly welcome such an intrusion by their rivals. Still, Ms Beglinger's imaginative ideas should stir up some healthy debate.* Regulation of the non-life insurance industry: why is it so damn difficult? Shirley Beglinger. CSFI, £25. Available from www.centralbooks.co.ukMarks and SpencerMarks and Spencer's one-day ""20 per cent off"" sale on Thursday is the latest sign that business is not great on the High Street in the run-up to Christmas.This is M&S's second one-day sale of the season, and while the first was fairly selective, with prices cut on a limited number of items, the company says this one will be wider, with reductions on ""thousands of products"".Stock, then, is not exactly walking out of the doors of M&S, but are the store's reductions a sign that it is faring worse than the competition, or simply getting more aggressive under Stuart Rose, the chief executive?One-day ""spectaculars"" have become a feature of the High Street, with Debenhams holding a two-day sale with up to 25 per cent discounts, Allders offering up to 50 per cent off over four days, and House of Fraser also putting up the sale signs early.Once upon a time M&S would have eschewed such stunts to boost footfall, with its potential erosion of pricing power. But it cannot afford such pickiness these days, and while its spectaculars may be a sign of weak trading, they at least show Mr Rose is responding quickly.As Nick Bubb of Evolution Securities points out, ""some panic promotions are planned and some aren't"". While M&S's appears to have been a last-minute decision, Woolworths' ""10 per cent off (almost) everything for a day"" sale yesterday looks part of a carefully planned attempt to keep its offer fresh.Bradford & BingleyRequiem for a failed strategy: Bradford & Bingley on Wednesday sold Charcol, its lossmaking mortgage broker for about £10m.

His successor, Steven Crawshaw, has rapidly gone back to basics.The founder of Charcol, John Garfield, is being brought back to run it by the private equity consortium that has just bought the business.

89;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-11-19T00:35:08Z;Marsh’s UK chief hits out at Spitzer probes;;Bruce Carnegie-Brown, head of the UK arm of Marsh & McLennan, on Thursday hit back at Eliot Spitzer, New York state attorney-general, who has filed a civil lawsuit against the insurance broker's US parent.Answering questions at a lecture at Lloyd's organised by the Insurance Institute of London, Mr Carnegie-Brown said there was a danger of allegations of anti-competitive practices against some individuals in the US being applied to the whole of the insurance market.“One of the issues that is so frustrating around Spitzer is that this market is working at 99.9 per cent of its capabilities every day of the week,” he said. “But he has managed to make that 0.1 per cent feel as though the whole market is corrupt in some way.” Mr Carnegie-Brown also said Mr Spitzer and the media had not drawn any distinction between “perceptions of conflicts of interest and actual conflicts of interest” in relation to incentive commissions bonuses paid by underwriters to brokers for large volumes or more profitable products.But he said it was clear that “brokers cannot put themselves in that position either actually and we knew that before [or] perception-wise either”.Mr Carnegie-Brown called for more transparency in relationships between brokers and clients, admitting that the way the payment structure had developed to include incentive commissions was a “very untransparent arrangement”.He warned that transparency could put pressure on brokers' earnings. It could also be a catalyst for making processes more efficient, which would benefit clients because if brokers did not have to engage in cumbersome administrative processes, they would not have to charge clients for them or bear the costs themselves.Marsh has stopped accepting incentive commissions.● Fortune Brands on Thursday said it was dropping Marsh as its insurance broker after Mr Spitzer accused Marsh of fraud, Reuters reports from Chicago.Mr Spitzer cited Fortune, whose products include Jim Beam bourbon, Moen taps, Swingline staplers and Titleist golf balls, as a victim of bid-rigging in his October 14 lawsuit against Marsh & McLennan.Clarkson Hine, a Fortune spokesman, said his company retained Marsh competitor Willis Group Holdings for policies that renew on January 1 2005 “as a result of our concerns about Marsh's alleged conduct”.
90;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-11-16T19:50:14Z;Zurich executives plead guilty in Spitzer probe;;Two executives at Zurich Financial Services, the third-biggest US commercial insurer, pleaded guilty on Tuesday night to criminal charges in connection with New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer's probe into price manipulation and kickbacks.The two executives, John Keenan and Edward Coughlin, worked in Zurich's US excess casualty unit, according to a plea agreement read out at their arraignment at the New York State Supreme Court.News of the guilty pleas came as Mr Spitzer called for greater federal oversight to end the US insurance industry's “culture of favouritism and payoffs”. More than a dozen insurance executives have been forced out of their jobs or suspended since Mr Spitzer and other regulators looking into conflicts of interest in the sector uncovered alleged abuses including bid-rigging.On November 12, Zurich, Switzerland's largest insurer, suspended several US employees after a review of its dealings with insurance brokers including Marsh & McLennan.In a civil lawsuit on October 14, Mr Spitzer accused Marsh of giving a contract to insure an $800m (€618m) loan taken out by Greenville County, South Carolina, to Zurich because it expected the insurer to pay a lucrative fee.Mr Spitzer testifying on Tuesday to the Senate sub-committee on financial management, the budget and international security criticised the existing US system, which delegates regulatory responsibilities to the states, and blamed some state insurance commissioners for failing to spot the price-fixing and other anti-competitive practices found by his office. “Many state regulators have not been sufficiently aggressive in terms of supervising the industry,” he said.“It is clear that the federal government's hands-off policy with regard to insurance combined with uneven state regulation has not entirely worked.“There are limits to what this office can do. The problems we have uncovered in the insurance industry are profound, complicated and national in scope.”Brokers' trade associations told the sub-committee they supported moves to increase transparency but unanimously opposed increased federal oversight and a ban on incentive bonuses. They backed a draft bill, the State Modernisation and Regulatory Transparency Act, which would require states to modify insurance laws without creating a federal regulator.Mr Spitzer also signalled that his inquiries would be wider than previously thought, outlining further areas to be scrutinised. First among these was insurers based in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands that are partly owned by brokers. Other forms of price-fixing were also prevalent and should be scrutinised, he said.
91;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-11-12T22:05:48Z;Crude declines prolong Wall Street advance;;"Wall Street started the week with broad expectations of profit-taking that never materialised, so it settled on moving higher with increasingly bold steps that gave the bulls hope and th e bears reason to quibble.By the close on Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 10,539.01 while the S&P 500 index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,184.17. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2 per cent to 2,085.34.For the week, the Dow put on 1.4 per cent while the S&P 500 advanced 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 2.3 per cent. Most of the gains came on Thursday and Friday as traders used fal ling crude futures to push the Nasdaq to nine-month highs and the S&P 500 to its best close in more than three years. The Dow and the S&P 500 tacked on their third consecutive week of gains while the Nasdaq Composite conclu ded a fourth one.Arthur Cashin, a managing director at UBS and veteran trader, noted that late on Thursday 425 stocks in the S&P 500 index were gaining, and doubted there was specific news about every company in question. He said this was evidence of index-based buying rather than investment decisions driven by companies' fundamentals.To market traditionalists, such activity dents the credibility of any rally. Throughout the week some market watchers cautioned that the advance was in danger of suffering the same fa te as previous ones this year, given the uncertain outlook for both the economy and corporate earnings.Nevertheless, the recent rally did attract new money into the market, according to Deutsche Bank, which said the four-week average flow of capital into US equity funds was $1.6bn, the highest since July.The case for doubting the economy appeared to be bolstered by the initially muted market reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest assessment when it raised benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday, as it had been widely expected to do. The US central bank's statement accompanying the decision was almost identical to the previous one and failed to stir buyers until the sharp decline in crude prices the following day brought the bulls from the sidelines.Even then much of the action was attributed to the imminent arrival of about $30bn into the market as Microsoft distributed its much-anticipated dividend. Mr Cashin at UBS described t his as one of ""the higher tax cuts"" to hit the US economy, with a likely impact ""for the textbooks"".Cisco Systems, which reported quarterly results after the Tuesday close, gave fodder to the sceptics doubting the prospects for corporate earnings. While it met analyst estimate s for the current quarter, its guidance for the upcoming period disappointed the market, and shares lost 6.6 per cent on Wednesday.A counterpoint came after the Thursday close, also from the technology sector, when Dell Computer reported a 25 per cent rise in profits and said it was a year ahead of schedule in its plan to double its revenues. Shares rose 4.4 per cent on Friday morning.The shares of Hewlett-Packard, whose ability to compete with Dell has been questioned by investors, declined 3.7 per cent on Wednesday as UBS downgraded the stock. They continue d to fall on Friday in reaction to the Dell results.Investors received an estimate of the impact of the investigation into insurance industry practices by Eliot Spitzer, the attorney-general of New York. The shares of Marsh&McLennan, one of the companies targeted by Mr Spitzer's probe, reported a 94 per cent drop in profits on Tuesday and its shares fell 2.1 per cent on the news.Pharmaceuticals, another sector in distress recently, continued to be in the news. Merck saw its shares lose 2.2 per cent on Tuesday after it reported that it was the target of investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as about 375 lawsuits, in relation to its withdrawal of Vioxx, its painkiller drug. After a rebound in the following session, the shares sol d off towards the end of the week.The fall-out from the Vioxx withdrawal spread to Pfizer,whose drug of a similar type was found to cause similar side-effects. Pfizer shares lost 1.9 per cent on Wednesday when the news came, and the decline continued in the next sessions."
92;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-11-09T16:55:19Z;John Dizard: Spitzer suit may also hurt the innocent;;"There isn't a lot of sympathy among people in the capital markets for the bid-rigging insurance brokers, and the underwriters who conspired with them. However, there is increasing concern that New York attorney- general Eliot Spitzer's 500 pound bombs might be hitting a few too many civilians. He and his enforcers might want to consider ways to limit the collateral damage to insurance purchasers and the insurers' credit market counterparties.There's no question that the storms of lawsuits are going to have an impact on the industry's capital base. Already, the credit default swap spreads on brokers Marsh & McLennan and Aon have blown out by 10 times, from 30 basis points to 260-300bp. While the brokers are still rated investment grade by the agencies, the credit markets are rating them as double-B junk. Among the underwriters, Ace has gone from 50 or 60bp to about 100bp, and even giant, AAA-rated AIG has creaked from 19bp to 33bp as of yesterday, which begins to put it in the un-god-like category.“This is having a much bigger impact on the insurance industry than the regulator's actions against the investment banks and mutual funds had on them,” says a credit-speculating hedge fund manager.The problem is that this isn't a mere spectator sport, or vehicle for hedgies to justify their two-and-twenty percentage points. There are actual insurance customers and credit market counterparties who depend on the timely payments and reliable guarantees they get from the industry.This doesn't seem to have penetrated the consciousness of the people in Spitzer's office. While they won't talk for the record about the risk of collateral damage, those close to the investigation, as the phrase goes, seem to believe that it's not their problem. If disaster occurs, then the customers and counterparties have only the brokers and underwriters to blame.If the only issue with real world problems was the allocation of blame, then this attitude would be reasonable. Then, for example, the US military need not be concerned about non-combatant Iraqis being killed by blast effects; the insurgents could be blamed for everything. However, the military does understand that collateral damage is harmful to their accomplishing their mission, so they try to minimise it.Just as the military has actual enemies, so there are actual guilty people here. The AG's office should go ahead and remove the executives responsible for the betrayal of the companies' customers, up to and including all the senior management and members of the boards of directors, and prosecute and punish those who committed criminal acts, enforce needed changes in business practices.However, the AG and his people should do all that with the interests of the customers and counterparties in mind - the public, in other words. Unlike the banks, the insurance industry doesn't have a Fed to back the liquidity and smooth functioning of the system. Analysis of the financial-economic effects of the enforcement actions, and modifying the actions on the basis of that analysis, is necessary. The idea should be to avoid the decapitalisation of companies the public depends on, while punishing the people responsible. Otherwise, the AG's office will find itself acting like someone picking up a ticking time bomb and shaking it to see if anything falls out. Not smart.■ If the US speculative community is finding entertainment value in the insurance world, so their counterparts in Europe are being offered some needed excitement by the public fight between the Hungarian government and the country's central bank.Earlier this month, some parliamentary deputies in the government's coalition introduced a proposal to change the central bank's governing law to increase the number of members on the monetary policy council from between seven and nine to between nine and eleven. This was a lot more than a mere technical change; the clear intent is to stuff the policy council with some easy-money votes. There is an election coming up in early 2006, and the less than wildly popular government would be in a better position with interest rates lower than today's short term policy rate of 10.5 per cent.Hungary is of great interest to hedge funds; it's hard to find double digit rates these days, albeit a return that could face devaluation risk.“It's too bad the government is getting into this fight with the central bank,” says one proprietary trader at a major bank. “We regard Drascovics (Tibor Drascovics, finance minister) as a safe pair of hands. But are they trying to push rates down too fast and pump up the economy with a devaluation?”I asked the minister if the deputies' law meant the government was backing off from Euro-orthodoxy, perhaps going for a devaluation and further postponement of euro-entry.“We are not considering changing the target date (2010) at all,” he replied. “That is out of the question. The real question is do we need such a strong currency to achieve inflation targets. The central bank says yes, we do need it.” As for the central bank's high interest rates, “I hope next year rates will go down fast, because inflation is going down fast.”This fight will only get more interesting, and the potential volatility greater, as the election approaches. Betting on the one month forint rate contract one year forward looks like a reasonable bet."
93;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-11-01T13:42:16Z;Lex: Credit lines;;Who do you call in a crunch? Marsh McLennan must have been on the phone to its bankers pretty sharpish, after Eliot Spitzer's bombshell hit its commercial paper programme. The bankers obliged. Not only did they waive certain clauses, allowing Marsh to keep in place crucial revolving credit lines, but they did so without making onerous demands. A modest one-off payment was required, but no step-up in the coupon on the funds that could be drawn down.However, the markets were not as helpful. The spread on Marsh credit risk in the derivatives market (credit default swaps) widened dramatically to roughly 300 basis points over Libor, compared with a pre-Spitzer level of 25-30 basis points, before settling back to about 100 basis points.This mismatch looks odd. Some might argue it is a false comparison. A credit agreement is a long-term contract, credit default swaps are market instruments. Bankers can take a longer view: they should understand their client's business inside out and may hope to win future lucrative investment banking business.Still, Marsh is clearly not the company it was pre-Spitzer, even if the markets have been talked down from panic levels. The banks are bearing extra risk without apparently getting a commensurate compensation rise. True, they have another chance in two months when the credit facility is up for renegotiation. Those terms would show just how hard-headed the banks are being about the increased risk if only they were public.
94;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-29T20:50:30Z;Wall St concludes best week since late August;;"Wall Street displayed its predilection for optimism again this week, rising hard and fast from new lows for the year and staging its best weekly showing since late August.By Friday's close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 10,027.47 while the S&P 500 index had added 0.2 per cent to 1,130.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index was flat at 1,974.99.For the five-session stretch, the Dow was 2.7 per cent higher while both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite had gained 3.1 per cent.The market managed to rack up gains for the whole month as well, even though October is one of the most feared times in market history. The S&P 500 index gained 1.4 per cent in Octobe r while the Nasdaq Composite added 4.1 per cent. The narrower Dow, however, fell 0.5 per cent, owing to specific declines in some of its 30 components.The bulk of the weekly gains came on Tuesday and Wednesday. The indices sprang higher on Tuesday amid short-term oversold conditions that caused the market to behave like a loaded spr ing, according to some traders. The apparent catalyst for the move was the news that Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney-general, would not pursue criminal charges against a leading insurance broker, thereby averting i ts possible demise and easing litigation concerns for the entire insurance sector targeted by the probe.The so-called Spitzer stocks showed Wall Street the way forward for the session. Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker in question, put on 9.3 per cent for the session while American International Group fuelled the Dow higher with its 7.5 per cent rise.In the subsequent session the indices confounded veteran traders' doubts and rose again. The strength of the upward momentum was reflected in the fact that bulls could not be bothered with a salient fact that had stymied rally attempts in previous weeks: heating oil reserves declined at what one analyst called ""the wrong time of the year"", namely when winter was set to hit the north-eastern US, where m ost homes are heated with oil.But crude futures succumbed to fierce profit-taking, losing almost 5 per cent and sending stocks into a frantic rally that no dour release of quarterly results could halt.The Dow added 1.2 per cent on Wednesday, unhindered by the 2.7 per cent decline in Procter & Gamble shares that stemmed from concerns about the profitability of the consumer goo ds conglomerate.The broad rally also overshadowed a sell-off in commodity-related stocks, notably oil companies, whose shares declined in spite of record quarterly results being reported throughout t he week.Arthur Hogan, chief US market analyst at Jefferies, attributed the move to an ""irrational"" concern that those companies' profits would decline in tandem with the oil price. He noted t hat crude prices were still higher than the levels upon which energy groups based their revenue projections.ExxonMobil shares declined 0.9 per cent on Wednesday and another 0.7 per cent in the subsequent session as it was hit by the sector-wide selling action, even as it reported shar ply rising profits.On a similar note, Amerada Hess shares declined 5.9 per cent after the company reported a 22 per cent rise in profits, while Kerr-McGee shares lost 1.2 per cent after the company reported record production levels for the quarter.Other stocks staged the same dance to a different tune later in the week, when Dow Chemical reported an 86 per cent rise in earnings only to see shares fall 2.1 per cent amid co ncerns that its growth was not sustainable.The chief concern was news that Chinese authorities tightened monetary policy for the first time in nine years, raising prospects for slower economic growth around the world, possibly d epriving US corporations of their main driver of demand.These fears also hit Alcoa shares on Thursday, contributing to their 2.9 per cent decline, as well as Phelps-Dodge, the mining group, whose stock fell 3.9 per cent even af ter it reported high growth in earnings.The market saw bright spots away from technical rallies and falling oil prices, as DreamWorks Animation shares rallied 38.4 per cent in their first day of trading on Thursday.Delta Air Lines shares surged 15.8 per cent in the same session as investors were relieved to hear the carrier reached a deal with its pilots that would at least delay, if not a void, a bankruptcy filing."
95;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-29T16:30:55Z;Bourses edge ahead helped by oil price retreat;;European equities managed a marginal advance this week, helped by a pullback in oil prices, although investors generally remained nervous about the dollar's recent weakness and next week's US election.China's unexpected decision to raise interest rates also kept a lid on the gains, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finished the week with 0.3 per cent fall on Friday to 998.13. That was a rise of 0.2 per cent over the week.A raft of third-quarter corporate earnings were generally well-received by the market, although Swiss engineering group ABB was a notable exception. Its shares fell 12.4 per cent over the week to SFr6.92 amid concerns about margins at its power technologies business.Third quarter figures from Deutsche Bank failed to rouse a generally subdued banking sector. Its shares ended 0.2 higher at €59.50 on Friday, but retained a 2 per cent gain on the week.Deutsche's net profits rose 18 per cent on the same period last year, ahead of the consensus forecast, but there was disappointment at the lack of more news on the bank's restructuring process.Germany's Metro was the main casualty in a generally subdued retail sector. Shares in the world's fourth-largest retailer fell 2.1 per cent to €37.43, after failing to match the consensus forecast for the third quarter, mainly because of a poor performance in food retailing. Over the week Metro shares were 0.8 per cent higher.Snecma, the part-privatised French aero engine-maker, and electronics group Sagem saw their shares move in opposite directions on Friday after announcing plans for a €7.3bn all-share merger.There was talk that defence group Thales, which had been seen as a potential suitor for Snecma, could eventually be included in the merged entity.Shares in both Snecma and Sagem were suspended from trading for much of Friday. The former closed at €16.70, up 3.7 per cent on the day, while the latter jumped 9.3 per cent to €71.35. Thales, meanwhile, rose 2.6 per cent to €28.27.Insurance stocks regained their balance and recorded the best weekly sectoral performance in the FTSE Eurofirst 300.The rally in the sector came after New York's attorney-general Eliot Spitzer said he would not file criminal charges against Marsh & McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, in the wake of the resignation of Jeffrey Greenberg, chairman and chief executive.Germany's Munich Re was the top performer in the sector over the week, adding 3.9 per cent to €76.68, while reinsurer Converium jumped 8.2 per cent to SFr8.90 after JP Morgan resumed coverage of the stock with an “overweight” rating. The Nordic telecoms sector provided some interest after TDC, the Danish telecoms operator, won the battle to acquire broadband group Song Networks by outbidding Swedish rival Tele2.TDC shares ended the week fractionally higher at DKr215.50, while Tele2 rose 4.2 per cent to SKr235.50. Song finished at SKr94.75.Versatel, the Dutch carrier, on Friday leapt 12.3 per cent to €1.64 amid rumours that it could now be a target for Tele2.

The capital would support the business ahead of the demutualisation in 2006, the company said.Both tranches were priced inside the original guidance, reducing borrowing costs, as yield-hungry investors placed orders worth nearly £3bn.The pricing was also boosted by the improving sentiment in the insurance sector. After a bout of volatility last week yield spreads tightened after US broker Marsh & McLennan escaped criminal prosecution on Tuesday.Standard Life sold £300m of perpetual bonds that can be bought back after 15 years and €360m of bonds that can be called after 10 years. The coupon payments will increase by 100bp in the unlikely event that the bonds are not bought back.The sterling tranche was priced to yield 170 basis points above the 8 per cent 2021 Gilt. The price tightened from the 175-180bp guidance as the order book reached £1.5bn. The euro tranche offered a spread of 127bp over the mid-swap rate, well inside the intital 135bp area guidance. Investors placed order in excess of €2bn for the bonds.Both tranches offered investors a premium versus Standard Life's outstanding bonds, due to their subordinate rank and, for the euro tranche, a longer maturity. It was the insurer's first subordinated bond issue in two years and it said it would not issue any more Tier 1 capital ahead of its demutualisation.The bonds will rank below all its outstanding debt. ""For a mutual insurer, this is as good as equity,"" said Amir Hoveyda at Merrill Lynch, which managed the sale with Barclays Capital and JP Morgan.The European Investment Bank launched a $1bn 2011 bond that was particularly targeted at Asian central banks. The issue completed EIB's global dollar issuance this year. The financing vehicle of EU infrastructure projects has issued bonds with maturities of two, three, five, seven and ten years and the new 2011 deal was one of very few liquid dollars bonds in the market, it said.Asian investors bought 78 per cent of the bonds and central banks took up 65 per cent of the orders. HSBC, JP Morgan and Nomura lead-managed the sale.Aareal Bank of Germany sold €272m of bonds in a €1.2bn synthetic securitisation that was backed by a pool of commercial property mortgages in 12 countries.The bond tranche was more than four times subscribed with more 30 investors taking part. Germany and the UK made up two-thirds of the investor base. Calyon was sole lead manager."
97;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;New issues: Insurers bounce back;;Corporate bonds bounced back from a two-month low in Europe on Tuesday, with hard-hit insurers and vehicle makers leading the modest comeback.News that Marsh McLennan, the world’s largest insurance broker, would not face a criminal prosecution boosted the insurance sector and vehicle manufacturers recovered some of last week’s losses as investors got the bad news at arm’s length.Falling oil prices also boosted equities and corporate bonds. The Iboxx corporate bond index moved slightly tighter after it widened 4 basis points to 57.5bp over the benchmark in October. The index remains 7bp tighter since the start of July but aggregate corporate yield spreads hit their widest levels since August 27 on Monday, according to data from Lehman Brothers.Spreads in the insurance sector tightened, with Munich Re 2023s narrowing by 3bp on the day and about 10bp since the widest levels last week. The yield on Zurich Financial’s 2023 issue closed 4bp tighter and 112bp/110bp over the Bund.The vehicle sector also recovered slightly after being forced sharply wider by concerns about market heavyweights Ford and General Motors in the past two weeks. Weak car sales, concerns about pension and healthcare liabilities and credit rating downgrades have weighed on sentiment following GM’s third-quarter earnings two weeks ago.On Tuesday , GM’s 2033 issue tightened 3bp to 317bp/315bp over the 30-year Bund and the 2013s narrowed 5bp to 219bp/216bp over the German government bond. The two bonds have widened by more than 35bp in the past fortnight. The Ford 2009 bond was unchanged at 173bp/168bp over Bunds.The better bid also boosted the telecoms sector. The 30-year bonds from France Telecom and Olivetti, which controls Telecom Italia, tightened by 1bp and 2bp, respectively.But despite the small resurgence in bond prices, investors appeared uncertain about the future as the US presidential election and key economic data loomed. Next week, non-farm payrolls and monthly auto sales figures will give investors an update on the state of the US economy, and its struggling vehicle manufacturing industry.“The market has no clear sense of where it is going next,” said Suki Mann, at SG CIB. “It will likely stay range-bound for the next few sessions. We are unlikely to see the tightest levels of the year again.”
98;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-26T17:05:29Z;Wall St climbs as insurance stocks get boost;;Insurers staged a rally that led Wall Street higher on Tuesday morning amid relief about a wide-reaching probe by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,853.58 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 1 per cent at 1,105.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 1,920.08.The shares of Marsh & McLennan gained 8.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company’s chief executive resigned and Mr Spitzer said he would not pursue criminal charges against the company as part of his wide-reaching probe into the practices of the insurance industry.The ripples of the news gave a lift to the other so-called Spitzer stocks of insurance groups targeted by or involved in the investigation. Shares in American International Group rose 6.4 per cent to $59.73 while ACE gained 6.6 per cent to $37.09. MetLife was 3.4 per cent higher at $36.24 as Aetna put on 4.7 per cent to $88.80.Rob Arancio, trader at Lehman Brothers, said: “A lot of the market action had to do with the relief rally in insurance stocks and decreased concerns about lawsuits there.”Mr Arancio added that there was evidence of a “healthy rotation” of capital into stocks “that have been decimated” recently, such as airlines and homebuilders.The American Stock Exchange Airline index added 3.9 per cent, powered by a 23 per cent rise to $4.65 in Delta Air Lines after JP Morgan upgraded the stock. Also higher were Alaska Air, up 2.7 per cent at $26.31, and Northwest, up 2.8 per cent at $8.50.Among homebuilders’ stocks, Pulte Homes added 5.6 per cent to $54.40 as Lennar put on 2.7 per cent to $44.97 and Centex gained 3.4 per cent to $50.39.On the opposite end of the rotation mentioned by Mr Arancio were technology stocks, which saw selling.Silicon Laboratories saw shares tumble 18.6 per cent to $$28.05 after warning its fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations, reinforcing bearish views of the semiconductor sector. Hewlett-Packard, down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 and Intel, off fractionally at $21.30 were among the few declining Dow stocks.Bucking the downward trend in technology, Nvidia rose 12.7 per cent to $15.03 after the graphics chip designer reported strong quarterly results.The relief rally in insurers and other sectors helped offset a disappointing reading of the consumer confidence index for this month, which declined more than economists had expected. The Conference Board, the business research group which released the data, said the index was 92.8, its lowest level in seven months.Economists noted the worsening in consumer expectations component of the index and attributed to rising energy costs. While Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics predicted further declines in confidence because of energy costs, Stephen Gallagher at SG Investment Banking deemed that as a “known risk” and dwelled on evidence of increased consumer spending and improving labour markets, “which are key …in the performance of financial markets”.Meanwhile the crude oil price, which had weighed on stocks, retreated after the Norwegian government acted to avoid a strike that could have disrupted production at a time when the markets are jittery about supply-demand imbalances ahead winter.As the third-quarter earnings season continued, Sara Lee, the consumer goods group, saw shares add 2.1 per cent to $22.91 after it reported higher quarterly earnings that investors appeared to dismiss owing to the effect of a fee from an asset sale. Commodity prices and other factors would have caused the company’s earnings to be flat if the fee had been excluded.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin shares were up 1.1 per cent to $54.10 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, raised its 2004 full-year estimate but guided analysts below their forecasts for next year.Halliburton, the oil services group, reported a quarterly loss owing to charges it took to provide for asbestos-related liabilities. Shares were 2.7 per cent higher at $35.28.DuPont shares edged off 2.1 per cent to $41.29 in morning trading after the chemical company swung to profitability for the quarter thanks to growing demand that offset the effects of rising energy prices.
99;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-26T17:04:55Z;Good news boosts insurance sector;;Some encouraging news in the insurance sector on Tuesday helped lift European stocks from the previous day's setback, with lower crude oil prices also supporting manufacturing sectors.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.3 per cent at 982.86.One of the best performing sectors of the day was general insurance stocks, which have suffered since news of the lawsuit filed against Marsh & McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker. Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney-general, filed the suit alleging corruption and anti-competitive activity by the company.News that Mr Spitzer does not seek to file criminal charges against Marsh & McLennan after the resignation of Jeffrey Greenberg, Marsh's chairman and chief executive, brought a surge of buying interest across the sector, and especially in reinsurers.Commenting on the latest news, analysts at Barclays Private Clients said: “If this is the case this will be good news for the sector and the companies mentioned in Spitzer's initial document in the civil case against Marsh & McLennan.”Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurance group, was the main beneficiary and its shares were up 1.8 per cent to €74.19, while Swiss Re gained 1.2 per cent at SFr73. Zurich Financial Services jumped 1.3 per cent to SFr169.10.Another winner in the sector was Dutch insurer Aegon, whose shares were among the top performers in the life sector and up 1 per cent €8.32 in spite of a statement that it does not rule out the possibility that Mr Spitzer may request information from the company as part of his investigation into the industry.In percentage terms the best of the insurance sector, but for different reasons, was Switzerland's Converium, whose shares put on 5.6 per cent to Sfr8.63 as the market registered its relief that the company's third quarter results came in better than was feared. It posted a third quarter loss of $116.3m, compared with a consensus forecast of a $144m loss and a profit of $44.3m in the same period a year ago. But the company conceded that its problems, resulting from a large shortfall in its reserves announced in July, had lost contracts worth $185m over the past few months.But Bear Stearns repeated its bearish stance on the stock “due to the uncertainty surrounding the level and quality of business that will be lost in the forthcoming 2005 renewals, the comparatively weak credit rating and the heavy restructurings facing the company”.The banks sector was buzzing with interest, most of it focused on the German banks, where Commerzbank shares came under sustained downside pressure amid widespread market rumours subsequently denied by the bank that it was preparing a profits warning. “There will be no profit warning,” the bank said.Another story doing the rounds was that Commerzbank was contemplating buying one of the Serbian banks preparing for privatisation. The third largest of the German banks said earlier in the year that it was considering acquisitions in central and eastern Europe. Commerzbank shares lost 2.2 per cent to €14.33.Top spot in the FTSE Eurofirst 300 went to Greece's OTE, the telecoms group, whose shares finished 5 per cent higher at €11.78 amid hopes that the company will restructure and after a some top-ranking brokers put their weight behind the stock.
100;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-22T21:45:40Z;Miserable week for Wall Street bulls;;The second week of the earnings season proved miserable for Wall Street bulls as stocks finished broadly lower in trading that looked like lengthy and painful surgery performed without anaesthetic.By Friday’s close the Dow Jones Industrial Average established a new low for the year as it finished 1.1 per cent lower at 9,757.81. The broader S&P500 index gave up 1 per cent to 1,1095.74. The Nasdaq Composite index eased 2 per cent yesterday to 1,915.14.For the week, the Dow industrials were 1.8 per cent lower while the S&P 500 lost 1.1 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent up for the five-session strectch.Quarterly results dominated the news agenda but to a lesser extent than in previous earnings seasons. As leading names gave a mixed-to-bad picture of profitability and outlook for the future, several other factors provided a vexing background that kept stocks confined in a narrow trading range for much of the time, one they only broke to go lower.Heading a litany of worries was the latest effort by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general, to root out alleged corporate malfeasance. Mr Spitzer a week ago announced a broad probe into the insurance industry’s practices. What began as a lawsuit against leading insurance brokers widened to cover life and health insurance companies as well. As market participants speculated on where Mr Spitzer’s inquiry would reach next, the group of companies targeted came to be known as the Spitzer stocks.By the close on Friday, Marsh & McLennan shares were 72.2 per cent lower since news of the inquiry broke last week. Among the health insurers, Aetna was 17.8 per cent off for the same time period, UnitedHealthcare had lost 3.1 per cent and Cigna gave up 17 per cent.The insurers’ plight came as crude oil prices staged yet another charge upwards after a brief spell of profit-taking as worries mounted over heating oil supplies this winter. Several leading companies reporting results cited rising prices for both oil and other raw materials as a reason for profit declines and tepid guidance going forward.Whirlpool, the home appliance maker, said steel prices undermined its efforts to meet analyst estimates and led it to cut earnings guidance for the year. In the same sector, Maytag warned of the effects of rising costs on its third-quarter earnings but its shares fared better, up 3.6 per cent on Thursday as investors appeared to focus on the success of its turnround efforts.Visteon, the auto parts maker, also cited rising steel prices and customers’ output cuts as it announced a wider loss than expected on Wednesday, sending shares 2.2 per cent lower on Thursday.Some technology stocks caused cheers while others caused jeers.IBM saw its shares add 4 per cent on Tuesday after it gave an upbeat outlook as its revenues grew 9 per cent. Texas Instruments beat analyst estimates as it announced results after the Monday close and saw shares add 6.9 per cent in the subsequent session. Ebay reported a 52 per cent rise in earnings thanks to its international businesses. The news sent shares 6.9 per cent higher on Thursday.However, after the Thursday close Microsoft poured some cold water over bullish hopes for tech as it gave a cautious outlook, sending shares 2.1 per cent lower on Friday.Amazon.com, the internet’s largest retailer, also saw its shares decline, by 10.5 per cent on Friday, after its tepid guidance overshadowed sharp earnings growth.As the earnings season continues, the run-up to the presidential elections appears to be doing nothing to bring investors into the market. As polls show the candidates locked in a dead heat, analysts are saying the stock market - a forward-pricing instrument - had nothing to price and was therefore biding its time.From a technical standpoint, some analysts noted a couple of important levels were being tested. The Dow ended the week-long flirtation with a new low for the year by establishing it yesterday, breaching below 9,800 while the S&P500 broke below 1,100 on Friday and the Nasdaq Composite closed below its 200 day moving average.Several analysts have said that a breach of these benchmarks in either direction was likely to lead to acceleration of the move in subsequent sessions.Given that all three gauges have moved to the downside of their respective technical levels, chart-reading market observers expect an acceleration of the sell-off next week. While many market watchers have expressed the view that markets stand to rally once the presidential elections are over, others doubt that will be the case given concerns about oil, the economy and geopolitics.Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, said the likeliest outcome of the elections is a gridlock betwen the White House and Congress, which has historically been a bullish factor for the stock market.Bullish analysts hope that oil prices will reverse their rise but others have pointed out that such a move could be triggered by a slowdown in economic growth, which would not be a positive for stocks.
101;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-22T16:21:43Z;London ends week lower but recovers from worst;;The FTSE 100 finished the week lower, but it could have been worse without mining shares recovering from their lows after they had fallen sharply and undermined the London equity market on worries about slowing Chinese demands for metals.Charles Goodyear, BHP Billiton’s chief executive, yesterday helped the miners after he told a shareholders’ meeting in Sydney: “We believe the demand for commodities in China is sustainable over the long-term”.London’s benchmark index was down 0.2 per cent on the week at 4,615.4, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 0.2 per cent at 6,287.2, buoyed by takeover activity, real and rumoured.Through the week Xstrata rose 0.8 per cent to 888p, BHP Billiton was off 0.6 per cent at 569p, Rio Tinto lost 0.8 per cent at £14.55, Anglo American shed 4.5 per cent to £12.03 and Antofagasta was 3.2 per cent lower at £10.35.Financial stocks had a difficult time, and not just because of the Prudential’s surprise £1bn rights issue and the shock waves from the lawsuit launched against Marsh & McLennan, the world’s biggest insurance broker, by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general.Banks were hit hard, first by concerns about the impact of the slowing housing market on their mortgage businesses, and then by a surprise rise in September retail sales that sparked talk the Bank of England could be forced to raise interest rates higher than expected to curtail consumer spending.John Butler, an economist at HSBC, said: “These retail sales figures should help to remind the Bank of England of the danger of signalling that rates have peaked.”HBOS fell 4.2 per cent through the week to 728p, and was also under pressure from Morgan Stanley, which cut its recommendation on the UK’s biggest mortgage bank from “overweight” to “equal-weight”, citing the impact of the slowing housing market.Morgan Stanley also targeted Barclays, off 1.8 per cent on the week at 542p. The investment bank reiterated its “underweight” recommendation. And while its target price was raised by 8 per cent to 520p, the investment bank stressed that the market was up 6 per cent since it set its previous target.Among the other banks Northern Rock was down 2.3 per cent through the week at 727p, Alliance & Leicester lost 2.7 per cent at 868p and Lloyds TSB was 1.1 per cent lower at 429p.HSBC slipped 1 per cent to 882½p after Citigroup advised investors to switch into Standard Chartered, up 1.6 per cent on the week at 985½p, because it is better placed to benefit from increasing business in Asia.Taylor Woodrow, down 6.2 per cent through the week at 236p, hit the banks and set the housebuilding sector on the slide by cutting its full-year house sales forecast by 6 per cent. Barratt Developments lost 3.9 per cent to 499½p, Berkeley shed 2.7 per cent at £11.85, Wilson Bowden gave up 5.1 per cent at 966p, Persimmon was 3.3 per cent weaker at 603½p and McCarthy & Stone dropped 1.6 per cent to 568p.Prudential shares went on the slide immediately it launched its one-for-six rights issue at 308p, a 33 per cent discount to Monday’s closing price. Down 11.8 per cent through the week at 392p, Prudential was subjected yesterday to rumours of a bid from HBOS, which the mortgage bank categorically denied.Jonathan Bloomer, the Pru’s chief executive, said most of the proceeds of the rights issue would be used to fund growth in the UK market. But a proportion would boost the insurer’s capital in order to comply with European rules on reserves.Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said many institutional investors would have preferred the insurer to invest more money in its successful Asian businesses. The institutions were also critical of Mr Bloomer, who lost the bid for American General in the US, failed to sell Egg, the internet bank, has presided over a cut in the dividend and attempted to push through lucrative executive pay packages in the face of shareholder opposition.The market was more generous towards Justin King, chief executive of J Sainsbury. Shares in the supermarket rose 0.1 per cent on the week to 246½p after Mr King detailed his strategy for recovery. Numis Securities raised its recommendation on the stock from “sell” to “hold”, and the general view was that Sainsbury should be given time to see would can be done to stem its decline against Tesco, off 1.7 per cent on the week at 284p.But Sir Ken Morrison, chairman of William Morrison Supermarkets, was the food retailing man of the moment. Following the accelerated conversion of Safeway stores into the core Morrisons business, the shares rose 14 per cent through the week to 220p. And the outlook is good, with like-for-like sales at the converted stores rising 13 per cent in the first 10 weeks of the second half.■ The FTSE 100 fell less than 0.1 per cent on Friday while the FTSE 250 was up 0.4 per cent. Trading volume was 2.6bn.Bid rumours swirled around EasyJet again. Shares in the budget airline rose 16 per cent to 152p on reports Air Atlanta Icelandic (which owns UK budget airline Excel Airways) or Iceland Express or Icelandair - were close to declaring a 3 per cent holding.But Iceland’s Avion, which owns Air Atlanta Icelandic, denied it had been buying shares. A spokesman said: “Neither Air Atlanta Icelandic nor any company within the Avion Group has acquired a holding in EasyJet.“ Iceland Express also said it had no stake.The speculation about Icelandic interest in EasyJet followed rumours that Ryanair planned a bid, which the Irish airline denied.Kidde, the fire protection company, jumped another 17.2 per cent to 170p after it rejected a 160p per share offer from United Technologies of the US.. Dealers pushed Kidde’s shares higher in anticipation of a bidding war. US duo Honeywell and Tyco have been mentioned as possible rivals, as well as Germany’s Siemens.EMI, the record label, shed 1.4 per cent to 217p after reports said New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer was considering reviewing the record industry’s alleged attempts to influence the content of radio stations.Rolls-Royce, the aerospace engineer, added 0.1 per cent to 256p with trading in line with expectations. And Intercontinental Hotels firmed 1.9 per cent at 676p after Morgan Stanley increased its target price from 600p to 710p. The investment bank factored in another £400m of hotel disposals and cost savings to its model.Eckoh Technologies jumped 23.9 per cent to 11p after the speech recognition technology group said it had received a takeover approach.
102;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Wall St pares losses as insurers recover;;Wall Street stocks rebounded from earlier lows on Wednesday as battered insurance stocks saw some buying alongside energy and technology shares, but downbeat earnings reports and a renewed spike in oil prices held sentiment in check.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1 per cent to 9,886.93 after it came within a whisker of establishing a new intraday low for the year. The broader S&P500 index finished flat at 1,103.66, still uncomfortably close to some analysts’ technically important level of 1,100. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 1,932.97.Crude futures rose sharply after weekly inventories data from the US government reflected a large decrease in stockpiles of distillate petroleum products, notably the heating oil much of the north-eastern US needs in the winter.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said investors saw the rise in crude prices as an opportunity to rotate money into energy stocks that are seeing to benefit from it.Kerr-McGee shares rose 2.4 per cent to $57.83 while ExxonMobil added 1.2 per cent to $48.87. The oil sector index put on 1.7 per cent.Meanwhile the “Spitzer stocks” of the insurance groups that are targeted by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, in a lawsuit, regained some of the ground lost recently. Marsh & McLennan added 3.4 per cent to $24.92 while ACE gained 2.6 per cent to $34 and UnitedHealthcare gained 5.1 per cent to $69.86.Mr Boockvar said: “It’s just some rotation and the comeback to some beat-up news, but I can’t point to any fundamental news [behind the rally], everything’s been quite negative.”He added that he was watching whether the S&P500 would hover around the 1,100 mark or not. He said it was more likely than not that the level would be broken to the downside, which could see the index retest year-lows.The onslaught of bad news and subsequent selling has led to the deterioration of the technical features in the market, according to Arthur Cashin, the veteran trader and managing director at UBS. Noting that the three stock gauges are below their 200-day moving averages, whose trends are headed downwards, Mr Cashin took inventory of several more causes for concern before urging colleagues and clients to “hold hands and look both ways”.Shares in JPMorgan Chase lost 1.9 per cent to $37.25 after the second-biggest US bank and Dow industrials component reported a sharp fall in quarterly profits, saying the costs of its merger with Bank One caused it to miss analyst expectations. Citigroup shares fell 0.7 per cent to $43.29 after it said that three of its top executives were leaving the financial services behemoth following a scandal at its private banking unit in Japan.Another Dow component that reported results was Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker. Its shares gave up 2.4 per cent to $28.30 as the company warned several upcoming expirations of patents jeopardised sales of medicines that raked in more than $5bn annually for Pfizer.Also in the pharmaceuticals sector, Wyeth shares inched up 0.1 per cent to $37.23 after the drugmaker reported a return to profitability that was better than expectations.Meanwhile Honeywell, a diversified industrial conglomerate on the Dow, reported rising quarterly profits thanks to strong sales of auto components and aerospace equipment. Shares edged off 4.6 per cent to $33.80.Strong demand for aerospace equipment helped United Technologies report a 13 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The maker of Sikorsky helicopters also narrowed its full-year forecast range. Shares edged off 0.2 per cent to $89.90.General Dynamics, a rival to some of United Technologies’ units, saw shares lose 1.7per cent to $98.40 after investors focused on its weak sales growth rather than 23 per cent rise inprofits.Shares in Motorola fell 7.8 per cent to $17.05 following quarterly results after the Tuesday close that were met with scepticism. Even though its profits more than tripled, Motorola’s sales growth appeared to disappoint investors.The Amex airline index fell 1.2 per cent by the close after three carriers offered a stark reminder of the worries afflicting the air transport sector, reporting losses due to rising fuel costs. Delta Air Lines lost 2 per cent to $2.93 as Northwest fell 2.5 per cent to $7.72 and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gave up 3 per cent to $6.49.In the consumer goods sector, Whirlpool shares fell 3.7 per cent to $57.09 after the home appliances group said earnings fell 4 per cent and cut its guidance due to a squeeze on margins from rising raw materials costs.Mr Boockvar at Miller Tabak said the news reflected the fact that market participants had been caught off-guard by the rise in commodities prices and its effect on corporate bottom lines.
103;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-20T12:34:41Z;Lex: Insurance debt;;There is nothing quite like uncertainty to generate market jitters. The insurance sector is facing such a scenario following Eliot Spitzer's suit against Marsh & McLennan last week. There are sound reasons to believe Marsh will be forced to change the way it does business. This will have an impact on its revenues and its credit profile. Whether other insurance brokers or even insurers will be affected is still little more than guesswork. Yet a heady cocktail of uncertainty has been created. Fear of Mr Spitzer has combined with anxiety over the unpredictability of legal outcomes in the US to make insurance stocks very volatile. Insurance bonds have also factored in greater risks, pushing up the cost of borrowing money in the capital markets.However, what is striking amid the furore is that bond markets are not pricing in further changes in insurance credit ratings. There is a perception that the damage from Mr Spitzer will be limited by the fact that people actually need insurance and financially sound insurance companies. Mr Spitzer's attentions come on the back of other negatives not least the high costs of claims following four recent US hurricanes. These costs have been the main driver of higher spreads on insurance bonds. Holders of insurance debt are right not to panic, but need to keep a close eye on events. There is, unfortunately, no way to insure against further Spitzer mayhem.
104;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-19T21:01:06Z;Insurance probe spooks Wall Street;;"Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, gave markets an early taste of Halloween with his broadening probe of the insurance industry.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 9,897.55 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 1 per cent to 1,103.23. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite lost 0 .7 per cent to 1,922.90.On the anniversary of the 1987 market crash, fears that worse was yet to come in Mr Spitzer's investigation of insurance brokers and health insurance groups chilled any early optimism from a falling crude oil price and encouraging results from several leading companies.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We're seeing the Spitzer effect on the insurance stocks, where the market is throwing the baby out with the bath water . Then there is the election …we don't like it being so close with two weeks to go, we're a forward pricing mechanism and we don't know what to price now.""He added that the sell-off was likely to be exaggerated and a rebound likely once markets got a clearer picture of the effects of Mr Spitzer's latest campaign against alleged corporat e malfeasance.Health insurance shares saw broad selling after one company confirmed it had received a subpoena from Mr Spitzer's office. The insurer in question, Cigna, saw shares trim 10.3 per cen t off their value to $59.73 as UnitedHealthcare lost 9.3 per cent to $66.50 while Aetna fell 11.8 per cent to $86.17.The insurance groups initially cited by Mr Spitzer continued to suffer as Marsh & McLennan was 5.8 per cent off at $24.10 while ACE lost 6.4 per cent to $33.10.The ""Spitzer effect"" trumped comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said that ""household finances appear to be in reasonably good shape"". Some bearish market wa tchers have long warned about excessive household indebtedness in the US and a possible retrenchment in consumer demand.Among the key stocks battling the downward pressures on the the market yesterday was IBM, the world's biggest computer company, which saw shares rise 4 per cent to $89.37 after it reported after the market close on Monday. Flat net profit was eclipsed by the company's optimistic outlook, as net revenue rose 9 per cent in the quarter. Excluding costs associated with a legal settlement, net profit was b etter than forecasts.Texas Instruments,which also reported after the close on Monday, beat expectations with its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $22.55.EMC shares rose 1.1 per cent to $12.28 after the data storage company reported an in-line 37 per cent rise in third-quarter profit as it gained market share.Ford Motor announced higher-than-expected quarterly profit as gains for the company's finance division offset losses at its auto unit. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook and the shares edged off 3.4 per cent to $12.93.Ford's news came after rival General Motors announced sharp cost-cutting decisions at its European operations in a bid to stem losses there. GM shares were 2.3 per cent lower at $38 on the Dow.Shares in McDonald's, another component of the blue-chip stock gauge, eased 0.7 per cent to $29 after the restaurant operator reported a 42 per cent rise in profits.Leapfrog Enterprises cut its quarterly earnings outlook and sent shares 34.1 per cent lower to $11.99 as the educational toy company cited a challenging industry environment.Boston Scientific shares lost 5.6 per cent to $35.71 as investors were disappointed by its guidance even after earnings grew amid strong demand for the group's medical devices.Economic news gave a mixed reading of the recovery in the US. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent last month, taking the annualised inflation rate in September to 2.5 per cent, but a sharp jump in lodging costs pushed core inflation up a surprise 0.3 per cent.Stephen Gallagher, the chief US economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said the data were unlikely to cause the Fed to interrupt its course of steady increases in interest rates. He added that employment trends would be more important in that process."
105;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Insurance probes set to spread;;The crackdown on corruption and bid-rigging in the US insurance industry is poised to extend across the country as state regulators follow the lead of Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney general.As shares in the leading insurance brokers fell on Tuesday, insurance commissioners in several states in the US were working to co-ordinate action. They are expected to discuss possible moves such as requiring companies to provide more disclosure on incentive commissions on a conference call on Wednesday.?All of the insurance commissioners want to get involved, especially those who have companies doing business in their states,? the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said. ?Most feel there is something they can do to monitor these companies.?Shares in Marsh & McLennan, the parent of Marsh, the broker at the centre of Mr Spitzer's lawsuit, closed down 6 per cent to $24.10 in New York, a loss of about 50 per cent since Thursday.On Tuesday, Moody's Investor Services, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on Marsh & McLennan's debt one notch to A3.Aon, the second biggest insurance broker, is under scrutiny, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, its stock fell almost 10 per cent at $19.20.Some health insurers fell on news that groups including UnumProvident, the biggest US disability insurer, Aetna and Cigna had received subpoenas related to the probe.In a research note, Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs said: ?HMOs have the least exposure relative to other insurance businesses. We believe this morning's sell-off is overdone.?The sell-off is partly being driven by fears that the widening investigation will force brokers to stop accepting incentive commissions from insurers, an important source of earnings. Other big concerns include the looming threat of legal action and settlement costs.?The prospect of losing [these commissions] is sending shock waves throughout the industry,? Barry Meiners, of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, said.Mr Spitzer's office has indicated that regulators believe commissions affect brokers' judgments. All groups might be forced to return them even if there is no evidence that individual customers were harmed, one official told the FT. In Europe, the share prices of Zurich Financial Services and Swiss Re diverged. Analysts noted the relative exposure of ZFS to the US market compared with the more limited presence of Swiss Re.Shares in Swiss Re rose 2 per cent, with ZFS shares up only 0.9 per cent.
106;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-19T18:09:00Z;Marsh to halt special deals with insurers;;Marsh, the world's biggest insurance broker, on Friday suspended accepting special commissions from favoured insurers as it sought to calm investors over charges of corruption.The suspension immediately deprived Marsh of a large part of its revenue and raised doubts about a key source of earnings for the insurance broking sector.Marsh also appointed Michael Cherkasky as chairman and chief executive to replace Ray Groves.Shares in Marsh & McLennan, Marsh's parent, fell for a second day dropping 16.21 per cent to $29.20 in New York. The stock has lost more than a third of its value, or almost $9bn in market capitalization, since Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit against Marsh, accusing the industry of corruption and anti-competitive practices. The New York attorney-general alleges Marsh duped “unsuspecting clients” by rigging bids, falsifying contracts and steering customers towards insurers paying higher commissions.Bonds issued by Marsh & McLennan were also hit, with yields leaping more than a percentage point on the company's debt. The company's 5.375 per cent bond, due in 2007, widened more than 1 percentage point to yield 1.99 points over Treasuries.Standard & Poor's, the credit ratings agency, placed Marsh & McLennan's A+ ratings on watch for a possible downgrade, noting the potential impact of a prosecution on Marsh's capital base and earnings. Moody's Investor Services, which rates Marsh & McLennan at A2, one notch below S&P, is monitoring events. Marsh & McLennan which also owns Putnam, the struggling Boston mutual fund firm, and Mercer Management Consulting has hired Robert Fisk, a former US attorney and lawyer at Davis Polk, to investigate the allegations.Jeffrey W. Greenberg, Marsh & McLennan's chairman and chief executive, said: ‘We believe it is in the best interest of our clients to suspend MSAs [contingent commissions] immediately.”Mr Cherkasky, Kroll chief executive until his move, was a mentor to Mr Spitzer when the two worked for Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan district attorney.Maurice ‘Hank’ Greenberg, AIG chairman and chief executive and Jeffrey W. Greenberg's father, said: “We are collaborating with [Mr Spitzer] and have from the beginning. We went to the insurance department as soon as we thought this needed clarification.”The issue of so-called contingent commission fees had “troubled” AIG for the past two years, he added. AIG plans to scrap the practice of paying higher commissions to brokers.No other AIG managers were aware of the rigging of business alleged at American Home, its subsidiary apart from the two American Home executives who pleaded guilty to charges this week, Mr Greenberg said. Patricia Abrams, a vice-president in the casualty division of Ace, the Bermuda insurer, last night became the third person to plead guilty to a criminal charge related to the Spitzer probe. She faces a year in prison
107;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-19T16:51:39Z;Bourses rally as insurers and IT stocks gain;;A sequence of three consecutive losing sessions on European markets was brought to a halt on Tuesday, helped by a sprinkling of bullish news from leading continental stocks.It meant the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was able to recapture the 1,000 level it lost last week and it ended the session 1 per cent higher at 1,001.78.It was not all plain sailing, however. The decline in oil and metal prices left the relevant sectors with losses, while some UK insurers reeled in the wake of the surprise £1bn rights issue from Prudential.Non-UK insurers enjoyed a much better day, however, as some of the turbulence triggered by the campaign launched by New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer against Marsh & McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, looked to have blown itself out for the time being.Swiss Re shares climbed 1.6 per cent to SFr73.50, Allianz 1.4 per cent to €81.35 and Munich Re 1.4 per cent to €73.76.Shares in OMV, one of the most popular of the oil stocks during the recent surge in oil prices, were given a rough ride, slipping 2.2 per cent to €200.50. This was after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the stock with an “underweight” tag and a €195 price target.The broker said: “We think the Petrom deal will determine OMV's relative performance in the near-term and would switch into OMV's overweight-rated peers Repsol, MOL and Norsk Hydro.Repsol shares edged up 0.1 per cent to €17.49 and Hungary's MOL climbed 2.5 per cent to Ft10870.IT and related stocks attracted strong support after bullish statements from IBM and Texas Instruments on Monday evening. Shares in STMicroelectronics, Europe's leading microchip maker, rose 2.2 per cent to €14.11 ahead of this morning's third quarter results which are expected to produce a 53 per cent increase in underlying operating profits. UBS lowered its price target for STMicro to €11 from €12.ABN Amro was the driving force behind the good performances of a handful of software and computer services stocks. Initiating coverage of the sector ABN said: “After three difficult years we believe the sector is cheaper. We suggest careful stock picking in flexibility, cost-cutting and turnaround stories, such as SAP, Atos Origin and Cap Gemini.Atos shares added 3.3 per cent at €46.07, SAP 3.2 per cent at €132 and Cap Gemini 2 per cent at €18.53.Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, was among the top performers in the FTSE Eurofirst 300, its shares advancing 4.1 per cent to €29.42, reflecting better-than-expected third quarter figures and a bullish outlook for the rest of the year.Morgan Stanley focused its attention on the central eastern European banks which it said “are simple stories with high upside potential, being geared to rising interest rates through widening margins and (they) offer potential capital restructuring without the distraction of poor Austrian fundamentals”. It described Komercni, the Czech Republic bank, as a “textbook buy and our top pick”. Hungary's OTP was the US bank's second pick. Komercni shares jumped 5.5 per cent to Kcs3133 and those of OTP 2.5 per cent to Ft4530.
108;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US insurance brokers may have to repay incentives;;All US insurance brokers could be forced to return incentive commissions they took from favoured clients even if there is no evidence that individual customers were harmed, according to the New York attorney-general's office.The practice of accepting incentive commissions could in itself be judged a potential breach of fiduciary duty and a fraudulent practice under New York state law, officials working for Eliot Spitzer said.“Brokers were poisoned by incentives,” an official said. “What our investigations have uncovered is conflicts of interest [in insurance broking] are almost impossible to overcome.”The insurance sector has been rocked by allegations of corruption by Mr Spitzer who last week filed a suit against Marsh, the world's biggest insurance broker. He claimed that Marsh duped its customers by faking and rigging bids for insurance contracts and favouring insurers that paid higher incentive commissions.Shares in Marsh's parent company, Marsh & McLennan, fell another 12 per cent on Monday to $25.57 and have lost 44 per cent since the suit's launch.Marsh said in a filing on Monday night that incentive commissions accounted for $845m in revenues last year. That figure represented about 12 per cent of total revenues of $6.9bn. State regulators have begun to crack down on incentive commissions. John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner plans to introduce regulations in the next few days that would require brokers to fully disclose commissions. Mr Garamendi intends to file separate suits against companies in the sector.“Incentive commissions should be outlawed,” Mr Garamendi said. “A broker cannot have dual obligations both to the insurance company and the consumer.”Mr Spitzer's investigation is expanding rapidly to include all lines of insurance and all types of businesses, including consultants who advise buyers of insurance. Mr Spitzer's office is also scrutinising tying, where brokers require that insurers buy reinsurance in exchange for receiving better primary insurance contracts.Mr Spitzer has not ruled out suing the insurers that paid incentive commissions, even though some such as AIG, the world's biggest insurer expressed concern to regulators about the practice two years ago. Two executives at AIG pleaded guilty last week to rigging bids. Shares in AIG closed up 3 per cent on Monday to $59.68 after losing more than 10 per cent last week.“We are looking at virtually every area of this industry and it is a very big industry …We hope there will be wide reforms in response to what we are doing,” an official said.An official at Mr Spitzer's office said though Marsh's clients may have known these incentive commissions existed, they could not possibly have known what accepting them “led to”.
109;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Lombard: Transparency needed on both sides of the Atlantic;;"Insurance industry practices under fireThere is little doubt what ought to be the Financial Services Authority's number one priority when it starts regulating general insurers on January 14: the use of “placement service agreements”.These deals are additional fees paid by underwriters to insurance brokers, over and above normal commissions, depending on the volume and profitability of the business placed. They are at the heart of the lawsuit launched last week by Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney-general, against broker Marsh & McLennan, and they are a feature of the London market as of the US.On the face it, they involve a basic conflict of interest: the broker has an incentive to place business with the underwriter offering the best PSAs, rather than the best deal for the client of the broker seeking insurance. And the danger of such conflicts will be doubly acute if - as often appears to be the case - the client has no knowledge of the commission being paid to his agent by the underwriter.Not all London brokers condone the practice. For example, BPL Global takes the view that it does not sit comfortably with its representation of clients.Whatever view the FSA comes to, the future of PSAs on both sides of the Atlantic must be in doubt now Mr Spitzer has cast such a spotlight on them. At the very least, this should be a spur to much greater, and needed, insurance industry transparency.A rather separate question is whether the London industry has engaged in the kind of disreputable practices alleged by Mr Spitzer in the US: the use of “phantom bidders” to inflate the price clients paid for insurance.The FSA has repeatedly found itself following up Mr Spitzer's actions with investigations of the London market: into analysts' conflicts of interests; into “spinning” - allocating shares in hot flotations to executives in the hope of landing business - and into market timing by mutual funds.On each occasion the London market has come through relatively clean. We must hope the same is true here.Humpty Dumpty“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty says in Alice Through the Looking Glass, “it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.”There are parallels between Humpty Dumpty and the actuarial profession, which enjoys great flexibility in establishing the actuarial valuations of defined benefit pension schemes and the words it uses to describe them.The Penrose report on Equitable Life highlighted how the self-governing profession's standards left too much open to the exercise of judgment by individual actuaries.Now comes a paper by partners at two of the UK's biggest practices, Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, which strongly criticises the language used to describe the status of schemes.The paper, to be presented next week to the Institute of Actuaries, argues that the methodology by which the profession sets schemes' funding targets is obscure and opaque and may contain an element of self-delusion.Guidance notes allow actuaries to claim schemes are “fully funded” - using phrases such as “100 per cent funded on an ongoing basis” - when they do not have enough money to meet their benefits with any degree of certainty.The paper also homes in on what many have long suspected but few have said - at least within the profession: “There is a natural tendency for clients to want low contribution rates and to present a positive picture to members. This creates commercial competition between advisers, leading inevitably to strong pressures towards weaker actuarial bases and methods.”Coincidentally, the degree of flexibility open to schemes is underlined this week in a new paper on J Sainsbury's fund from John Ralfe, the consultant who played a major role in the seminal move into bonds by the Boots scheme. He points out that the scheme has abandoned plans to match the bond-like liabilities of its growing number of current pensioners, electing instead to keep an asset mix of 58 per cent equities and 42 per cent bonds. But the nature of actuarial calculations allows the company to reduce its pension contributions, even though the investment strategy is riskier.All this underscores that the profession is badly in need of much clearer and tighter standards. And at last it seems to be getting that message.It has a task force working to establish an independent Actuarial Accounting Standards Board, and Michael Pomery, the Institute's president, has accepted the profession has not been sufficientlomby ocfully funded” and “solvent”. Meanwhile, a post-Penrose government review of the profession under Sir Derek Morris may propose significant changes of its own. But there is a long way to go before the days of the “actuary as alchemist” - to use Mr Ralfe's phrase - or as Humpty Dumpty are over.martin.dickson@ft.com"
110;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-17T22:33:53Z;The question is: Just how mutual, just how beneficial?;;When Jeffrey Greenberg was named chief executive of insurance broker Marsh & McLennan in January 1999, he said of American International Group, the insurance company led by his father, Hank: “I don't think there's the slightest conflict of interest. AIG gets business from Marsh and we depend on AIG to provide insurance for our clients. It's a very mutually beneficial relationship.”Just how beneficial, and in what way, is the focus of a new investigation by Eliot Spitzer, New York's aggressive attorney-general. His move against AIG and three other insurance companies was a long time coming. One of the key elements of Mr Spitzer's allegations the payment of contingent fees (payments to brokers by underwriters such as AIG) was first raised in 1998. Marsh's $2bn purchase of Sedgwick, its UK rival, in September 1998 was a catalyst for customer complaints about the growing dominance of Marsh and Aon. The customers said the consolidation of the industry gave brokers the chance to extract ever higher customer commissions, while receiving payments from underwriters. This raised questions of independence.A Marsh spokeswoman at the time said complaints by customers about contingent fees were nothing new, although Hank Greenberg, the AIG chief, said: “We feel these are real issues that do raise some concerns.”Marsh, which has been a highly profitable company over the years, was locked in a struggle for dominance with Aon that saw both make several high-cost acquisitions in a few years. The Sedgwick purchase came while Marsh was still digesting its purchase of another broker, Johnson & Higgins. It tried to buyLondon-based Benfield group, another broker, in 2002, but failed to agree a price.This July it bought Kroll, the security firm, for $1.9bn a big outlay that resulted in its counterparty credit rating being downgraded to AA from A+.As it continued its expansion, Marsh continued to defend the practice of contingent fees. In June several of its senior executives at the World Insurance Forum said a broker did not create a conflict of interest by helping a customer buy insurance while simultaneously acting as an intermediary paid by an underwriter.This latest probe means all three of Marsh's businesses are under regulatory scrutiny. The group also owns Putnam, the fifth-largest fund management company in the US. A year ago it fell foul of another big Spitzer investigation into the market timing of mutual fund shares.Market timing was, similarly, a somewhat questionable industry practice that was known about for years. It turned out to be more widespread than believed, and to have the tolerance or even full co-operation of some fund executives despite public claims that they discouraged it.Putnam's chief executive, Lawrence Lasser, was fired following Mr Spitzer's claims, and the company paid $110m to settle regulators' allegations that it had allowed short-term traders to arbitrage its mutual fund shares at the expense of long-term investors. Putnam has since lost one-quarter of its assets as investors pulled out more than $60bn. New chief Ed Haldeman has worked to regain investors' trust, but money has continued to drain away, mostly going to rivals.Marsh's third arm, Mercer Consulting, is also under scrutiny. The SEC last December began an inquiry into conflicts of interest by pension consultants such as Mercer, which last year contributed 22 per cent of Marsh's profit. The inquiry centres on how the consultants decide which money managers to recommend to pension funds.
111;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-17T22:17:17Z;Eliot Spitzer goes after his biggest fish yet;;When Eliot Spitzer said his lawsuit against Marsh & McLennan was “day one” of a wide-ranging investigation into corrupt practices in the US insurance industry, there was every reason to believe him.In his previous campaigns, against tainted equity research on Wall Street and questionable trading practices in the mutual fund industry, the New York attorney-general focused on building a strong case against one high-profile target. Each time, early success mobilised public opinion in his favour and forced other parties to co-operate.The 2002 stock research case began with a court order against Merrill Lynch. Last year's mutual fund investigation was launched after a hedge fund settled for improper trading with Bank of America.Now Mr Spitzer appears to be using the same method against the insurers. “It does have the hallmarks of the way Spitzer brings cases,” says Steven Kobre, of Kobre & Kim, a law firm, and a former assistant US attorney for the southern district of New York. “If you bring down the big fish, no one feels safe and everyone will try to fall in line.”This time, the fish could hardly be bigger. Jeffrey Greenberg, chief executive of Marsh & McLennan, is a member of one of corporate America's most successful dynasties. Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, his septuagenarian father, is chief executive of American International Group. Evan Greenberg, his brother, is chief executive of Bermuda-based Ace. AIG and Ace were named in the suit, which alleges systematic rigging of bidding contracts for large insurance policies.However, it is not just the high-profile target that makes the latest action “classic” Spitzer. The citation of personal e-mails, which he did widely throughout the stock research case and in last week's complaint, is another trademark. “It is becoming signature that he's looking to what was previously thought as confidential correspondence to corroborate any verbal storytelling,” says Mr Kobre.The tone of the initial press conference, laced with insinuations that the findings may only be the tip of the iceberg in an ocean of illegality, is also familiar.On April 8 2002, the day he unveiled the court order against Merrill Lynch for its tainted stock research, Mr Spitzer spoke of a “first small step” and called for “significant structural change” across the investment banking industry.On September 3 last year he used similar language to unveil a $40m settlement with Canary Capital, a hedge fund involved in improper mutual fund trading.Last Thursday Mr Spitzer said: “The insurance industry needs to take a long, hard look at itself. If the practices identified in our suit are as widespread as they appear to be, then the industry's fundamental business model needs major corrective action and reform.”Such pronouncements come close to self-fulfilling. Industry participants rush to co-operate, sometimes settle, and implement reforms. “It's effective,” says one corporate lawyer. “The second, third and fourth on the list will want to get it over with as fast as possible.”
112;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-15T20:25:54Z;Wall Street under siege from all directions;;"Wall Street saw ever fewer reasons to be cheerful this week and subsequently fell amid a seemingly relentless stream of negative news.From third-quarter corporate earnings reports to economic data that reinforced labour market weakness and a balloning trade deficit, downbeat news drowned out the occasional positive signal.By the close on Friday, the Dow was 1.2 per cent off on the week as the S&P 500 gave up 1.3 per cent and the Nasdaq eased 0.4 per cent.But the market had some respite on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent up at 9,933.38, while the broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,108.20 and the Nas daq Composite advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,911.50.The ripples of a disappointing jobs report the previous week came home to roost on Tuesday when traders, who were off for the Columbus Day public holiday on Monday, returned to work.In addition, earlier reports of drastic cost cuts by General Motors were only assimilated on Thursday when the world's biggest carmaker saw its shares lose 5.9 per cent after its earn ings missed expectations.American International Group compounded the pressure on the Dow as it lost 10.4 per cent in the same session following a lawsuit against it and other leading insurers from Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, who accused the industry of corrupt practices. Marsh & McLennan,the main target of the lawsuit, saw its shares tumble 24.4 per cent for the session and the sell-off resumed on Fri day.As if crude oil's inexorable march upwards had not been sufficient to chase the bulls to the sidelines, metals contracts lost their footing midweek. Traders could not fully explain it but metals-related stocks moved sharply lower.Phelps-Dodge,the copper mining company, lost 9.4 per cent on Wednesday and US Steel lost 4.8 per cent. The Morgan Stanley index of commodity-related stocks lost 2.8 per cent for the session.Crude oil futures, after briefly giving in to aggressive profit-taking early in the week, rebounded and hit the $55 per barrel mark on Friday amid worries about heating oil suppli es with winter approaching.Oil and stock traders appeared to find little solace from a speech by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, about the effects of the oil price on the economy. The Fed chief, w ho has previously admitted that rising energy costs were slowing the economy, downplayed their effect relative to the 1970s oil crisis.However, he cautioned: ""The risk of more serious negative consequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher."" Shortly after the speech, crude contracts eased o ff previous highs but were still near $55 per barrel.Market watchers grew increasingly nervous about the outcome of the presidential election, with polls continuing to point to a dead heat with only three weeks to polling day.Dennis Gartman, a long time market observer and editor of The Gartman Letter, raised the prospect of a repeat of the last election when the result was delayed by recounts and lawsuits . He cited fears that ""we shall be subjected to dozens, if not hundreds, [of] re-counts that shall keep the election in limbo for weeks …perhaps months"".Amid the flurry of downbeat news, the positive earnings of a handful of technology companies garnered limited attention while negative reports from the sector countered optimism.Intel saw its shares rise 3.5 per cent on Wednesday, a day after it encouraged the market with in-line revenues. While some technology experts cautioned high inventories were ho unding the sector, another trader said Intel appeared to be in control of that problem.Novellus Systems appeared to validate concerns about high inventories as it warned of slowing demand for its chip manufacturing equipment. The news sent the stock 8.9 per cent l ower on Thursday. In the same session Apple Computer shares rose 13.2 per cent after the company reported sharply rising revenues due to strong sales of its popular iPod player."
113;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-15T12:30:57Z;Lex: European insurance;;First came hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. Now European insurers are reeling from the Spitzer typhoon. The investigation into Marsh & McLennan by Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney-general, on Friday triggered a sell-off in European non-life insurance shares hitting both those with and without extensive US exposure. This seems an over-reaction. Munich Re is the only European company named as a colluder in Mr Spitzer's suit, via a US subsidiary. Zurich Financial Services is also mentioned in his report but as an innocent bystander. And while companies such as Benfield have been subpoenaed, they are not subject to any formal inquiry.However, what has unnerved the sector is that it is difficult to predict the path of US regulatory inquiries particularly with Mr Spitzer in charge. MMC is a broker and has dealings with numerous European and US companies, making it hard to exclude any names from investigation risk. Moreover, the investigation comes amid other woes. Collectively, the four recent US hurricanes and a Japanese typhoon have produced insured industry losses estimated at $20m to $40m. That makes the third quarter the second worst for catastrophe losses ever recorded, only exceeded by 9/11. Insurance companies claim to have weathered this well. They may be right. However, the risk remains that the next set of results could produce nasty surprises even before the Spitzer typhoon does its worst.
114;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-14T23:24:20Z;Suit offers up e-mails as evidence;;Marsh, the world’s largest insurance broker, was at the centre of a systematic scheme to rig contracts to benefit its favourite insurance providers, according to the complaint filed on Thursday by Eliot Spitzer.In 27 pages, New York’s attorney-general outlines how the elaborate system, which he alleges defrauded Marsh’s clients of hundreds of millions of dollars, was implemented by Marsh and a number of the sector’s giants, including American International Group.In one instance, in October 2003, Marsh asked AIG to bid for an insurance deal at $900,000 in order to allow Zurich, a rival, to win the renewal of its contract with a $750,000 offer.“This was not a real opportunity. Incumbent Zurich did what they needed to do at renewal. We were there just in case they defaulted. Broker …said Zurich came in around $750K wanted us to quote around $900K,” an AIG underwriter wrote in an undated e-mail.AIG would have been glad to forego the business because it knew that the scheme - enforced by William Gilman, executive director of marketing at Marsh Global Broking - would favour it in other situations.“Gilman likewise advised AIG of the benefits of the system. As he put it: Marsh ‘protected AIG’s ass’ when it was the incumbent carrier, and it expected AIG to help Marsh ’protect’ other incumbents,” the complaint reads.For example, when bidding for the casualty insurance of Fortune Brands, a company selling home, office, golf and wine products, AIG was directly competing with ACE, the Bermuda-based insurance group.On December 17 2002, the bidding war came to a head when ACE submitted a bid for the business at $990,000. Later that day, the offer was mysteriously revised to $1.1m, prompting ACE to lose the policy in favour of AIG.The next day, an ACE employee offered this explanation of the losing bid to a colleague: “We were more competitive than AIG in price and terms. [Marsh] requested we increase premium to $1.1m to be less competitive, so AIG does not loose the business”.The scheme did not only involve the placing of non-competitive bids. It also meant insurance company officials were sometimes asked to attend client presentations merely to give the impression of a competitive bidding process.“Throughout 2001 …Marsh asked Munich to attend presentations for prospective clients with whom Munich was already out of the running,” the complaint alleges, adding: “One Munich regional manager characterised these presentations as mere ‘drive-bys’.”By rigging the bidding process, the complaint alleges that Marsh and the insurance companies would both end up getting what they wanted. Marsh could preserve the lucrative “contingent commission agreements“ with insurers that account for an estimated $800m of its revenues, and insurance companies had a predictable system allowing them not to overpay for contracts.The victims were mostly to be found among Marsh’s clients. One of them listed in the complaint is the County School District of Greenville, South Carolina, which contracted an $800m renovation project to Institutional Resources, a procurement group. Institutional Resources paid about a $1.5m fee to Marsh to provide it with the best insurance coverage for the project. The deal was eventually awarded to Zurich, which was in the midst of negotiating “contingent commission agreements” with Marsh.According to the complaint, the Zurich bid was declared victorious after Marsh deliberately submitted a losing bid on behalf of CNA, a rival insurer. The bid had never been authorised by CNA.Although the system appeared to favour all the parties involved, except for Marsh’s clients, there was some resistance to it.In preparation for an April 2001 meeting with Marsh, a Munich executive asked employees for reactions on their dealings with the insurance broker.Some of the comments, listed on page 24 of the complaint, are scathing: “This idea of ’throwing the quote’ by quoting artificially high numbers in some predetermined arrangement for us to lose is repugnant to me, not so much because I hate to lose, but because it is basically dishonest. And I basically agree with the comments of others that it comes awfully close to price-fixing,” said one.Meanwhile, however, Mr Spitzer claims Marsh employees were being rewarded and promoted for doing essentially that.
115;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2004-10-14T23:11:03Z;Spitzer aims at MarshMac once again;;Marsh & McLennan suffered a staggering blow on Thursday as its shares slumped 25 per cent on news that its insurance brokers were allegedly cheating customers and stifling competition.Eliot Spitzer has taken aim at the blue-chip financial services group a number of times over the past year.Putnam, the Boston mutual fund firm MarshMac controls, was one of the first companies Mr Spitzer brought charges against in his investigation into abuses in the mutual fund industry.In the wake of the charges, Putnam lost billions of dollars in assets and has been struggling to keep customers since.When the scandal at the NYSE erupted over ex-chairman Richard Grasso’s pay package earlier this year, Mercer Human Resources Consulting, another MarshMac subsidiary, took a hit when it was required by Mr Spitzer to return the $440,275 it charged the exchange to help compute Mr Grasso’s pay package.But it is Thursday’s lawsuit by Mr Spitzer against Marsh, the group’s broking unit, which could have the biggest impact on MarshMac’s fortunes.In industry circles, the fact that some insurers pay so-called contingent commissions to brokers is well-known, analysts say. They vary according to how much business the broker’s clients place with the insurer, how profitable that business is and whether its clients renew their policies.But a less well-known fact is how much money these payments represent to brokers.Last year, the ones called into question by Mr Spitzer accounted for $800m, or more than one-third of net income for Marsh, according to the complaint.Earlier this year on a call with analysts, Jeff Greenberg, MarshMac’s chairman and chief executive, brushed off questions about these commissions, saying they were part of the group’s business model. “We don’t break out contingent commissions,” Mr Greenberg told them.The repercussions for MarshMac and the industry are likely to be huge, analysts say. Shares in Aon and Willis, the two other biggest insurance brokers, which have received subpoenas from regulators about this investigation, also slumped sharply on Thursday’s news.“The magnitude of the allegations is taking everyone by surprise,” says Bob Hartwig, chief economist of The Insurance Institute. “This revelation that there could have been illegal activity is a tremendously big deal.”MarshMac made a bold move into new business in May by acquiring Kroll, the established provider of corporate security and investigation services, for $1.9bn in cash.At the time, Marsh was looking for growth opportunities. It came under criticism for paying too much for Kroll.
116;MMC;Marsh & Mclennan Companies;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
