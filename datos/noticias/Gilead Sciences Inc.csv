0;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Hints of progress on virus drugs trigger sharp market moves;The whipsawing after economies locked down begins again as hopes rise of cities reopening;For financial markets already whipsawed by shutdowns that collapsed the global economy, a new reason for jitters has emerged — the dim prospect that economies could reopen thanks to treatments for Covid-19.But analysts warn that investors risk latching on to fragmented data, sending shares sharply higher on what would normally be seen as inconclusive or ambiguous disclosures. On Friday a trade publication report that Gilead Science’s remdesivir drug was performing well on a handful of seriously ill Covid-19 patients at the University of Chicago Medicine sent shares up as much as 11 per cent — even though it was not part of randomised controlled study.And it is not just therapies that are proving irresistible. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, said on Friday that it was launching an antibody test that would help health professionals test whether people have had the virus or not. Shares in Switzerland-listed Roche rose 2 per cent to SFr324.8. “The latest surge for stocks shows just how keen the market is to react to any piece of good news amid the current crisis,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The Gilead price surge came after video footage leaked to industry publication Stat news in which an infectious disease specialist running the trial said many patients taking the antiviral were recovering and being discharged quickly.The news buoyed the S&P 500, which closed up 2.7 per cent, as investors look for signs that better treatment options could embolden governments to open up locked-down economies. But Gilead and the University of Chicago Medicine both cautioned that the data were incomplete and the trial’s full results were needed before drawing conclusions. Umer Raffat, a biotech analyst at Evercore, noted that without a control group, the remdesivir trial should be viewed with a sceptical eye rather than a “silver bullet”. Still the news sent Gilead shares 9.7 per cent higher by the close in New York. “This seems a generous amount of credit for a product that the company has specifically stipulated will not be sold for a profit,” said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVBLeerink, who estimated that hopes for remdesivir had already been responsible for adding $15bn in market cap to Gilead, even before Friday’s gains.“Investors may be discounting that commentary, or simply looking to buy any positive Covid news,” he added. Roche’s Elecsys serology test will be available in early May in Europe and other countries that accept the CE mark accreditation. Roche is applying for an emergency authorisation from the US regulator. Abbott Labs and BD, both based in the US, have already launched antibody tests.The US government also expanded its commitment to creating drugs and vaccines to tackle coronavirus, with the National Institute of Health launching a public-private partnership, working with 16 pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The group will work to prioritise the right vaccines and drugs, streamline clinical trials and co-ordinate on regulation. Francis S Collins, director of the NIH, said: “Now is the time to come together with unassailable objectivity to swiftly advance the development of the most promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates that can help end the Covid-19 global pandemic.”Additional reporting by Clive Cookson in London
1;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Gilead’s coronavirus drug: why experts are cautious on its prospects;US shares rise after leaked report enthused about benefits of remdesivir in 125 Covid-19 patients;"Of all the drugs being tested to fight the new coronavirus, people have invested most hope in remdesivir. A leaked report on Thursday night of positive results from a clinical trial of remdesivir in Chicago caused shares in its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, to rise 14 per cent in after-hours trading and sparked an overall market rally in Asia and Europe.Remdesivir emerged from a collaboration to find antiviral drugs during the west African Ebola epidemic of 2013-16 that involved Gilead, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It works by jamming the molecular machinery that some viruses use to build their genes as they replicate.Clinical trials against Ebola virus first in west Africa and then in the Democratic Republic of Congo gave promising results but those outbreaks fizzled out before remdesivir had been fully evaluated to the satisfaction of medical regulators. It remains an unlicensed medicine everywhere.Pharmacologists who surveyed existing drugs for possible effectiveness against Covid-19 when the pandemic started immediately saw potential in remdesivir, because the new coronavirus shares important features in common with Ebola. Both viruses carry their genes in a single strand of RNA, a sister molecule to the DNA that makes up animal and plant genomes.Since January, scientists in several parts of the world have been carrying out clinical trials with Covid-19 patients, starting in China, but none has yet given unequivocal evidence of efficacy.The overnight excitement over the trial at University of Chicago Medicine does not come from any official disclosure of results but from a video leaked to Stat, a healthcare publication. Kathleen Mullane, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, enthused to medical colleagues about the benefits of daily infusions of remdesivir in 125 Covid-19 patients. Dr Mullane said the patients, most of whom were severely ill, experienced rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms; nearly all were discharged in less than a week, according to Stat. She has confirmed that the video is genuine but declined to comment further.Both Gilead and the hospital urged caution. “Information from an internal forum for research colleagues concerning work in progress was released without authorisation,” said University of Chicago Medicine. “Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”Almost everything. Even if the positive findings from Chicago are confirmed when they are officially released, probably later this month, sceptics will point out that it is what researchers call an “open label trial” in which everyone knows that remdesivir is being infused. The progression of Covid-19 is variable and unpredictable — and the positive results might have been good luck.Statistically valid evidence will come from the large “randomised controlled studies” that Gilead is carrying out with medical collaborators around the world. In these trials, patients are divided at random into two groups, one receiving remdesivir and the other a placebo that looks the same but contains inactive ingredients. The studies are double-blind, meaning trial investigators and participants would not know who is receiving remdesivir or placebo.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Even if remdesivir gives positive results in these controlled trials, questions will remain about whether Gilead can produce enough remdesivir to satisfy what would be a huge demand worldwide. The University of Oxford wanted to include remdesivir in its current large clinical trial to test the efficacy of existing drugs against Covid-19 but was unable to obtain sufficient quantities.With the pharmaceutical world devoting immense resources to the battle against coronavirus, more than 100 potential Covid-19 medicines are in various stages of testing.Remdesivir is among the most promising candidates in the antiviral category, which attack coronavirus directly. These are likely to be particularly effective in the early stages of the disease, when the virus is replicating rapidly and symptoms beginning to emerge.A second category of drug aims to damp down the excessive immune response and inflammation that can damage the lungs and other vital organs in patients with more advanced severe disease. Medicines developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disorders are being tested against Covid-19."
2;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Gilead drug boosts investor hopes for coronavirus treatment;Early impressions from US study show severely ill patients in clinical trial recovering quickly;"Wall Street shares are on track for a higher opening on Friday after a report suggested a coronavirus drug developed by Gilead Sciences had shown positive results in a clinical trial, giving investors hope that a treatment could ease the pandemic and open up the global economy. Early impressions from a study at the University of Chicago Medicine were reported by Stat news, a healthcare industry publication, showing rapid recoveries in almost all of the more than a hundred severely ill patients.Shares in Gilead, which have risen 17 per cent already this year, jumped as much as 14 per cent in after-hours trading.This helped spur a 3 per cent gain in futures contracts linked to the S&P 500 index on Friday and underpinned a rally in Asian shares despite a historic contraction in China’s economy. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index gained 2.9 per cent and London’s FTSE was up 3.2 per cent.In a video presentation to her academic colleagues, a copy of which was obtained by Stat, Kathleen Mullane, an infectious disease specialist who is leading the trials at the university hospital, said: “The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish.” The trial for the most seriously ill patients does not include a control group, which is given a placebo. So, Dr Mullane said, it was hard to draw too many conclusions. But she said that after starting the drug, many patients saw their fevers reduced quickly, some came off ventilators the next day and most did not need the full course of 10 days. Some Biotech analysts on Wall Street have warned against overreacting to news of a potential treatment.In a statement after its shares leapt, Gilead also urged caution. “We understand the urgent need for a Covid-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. The totality of the data need to be analysed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial,” it said.“Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19. We expect the data from our phase 3 study in patients with severe Covid-19 infection to be available at the end of this month, and additional data from other studies to become available in May.”The University of Chicago Medicine added that the partial data were by definition incomplete. “In this case, information from an internal forum for research colleagues concerning work in progress was released without authorisation,” it said. “Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.” Experts had high hopes for remdesivir because it had shown it was effective in stopping the Ebola virus replicating. Ebola shares a similar mechanism of replication with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease.Jefferies equity analysts said the excitement was ""overdone in the near term"", and highlighted that the findings do not come from the later stages of clinical research. “We appreciate that the broader market is in a risk-on and glass-half-full environment and investors are looking for a good story,” the analysts said.Last week a small study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed 68 per cent of patients, who had been given the drug on a “compassionate use” basis, improved after taking it. However, the drug has not been approved to treat any disease and scientists are waiting for the results of large trials with control arms for proof that it works and that the benefits outweigh any risks of side effects. Umer Raffat, a biotech analyst at Evercore, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” about remdesivir but warned it was not a “silver bullet”.He said it was important to note that none of the patients on the Chicago trial had been on invasive ventilation, which tends to be an indication of a more serious condition and worse outcomes. Investors have been anxious for news of potential treatments for Covid-19 in the hope that reducing risks to those who catch it could lead to public officials more quickly opening up economies, which have been put into deep freeze to stop the spread of the virus.Jim Tierney, the chief investment officer of AllianceBernstein’s concentrated US growth strategy, said stocks were moving on the report, given financial markets had been closely tied to the virus’s spread and signs of its containment. “Right now the best solution is time and isolation, but if you actually have a vaccine and a treatment it’s a big thing. It is enough to move the market,” he said. “The world is looking for a solution and doesn’t want to be in the state we’re in.”"
3;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Gilead drug shows positive signs in early coronavirus testing;Antiviral treatment helps two-thirds of patients in New England Journal of Medicine study;Gilead’s remdesivir drug has shown early positive signs that it might be effective in treating coronavirus, in a study of patients who have taken it on a compassionate use basis. The New England Journal of Medicine published a small study analysing data from 53 patients, which found that about 68 per cent improved after being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral that some experts hope could stop the Sars-CoV-2 virus from replicating. The drug was originally developed for Ebola, but has never been approved.But the study did not have a control arm, so the results cannot be compared against patients who did not receive the drug, and should not be treated as conclusive. Large randomised control trials evaluating the drug — and others — are underway across the world. Jonathan Grien, the epidemiologist who was the lead author of the journal article, said they cannot draw “definitive conclusions from these data, but the observations from this group of hospitalised patients who received remdesivir are hopeful”. The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Remdesivir is one of the most prominent of the many drugs being explored for treating Covid-19 patients. Other antivirals include HIV drugs developed by AbbVie and a flu treatment from Fujifilm. Many trials are also testing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, antimalarials, as well as anti-inflammatories to help calm the body’s immune response if it goes into overdrive in the latter stages of the disease. The NEJM study, which took in data from patients in the US, Europe and Japan, found no new safety issues, other than those already reported, which include kidney and liver problems. Without a randomised trial it is hard to tell if those problems are complications of the disease or caused by the drug. Scientists are researching whether the drug may work better if it is delivered during the early stages of the disease. In this study, the patients were already hospitalised when they were given the drug and more than half were receiving ventilation. Patients who did not improve were more likely to be on invasive ventilation and 70-years-old or over.Gilead, the California-based biotech company that developed the drug, funded the study. The company initially applied for “orphan status” for the drug, designed to expand intellectual property protection to drugs for rare diseases, but has since rescinded the status. Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer at Gilead, said the outcomes were “encouraging” but the data are “limited”. “Gilead has multiple clinical trials underway for remdesivir with initial data expected in the coming weeks,” he said. “Our goal is to add to the growing body of evidence as quickly as possible to more fully evaluate the potential of remdesivir and, if appropriate, support broader use of this investigational drug.”
4;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Covid-19 drugs could be made for $1 per day, say academics;Study argues prices for potential treatments are far higher than the actual cost of production;Existing drugs with the potential to treat coronavirus could be produced and sold at a profit by pharmaceutical companies for $1 a day or less, according to academics.Liverpool University’s Andrew Hill and others argue in a new paper that current market prices for an array of potential treatments for Covid-19 are much higher than costs of production, particularly in the US.No treatment has yet been shown to work against the novel coronavirus and none has been officially approved by regulators for Covid-19, but some doctors are giving them to patients for compassionate use. Remdesivir, an antiviral initially devised by Gilead Sciences for Ebola that is in several Covid-19 trials, could be mass produced for $9 per treatment course, according to the paper in the Journal of Virus Eradication.The paper estimates minimum costs of production by considering the costs of pharmaceutical ingredients, packaging and other items. On top of that, it assumes that drugmakers will achieve profit margins of 10 per cent.Dr Hill, a senior visiting research fellow at Liverpool’s department of translational medicine, said: “The main treatments being evaluated for coronavirus could be mass produced for $1 per day or less.”“At these low prices, anyone needing treatment for coronavirus, in any country, should be able to access the treatment they need,” he noted. “We urgently need worldwide access to effective antiviral treatments for coronavirus to hold back the epidemic for the next 18 months until a vaccine can be produced.”Gilead disagreed with the findings of the study, saying they “do not accurately reflect the true cost of manufacturing remdesivir at scale”.It is currently providing all its current remdesivir supply for trials, compassionate use and an expanded access programme at no cost, it said.Drugmakers say they need high profit margins to reward the high risks involved in investigating molecules and bringing them to market. Critics say high prices can prevent universal access to vital medicines.Most of the drugs currently being investigated for the coronavirus are aimed at stemming the replication of the virus or stopping the body’s immune system going into overdrive as it attacks the disease — a dangerous phenomenon known as a cytokine storm.Another contender is the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir combination, a Hepatitis C treatment partially made with a Gilead molecule. The academics said it is on sale for $18,610 per treatment course in the US, and for $6 in Pakistan. They calculate that it would cost $5 to produce a course of the medicine — or 39 cents a day.Hydroxychloroquine, a drug US President Donald Trump has been promoting as a treatment despite a lack of evidence, has a list price of $19 per course in China and $2 per course in India, but could be sold at a profit for just $1 per course, according to the paper.A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, known as Kaletra, retails for $503 in the US. The academics estimated its cost price at $4 per course instead. AbbVie has dropped the global patent protection for the drug, which is a relatively mature one, paving the way for cheaper generics.Pirfenidone, a Roche drug used to treat pulmonary fibrosis that is currently being investigated for the new coronavirus, sells for $9,606 per course in the US, but could be sold at a profit for just $31, or $1.09 a day.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Dr Hill said that makers of generic copies of drugs for which patents have expired had already mass produced drugs to treat HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria and achieved profit margins of 10 per cent.“It is time to repeat these success stories for coronavirus, but this time much more quickly,” he said.Prices in Europe are typically much lower than in the US, partly because national health services can negotiate bulk discounts with manufacturers.Pressure is already building on companies to relinquish their patents on some of these drugs. 
5;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Gilead asks to rescind special status for potential coronavirus drug;Drugmaker had come under fire for ‘orphan’ ranking that conferred pricing and tax benefits ;Gilead Sciences has asked US regulators to rescind “orphan drug” status for its potential coronavirus treatment, after it was criticised by activists for abusing a process reserved for medicines for rare diseases. The company’s unusual U-turn on its potential coronavirus candidate Remdesivir comes just two days after Gilead disclosed it had been granted the status by the US Food and Drug Administration. The drugmaker said on Wednesday that it was waiving all benefits of the status — which include significant tax incentives and control over prices for at least seven years in a de facto monopoly.On Tuesday the Financial Times reported that activists had slammed the designation, calling it “morbid calculus” in the face of a rapidly-spreading pandemic. Orphan drugs are intended for diseases affecting up to 200,000 people in the US. Almost 60,000 people are infected with coronavirus in the US, but the number is likely to be an underestimate. Globally, more than 436,000 people have been infected. “Gilead is confident that it can maintain an expedited timeline in seeking regulatory review of remdesivir, without the orphan drug designation,” the company said on Wednesday.Activists had criticised the timing of the move, which was disclosed hours after the drugmaker said it would be limiting some of its compassionate-use supplies.“Gilead acknowledged it did not file for orphan status until early March, after it was clear it was a pandemic,” said Jamie Love, founder of intellectual property advocacy group Knowledge Ecology International.“Gilead’s decision can fix one problem, but we don’t know what other drugs will qualify for orphan status. The FDA made the mistake, and the FDA procedures need to be fixed,” added Mr Love.The FDA’s decision to grant orphan drug status had prompted anger in Congress, where some US lawmakers expressed concern that the company could use it to make remdesivir unaffordable to many coronavirus patients.Before Gilead made its reversal, Patty Murray, the most senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said the FDA decision had raised “some concerning flags”, adding that she planned to push the agency as to why it had made the determination.Many analysts believe remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, is one of the best bets for treating Covid-19. Studies in animals have also shown it is successful against other coronaviruses. Data from a small study using the drug to treat Covid-19 patients in China is expected to be released in the coming weeks. Large trials of hundreds of patients have been started by the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health, among others. Gilead’s U-turn comes after AbbVie, a US pharma company that makes a combination of HIV drugs that are also being tested against the virus, waived all intellectual property rights on the combination worldwide, paving the way for lower-priced generics to flood the market.
6;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-03-24T13:59:13Z;Gilead criticised over ‘orphan status’ for potential virus treatment;Activists slam US drugmaker for seeking exclusivity ‘despite calls for solidarity’ to tackle pandemic;Gilead Sciences has come under fire for securing a de facto monopoly in the US for an experimental drug seen as a potential coronavirus treatment, with activists accusing the US drugmaker of “morbid calculus” and “the most blatant abuse of the orphan drug act”.Under the act, a pharmaceutical company can obtain “orphan status” for a drug, giving it exclusivity on sales and the right to set prices for seven years, along with significant tax incentives and other benefits. It is granted by the Food and Drug Administration for a drug to treat diseases that affect less than 200,000 patients in the US.“At the time of the request for orphan drug designation, only a small number of Americans were affected by Covid-19,” Gilead said in statement on Monday, adding that it had been “making significant at-risk investments to develop and manufacture” the drug, called remdesivir, as the pandemic spreads.But health activists on Tuesday hit out at the orphan status.“This action by Gilead is Big Pharma profiteering at its finest, and shows why we cannot depend on drug companies to show responsible restraint in pricing even in a global emergency,” said David Mitchell, founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs, a campaign group.“It is particularly alarming because taxpayers contributed significantly to the research underlying the development of remdesivir.”Thiru Balasubramaniam, the Geneva representative of Knowledge Ecology International, an intellectual property advocacy group, said seeking the designation was the result of “morbid calculus” from Gilead.“Despite calls for solidarity in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gilead Sciences has exhibited a ruthless penchant for insatiable greed that would rival a medieval Raubritter,” he said.Ellen ’t Hoen, director at non-governmental organisation Medicines Law & Policy, said: “This is the most blatant abuse of the orphan drug act I have ever seen. It provides further evidence of the urgent need for an overhaul of the current pharmaceutical incentive system.”She said it would grant Gilead a “very strong monopoly” for the treatment, adding: “You cannot compulsory license an orphan drug exclusivity. That should not stop the government from taking measures now.”Zain Rizvi, a researcher in medicines access at Public Citizen, another adovacy group, said: “It is absolutely ridiculous, and shows the lengths pharmaceutical companies are willing to go to cash in from a crisis.”Globally, the virus has affected at least 334,000 and killed more than 14,000, according to the World Health Organization. There are at least 31,000 confirmed cases in the US. There are no approved treatments for the disease and drugmakers around the world are working to devise treatments and vaccines. Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola and has shown effectiveness against other coronaviruses in animal studies and is now being tested on patients in clinical trials. Gilead had been providing emergency access to remdesivir via health agencies for some patients on compassionate grounds, but hours before the orphan drug designation was announced, it said it would stop doing so because of “overwhelming demand”. Gilead’s application for orphan status contrasts with the approach of some other major drugmakers. On Monday, the Financial Times reported that AbbVie would be dropping its patent protection on Kaletra, another potential coronavirus treatment candidate.Observers suggested AbbVie may have been motivated by anticipated demand surges should the treatment prove effective, or because higher-income countries would likely follow in the steps of Israel by issuing compulsory licences for the drug to treat coronavirus.It is not the first time that Gilead has drawn criticism over patents for drugs treating diseases that are a matter of public health priority. It is embroiled in a legal dispute with the US federal government over its HIV treatment Truvada relating to alleged infringements that the lawsuit claims have helped Gilead reap billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded research.In a statement provided upon request, Gilead said it was acutely aware of the need surrounding the pandemic, and was working to “responsibly provide emergency access to remdesivir while these studies are ongoing”.“If remdesivir is proven to be safe and effective to treat Covid-19, we are committed to making remdesivir both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world,” said Gilead.Additional reporting by Hannah KuchlerThe Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed.Find the latest here.

In a statement on Monday, Gilead said it would pay $95.50 a share for Forty Seven, a 96 per cent premium to the group’s closing share price on Thursday when talks between the two companies leaked. Shares in Forty Seven, which was founded in 2015 and is based in Menlo Park, California, surged 61 per cent following the announcement of the deal.“This agreement builds on Gilead’s presence in immuno-oncology and adds significant potential to our clinical pipeline,” said Daniel O’Day, Gilead’s chief executive. “With a profile that lends itself to combination therapies, magrolimab could potentially have transformative benefits for a range of tumour types.”Gilead is not alone in turning to M&A to bolster its portfolio of cancer drugs. Early last year Bristol-Myers Squibb purchased Celgene for $93bn, while Pfizer snapped up Array BioPharma for $11bn in June. Rivals Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline have also bet billions of dollars on cancer treatments over the past 18 months.Best known for its HIV treatments and its medications for hepatitis C, Gilead has come under pressure following a drop in sales for some of its blockbuster drugs and a legal fight with the US government over alleged patent infringements.The capture of Forty Seven shares many of the hallmarks of other big cancer deals, where a recently listed start-up is acquired after its treatments show good progress in clinical trials. Shares in Forty Seven more than doubled in December after the company reported promising trial results of magrolimab.The Forty Seven acquisition is Mr O’Day’s second major deal since taking the helm two years ago.In July, Gilead reached a $5.1bn deal to increase its stake in Galápagos, giving the company access to a pipeline of new osteoarthritis and lung scarring treatments being developed by the Belgian biotech group.Gilead shares were up 2.7 per cent in early trading on Monday.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Regulators’ expectations are high, as are those of investors;A race for a coronavirus cure is on, and not wholly for altruistic reasons. Investors too want to find the maker of any treatment that can solve the crisis. So far the most promising treatment is remdesivir from Gilead Science. Clinical trials of the US drugmaker’s antiviral drug have been under way. But Gilead is not alone. Inflated expectations, including on China’s local markets, for some drugmakers do not reflect the experimental nature of any hopeful treatment.Remdesivir was originally developed as an Ebola treatment. Last month, Chinese biotech company BrightGene claimed it could manufacture remdesivir in large quantities. Its share price had more than doubled in the year to mid-February.That rally was shortlived. The Shanghai Stock Exchange reprimanded BrightGene on Monday saying it did not have approval from drug regulators nor license to produce from patent owner Gilead. BrightGene’s stock plummeted nearly 15 per cent. The company has only sketchy analyst coverage. This underlines the risks investors in biotech companies face. Developing new treatments is costly. Regulators’ expectations are high, as are those of investors.For Gilead remdesivir will hardly be a blockbuster. The drug, if successful in getting to market, will add less than $2.5bn in one-time revenue, says Bank of America. Its group revenues were $22.4bn last year. That helps explain why shares of Gilead, which have rallied since January, fell over 7 per cent since last Thursday. It is no different for Chinese peers such as Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical, which recently received approval to start clinical trials of its flu drug to treat coronavirus symptoms. Those shares have also turned down after gaining nearly a third over the past month.For most biotechs, success will be elusive. One winner will take most of the market. A best-case scenario is being priced in. Getting closer to a cure is good news for patients.

The latest sell-off extended the benchmark index’s decline this week to more than 8 per cent, which would mark its steepest drop since the financial crisis.Only five companies have managed to post a week-to-date gain by Thursday afternoon.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has been the top performer with a 10.4 per cent rise, as the company races to develop treatments for coronavirus. In early February, Regeneron said it was expanding a partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services and treatments could be made available for testing or “compassionate use” within a few months.Shares in Gilead, whose antiviral drug remdesivir is the subject of a clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19, have jumped 5.9 per cent.Clorox, known for its disinfecting wipes and other cleaning products, and CME Group are each up more than 3 per cent.Netflix is another unsurprising member of the winners’ circle, with the streaming video giant positioned to remain a fixture on consumers’ screens if offices or schools are forced to close. Shares are up 0.8 per cent this week and about 18 per cent year-to-date.Although they are down for the week, Steris and Quest Diagnostics have notably outperformed the broader market. Steris, which makes sterilisation equipment and other products for medical providers, is down just 0.6 per cent. Quest, a clinical lab, has fallen by the same margin.The utilities sector, considered a defensive play in equities, has recorded the slimmest decline this week at minus 7 per cent. Consumer staples, healthcare and real estate have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500, while energy has registered the steepest decline at 15 per cent.
12;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-11-07T17:08:44Z;US sues Gilead over HIV patent infringements;Lawsuit claims drugmaker reaped billions of dollars through taxpayer-funded research;The US is suing drugmaker Gilead Sciences for infringing government patents for the use of two of its flagship drugs to prevent HIV, saying the company has reaped billions of dollars by capitalising on taxpayer-funded research. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Health and Human Services Department said it filed a lawsuit seeking damages over the company’s alleged infringement of HHS patents for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, to bring drugs Truvada and Descovy to market. Gilead had originally obtained FDA approval for the therapeutic use of Truvada — which is priced at $20,000 a year per patient in the US — to treat HIV in combination with other drugs. It then obtained approval for the preventive use of Truvada and Descovy, a newer drug, by using data from Centers for Disease Control, a government agency, HHS said.HHS said that Gilead refused multiple attempts to get it to try to license the patents. PrEP is 99 per cent effective in protecting against HIV infection. If used widely, it has the potential to wipe out the HIV epidemic entirely. But pricing — activists, politicians, doctors and patients say — has been a major obstacle in broadening access. “HHS recognises Gilead’s role in selling Truvada and Descovy to patients for prevention of HIV. Communities have put these drugs to use in saving lives and reducing the spread of HIV,” said Alex Azar, US health secretary. “However, Gilead must respect the US patent system, the groundbreaking work by CDC researchers, and the substantial taxpayer contributions to the development of these drugs. The complaint filed today seeks to ensure that they do.”The Financial Times reported this summer that Gilead had not applied for exclusivity for the preventive indication of Truvada, based on a review of federal patent documents. A lack of exclusivity and the existence of publicly backed patents for the drug could expose the drugmaker to more than $1bn in damages and back royalties to the US. The Washington Post first revealed the existence of the government patents for PrEP earlier this year. PrEP4All, the advocacy group that has been pushing to break the de facto monopoly Gilead has enjoyed on PrEP, said that the lawsuit is a “necessary first step” to implement a larger-scale rollout of the therapy.“For nearly a decade, Gilead’s price gouging on PrEP has prevented hundreds of thousands of Americans from accessing this technology, despite it being a taxpayer funded invention. If HHS is truly invested in ending the HIV epidemic, it will use these patents as leverage to ensure that everyone who needs PrEP can get it,” it said in a statement.Gilead did not respond to a request for comment. It has disagreed with the premise that royalties could be due or that its previous patents did not grant it exclusivity for PrEP.Shortly after the FT reported that Gilead had not sought exclusivity for PrEP as it went to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval, the company moved to challenge the US patents for PrEP.Shares in Gilead lost 2.1 per cent in early New York trade.
13;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-08-21T19:57:20Z;Gilead to challenge US patents on HIV drug Truvada;Move comes amid increasing scrutiny of drugmaker over pricing practices;Gilead Sciences, the maker of HIV drug Truvada, is moving to challenge patents held by the US government on the preventive use of the drug, which is known as PrEP, amid criticism it used publicly-funded research to bring the drug to market at too steep a price.In a statement on Wednesday, the drugmaker said it strongly believes that the patents granted to HHS for two prophylactic uses of the drug are not valid.Gilead’s petition to the US Patent and Trademark Office is to request a so-called inter partes review, which re-examines the claims in a patent to determine if they are valid. If the proceeding is instituted, determinations are usually reached within a year.The Financial Times reported on Sunday that the company did not apply for exclusivity for the preventive use of the drug in the United States, and that it could owe the US government at least $1bn in royalties and damages.Gilead said it disagreed with the premise that royalties or damages were due, and that its patents for Truvada covered all uses of the drug, and that it did not obtain new patents for the PrEP indication.Gilead has been under political pressure to justify the high cost of the drug — which can run to $20,000 a year in the US — and if used by more people, could wipe out the HIV epidemic.In Wednesday’s statement, Gilead said: “The ongoing dialogue about these patents is a distraction from the important work being done by Gilead and its many community partners to reduce barriers to PrEP.”When approached by the FT for the first story, Gilead declined to rule out price increases for the drug — which has grown threefold since 2004 — and to disclose the manufacture and sales cost for Truvada.It is able to write the latter down for tax when it donates batches of Truvada. It recently moved to do so in the US, for up to 2.4 million bottles of Truvada for PrEP through 2030.Gilead, which says the main barrier to access the drug isn’t price but stigma and other structural hurdles, currently faces no price competition in the sale of Truvada for PrEP in the United States. A generic version of the drug is set to enter the market later next year.“The petition for inter partes review filed by Gilead today is a sign of fear — and Congress and investors should take note,” said James Krellenstein of advocacy group PrEP4All.He added: “As we’ve said for months, the US and European Patent offices examined the CDC’s patents carefully and repeatedly”.“Gilead’s arguments appear similar to what these patent offices have already considered, and they concluded that the CDC’s patents are valid . . . The CDC was the first to show with laboratory evidence that Truvada works as PrEP, which makes the CDC the inventor of PrEP and the rightful holder of patents on PrEP.”
14;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-08-18T21:00:26Z;Gilead did not seek US exclusivity on PrEP with Truvada;Drugmaker could be liable for billions in royalties to US government;Gilead Sciences did not apply for exclusivity when it sought US approval for Truvada, a drug that could end the HIV epidemic, to be used as a preventive treatment in 2012, according to a review of federal documents.Activists and legal experts say this lack of exclusivity and the publicly backed patents for the drug mean that Gilead’s effective monopoly in the US is invalid, and that generic alternatives could have been made available sooner.Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Books, which among other information list drug patents as provided by pharmaceutical groups, shows no exclusivity for Truvada for preventive use, a treatment known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.PrEP is 99 per cent effective in preventing HIV infection. The FDA approved Truvada for therapeutic and preventive use in 2004 and 2012, respectively.“Truvada was not granted any exclusivity specific to PrEP by the FDA that was in effect between 2012 and now. That absence of exclusivity meant and means one fewer obstacle for generics to come into the market,” said Christopher Morten, a staff attorney and lecturer at Yale Law School.Gilead dismissed this, however, saying: “the patents listed in the Orange Book for Truvada cover all uses of the product, including for treatment for HIV [and two types of prophylaxis, including PrEP]. We did not obtain new patents related to the PrEP indication.”The drugmaker is under fire in the US over the high price it has set for Truvada in PrEP, where it currently has no competition. Activists and intellectual property experts say the drug would not have been approved for HIV prevention without crucial trial data sponsored by the government’s Centers for Disease Control and others.This means, they say, the drugmaker could owe the government royalties on sales of the drug.The drugmaker charges more than $20,000 a year for treatment in the US — a threefold increase from 2004. It disagrees with suggestions that it owes any royalties on the drug. Gilead declined to say how much it costs to make or sell Truvada.Mr Morten and his colleagues at Yale analysed the CDC’s patents on behalf of PrEP4All, an advocacy group. The CDC did not respond to requests for comment.Gilead said it “strongly believes” that the US government patents are invalid. It said it has spent about $1.1bn in research and development since 2000 on Truvada, but declined to break down costs or its expenditure on PrEP development.The drugmaker said its scientists had worked on precursor PrEP research but were not given appropriate credit, yet it declined to say why it had not sought to secure recognition of their contributions.According to FT analysis, based on data and estimates compiled by RBC Markets, if royalties were found to be due Gilead could owe at least $1bn in such payments.The Washington Post revealed the existence of the government patents, prompting a US Department of Justice review. Gilead declined to comment on the review. The Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.Of the roughly $13bn in Truvada sales in the US since 2013, $5bn were for PrEP. If it were found to owe loyalties, the sum could fall anywhere between 7 per cent of that $5bn, or three times as much if damages were to be awarded.“The seven-year failure of the CDC to adequately scale up PrEP in the US has resulted in tens of thousands of Americans unnecessarily acquiring HIV,” said James Krellenstein of PrEP4All. “The CDC holds patents that could simultaneously lower the price of PrEP, while providing billions of dollars of additional resources to the most vulnerable communities to help end the HIV epidemic in America.”Mylan, which makes a generic version of Truvada, pays royalties for some its sales to the CDC. When the generic market forms in the US, it said, it will continue to do so.Gilead is awaiting an FDA decision on PrEP with a new drug, Descovy, which it hopes will supplant Truvada as generics enter the market later next year.Activists and intellectual property experts have said that the CDC is likely to retain an ongoing legal right to demand compensation from the company even if every patient on Truvada switched to Descovy. Asked about this, Gilead disagreed, reiterating it believes the government patents are invalid.
15;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-07-14T19:51:08Z;Gilead to raise stake in Belgian biotech in $5.1bn deal ;Drugmaker’s investment in Galapagos will gain it access to pipeline of drugs;US drugmaker Gilead Sciences has agreed a $5.1bn deal to increase its stake in Belgian biotech group Galapagos and gain access to a pipeline of drugs that are under development.The deal marks an expansion of the alliance between the two companies, which were already co-operating on a potential arthritis treatment. It comes as Gilead is under pressure from sliding sales of its blockbuster hepatitis C drug, and is the first major move by chief executive Daniel O’Day who joined from Roche Pharmaceuticals in March. Gilead will acquire the rights outside Europe to two additional drugs that are in development, which target osteoarthritis and lung scarring. It will also have the option to take up similar rights over any other new treatments that Galapagos invents over the next ten years. The American company is paying an upfront fee of $3.95bn, and will also invest $1.1bn to nearly double its stake in Galapagos to 22 per cent. It will make additional payments if the two experimental drugs named in the deal are approved in the US. Gilead has also agreed to share some of Galapagos’ development costs.Mr O’Day said he joined the company to expand its portfolio of world class research, and that this partnership was a “creative” and “unique” way to do it. Gilead did consider acquiring Galapagos but chose a partnership instead. “I’m a believer that acquisitions, in this case, can often destroy value. Many times you lose some of the very best scientists and people in the organisation. You create complexity. In early stage research, independence creates more value,” he said. Onno van de Stolpe, Galapagos chief executive, said he wanted to create a “European powerhouse”, not sell out to a large pharmaceutical company. With over a billion euros in the bank, he said Galapagos came to the negotiations in a position of strength.“If you look at European companies successful in biotech, all have been acquired by big pharma and that’s something we — and especially me as a founder — didn’t want to see happening. We want to determine our own destiny regarding research,” he said.Big pharmaceuticals companies are increasingly turning to mergers and acquisitions instead of relying entirely on in-house research scientists, preferring to let niche biotechnology companies take the risks inherent in early-stage research.But the trend means that new drugs are more often being invented by companies that lack the expensive sales capabilities and global reach needed to commercialise them. That, combined with pharmaceuticals companies’ need to replace old products that lose patent protections or are under pressure from competitors, has triggered a wave of deals.In the first three months of the year alone, pharmaceuticals companies notched up $92bn worth of mergers and acquisitions, the highest quarterly total since 2014, according to EvaluatePharma. Gilead is best known for HIV treatments and a hepatitis C medicine that transformed patients’ prospects by curing the disease within months, but also placed strains on insurance plans left footing a price of roughly $1,000 per pill.But the company has since reported slowing sales of the drug, which fell to $790m in the first quarter of this year, from $1bn a year earlier. Unveiling the results in May, Gilead blamed a decline in the number of patients beginning treatment, and a fall in the price paid for the drug by the US Medicare scheme.
16;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-05-02T21:11:02Z;Gilead tops earnings forecast as cancer drug drives sales;;Gilead Sciences earned a stronger quarterly profit than forecast on sales growth for its HIV treatments and Yescarta cancer drug.The drugmaker said on Thursday that Yescarta, which received US approval in 2017, generated $96m in sales during the first quarter, more than double the $40m in sales recorded during the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile HIV product sales jumped to $3.6bn from $3.2bn, mainly due to higher volume from the drug Biktarvy.Those gains helped offset a continued slowdown in sales of Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs, which fell to $790m from $1bn. Gilead attributed the decline to lower patient starts and competitive dynamics, including a decline in US Medicare prices this year.Gilead added the Yescarta cancer treatment to its portfolio through the $11.9bn acquisition of US biotech group Kite Pharma in 2017. The CAR-T product is used to treat lymphoma, a blood cancer.The California-based company said first-quarter revenue totalled $5.3bn, up from $5.1bn a year earlier and matching analysts’ average estimate.Net income rose 28 per cent to $1.98bn, or $1.54 a share. Adjusted earnings per share jumped to $1.76 from $1.48, beating expectations for $1.61.Gilead affirmed its full-year guidance, which estimates net product sales of $21.3bn to $21.8bn.Shares in the company ticked 0.8 per cent higher in after-hours trading. The stock is up 4.4 per cent year to date, trailing the broader S&P 500.
17;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2019-04-08T20:26:34Z;GSK two-drug/one-pill HIV treatment given FDA approval in US;Clinical trials show reduced regimen still effective at controlling virus;An HIV treatment made up of two drugs, rather than the usual three, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, potentially handing GlaxoSmithKline a significant boost in its battle for market share with American biotech Gilead Sciences.GSK’s new medicine, Dovato, will be the first single-tablet, two-drug regimen sanctioned for adults who have not previously been treated for the disease.Made up of two medicines, dolutegravir and lamivudine, it follows a series of clinical trials that have demonstrated two drugs are as effective as three at suppressing the virus, achieving the same result but with less toxicity.Gilead currently dominates the overall HIV market, worth around $28bn, with around 53 per cent share compared with only about 22 per cent for GSK.Deborah Waterhouse, chief executive of ViiV Healthcare, a specialist HIV company majority-owned by GSK, argued that the UK drugmaker could assert dominance over its rival through the success of dolutegravir.A total of 650,000 people across the world were now taking a dolutegravir-based regimen. “That’s where we believe we can take leadership over time and at the core of that is the two-drug regimen,” she added.We don’t believe that any person living with HIV should take more medicines than they need toShe declined to put a timescale on this ambition, adding that the company was awaiting further clinical data, but added: “The strength of our pipeline would lead you to believe that the future is looking very promising.”Advances in treatment mean HIV is now for many a chronic condition with which they will live for decades.Ms Waterhouse said: “What we’re trying to do is really challenge the current treatment paradigm because we don’t believe that any person living with HIV should take more medicines than they need to.”Patients diagnosed in their twenties and thirties could be on medication for 40 years, she argued. “If you happen over that period to take one of the three-drug regimens that have . . . a booster within it, then you’re going to be taking about 57,000 doses of medicine. If you take a two-drug regimen, that reduces to 28,500 doses,” she added.Surveys had shown that 72 per cent of people living with HIV worried about the long-term effects of HIV treatment and 56 per cent would consider reducing the number of drugs in their regimen to a minimum “as long, of course, as they weren’t risking any issues from an efficacy perspective”, she added.Some observers, however, believe doctors may be reluctant to abandon the three-drug treatment, which they have long prescribed, in favour of GSK’s two drug version.Ms Waterhouse conceded: “You’re breaking a treatment paradigm and that means that the uptake . . . will be a little bit slower.”But given sufficiently strong clinical data, physicians would be willing to make the change, she argued.Ms Waterhouse said that, while the US approval was initially for so-called “treatment naive” patients, who had not previously received HIV medication, over time, she believed the regulator would allow the treatment to be used in a broader population. In Europe, where approval is expected in the third quarter, the medicine was likely to be sanctioned for a broader population from the start, she said.She also suggested that the ViiV medicine would beat Gilead’s medication, Biktarvy, on price, saying it would be the lowest-cost single-tablet regimen of its kind.
18;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2018-12-10T09:19:56Z;US drugmaker Gilead poaches Roche executive Daniel O’Day;Pharmaceuticals chief will replace John Milligan who announced his departure in July;US drugmaker Gilead Sciences has poached pharmaceutical industry veteran Daniel O’Day from Swiss rival Roche to be its new chief executive as it battles to revive flagging sales.Mr O’Day replaces the outgoing John Milligan, whose departure from Gilead was announced in July. The Roche executive’s appointment follows a sharp slide in sales of Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drug. At the same time, Gilead said its chairman John Martin would also leave.Mr Milligan took charge of Gilead in 2016 and had spent almost three decades with the business before announcing his plans to step aside.Mr O’Day has spent his entire career at Roche, joining in 1987, and has held various roles in the US as well as at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland — most recently running its pharmaceuticals business.The 54-year-old American, who studied biology at Georgetown University and did an MBA at Columbia University, said he had “long admired Gilead for its work to develop medicines that have fundamentally changed the way HIV and viral hepatitis are treated”.Analysts at Jefferies said Mr O’Day’s 30 years of oncology and global commercial expertise at Roche should help Gilead “build out its own global commercial presence particularly in new areas [it] is entering including in oncology . . . and inflammation . . . as well as through more acquisitions and in-licensing deals”.Mr Martin, who will stay on as Gilead’s chairman until March, said that, following a comprehensive search, “the board became convinced that Dan is the right leader to bring Gilead into the future”.He was “uniquely qualified to take on this role given his track record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, deep understanding of the evolving healthcare environment around the world, and unwavering commitment to driving innovation across all aspects of a business,” added Mr Martin.Gregg Alton, a senior Gilead executive, will serve as interim chief executive until Mr O’Day starts his new job in March. Meanwhile Mr O’Day will be replaced by Bill Anderson, head of Roche’s Genentech subsidiary, from the start of next year.At Gilead, Mr O’Day will be charged with maximising the potential of its cutting-edge cancer treatment, CAR-T, which involves extracting a patient’s blood cells and re-engineering them in a lab so they can attack the disease, before infusing them back into the body.In August last year, after several years looking for a blockbuster deal, Gilead bought Kite Pharma, a US biotech, in an $11.9bn deal, acquiring its CAR-T product, Yescarta. Last December it reported strong results with the drug, which kept some of the sickest patients suffering from lymphoma, a blood cancer, alive for at least a year.In another boost for Gilead, the UK’s National Health Service — often seen as a bellwether by other health systems — negotiated a deal in October with the company under which it agreed the medicine could be used to treat adults, following an earlier approval for treatment in children. It marked the first time that adult NHS patients had been allowed access to CAR-T.However, sales of its new CAR-T treatment have so far been modest and slowing sales of Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs led to a 19 per cent year-on-year fall in revenues in the first nine months of the year.Analysts at Jefferies said “general feedback from investors” on Mr O’Day had been “neutral to positive”. They added, however, that he was “not viewed as a leader that for good or bad necessarily implemented any major changes or pivoted any major strategies at Roche, and is perceived to be pretty straight down the road . . . in terms of risk-taking”.They predicted that Mr O’Day’s strategy would be based on “deploying [Gilead’s] current cash of [about] $32bn towards more oncology assets and other key areas, such as inflammation and liver diseases”.Gilead’s current debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio stands at roughly 2.6 times “so the company could still lever up to do more deals”, they added.At Roche, Mr O’Day has been at the forefront of the company’s push into personalised medicine. Earlier this year, Roche acquired Flatiron, a New York-based start-up that deploys vast data sets, drawn from medical records, with the aim of reducing the time spent in discovering effective cancer treatments.In June, Roche announced that it was acquiring the outstanding shares it did not already own in Foundation Medicine, a company with a focus on using genomic profiling to identify the molecular alterations in a patient’s cancer and to match them with the right targeted medicines.

He will stay on at the company through the year end as the board conducts a search to identify his successor.“The board and I have agreed it is a good time to turn the reins over to a new leader,” said Mr Milligan in a statement. “I’m looking forward to a well-deserved break and will then move on to new and different opportunities.”Mr Milligan will also step down from the board at the end of the year. The company said that chairman John Martin will also depart from the board when the new chief executive joins the company.“Our view, is this is probably a board decision (and not necessarily CEO decision given comments say he will be taking a break) to invigorate the company and to bring on fresh leadership to turn Gilead from pharma-like, to more Biotech-like,” said Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies.The news of Mr Milligan’s exit overshadowed a smaller than expected drop in second-quarter revenues and upbeat adjusted earnings.Shares in Gilead, which are up 10 per cent year-to-date, were down 2.4 per cent in extended trade.
20;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2018-05-30T04:00:28Z;Drugmakers struggle to find immunotherapy combinations for cancer;Discordant notes expected at this year’s Asco, a kind of rock festival for pharma;"After decades of frustratingly slow progress in discovering new drugs to battle cancer, the breakthroughs have started to come thick and fast. Futuristic cell therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences can re-engineer the body to attack tumours, while a drug from Loxo Oncology produces spectacular results by zoning in on cancer genetics. The annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco), the world’s largest cancer conference, has become the main forum for drugmakers to chart their success. As the pace of discoveries has quickened in recent years, it has turned into a kind of rock festival for the pharmaceutical industry.This week, 30,000 doctors and pharma executives will again assemble in a huge conference centre on the banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago for the meeting to pore over results from hundreds of clinical trials. The biggest advance has been the arrival of immunotherapy drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, which remove brakes in the immune system so it can fight cancer as it does other foreign invaders such as viruses.The medicines, which wowed the audience at Asco in 2014, raked in $10bn in sales last year for Merck of the US, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca. This year’s meeting was supposed to be another one for the ages, when pharma companies would finally start to prove a popular theory which holds that combining two immunotherapy drugs into one treatment can dramatically boost survival rates. While a minority of between 20 and 30 per cent of cancer patients do extremely well on immunotherapies, most do not. Drugmakers have been trying to push response rates higher by testing cocktails containing two medicines targeting the immune system. Thousands of trials are under way.However, the company that was supposed to be this year’s headline act will be conspicuously absent from the main stage. Incyte, a US biotech group, had hoped to prove that combining its experimental immunotherapy with Keytruda — a leading checkpoint inhibitor made by its Big Pharma partner Merck — would boost survival rates in patients suffering from melanoma and other common cancers. But after announcing the failure of its closely watched Phase III trial earlier this year, Incyte’s investigators will instead take to the podium with a presentation that tries to unpick why the approach was so unsuccessful. “Every year Asco has an ‘advance of the year’,” said Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Exchange Traded Fund. “This year was supposed to be the year of combos, but it hasn’t materialised as quickly or as robustly as anyone would have hoped.” Outside of melanoma, the only combination approach that has been conclusively proven to work involves twinning a checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with chemotherapy, a treatment that has been used to fight cancer for more than 70 years. Last month, Merck unveiled a large trial showing this cocktail can dramatically improve survival prospects for people suffering from the most common form of lung cancer, putting it on track to become the standard first-in-line treatment for these patients. However, the inclusion of chemotherapy in the mix means patients must still contend with its brutal toxic side effects, such as hair loss, vomiting and anaemia. The holy grail is still finding two immunotherapies that can manipulate the immune system so that it does all the work, meaning chemotherapy can be discarded altogether. But a crop of studies due to be presented at this year’s Asco meeting suggests there is still much more work to do. The most promising experimental drug is from Nektar Therapeutics, a San Francisco biotech company that recently signed a record-breaking $1.85bn partnership deal with Bristol-Myers. I’d prefer to combine mechanisms where both parts of the combination have activity by themselves. “[Incyte’s drug] did not have single-agent efficacy, which was always worrisomeAn abstract preview of the company’s trial shows that around half of patients with skin, kidney and lung cancers responded to a combination of Nektar’s drug and Opdivo, a checkpoint inhibitor made by Bristol-Myers. Still, the results from the small trial are less impressive than a readout of the same study published in November, leading some investors to fret over whether the combo really works. Jounce Therapeutics, which had been touted as another star act, also looks set to disappoint. The company founded by Jim Allison — a scientist often described as the “godfather of immunotherapy” — published an abstract of its combination trial that Mr Loncar described as “terrible”.The patchy progress in finding the right combination supports the view of those oncologists who think drugmakers have started taking foolhardy scientific shortcuts in the hope that they will strike lucky and find a blockbuster treatment. Merck made a big bet on Incyte’s failed combination effort, in a rare stumble for a company that has developed its own immunotherapies with scientific rigour, even if it has meant sacrificing some early commercial success. Mr Loncar identified two problems with the Incyte and Merck collaboration. First, there was scant proof that Incyte’s drug was effective in fighting cancer. Second, the companies charged into a series of large and expensive trials based on data from a handful of small, early-stage studies, without doing the necessary mid-stage groundwork. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s top scientist, said the company would focus its future efforts on combinations where each of the drugs has been proven to work separately as a “monotherapy” before testing them together.“I’d prefer to combine mechanisms where both parts of the combination have activity by themselves,” he said. “[Incyte’s drug] did not have single-agent efficacy, which was always worrisome.” Asked whether that meant Merck could scale back any of the roughly 400 combination trials it has under way, Dr Perlmutter replied: “We review them all the time based on new data that comes in; we are always looking at them and thinking about them.”However, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, which is trialling its own immunotherapy combo, predicts companies will still move quickly because the lucrative field is so hotly contested. “It’s still a very competitive race and people are ready to take risks,” said Mr Soriot. “Of course, we are going to be looking for monotherapy activity, but if we have a good biological rationale, we may still take the risk with a combination.” For Mr Loncar, “the clear takeaway from the Incyte failure is that we need a lot more mid-stage, randomised trials”. “But,” he added, “that costs money and takes time, and sometimes market forces motivate people to do things the wrong way. “I believe things will change when I see it.”The most keenly awaited study at this year’s meeting is a large trial of Merck’s immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, in patients with a common type of lung cancer. The company stunned medics and investors last month with the success of its trial combining Keytruda and chemotherapy in untreated patients.But the study due to be unveiled at Asco is examining whether patients can be spared the older, toxic treatment altogether. Merck’s drug is already used instead of chemo in a subset of patients with tumours that have very high levels of a protein known as programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1), which is thought to make them particularly good candidates for immunotherapy. The forthcoming study is looking at whether chemo can also be dispensed with in patients whose tumours have lower levels of the protein.Merck has already announced that the study was successful without giving much detail, but doctors will want to see the full results to determine whether to use Keytruda on its own or in combination with chemotherapy. Merck’s success in using Keytruda as a “monotherapy” in this group of patients is surprising, given that Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted a similar trial in 2016 that ended up failing.Depending on the strength of the full results, the study could raise questions over whether Merck’s drug is inherently better than Bristol’s. Most doctors believe that the drugs are effectively copies of each other — the equivalent of Coca-Cola and Pepsi — but that could start to change if trials suggest that Merck has an edge. "

The sales figure fell short of Wall Street expectation of $1.16bn.Gilead attributed the sales decline to weaker demand for the drug in all major markets amid increased competition.The biotech group pioneered hepatitis C drugs that can cure the illness in a matter of weeks but it has lost share to AbbVie, a rival drugmaker.AbbVie’s hepatitis-C franchise generated $919m in the first quarter – well ahead of the consensus analyst forecast of $572m.The poor performance of the hepatitis C unit resulted in Gilead missing Wall Street’s expectations for its first quarter earnings and revenues.Gilead posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 on revenues of $5.1bn, which were 19 cents and $300m short of consensus forecasts, respectively.Shares of Gilead declined by 5.18 per cent in after-hours trading.
22;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Gilead sinks in after-hours trade on weak revenue outlook;;Gilead Sciences shares slid in after-hours trading after flagging lower product sales in 2018 and swinging to a net loss in its fiscal fourth quarter.The pharmaceuticals company said it expected total product sales this year of $20bn to $21bn, a drop of at least 18 per cent from the $25.66bn it booked in the 12 months ended December 31.Revenue for calendar 2017 was down 14.3 per cent from the previous year. That declining trend was also evident in the December quarter with total revenue, which includes product sales and royalties, falling about 19 per cent to $5.95bn. This was ahead of the $5.7bn median forecast from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Gilead swung to a $3.87bn loss in the fourth quarter from a $3.1bn profit a year ago. This was primarily due to a $5.5bn one-off charge related to recent US tax reform.The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $2.96 in the fourth quarter and earnings per share of $3.51 for the full year.Sales of the company’s hepatitis C treatments, which count for a substantial portion of revenues, more than halved to $1.5bn in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, and were down 39 per cent to $9.1bn for the full year.Shares were down 1.7 per cent in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq, with the company gaining 2.6 per cent during regular hours alongside a broad rebound for Wall Street.
23;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2018-01-04T05:15:27Z;Cost of Viagra soars as hundreds of drug prices rise in US;Pfizer among those risking backlash with new year increases on many medicines;Drugmakers have imposed price rises of several times the rate of inflation on more than a thousand products in the US, a New Year move that risks a political backlash at a time of intense scrutiny on healthcare costs.Pfizer, the largest standalone drugmaker in the US, raised the average wholesale price of 148 drugs by a mean average of 8.8 per cent, according to data seen by the Financial Times.The list included several of its best-known medicines such as Viagra, the erectile dysfunction treatment, and Lyrica for nerve pain.Other large drugmakers, including Allergan, GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead, Shire, Biogen, Teva, Baxter and Viiv also increased the US list prices of their medicines on January 1, according to the data.For the most part, drugmakers held the increases at less than 10 per cent, but they still tracked well ahead of inflation, currently 2.2 per cent in the US.Some pharmaceutical groups implemented much larger increases. Hikma, the London-listed drugmaker, raised the price of several strengths of morphine — which was first marketed in the 1800s — by between 75 and 90 per cent, taking a 25-pack of vials from $30 to $58.Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people lower the cost of prescription medicines, said it had recorded price increases on more than 1,300 products on the first day of the year.“If GM raised the price of their trucks by four times the rate of inflation for multiple years, they wouldn’t sell any trucks,” said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings. “The inelastic market of pharmaceuticals continues to be stretched to new levels.”The decision by pharmaceutical groups to raise the price of so many products is a gamble given the intense focus on drug costs in the US, the world’s largest and most profitable healthcare market.The issue has been at the forefront of public debate since the presidential campaign, when Hillary Clinton targeted Martin Shkreli, the disgraced biotech entrepreneur, for raising an Aids and cancer medicine by 5,000 per cent.President Donald Trump has also criticised the industry since winning election, accusing it of “getting away with murder” by charging high prices.David Mitchell, a campaigner from Patients For Affordable Drugs, said it made little sense to focus only on “outliers” such as Shkreli given that successive years of above-inflation increases on thousands of common drugs were a bigger contributor to higher costs.“The Shkrelis are emblematic of what’s going on across the whole system. When everyone applies these hikes across virtually every drug, it adds up to a hell of a lot more,” he said.For some of Pfizer’s medicines, the latest increase is the third in the space of a year and come after it hoisted 91 of its drugs in June.A 100mg capsule of Lyrica, for nerve pain, has gone from $7.59 at the start of last year to $9.81 following three successive increases, a jump of 29 per cent.A 100mg tablet of Viagra went from $57.94 to $80.82 over the same period — an increase of 39 per cent — although a generic version of the medicine has been available since December.A spokesperson for Pfizer said the company “takes a measured and responsible approach to pricing” and that the list price of the majority of its medicines “remains unchanged” following the latest round of increases.The company said it operated assistance programmes for patients struggling to afford their medicines. It declined to say whether it planned to implement further price increases in June, as it did last year.Drugmakers argue that list prices do not reflect the actual amount they end up collecting from health insurers, employers and the government, because they often have to offer large rebates to secure reimbursement.For example, Pfizer said at the end of the third quarter — before the most recent increase — the “weighted average net selling price” of all its drugs in the US was up 3 per cent over the previous year. However, that figure includes large discounts given to military veterans and low income individuals.Join the FT’s deputy editor Roula Khalaf for a panel discussion on the future of Alzheimer’s on January 18 in LondonList prices are still important because they are often used to calculate the amount that patients must personally pay “out of pocket”. Rising list prices coupled with less generous insurance plans have caused patient costs to climb considerably in recent years.Allergan said it had implemented an average list price increase of 7.3 per cent, which it said was “consistent with our single-digit commitment”, and that it would not increase prices on the affected medicines again this year. It said that following rebates and discounts it expected its net price increase to be between 2 and 3 per cent.Hikma attributed its morphine price increases to “marketing shortages” that had prompted it to “reallocate manufacturing capacity” and said it had not raised the price of the affected products in more than four years.
24;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-12-10T15:36:01Z;Gilead dispels doubts with Car-T cancer drug trial results;Study shows lymphoma patients live longer after pioneering cell therapy;A pioneering cancer treatment being developed by the US biotech company Gilead Sciences can keep some of the sickest lymphoma patients alive for at least a year, according to the results of a much-anticipated clinical trial published on Sunday.The study will help dispel nagging doubts over the effectiveness of chimeric antigen receptor therapy, or Car-T, and underpin the confidence of investors in companies developing the treatment.Car-T involves extracting a patient’s blood cells and re-engineering them in a laboratory so they can attack cancer, before infusing them back into the body.The one-time treatment has produced impressive results during trials, achieving remissions in blood cancer patients who had just weeks or months to live, and regulators have approved Car-T therapies at breakneck speed because of their remarkable impact in some people who would otherwise die.But the unprecedented haste has led to the unusual situation of the drugs being given a green light before it is known whether the effect is durable.The trial of Gilead’s product, Yescarta, showed that after a median period of 15.4 months, 59 per cent of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were still alive, 42 per cent were in remission and 40 per cent exhibited no trace of cancer.“With existing therapy, the median survival for people with this disease is only six months — here, we see more than half of patients are still alive over a year after treatment,” said Dr Sattva Neelapu, a professor at the University of Texas, who led the study.Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange traded fund, which has holdings in Gilead and other Car-T makers, said: “This has been developed so quickly that we don’t know if it lasts and, for that reason, these data are very important.”“The big question was what would the leap from six months to a year look like,” added Mr Loncar. “Now the goal is to cure people: that’s the exciting thing.”David Chang, head of research and development at Kite, Gilead’s cell therapy subsidiary, said: “This is what everybody was asking for and we are delighted in the end the data lived up to what we were hoping for.”————————————————————————The results of the study were presented on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta, which has become one of the foremost medical conferences in large part due to the promise of Car-T.A separate study of a rival Car-T being developed by Novartis, known as Kymriah, underscored the promise of that drug. After six months, almost a third of patients were cancer free while a further 7 per cent were in remission.A trial of a similar therapy being developed by Celgene and Bluebird Bio suggested that Car-T could also be used to treat people with a different type of blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.Despite the positive data, there remain several obstacles to the widespread use of Car-T, including toxic side effects that have caused a spate of deaths during clinical trials.The bespoke manufacturing process is also very costly, leading drugmakers to charge some of the highest prices ever seen in the pharmaceuticals industry. Gilead charges $373,000 for Yescarta, while Novartis put a price tag of $475,000 on Kymriah, although it says it will offer refunds if the treatment does not work.
25;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;When Silicon Valley came to Wall Street;Mainstream asset managers have begun using big data and machine learning;Gilead Sciences recently reached an $11.9bn agreement to acquire Kite Pharma for a 50 per cent premium to its monthly average stock price. Five days before the US takeover was announced, an artificially intelligent computer predicted it.The algorithm, developed by Dataminr, a New York-based technology group, had noticed unusual social media chatter and options activity and alerted its clients about a possible buyout of Kite by a large biotech company. The following week, shares in Kite jumped 28 per cent.The prediction was not the first time clever social media analysis had anticipated a market movement before investors, analysts and journalists. For years, boutique hedge funds have used computers to crunch alternative data sources to gain a competitive edge over their rivals.However, as artificial intelligence makes predictions more sophisticated and active managers come under pressure to reduce costs and improve returns, mainstream investment companies such as Schroders, Axa Investment Managers, JPMorgan Asset Management, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, State Street, NN Investment Partners and Fidelity have also begun using big data or machine learning to aid investment decisions.“There has been a blurring between traditional judgmental managers and quantitative managers,” says Gideon Smith, Europe chief investment officer at AXA Rosenberg Equities, the quantitative investment arm of France-based Axa Investment Managers. AXA Rosenberg said earlier this month it would integrate machine learning and big data into its investment processes.“Any role where you are doing something repetitive is ripe to be done faster, quicker, cheaper by machines and robots, and so it is beholden on all of us in the asset management industry to look at what we do . . . and [whether] it is something that a machine might be able to do better.”As cheaper, passively managed funds grow in popularity and attract assets away from active managers, investment houses have come under fierce pressure to cut fees and improve performance. Under the spotlight of investors, regulators and passive rivals, active managers hope that artificial intelligence can help traditional fund houses beat the market and rein costs in.2.5 quintillionBytes of data created every dayWith this in mind, Schroders, the UK’s largest listed asset manager, has embarked on ambitious plans to recruit data scientists. It has expanded its data team from two to 18 over the past two years and plans to hire more staff as portfolio managers get used to the technology.“There are all these big data sets that could be useful to inform the investment decisions that stockpickers are making,” says Mark Ainsworth, head of data insights at Schroders. “But they don’t currently exist in a form that is useful for investment managers.“You can get a computer to make some sort of sense of a large body of text.”According to Mr Ainsworth, Schroders’ data team accurately predicted how many betting shops the UK’s competition regulator would force Ladbrokes and Gala Coral to sell following a £2.2bn deal to create the UK’s largest gambling house.“The alternative is to put an intern in front of Google Maps for six weeks,” he says.For years, small tech groups have attempted to woo traditional money managers with machine learning technology, arguing that it was a strategic imperative for investment companies to understand the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that are created every day. But until now many mutual fund groups have struggled to make the transition because of a lack of in-house expertise and the high cost of valuable information.In the past few years, breakthroughs in machine learning and so-called natural-language processing, where computers learn to interpret human language, have made it possible for artificial intelligence to decipher social media communication, patent filings, satellite images and even analyst calls.191*Number of start-up tech companies offering alternative data analysis to financial institutionsThese developments have piqued the interest of big investment groups. “Unstructured data have grown exponentially,” says Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, head of quantitative investment strategies for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.“You have a gap between the amount of information and the ability to process it, and [for a long time] the only way to close that gap was to hire lots of Javiers.“Now you can capture that gap by using computers.”Almost a third of asset managers surveyed this year by Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy, said they were using alternative data, with 64 per cent saying they believed it could help them beat their benchmarks. The most popular information was social media data, supply-chain analysis, business performance information and web traffic.Their interest has led to an explosion in the number of start-up tech companies offering alternative data analysis to financial institutions. There are now 191 providers around the world, according to AlternativeData.org, a data provider on the industry set up by YipIt Data.*“There has definitely been a significant increase from traditional mutual funds in the past year,” says Emmett Kilduff, founder of Eagle Alpha, a well-known alternative data provider.“There are some macro factors: a lot of money is going to passive and quantitative [funds], so the discretionary guys are trying to become more quantamental [quantitative and fundamental].”The effects of a shift towards quantitative investing using machine learning tools will be significant for financial markets.If companies attempt to control data signals or the same few vendors provide underlying technology to multiple asset managers, there could be concerns about crowding and competition.90%Percentage of quantitative funds using data science and machine learning“Does the regulator know what the changes to the market will be if people don’t know what is happening on the margins?” says Daniel Tammas-Hastings, founder of RiskSave, a robo-advice start-up. “If we built a machine-learning algorithm now and asked it to trade individual accounts, it would take two, three years before we knew whether it was right.”Obstacles remain for traditional fund managers, who are often trained in economics and finance rather than data science or technology.“They are too big, they are too slow,” says Scott Borgerson, co-founder of CargoMetrics, a maritime data analytics group, which is now a hedge fund. “These are big data Silicon Valley things, not Wall Street things.”Stockpickers usually do not buy and sell stocks more than once within a trading day and cannot always benefit from a data-driven signal that is only a few hours ahead of a company announcement.“There are many challenges for someone who is not native in data science to start using these tools,” says Armando Gonzalez, chief executive of RavenPack, which provides social media and news analysis to investors. “I would say 90 per cent of quantitative funds and 30 per cent of fundamental [managers] are using these tools.”*This article has been amended from the original to update the number of providers and correct the originator of the data.Big data and artificial intelligence are not just used in investment decisions. Many of the largest fund houses and banks have also rushed to launch cheap, automated advice platforms known as robo-advisers, which use technology to recommend funds based on simple questions.Their belief is that automation online will reshape the market for financial advice by appealing to younger and less wealthy savers. HSBC, Investec, BlackRock, Deutsche Asset Management, Schroders, Aberdeen Asset Management and Lyxor are among the financial institutions that have bought or invested in robo-advice.Citigroup has estimated the robo-advice market globally could reach $5tn over the next decade.“As the population becomes more digital . . . there is a massive opportunity for lenders to expand through automation,” says Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, the online investment manager in which Schroders invested more than £12m.“That’s the only way you can grow with a huge population and the need to keep costs low.” Nutmeg employs four data scientists in a team of 98 and wants to hire more next year.Regulators have welcomed robo-advisers. In April, the UK set out new rules to free online providers from the heavier regulation associated with traditional financial advice. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said it wanted to encourage the growth of robo-advisers as a way to offer investment help to a greater number of people.For asset managers the hope is that automated advice could help them save money. “The drivers for active managers is to come up with top-line increases while reducing cost and speed,” says Tej Vakta, head of wealth management at Capgemini, a consultancy and technology provider.
26;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Gilead new cancer therapy wins FDA approval — with $373,000 tag;;The Food and Drug Adminstration on Wednesday approved Kite Pharma’s cell-based therapy treatment for patients with advanced lymphoma marking the second approval for the cutting edge cancer treatment known as Car-T.Gilead Sciences, which bought Kite Pharma earlier this year, said the price for Yescarta, a therapy known as as chimeric antigen therapy, would be $373,000. The process involves extracting a person’s cells and re-engineering them to attack and kill cancer cells.“Today marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases. In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, said. “This approval demonstrates the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine and we’re committed to supporting and helping expedite the development of these products.The win for Gilead comes after Novartis secured approval in August to use Car-T to treat a type of lukemia in children and young adults. Novartis said it would charge $475,000 a patient for its therapy.Gilead Sciences shares were up 3 per cent to $82.47 in after hours trade.
27;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-10-05T14:37:15Z;Trump tax reforms risk crimping US bond market supply;Gilead issuance of shorter-dated debt is a sign of how corporate groups are positioning;When biotechnology company Gilead sold $3bn of bonds last month to fund its acquisition of Kite Pharma, US credit investors were perhaps shown a glimpse of the future.Rather than offering longer-dated debt in an M&A-inspired blockbuster deal that has been the market’s hallmark, the $108bn drugmaker presented investors with a choice of two bonds: one with a maturity of just 18 months and the other of two years.The message for investors was unmistakable. The prospects of substantial US tax reform may be uncertain as Congress and the White House start the lengthy process of negotiations, but the increased chance of it happening matters if you are a multinational company with piles of cash parked offshore.Investors say that for Gilead, holding $27.4bn in cash outside the US, the possibility that Congress may pass legislation that allows the money to be brought back to the US with a much smaller tax levy gives them an incentive to sell shorter-dated bonds.“They are doing this for the pending tax policy,” says Todd Schomberg, senior portfolio manager at Invesco, which bought some of the Gilead bonds. “If we get a change in tax policy, Gilead has a lot of cash overseas and they can use that to pay down the debt.”A spokesperson for Gilead declined to comment on the company’s M&A financing and strategy.Although plans for tax reform have languished for much of the year, investors are now anticipating diminishing supply of new paper and a further narrowing in the premium investors’ demand to own US corporate bonds instead of Treasuries.“Instead of pushing out debt as they had before, they are looking to bring money back from overseas,” says Jack Flaherty, a director in GAM’s fixed income investment team. “I definitely think there will be lower supply.”Having already topped $1tn for the sixth straight year, the past two weeks has seen investment-grade corporate bond issuance dip to about $20bn per week, down from more than $45bn in each of the previous two weeks.Yet at the same time, demand for investment-grade corporate debt remains high. Investors have ploughed fresh cash into US investment-grade bond funds every week this year, according to data from EPFR. The last week of outflows was recorded in December 2016.That wall of money has helped compress the premium, or spread, between Treasury yields and those of investment-grade debt to 1.05 per cent — the tightest level since the financial crisis — from 1.17 per cent earlier in the year. And the chance of an overhaul of rules on tax repatriation is not the only mooted tax measure that is stirring the US credit market.A significant attraction for US companies to sell debt is the ability to deduct interest expenses from their taxable income, which is subject to a 35 per cent levy. Taking away or at least scaling back this benefit — as proposed by the US administration — would undercut the appeal of selling debt, say analysts.“Interest deductibility really is the wild card,” says Rebecca Cummins, fixed-income analyst at Thornburg Investment Management. “While somewhat hard to believe that it makes it into the final proposal, if it did, it would likely be viewed as a negative for corporate America initially, as highly leveraged companies become more cash flow-constrained without the deduction.”But that also means companies will issue fewer bonds, she says. Even if net interest deductibility proposals fail to become a reality, simply lowering the corporate tax rate will also make issuing debt less attractive, says Jesse Fogarty, a portfolio manager at Insight Investment.A package of tax reform is not without potential stings for the corporate bond market. There will be further pressure on bond prices should any eventual tax deal lead to a shortfall in revenue and force the US Treasury to borrow more.And while investors are not getting carried away given the false starts on tax cuts so far this year, there is an understanding of the strong political incentives both Mr Trump and Congress have to see something passed.“There has been such a lack of progress on policy and now we are getting some movement on the tax plan,” says Mr Fogarty.
28;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-08-30T15:36:10Z;FDA backs Novartis cancer gene therapy;;US drug regulators on Wednesday approved a revolutionary new cancer treatment developed by Novartis, the first time a gene therapy has been made available in the US.The treatment, known as chimeric antigen receptor therapy or Car-T, involves the extraction of patients’ own cells and reprogramming them outside the body to recognise and hunt cancer cells.The US Food and Drug Administration had been expected to grant its formal approval to the Novartis drug, known as Kymriah, after a panel of scientists reporting to the regulator had unanimously recommended it be approved in July. The drug has been approved for younger patients with an aggressive form of paediatric leukaemia.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement:“We’re entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient’s own cells to attack a deadly cancer. New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses.”Swiss-headquartered Novartis had included the drug in its pipeline of possible blockbusters. Analysts believe it could deliver worldwide peak sales of at least $1bn.Other drugmakers have been developing Car-T products, including Kite Pharma, which was snapped up for $11.9bn by Gilead Sciences earlier this week. Kite has submitted its Car-T product, AxiCel, for FDA approval, and a decision is expected in November.Novartis’ New York-listed shares dipped 1 per cent in Wednesday trading.Another drugmaker, Roche, said separately on Wednesday that it had received FDA approval to use of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra to treat cytokine release syndrome, which is caused by an overactive immune response and has been identified as a potentially serious side effect of using Car-T therapies to treat certain cancers.
29;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-08-29T10:19:15Z;US pharma Gilead faces pricing dilemma with new cancer treatment;Near-$12bn purchase of Kite predicated on promising but expensive Car-T therapy;Outside the pharmaceuticals industry, Gilead Sciences is best known as the company that sparked a national outcry over the soaring cost of drugs in the US.When it launched its hepatitis C medicine in 2014, it transformed the fortunes of sufferers with a treatment that could cure them in a matter of months — but the plaudits were drowned out by howls of protest at a price of roughly $1,000 per pill.With its $11.9bn purchase of Kite Pharma on Monday, Gilead is returning to familiar territory: it has acquired a potentially curative therapy that is expected to be among the most expensive of all time.“They’re definitely going to have to price it highly, or they wouldn’t have bought Kite for nearly $12bn,” says Maxim Jacobs, analyst at Edison, who estimates the treatment will go on sale at roughly $750,000 per patient.Kite is one of the leading companies in the pioneering field of chimeric antigen receptor therapy or Car-T, a one-time treatment that involves re-engineering a patient’s blood cells so they can identify and attack cancer.Clinical trials suggest the therapy has great promise in even the most stubborn blood cancers, and a rival version made by Novartis was last month backed unanimously by a panel of scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration.But the therapy is complex and expensive, with a process that involves extracting a patient’s blood cells in hospital, transporting the plasma — normally by air — to a laboratory, and re-engineering them before they are returned.John Milligan, chief executive of Gilead, says there are “some similarities” between the acquisition of Kite and the company’s last big deal: the $11.2bn takeover of Pharmasset in 2012, which brought with it the hepatitis C cure Sovaldi.“Much like Sovaldi, which was a finite treatment, this is a one-time treatment that could cure patients or send them into remission,” he adds.Our intention is to introduce greater automation [into the manufacturing process] . . . We have a challenge to drive costs downHowever, Mr Milligan argues there is a crucial difference.When Gilead launched its hepatitis C drug, there was pent-up demand for a treatment, and the price tag of more than $80,000 per patient put a huge strain on insurers and government health plans.That was good for Gilead’s revenues, which swelled from $9.7bn in 2012 to $32.6bn in 2015, but it turned the company into a lightning rod for anger over the rising price of drugs.Conversely, if Kite’s therapy is approved by the FDA later this year, its use will at first be limited to a small subset of the sickest patients with a type of lymphoma.“The burden on the system as a whole needs to be taken into account and this is a very small number of patients,” says Mr Milligan.However, the near-$12bn Gilead paid for Kite is predicated in large part on the belief that the pool of potential patients will grow substantially over time.If that proves to be the case, Gilead and its rivals in Car-T might be compelled to find ways of cutting the price, in contravention of the standard pharma business model implementing increases each year.“Our intention is to introduce greater automation [into the manufacturing process],” says Mr Milligan. “We have a challenge to drive costs down.”Some biotech investors believe any criticism of the price of Car-T would be unwarranted, given the treatment represents a genuine medical breakthrough that can save the lives of people who would otherwise be dead in weeks.“Not everything with a high price is bad,” says Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Exchange Traded Fund, which has holdings in Kite and other Car-T makers.Mr Loncar says there are some “outrageous” cases of high prices, referencing Mylan’s allergy injector, the Epipen, and the Aids and cancer medicine that brought infamy to Martin Shkreli.“But Car-T is not going to be priced based on greed,” he says, pointing to estimates that put the cost of goods at $200,000 per patient. “This is at the forefront of science — we should want to invest in pushing the envelope forward in cancer like this.”In an analysis published earlier this year, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) suggested Car-T could be worth up to $649,000 if given to children because of the huge numbers of “life years” that could be saved.The report garnered attention because Nice, which acts as a gatekeeper to the National Health Service, is regularly criticised by the pharmaceuticals industry for being too parsimonious.Even so, there are signs that pricing campaigners are preparing to mount a challenge against Gilead, based on the fact that Kite’s treatment was initially developed by researchers at the National Cancer Institute, part of the federally funded National Institutes of Health.Knowledge Ecology International, a campaign group, has called on Congress to ensure Kite’s products are made available on “reasonable terms” by requiring the NIH to enforce rules that govern the commercialisation of federally funded inventions.The campaign group’s previous targets, such as Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug recently acquired by Pfizer, have been taken up by US politicians, including Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate.If the same thing happens this time round, Gilead could find itself at the centre of another pricing row.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, home-improvement retailer Home Depot, however, picked up 1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed nearly flat as well at 2,444, with gains in the healthcare sector — buoyed by biotech stocks, and in particular Gilead Sciences on the heels of its $11.9bn acquisition of Kite Pharma — offset by losses in energy, as shares of oil companies Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips declined.The Nasdaq managed to buck the trend, however, finishing the day with an 0.28 per cent gain at 6,283.The dollar index — measuring the buck against a basket of its peers — was down 0.51 per cent at 92.26, on track for its lowest close since January 2015.Gold, on the other hand, closed above $1,300 a troy ounce for the first time since the week before the US presidential election in November. Both moves have been driven by a lack of clear monetary policy signals out of Janet Yellen’s Jackson Hole speech last week, as well as growing anxieties about the slate of political issues looming over the next few weeks, including Nafta talks and a debate over the debt ceiling.Oil, meanwhile, continued to swing on the latest concerns about Harvey’s effect on the US Gulf coast, a major US refinery hub. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the US standard, was down 2.5 per cent at $46.67, while Brent, the international benchmark, declined 0.8 per cent to $51.97. Gasoline futures, meanwhile, picked up 3.6 per cent to $1.72 a gallon.
31;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Gilead Sciences: high as a Kite;Biotech M&A is about market size bets, not synergies;You must do a deal, the shareholders of Gilead Sciences have insisted to its management. The once high-flying biotech has come down to earth. It had soared for years on the backs of Sovaldi and Harvoni, the $84,000-per-treatment hepatitis C medications. Annual revenue that was once $33bn is predicted to be just $26bn this year. What exactly a deal brings, though, is the riddle. For conventional companies, it is the chance to wring out redundant costs. For drugmakers, perhaps the bet is different. It is a guess that a management team can spot a market opportunity that no one else has appreciated. On Monday Gilead announced it would pay $180 a share in cash for Kite Pharma, or nearly $12bn in all. A year ago, Kite shares traded at $60 a share. Nonetheless, Gilead’s own shares added $2bn in market value on Monday, suggesting that its own shareholders approve.Kite is a pioneer in the new Car-T cancer treatment, where white bloods cells are extracted from the body, re-engineered and then re-implanted. Its key drug Axi-Cel, which treats a type of lymphoma, will probably not get regulatory approval until later this year. Revenues though are expected to exceed $1bn in a few years’ time given treatments could cost several hundred thousand dollars.Gilead partisans note that it had bought Pharmasset in 2012 for a similar sum to Kite. That deal was one of the great heists in merger and acquisition history, leading to Gilead’s gusher in hepatitis medicine. But Car-T is different, as it is not a pill but an intravenous procedure. The different protocol requires not just relationships with physicians but transplant centres. The Car-T field is crowded, too, with rival treatments from Novartis and Juno. The highest analyst price target on Kite before the acquisition was just $155. There is no logical case for adding $2.3bn to Kite’s market value from last week other than that is the price necessary to clear the market. Successful stockpickers rarely have repeated good success. Gilead’s shareholders clearly expect that it has struck gold twice in five years. The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Are pharma execs too willing to pay big M&A premiums?
32;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-08-28T13:18:07Z;US drugmaker Gilead agrees $12bn deal to buy rival Kite Pharma;Deal validates Kite’s Car-T treatment for cancer by re-engineering white blood cells;Gilead Sciences has reached an $11.9bn agreement to acquire Kite Pharma, adding a cutting edge cancer treatment to its portfolio and ending the biotech company’s long search for a sizeable deal.The California-based biotech group will pay $180 in cash per share for Kite, which makes an experimental treatment that re-engineers a patient’s white blood cells so they can attack cancer, known as chimeric antigen therapy or Car-T. The process involves extracting a person’s cells, transporting them to a lab — usually by aeroplane — and re-engineering them before they are returned. Gilead is paying a 50 per cent premium to the company’s 30-day volume weighted average stock price, a hefty price for a group that does not yet have any drugs on the market. “The acquisition of Kite establishes Gilead as a leader in cellular therapy and provides a foundation from which to drive continued innovation for people with advanced cancers,” said John Milligan, Gilead’s chief executive. For Gilead, the takeover of Kite culminates a long search for a blockbuster deal, the largest since it acquired Pharmasset for $11bn six years ago.Kite’s Car-T product, AxiCel, has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, although the company has applied for permission to market the drug and is expecting a decision in November. Analysts are predicting it will win a green light after a rival product made by Novartis was approved last month. The acquisition will be seen as a major validation of Car-T, a treatment that has been developed at breakneck speed compared to traditional drugs, with some remarkable results, but which has also raised concerns amid a spate of patient deaths on clinical trials. There also questions about whether the manufacturing of Car-T products can ever be done at commercial scale. Shares in other Car-T manufacturers shot up in pre-market trading in New York, with Juno adding nearly 14 per cent and Bluebird bio up 7 per cent. Global drugmakers have been rushing in recent years to acquire new assets in emerging fields as they re-stock their pipelines with drugs that have fresh patents amid pricing pressure from cash-strapped governments and health insurers. Gilead’s need for a deal was particularly acute: it was once the envy of the biotech world for its expensive cure for hepatitis C, which worked out at $1,000 per pill at one point, but it has struggled in the past year amid fierce competition and a declining number of patients left to treat. The company has been searching for a deal target since at least December 2015, when its chief scientist told the Financial Times it was “looking for opportunities”. After a three-year long mergers and acquisition frenzy in the pharmaceutical sector, deal activity has slowed since Donald Trump became US president as several drugmakers have been waiting for greater clarity on drug pricing and tax reform. Gilead’s decision to go ahead with a major deal could lead other large companies to follow suit with their own acquisitions as expectations of major reforms are waning, said an adviser working closely with several drugmakers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard are acting as financial advisers to Gilead. Centerview Partners is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Kite. Jefferies and Cowen & Company also provided advice to Kite.Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is serving as legal counsel to Gilead and Sullivan & Cromwell and Cooley are serving as legal counsel to Kite.

36;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-08-08T00:06:54Z;US blue-chips’ double-digit earnings set to continue;Rate of growth in back-to-back quarters comes despite lack of progress on Trump agenda;US blue-chip companies are poised to report the first back-to-back quarters of double-digit earnings growth since 2011, underpinning fresh highs on Wall Street despite a lack of progress on the Trump agenda in Washington.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to fresh highs on Tuesday boosted in recent months by earnings gains on the back of a global economic recovery and weakening US dollar.“As long as we have the earnings growth, no one seems to care that President Trump’s agenda doesn’t have a lot of traction,” said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis.Continued momentum for earnings will be crucial as Congress comes back from the summer holidays to grapple with issues including tax reform and raising the US debt ceiling while the Federal Reserve debates further rate increases this year.“If you are no longer expecting the sugar high of tax cuts out of Washington, it becomes more important that companies deliver on the bottom line,” said Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at BlackRock.With 87 per cent of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported their earnings for the past quarter, a blended rate of the actual results and analysts’ forecasts indicate that earnings rose 10.1 per cent per share year-on-year, according to FactSet.That put companies on track for the second-highest year-on-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2011. It is also the first time companies in the index have seen two consecutive quarters of double-digit growth since the third and fourth quarters of 2011.Before the results’ season opened, estimates were for an increase of just 6.4 per cent in EPS.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 and Dow were both down 0.2 per cent, amid rising geopolitical tensions.A rebound in the energy sector from a period of stress in 2016 when oil prices fell sharply has helped to boost overall earnings growth in the second quarter. The year-over-year comparisons become more difficult looking forward, which is one reason why expectations for third-quarter earnings growth are for a fall to 5.4 per cent.Led by the healthcare, financials and information technology sectors, more companies beat expectations and by a wider margin than the five-year averages. Among the companies which beat expectations comfortably were Apple, Gilead Sciences and JPMorgan Chase.The return of earnings growth in the US comes after a five-quarter run of shrinking earnings that ended in the third quarter of last year and has helped to underpin valuations above long-term averages.“Following the mini recession with respect to profits, growth has been widespread and stronger than expected,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “Weakness in the US dollar has driven markets higher and will be supportive of corporate earnings.”Some 10 of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were showing earnings growth in the second quarter.Small capitalisation stocks have by contrast lagged behind their bigger counterparts this year. These smaller businesses have less international exposure and as such have been more vulnerable to what are perceived as delays on the Trump agenda. They pay higher tax rates and don’t benefit from having cash flows in different countries with different tax regimes.

Net income was $3.1bn, or $2.33 a diluted share, compared to $3.5bn and $2.58 a share in the year-ago period. Profits were still comfortably ahead of the $2.53bn, or $2 a share, that analysts had expected.The better-than-expected results — despite the ongoing decline of Gilead’s hepatitis C (HCV) portfolio — prompted the company to boost its full-year guidance. It is now looking for net product sales in the range of $24bn-$25bn, compared the previous range of $22.5bn to $24.5bn. HCV drugs are expected now to bring in $8.5bn to $9.5bn, up from its previous range of $7.5bn to $9bn, while non-HCV drug sales are forecast to come in at $15.5bn-$16bn, up from $15bn to $15.5bn.Adjusted for special items, diluted earnings per share are now seen in the range of 86 cents to 93 cents, versus the previous guidance of 84-91 cents a share.The company’s shares were lifted 2 per cent higher in after-hours trading following the announcement, before trimming those gains to trade up 1.2 per cent.

The US Centers for Disease Control believes there are roughly 20,000 fatalities each year from chronic liver disease or cirrhosis that are not related to alcoholism.Drugmakers are betting that the number of people with Nash — which is more common in overweight people — will rise dramatically in the coming years because of the worldwide obesity epidemic. Some analysts are predicting the global market for Nash medicines will be worth as much as $35bn a year at its peak.There are no approved drugs to treat the condition but pharmaceutical groups are studying more than 25 experimental compounds in humans, with four medicines either being studied in phase III clinical trials, or about to enter this final stage of testing.Of the large drugmakers, Allergan is furthest ahead, having spent $1.7bn to acquire Tobira, a San Francisco biotech group, in November last year. Tobira’s main medicine, Cenicriviroc, will enter phase three trials later this year with results expected as early as 2019.Allergan recently acquired another smaller Nash-focused drugmaker, Arkana, for $50m.“Nash is now the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer, having taken over from hepatitis C,” says Dr David Nicholson, Allergan’s chief research and development officer. “And at the moment, there’s nothing out there to treat it.”Gilead has entered the field too, recently acquiring Nimbus for up to $1.2bn, while also investing heavily in its internal research efforts. The West Coast-based biotech company has already had huge success with its treatments for hepatitis C, another potentially fatal liver disease.Several other well-known pharmaceutical groups, including Novo Nordisk and Shire are working on Nash drugs at an earlier stage of development.I’m sceptical as to whether [taking a drug for life] is actually needed for most peopleHowever, the two companies that are most advanced do not come from the ranks of big pharma: Intercept Therapeutics, a New York-based biotech group, and GenFit, its French rival.Shares in Intercept jumped 13 per cent last week after the company said it had redesigned a late-stage clinical trial of its drug, obeticholic acid, in a way that would make it easier for the study to succeed.Following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, Intercept said the trial must now show that the drug can either resolve Nash or improve “fibrosis” — the medical term for liver scarring. Previously, the company would have had to prove the medicine could do both.Intercept also said it would be able to analyse the data once it had enrolled 750 patients, rather than 1,400, after the process of recruiting patients to the trial took longer than the company had originally expected.The changes reflect the flexibility of regulators at the FDA, who want to encourage drugmakers to invest in researching medicines for the untreatable condition before the number of sufferers increases rapidly.However, the sluggish recruitment to Intercept’s trial is indicative of one of the biggest hurdles facing Nash drugmakers: the disease is very difficult to diagnose.The vast majority of people do not realise they have the “silent” disease, which only causes symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue and weight loss in the very late stages.Doctors sometimes suspect a patient has Nash when they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood or when they spot abnormalities during ultrasound scans.But the only surefire way of diagnosing the disease is to carry out a liver biopsy — a complex, invasive procedure that requires an anaesthetic. In rare cases, the biopsy can cause bleeding that requires a transfusion or surgery.Many patients are reluctant to undergo the procedure, which poses a difficulty not just for recruiting them to clinical trials, but also convincing people in the real world to get tested for the condition.Drugmakers are hoping that less invasive tests will be developed that use biological clues or “biomarkers” to diagnose the disease without the need for a biopsy.“We really believe that there will be big breakthroughs that will make it much easier for physicians to diagnose the disease and subsequently to utilise the drugs in development,” says Dr Nicholson.One option is a simple breath test, according to Dr Ilan Yaron, chief medical officer of Tiz Pharma, a London-based biotech group that is about to start testing its Nash drug in humans. “The FDA does not recognise these tests yet, but it will in time,” he says.However, even if drugmakers find a reliable, non-invasive way of diagnosing the disease, there is no guarantee that Nash sufferers will rush to start taking their medicines.The disease progresses slowly and many sufferers will die of something else; given the lack of symptoms, people could be wary of taking a drug for life when they feel perfectly well.“I’m sceptical as to whether this is actually needed for most people,” says Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein. “You’re essentially trying to put into chronic treatment forever a broad population that will probably never develop the most serious form of the disease.”Cash-strapped healthcare systems could resist paying for the drug in all but the sickest patients, predicts Mr Gal. These number approximately 1.5m in the US.For that reason, he believes the market for Nash drugs will be much smaller than many others on Wall Street are expecting, and is pencilling in peak sales of $8bn for what he describes as a “midsize condition”.“If you take all the people with advanced Nash and ask how many people will end up becoming seriously ill in their lifetimes, the number could actually be very small,” he says."
40;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-02-13T23:45:58Z;GSK claims new HIV combination therapy will be ‘less harmful’;Two-drug cocktail aims to reduce amount of medicine patients take each day;GlaxoSmithKline claimed that its new HIV treatment would be “less harmful and less hassle” than current therapies, as it unveiled clinical trial results for a two-drug cocktail designed to reduce the amount of medicine that patients must take each day.Most HIV patients take a single daily pill containing three or four different medicines but there are concerns that such a large “drug burden” could prove problematic as people become older and start receiving treatments for other common conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis.GSK on Monday published the full results of a large, late-stage clinical trial showing that a two-drug combination of its medicine Tivicay along with Edurant, made by Johnson & Johnson, was just as effective for patients switching from existing treatments.The two-drug regimen achieved “virological success” — suppressing the virus to undetectable levels — in 95 per cent of patients who switched over to the new cocktail, according to data released at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle.That was the same level as for those patients who continued on their existing three or four-drug treatments, according to the study.GSK intends to seek approval for the cocktail in the US and Europe in the first half of this year.“We asked if there was a way to reduce the number of drugs because it is less harmful and less hassle,” said Dominique Limet, chief executive of Viiv, a joint venture focused on HIV that is majority-owned by GSK.“It is less risky for the long term because there is less toxicity with fewer drugs,” he added.Patients who moved over to the two-drug regimen experienced more side effects and a small number had to stop taking the new treatment as a result, although Mr Limet said this was common for those switching from one treatment to another.The data come at a time of increased innovation in the arena of HIV after GSK introduced Tivicay, a so-called integrase inhibitor, in 2013.GSK is also testing whether another integrase inhibitor is effective as part of a long-acting injection that would be administered just once a month to HIV patients, or once every eight weeks as a way of preventing people from contracting the virus in the first place.GSK expects to publish the results of late-stage clinical trials of the injections at the end of next year.The success of Tivicay, which is already used in some three or four-drug treatments, poses a challenge to Gilead, the US biotech group whose “backbone” drugs have been a mainstay of HIV treatment for years.“The first two-drug regimen in one tablet will create a major competitive threat to Gilead,” said Mr Limet.Gilead itself is due to publish the results of a mid-stage study of its own integrate inhibitor at CROI, which pits the drug in a head-to-head trial against Tivicay.Analysts at Barclays predicted that the drug, Bictegravir, could “displace” GSK’s Tivicay and “further consolidate Gilead’s dominant position in HIV”.Gilead posted total HIV revenue of $12.8bn in 2016, while Viiv has annual revenues of roughly £3.6bnViiv is a HIV-focused joint venture with Pfizer and Japan’s Shionogi in which GSK has a majority stake of 78 per cent.
41;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2017-02-08T21:44:46Z;Gilead tumbles following sales warning;Broader Nasdaq biotechnology index also sees declines;Drugmaker Gilead saw its shares tumble 8.6 per cent to $66.83 on Wednesday alongside broad declines for the biotech industry, as the company announced that sales of its cures for hepatitis C would be lower than expected this year.The drugs, including Sovaldi and Harvoni, are capable of curing hepatitis C, and initially brought fame and blockbuster revenues to Gilead.But the company is beginning to suffer from a perfect storm, amid pricing pressure stemming from the initial price tag of $1,000 a pill, competition from rival groups AbbVie and Merck, and a smaller pool of patients that still need to be treated.The company said it expected its hepatitis C products to generate between $7.5bn and $9bn of revenue in 2017, well below the typical analyst estimate of $11.5bn. It sent its share price dramatically lower, hitting levels last seen in April 2014, having been trending lower since mid-2015.The broader Nasdaq biotechnology index also saw declines, dipping 0.2 per cent by the close in New York.Stronger performance came for Allergan, the maker of wrinkle smoother Botox, as it reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 3.7 per cent to $241.17.The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.90 a share during the final three months of last year on revenues of $3.86bn. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to post adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 on sales of $3.8bn.Healthcare insurer Humana reported losses on Wednesday but saw its stock price rebound from early morning declines to trade up 2.3 per cent to $199.64 at the close.The S&P 500’s healthcare index fell 0.1 per cent, while the index as a whole rose 0.1 per cent to 2,294. Investor caution continued in light of political backlash over President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks and his legally contentious temporary travel ban against seven Muslim-majority nations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 20,054 and the Nasdaq Composite recovered earlier lost ground to end up 0.2 per cent at 5,682.Financials was the worst-performing sector on the S&P 500, dropping 0.8 per cent, with energy stocks battling against further declines in oil prices, falling 0.1 per cent. Haven assets, such as gold and US Treasuries, saw prices rise.Elsewhere, tyremaker Goodyear suffered a net sales drop of 7.9 per cent to $3.7bn in the final three months of last year as it sold fewer tyres in its important Americas market, despite booming US car sales.The market had expected sales to come in at $3.87bn. It pushed the company’s stock price down 0.3 per cent to $32.13.Net income was $561m for the quarter, compared with a loss of $380m in the previous period when results were marred by a large charge related to deconsolidation of its Venezuela operations.Excluding this, adjusted net income decreased 3.1 per cent to $249m, or 95 cents a share, compared with $257m, or 93 cents a share, in 2015. However, the drop beat analysts’ expectations of $226.8m.

43;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;The ‘final nail in the coffin’ for Aids?;A surge in the use of preventative drugs is reducing risk but with more than 36m people living with HIV a huge challenge remains;"Will Nutland is not infected with HIV, yet he has been taking an Aids drug for just under a year. As a doctor, he says his primary motive is to act as “a guinea pig” but as a gay man he is also taking it to prevent him contracting the human immunodeficiency virus that can lead to Aids.He takes Truvada, a pill introduced by the US drug company Gilead in 2004 as an antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV but since developed for pre-exposure prophylaxis — generally known as PrEP — for those at risk of infection.Around the world, hundreds of thousands have been taking PrEP on a daily basis for several years, yet Dr Nutland, who bought his blue lozenge-shaped pills online, is only one of a handful of people in the UK taking the medicine.The question for many — both activists and clinicians — is whether greater use of PrEP alongside more widespread diagnosis and early treatment could finally herald the end of HIV/Aids. The combination of the prophylactic for those who are HIV-negative with effective antiretroviral drugs, which suppress the virus in those who test positive, offers a chance to manage the disease out of existence, suggests Tony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.NIAID, with other public agencies and companies, is developing long-acting forms of HIV prevention with formulations of antiretroviral drugs that need only be administered monthly or even annually. These include intravaginal rings, slow-release implants and long-acting injections. Viiv, GlaxoSmithKline’s majority-owned subsidiary focusing on Aids, is carrying out clinical trials of a new antiretroviral called cabotegravir, given as monthly injections on its own or combined with other drugs.But PrEP drugs cannot put an end to HIV/Aids on their own, Dr Fauci warns. They will have to be coupled with other approaches including a vaccine that prevents infection. “If deployed alongside our current armoury of HIV prevention tools,” he says, the combination “could be the final nail in the coffin for HIV”.Truvada was first licensed for PrEP by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2012, and subsequent studies in San Francisco and New York have seen a dramatic reduction in the transmission rates of HIV among gay men in those cities. Truvada, which is a combination of two HIV medications, tenofovir and emtricitabine, is 86 per cent effective at blocking the pathways that HIV uses to set up an infection, according to Aids.gov, a US government website.In the US, a course of 30 PrEP tablets costs just over $1,500, most of which insurance companies will cover — justifying the expense as cheaper than that of covering people living with HIV/Aids.17%Fall in San Francisco infection rates in 2015. About 20% of gay and bisexual men in the city use PrEPInfections in San Francisco dropped 17 per cent in 2015 compared with the year before, down from 309 to 255, after an 18 per cent annual fall in 2014. The city authorities ascribe the decline to its Getting to Zero campaign, a policy of promoting early diagnosis and rapid access to antiretroviral therapy for those who are HIV positive, ensuring infected people remain in care, and extending PrEP use to those who are negative but are deemed high risk. Approximately 20 per cent of the city’s 30,000 gay and bisexual male population are thought to be using PrEP.The US is not alone. France, Norway, Australia, Israel, Canada, Kenya and South Africa have all approved PrEP use.In the UK, the treatment has become the latest battleground in the funding of drugs to prevent the spread of HIV/Aids. In November, the Court of Appeal ruled against the National Health Service, which had contested a High Court judgment that would force it to offer PrEP on request. The NHS estimates this would cost £10m-£20m a year. A daily course of Truvada costs about £400 a month.The National Aids Trust, which took the NHS to court, suggested that the overall cost of caring for someone with HIV or Aids was much higher. A 30-year-old man infected today is likely to cost the health service in the UK almost £400,000 over his lifetime. Given that there are approximately 104,000 people in the UK living with HIV, the total bill, without taking into account new infections, could cost the NHS £41.6bn.Just before Christmas, the NHS announced a £10m, three-year clinical trial, involving 10,000 HIV-negative participants to gauge the efficacy of PrEP.The NHS’s sexual health clinic at 56 Dean Street in London is the only NHS clinic offering PrEP at cost price in the UK. Over the past 12 months, it has seen a fall of 40 per cent, from 626 in 2015 to 373 last year, in the number of transmissions it has recorded.“We were determined that 2016 would be the year that London learnt from San Francisco’s success,” says Dr Alan McOwan, the centre’s lead clinician.“This drop in new HIV diagnoses could be really significant. The impact could spread across the UK thanks to better HIV awareness, frequent testing, early treatment and use of prevention methods such as PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis] and PrEP in key populations,” he says.For the pharmaceuticals industry, HIV/Aids is a growing market. The Joint UN Programme on HIV/Aids estimates that the number of people worldwide on antiretroviral therapies rose by 1m during the first half of 2016, reaching 18.2m. Gilead, the leading provider, reported total product sales of $32.2bn for 2015, up 31 per cent on the year before. Truvada sales in the US alone grew 15 per cent to $2.1bn in 2015, with the global figure hitting $3.5bn.According to Datamonitor Healthcare, which tracks the sector, approximately one-third of Truvada’s use in the US was attributed to PrEP, rather than antiretroviral treatment. As yet, Truvada is the only PrEP drug recognised by world health organisations.40%Fall in transmission cases in 2016 at a UK clinic where PrEP is prescribed at costWhile transmission rates around the world are falling they remain stubbornly high. Globally, UNAids reports that there were 36.7m living with HIV at the end of 2015, double the numbers on antiretroviral therapy. An estimated 2.1m people became HIV positive in 2015, down from 3.2m in 2000.Sub-Saharan Africa remains worst affected, with UNAids estimating in 2014 that 4.4 per cent of the adult population live with HIV. Nearly 70 per cent of those infected with HIV worldwide live in the region and they are gaining access to antiretroviral therapy, but not as comprehensively as in developed countries. UNAids warned in 2014 that 54 per cent — some 19m people globally — remain unaware of their status.With so many infected, questions remain of how struggling health services can afford the burden of providing PrEP on demand. Yet for Ford Hickson, assistant professor in health promotion at Sigma Research, part of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, this misses the point.“In the public domain, in newspapers and the media, the way it [PrEP] is debated is not about reducing misery and keeping people healthy; the debate is about saving money and whether we should spend money on these people,” he says.36.7mPeople living with HIV at the end of 2015; 70% are in sub-Saharan AfricaFor Dr Hickson and many activists, the argument in the UK over PrEP provision has unfortunate moral overtones of the early 1980s, when health services around the world were slow to respond to the growing issue of HIV/Aids. But while activists and clinicians argue about the costs and benefits of PrEP, many people around the world are still becoming infected with the virus.Philip Christopher Baldwin discovered he was HIV positive in 2010. Aged 24, he had just started working in the City of London as a lawyer.“I thought at the time it might completely destroy my life,” Mr Baldwin says. “I knew very little about what it was to be HIV positive, and then went through a process of acceptance coming to terms with my HIV and that took several years.”While the diagnosis may no longer mean a death sentence, for many the stigma remains. “There is still a massive amount of work to be done around HIV awareness,” he adds.The dilemma facing both pharmaceutical companies and health organisations is how to ensure people get tested and to determine the best method of prevention. Some believe the combination of PrEP and the promotion of early testing and diagnosis could be the answer to reducing HIV transmission.This is at the heart of the debate surrounding PrEP: is it a promiscuity pill? Would it encourage those in the most at-risk group — gay men — to ditch condoms altogether?Certainly, some members of the gay community think it could. Michael Weinstein, head of the Los Angeles-based Aids Healthcare Foundation, which last year issued 14,000 HIV tests and gave away 38.5m condoms, initially declared PrEP to be a “party drug” and a “public health disaster in the making”. Although the foundation has since made clear that it is not against PrEP, Mr Weinstein suggests that those most at risk will not adhere to taking a pill a day.Sigma’s Dr Hickson says: “What we need to see are changes in testing policy and, consequently, practices. It’s not about the psychology of the men involved, but about the behaviour of the service — whether you get offered PrEP or not.”Discussing the question of promiscuity among gay men is fraught with difficulties. Accusations of homophobia are easy to level, and questions about whether gay men are more sexually active than their straight counterparts have long proved controversial. Add a prevalence of recreational drugs among certain groups and the question of safe sex becomes even more pressing.2.1mPeople who became HIV positive in 2015, down from 3.2m in 2000“Some people have portrayed PrEP use as irresponsible,” says Dr Nutland. “But I think it’s totally the opposite. It’s an immensely responsible thing to do, particularly if you are one of those guys who doesn’t consistently use condoms.”For Mr Baldwin, who is healthy — he sees his specialist every three to six months — and successful, there is no reason for others to experience what he went through, he says.“We need to see PrEP available as soon as possible,” Mr Baldwin says. “Every day, 17 people are diagnosed with HIV [in the UK] and PrEP is an important tool in the kit for confronting the disease.”Researchers have been pouring resources into work on an HIV vaccine for more than two decades, without much success.“The development of an HIV vaccine is probably the greatest challenge that biomedical science has taken on in the public health arena,” says Mark Feinberg, chief executive of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, a public-private partnership working to accelerate the development of vaccines.The changeability and variability of HIV, together with the way it undermines the immune system, make it a particularly challenging target.The next step is a large trial in South Africa of an experimental vaccine called HVTN 702, an improved version of a treatment that showed modest efficacy in an earlier clinical study in Thailand. Over coming months 5,400 HIV-negative volunteers will receive HVTN 702 or a placebo, and researchers will compare infection rates between the two groups.Paul Stoffels, a veteran of the battle against Aids and chief scientist at US pharmaceutical group Johnson & Johnson, warns against over-optimism: “Some people say the end of HIV is in sight — forget that idea,” he says. “We are nowhere near the end of the epidemic.”J&J is developing three different potential Aids treatments. In November the company suggested in a study published in the journal Nature that a new “therapeutic vaccine” given to people with HIV could lead to a “functional cure”: HIV would be suppressed indefinitely to undetectable levels, without patients needing to take antiviral drugs.Clinical trials of the therapeutic vaccine on people with HIV are getting under way, following positive results in monkeys infected with a closely related virus.“Our goal is to . . . have a functional cure, which would keep patients’ virus under check without the life-long burden of being on treatments, and ultimately to have a preventative vaccine that stops HIV in the first place,” says Dr Stoffels."

The lawsuit was brought by Idenix, which Merck purchased in 2014 in order to boost its portfolio of treatments for hepatitis C, a potentially fatal liver disease.Gilead had disputed that it had relied on Idenix’s intellectual property in making its blockbuster drugs, and said the patent was invalid. Jurors, however, found that Gilead had willfully infringed the patent at issue.A spokesperson for Gilead said:Gilead respectfully disagrees with the jury’s verdict and damage award, and intends to vigorously challenge this outcome through the appeal process. We remain steadfast in our opinion that Idenix’s U.S. patent is invalid, and since they made no contribution and assumed none of the risk in the discovery and development of sofosbuvir and its metabolites, do not believe they are entitled to any level of damages.This ruling does not impact on our ability to continue to make sofosbuvir, and sofosbuvir-containing products available to patients in the U.S.Sofosbuvir is sold under the name Sovaldi.Merck said in a statement that the finding of willful infringement allows the judge overseeing the case to increase the amount of damages by as much as three times the original award.“The jury’s verdict upholds patent protections that are essential to the development of new medical treatments,” Merck said in a statement.Gilead shares fell 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading following the verdict’s announcement, while Merck shares bounced 1 per cent.

The HCV franchise accounts for nearly half of the company’s overall revenues and third quarter sales of the two-biggest hep C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi, also missed Wall Street’s estimates for $3.3bn.Moreover, sales of Truvada, the company’s HIV drug, slowed to $858m, from $942m the previous quarter and down five per cent year-on-year. That was also shy of analysts’ expectations for $902.6m.Slowing drug sales saw the California-based company’s overall revenue fall 9.5 per cent year on year to $7.5bn, just ahead of analysts’ estimates.Profits slowed to $3.3bn or $2.49 a share in the third quarter, compared with $4.6bn or $3.06 a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.75 a share missed estimates for $2.85 a share.Gilead shares have declined 27 per cent so far this year.
46;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-08-22T17:24:11Z;Pfizer makes $14bn bet on cancer drugmaker Medivation;World’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals company aims to become leading player in oncology;Pfizer unveiled its biggest takeover of a cancer company in its 167-year history on Monday — the $14bn acquisition of Californian biotech Medivation — following a hotly-contested auction of the sought-after drugmaker.The deal comes as the world’s second largest drugmaker by value tries to turn itself into a leading player in oncology, able to capitalise on rapid scientific advances that have led to the discovery of a string of revolutionary cancer medicines that command high prices.Ian Read, chief executive, said he wanted to build a “leadership position in oncology with flagship products” during a call to discuss the deal with analysts.Pfizer said it would pay roughly $81.50 in cash for each share in Medivation, which was founded in 2004, giving the company an enterprise value of more than $14bn.The price represents a premium of 120 per cent over Medivation’s stock price at the end of March, when the company said it had hired bankers to defend itself against a hostile bidder, which turned out to be Sanofi, the French drugmaker. In February, Medivation shares were changing hands for as little as $27.32 each.Medivation shares jumped by a fifth to $80.42 by lunchtime in New York. Pfizer slipped 0.25 per cent to $34.90.Sanofi, which had given up on a hostile takeover of Medivation to enter friendly talks with the company, on Monday said it had “appreciated the opportunity to have engaged constructively,” but that it was “first and foremost a disciplined acquirer”.Merck, Gilead and Celgene also held talks with Medivation, according to people familiar with the negotiations.“While Pfizer is described as having ‘beaten’ other companies in this competitive bid, is this something to be proud of,” asked Tim Anderson, an analyst at Bernstein.“At first pass, paying $80-plus per share for a stock that was trading in the $30s just a few months ago feels pricey,” he added.Mr Read said: “The process was efficient and competitive and we think we tied a fair price to the asset.”Mr Read had been preparing investors for a large deal to grow the part of Pfizer that develops innovative medicines since April, when his attempt to buy Dublin-based Allergan for $160bn was thwarted by the Obama administration, which wanted to stop the company relocating to low-tax Ireland.San Francisco-based Medivation makes the world’s best-selling prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, which is forecast to generate $5.7bn in annual revenues by 2020. It is also developing an experimental drug called Talazoparib, designed to stop tumour cells from multiplying by damaging their DNA, and Pidilizumab, a medicine that could help patients suffering from lymphoma.Pfizer is best known for selling drugs prescribed by family doctors, such as Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering statin, and Viagra, the male impotence pill, but in recent years it has started building a large oncology franchise, which has been buoyed by the success of Ibrance, a blockbuster cancer drug.Last year it lost out in the race to buy Pharmacyclics, the maker of a best-selling drug for a type of blood cancer, which was eventually taken over by AbbVie for $21bn.
47;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-08-17T17:03:01Z;Gilead: breaking the fever;It is better to be cheap than stupid;Gilead’s strategic conundrum is so acute that it forced one analyst to come right out and advocate what most short-sellers only gesture at: a short-term fix likely to destroy value over the long term. He wrote, a few months ago, that “the time appears ripe for Gilead to do a significant transaction.” Of course, “options for the type of M&A that Gilead may need could prove to be limited” and “a series of smaller tuck-in deals may be prudent for the long term.” All the same, it is hard to see how those could whip up “near-term revenue trajectory (or sentiment).”One can only sympathise with the poor fellow. Gilead’s shares are off by a third since the middle of last year, after a three-year run in which they sextupled on the back of breakthrough Hepatitis C vaccines. HCV sales now appear locked in slow decline. All the same, one desperately wants a reason to own the stock. It trades at seven times earnings, making it the cheapest big drug stock in the world. It generates oceans of cash and has no net debt. There has to be something Gilead can do shed its discount. Right?What Gilead is trying is share repurchases. It is not working. Since 2014 it has spent $24bn, almost a quarter of the current market cap, buying its own shares. The shares are 22 per cent below the average price paid. Buying back shares in the face of falling profits is very chancy. Pfizer managed to keep its shares rising following the expiration of the patent on Liptitor, buying back $45bn in shares between 2011 and 2015. Pfizer also had massive cost-cutting opportunities, though. Gilead is admirably lean already.The quickest way to cut the discount would be to sell the company. At a 30 per cent premium, it would be a $140bn deal, the biggest drug deal after Pfizer’s $160bn purchase of Allergan. Would, say, Merck be interested, if Gilead would take shares as payment? Conceivably. But hoping a big spender appears is not a strategy.And so to buying growth. Gilead’s $11bn purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 was risky, but turned out to be one of the best deals ever. But whenever a good-sized biotech asset is on the block (Medivation, the target of the moment, has five companies interested) a wild money fight breaks out. The chance of overpaying is high.Gilead’s puzzle has only one good solution: patience. Invest in research, do small deals, stay lean — and endure a low valuation for a few more years.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
48;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-07-06T17:57:19Z;Medivation: scarcity value;All mid-sized biotechs get bought eventually;One must be a careful about criticising big pharma companies for splashing the cash on smaller, essentially one-product companies. Sometimes the strategy works. In 2011, when Gilead announced that it would pay $11bn for Pharmasset and its unproven Hepatitis C drug Sofosbuvir, there were gripes, and the shares fell 10 per cent. Over the next four years, Gilead shares quadrupled. Products based on Sofosbuvir had sales of $19bn last year.Even so, it is fair to question the rationality of the eager courtship of Medivation, the US biotech company. Pfizer, Sanofi and Celgene are all talking to the company. The bill will surely be upwards of $10bn. The prize is Xtandi, a prostate cancer treatment with $2.1bn in sales in the last year.Put aside the nasty process which led to the discussions (Sanofi had to threaten to replace Medivation’s board) and stick to the economics. All three suitors are big enough to come up with the money without damaging their capital structures. The question is whether they earn a strong return. The disanalogy with Sofosbuvir is worth noting. That drug had still to be approved, and results from its biggest clinical trial were still unknown. Xtandi is already on the market, which brings a degree of certainty. At the same time, though, its sales in the US have been flattish for the last four quarters, and international growth is slowing. There have been rumblings about the drug’s high price.The hard fact is, however, that the big pharmas have more financial capacity than they have growth. They need to do deals. And there are very few assets of any scale out there, especially in desirable areas such as oncology. There will be plenty of bids.This says more about big pharma than Medivation. They are very profitable, generate heaps of cash, and look cheap on standard metrics. The cheapness, however, is less an opportunity than a reflection of the fact that a big slice of those profits will inevitably go on chancy deals.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

50;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-03-31T20:53:34Z;Telecoms and utilities lead quarterly gains for S&P 500;Healthcare and financials are the two big sectors that end the period in the red;The US telecommunications and utilities sectors widely outperformed in the first quarter as the Federal Reserve scaled back its expectations for raising borrowing costs this year.Many strategists forecast a tepid performance from defensive stocks when the first quarter began, adopting the view that a stronger US economy and tighter policy from the Fed would dull investor interest in sectors such as telecoms and utilities.Compared to a 0.8 per cent quarterly rise for the S&P 500, the telecom index stands 15.1 per cent higher for the first quarter, while the utilities index has rallied 14.5 per cent. Telecoms has recorded its best quarterly gain since 2010, while the performance of utilities ranks as the best three month stretch since 2003.Among the main telecoms companies in the S&P, Verizon Communications, a blue-chip telecoms group, rallied 17 per cent to $54.08, while AT&T advanced 13.8 per cent to $39.17.In utilities, Consolidated Edison, a power utility, rose 19.3 per cent to $76.62.On the other side of the spectrum, the two big sectors that ended the quarter in the red were healthcare and financials. Healthcare fell 5.9 per cent, while financials declined 5.6 per cent.Biotechnology stocks sustained a particularly strong hit, with the sector sliding 13.3 per cent, as investors moved away from stocks that are seen as risky and grew more worried about potential regulatory action on drug prices.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals dropped by a third to $360.44, while Gilead, the biggest group in the sector, dropped 9.2 per cent.Financials, meanwhile, came under pressure as the odds for a Fed rate rise for 2016 dimmed and yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped. Banks earn profits on the difference in the rate they pay for funds and what they earn on loans, so lower-for-longer rates are seen crimping their net interest margins.In addition, there have been lingering concerns about lenders’ exposure to the embattled energy sector. Indeed, Fitch said earlier this month that the default rate among the riskiest US corporate borrowers may hit its highest level ever outside a recession this year.On Thursday the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,059.74, posting a quarterly gain of 0.8 per cent. That leaves the benchmark about 3 per cent below its record closing high of 2,130.82 set in May 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by the same margin on the day to 17,685.09, locking in a first-quarter advance of 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was nearly unchanged on Thursday at 4,869.85, logging a quarterly loss of 2.8 per cent.The S&P 500’s mild first-quarter rise belies the intense volatility that sent the market barometer falling more than 11 per cent for the year at one point. But a stabilisation in the price of oil, brighter sentiment on the US economy and action by global central banks stoked a sharp rebound late in the quarter. The CBOE’s Vix, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, was at 13.95 on Thursday, down from a quarterly peak of 28 in mid-February.
51;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-02-25T14:08:49Z;HIV unit emerges as ‘critical’ driver of GSK growth;Promising treatments and surging sales at ViiV arm put UK drugmaker on course to hit targets;"It is only a year since GlaxoSmithKline was considering a spin-off of its HIV unit as a way to unlock value for disgruntled shareholders. The option was rejected and now the business, known as ViiV Healthcare, is playing an increasingly important role in efforts to return the UK drugmaker to growth.GSK this week reported positive progress on a new long-lasting treatment under development by ViiV even as its existing drugs expand their share of the $20bn-a-year global HIV market from rivals including Gilead Sciences.ViiV’s contribution to GSK operating profits has increased from 16 per cent in 2014 to 29 per cent last year and is forecast by UBS to reach almost half by 2020.This is partly a reflection of the decline of GSK’s once-mighty respiratory business but surging growth in ViiV has accelerated the shift. Sales of HIV drugs rose 54 per cent last year to £2.3bn compared with a 7 per cent fall in the broader pharmaceuticals business. ViiV’s operating profits were up 72 per cent at £1.7bn, compared with a 12 per cent drop in the wider pharma business.Alexandra Hauber, analyst at UBS, says ViiV is “critical” to GSK’s promise of renewed growth over the next five years as its best-selling Advair asthma drug faces generic competition. “The main reason why investors can be confident that GSK should deliver its 2020 targets is ViiV,” she says.For critics of Sir Andrew Witty, GSK chief executive, the group’s growing reliance on a business he was previously willing to partially divest is evidence of strategic muddle. His allies say the review of ViiV’s future was a healthy exercise that focused attention on the HIV portfolio and ended with all parties — management, board and most investors — in agreement that it was too good to give up.GSK’s roots in the HIV market are deep. One of its predecessor companies, Burroughs Wellcome, was responsible for AZT, the first HIV drug approved by US regulators in 1987 — and the focus of Oscar-winning film Dallas Buyers Club.However, GSK fell behind Gilead in the next wave of medicines and, between 2002 and 2013, saw its market share fall from 40 per cent to 11 per cent. The decision in 2009 to combine GSK’s HIV assets with Pfizer’s in the ViiV joint venture initially failed to reverse the decline. But by 2014 the business — 78 per cent-owned by GSK — was beginning to claw back lost ground and last year its market share had risen to 17 per cent.The turnround has been driven by dolutegravir, a so-called integrase inhibitor sold under the brand name Tivicay and as part of a three-in-one combination pill called Triumeq. These products have narrowed the clinical advantage held by Gilead, but even GSK has been surprised by how quickly they have taken off. Sales from Tivicay and Triumeq were £1.3bn last year and UBS expects them to reach £4.9bn by 2020 — with a profit margin, at 75 per cent, higher than any other part of GSK.Ms Hauber says the potential could be even greater if ViiV succeeds in efforts to make dolutegravir the backbone of new two-drug combinations offering “simpler, safer” alternatives to the current three-drug formulations. The most advanced of these “dual therapies” is in late-stage trials.“We have to demonstrate that the dual strategy we are pursuing can deliver its promise,” says Dominique Limet, chief executive of ViiV. “It is early days but if it works it would be transformational.”An even bigger opportunity could come from long-lasting treatments which aim to replace daily pills with an injection given once every four or eight weeks. The first such product — developed by ViiV with Johnson & Johnson — successfully suppressed the HIV virus in more than 90 per cent of patients in mid-stage trial results detailed at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston on Tuesday.However, many trial participants reported pain associated with the jabs, leading some analysts to question how widely the product would be adopted. Geoffrey Porges at Leerink said: “Put simply, we believe the number of patients who will opt for painful injections . . . over painless once-daily tablets, is small and poses only a limited risk for Gilead’s outlook.”GSK has sought to widen its research and development pipeline with the acquisition of several experimental medicines from Bristol-Myers Squibb in a deal worth up to $1.5bn agreed in December and completed this week.There could be further investment ahead. GSK has booked a £2bn liability on its balance sheet for the put options that Pfizer and its other partner, Shionogi of Japan, have to sell their ViiV stakes to the UK group. Sir Andrew this month hinted that GSK was keen for a deal, saying he was “absolutely a buyer” if an opportunity arose to take full control.ViiV is unlikely to have things all its own way in the race for the next generation of HIV drugs but Ms Hauber says investors are yet to fully appreciate the “opportunity for GSK to challenge Gilead as never before”.GlaxoSmithKline is aiming to join Gilead Sciences in offering a treatment that can prevent people contracting the HIV virus.The UK group’s ViiV Healthcare unit published generally encouraging results this week from an early-stage clinical trial of an injectable medicine called cabotegravir, which had previously been shown to provide animals with 100 per cent protection against HIV infection in pre-clinical studies.Gilead has led the way in prophylactic HIV drugs with its oral Truvada pill proving more than 90 per cent effective in preventing infection when taken daily. ViiV is aiming to produce a longer lasting alternative that needs to be injected only once every eight or 12 weeks.There is still much for ViiV to prove; this week’s data only provided information on the safety of the drug, with a bigger study planned to demonstrate efficacy. Questions also remain over whether the appeal of a more durable treatment would outweigh the pain of the injection, with 98 per cent of trial participants reporting discomfort from the cabotegravir jab.The use of so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or “prep”, to stave off HIV infection has caused controversy, with critics arguing it will undermine condom use and therefore increase the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. But the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have backed the use of Truvada by people at high risk of HIV.Dominique Limet, chief executive of ViiV, said preventive treatments could make a big impact if adopted widely in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV remains rife. “We already see relatively lax compliance with . . . safe sex,” he said. “We have to work hand in hand with the medical community and public health bodies [to promote safer practices].”"
52;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-02-02T21:28:51Z;Gilead unveils $12bn share buyback, disappointing sales view;;Gilead Sciences announced a new $12bn share buyback programme casting doubts on whether the biotech company will make any big acquisitions in the near future.The news came alongside better-than-expected fourth quarter results and a disappointing 2016 sales outlook, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.A breakdown showed that sales of Harvoni, its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug, which costs $94,500 for a 12-week course, totaled $3.3bn, above analysts’ estimates for $3.09bn. Sales of the drug, which was approved for sale in the US and Europe late in 2014, were up 59 per cent from the previous year and 0.4 per cent sequentially.Sovaldi sales fell nearly 11 per cent year-on-year to $1.6bn in the quarter, ahead of expectations. Harvoni, which requires patients to take just one pill, was expected to cannibalise on its predecessor.The California-based company reported fourth-quarter profits of $4.7bn or $3.18 a share, compared with $3.5bn or $2.18 a share in the year ago period. Sales rose 16 per cent to $8.5bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.83 a share, on sales of $8.15bn. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of $ 3.32 a share, topping analysts’ estimates.For the year, Gilead expects sales in the range of $30bn to $31bn, shy of Wall Street expectations for $31.5bn.Gilead faces twin pressures and the first comes from its own success. Gilead’s HCV franchise, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of its overall revenue, has a high cure rate and is expected to shrink its patient pool, and as patients with hep C decline, so will revenue from sales of the drug.The second stems from concerns over the price of its hep C drugs. Investors have soured on the stock amid fears that Merck’s decision to price its hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, at $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which is a significant discount to Gilead’s offering, could prompt a price war and help the company steal market share away from Gilead.With Gilead’s own pipeline of drugs expected to do little to mitigate an expected decline in sales of its hep C drugs, many had expected the company to acquire another drugmaker. The company told the FT in December, that it was on the hunt for acquisitions.Gilead shares were pressured last year amid a sell-off in biotechs as the sector came under increasing political scrutiny.Shares in Gilead Sciences which surged more than 100 per cent in 2013, have since lost momentum. They climbed 1 per cent in extended trading.
53;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-01-31T19:00:16Z;Gilead risks becoming victim of its own success;Falling number of potential patients and competition from Merck pose threats;"During the past two years, Gilead, a California-based drugmaker, has emerged as the undisputed leader of the four large US biotech companies.Its hepatitis C medicines, Harvoni and Sovaldi, set a new record for the most successful drug launch, thanks in part to a contentious price tag that works out at roughly $1,000 per pill.But the company has also achieved something that is still quite rare in modern medicine: a bona fide cure for a deadly disease that was previously untreatable in roughly half of patients.Now some investors and analysts are asking whether Gilead is about to become a victim of its own success. The problem with a cure, especially one that works in as little as eight weeks, like Harvoni, is the drugmaker will one day run out of new patients to treat.When the company announces 2015 earnings on Tuesday, analysts expect it to report net profits of $17bn on revenues of $32bn, compared with profits of $3bn and sales of $11bn in 2013 — the year before the runaway success of its hepatitis C launch.The explosive growth has propelled the company into the ranks of the world’s largest drugmakers, with a market capitalisation of $126bn that is larger than more established names such as GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb.Yet there is little in the company’s pipeline of prospective drugs that could replicate the boost from its hepatitis C medicines, or mitigate the impact when sales eventually start to slide.Hence why Gilead trades on a price to earnings multiple of 7.6 times, less than half the level of the next cheapest large biotech stock, Amgen, which trades at 15.8 times. It is, in the words of one of its largest investors, “ridiculously cheap”.Paul Carter, executive vice-president of Gilead, is candid about the company’s conundrum.“There’s this sort of pressure now we are a $30bn-a-year revenue company,” says Mr Carter. “People are asking where the next 8 or 10 per cent of year-on-year growth is going to come from.”“We’ve got a really rich pipeline, but there’s actually not another drug that’s going to give us tomorrow morning another $3bn to $5bn [in annual sales],” he adds.The announcement on Friday that the company’s longstanding chief executive, John Martin, will step aside to become chairman after more than two decades at the helm, has not helped investor sentiment.Mr Martin joined Gilead in 1990 and was appointed to the top job in 1996, a year before Donald Rumsfeld, the former US defence secretary, started a four-year stint as chairman.News of Mr Martin’s departure from the CEO’s office came within hours of a decision by Merck to offer its new hepatitis C drug at a steep discount to Gilead’s medicines.That means that Gilead must contend not only with a shrinking number of patients, as more sufferers are cured, but also the prospect of implementing price cuts to stop health insurers switching patients to Merck’s drug.Shares in Gilead, down 18 per cent since the start of January, closed 5 per cent lower on Friday as investors digested the departure of Mr Martin and the Merck threat.The company is also facing a challenge in HIV, the mainstay of its business before it acquired Pharmasset, and the rights to its hepatitis C drugs, for $11bn in 2012.Gilead has been the undisputed leader in HIV medicines for well over a decade, but now faces a renewed threat from Viiv, a joint venture between GSK and Pfizer that is focused solely on developing new treatments for the virus.Viiv signalled its intention to compete more aggressively with Gilead by purchasing Bristol-Myers’ HIV assets for up to $1.5bn at the end of last year, and GSK recently abandoned plans to spin off the unit because of its apparent potential.The majority of analysts remain upbeat on Gilead’s prospects, nonetheless, pointing out there are still millions of untreated hepatitis C patients in the US, not to mention the rest of the world.“Let’s try to put some perspective around it,” says Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who says a price-to-earnings ratio as low as Gilead’s is typically reserved for companies facing a “patent cliff” — the moment when their blockbuster drugs face competition from a much cheaper generic version.Mark Schoenebaum, analyst at Evercore ISI, says that Mr Martin’s move to the chairman role was not a big surprise, and that his successor, John Milligan, has been de facto chief executive for some time.One way that Gilead could try to soften the impact of lower sales of its hepatitis C drugs is by buying a rival company with a potential blockbuster medicine.It has a net cash position of $15bn and recently raised $10bn of debt, giving it the firepower to buy one of the smaller biotech groups, which have become much cheaper in recent months following a sector-wide sell-off.Last year, the company told the Financial Times it was on the hunt for deals.Mr Carter says the company gets asked by shareholders and analysts whether it will make an acquisition “every five seconds”.“Investors can see we’re accumulating cash very, very fast, so we’re in a position to do whatever,” he says. “We’re feeling the heat, but what Gilead has done in the past is be very, very disciplined and thoughtful about these decisions.”“We’re determined not to do something stupid.”The introduction in 2014 of Gilead’s hepatitis C treatments, costing roughly $1,000 per pill, sparked a nationwide debate on the cost of prescription drugs in the US, the world’s largest healthcare system.Gilead, which already offers big discounts to health insurers and employers who pay for prescription drugs in the US, could be forced to make fresh price cuts after Merck brought out a much cheaper rival medicine last week.For most hepatitis C sufferers, Gilead’s drug is still the gold standard: it is sold as a once-a-day pill; it has a better safety profile than Merck’s; and there are fewer side-effects.Hence Merck’s decision to set a list price for its drug of $54,600 for a 12-week course of treatment, versus $94,500 for Gilead’s Harvoni. Insurers and employers will probably pay even less, as they typically demand rebates in return for access to their patients.Now Gilead must decide whether to cede market share to Merck, or to make its own defensive price cuts. It is not the first time Gilead has been challenged by a cheaper rival. When AbbVie launched Viekira Pak, it offered it at a steep discount to Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug benefits, in return for exclusive access to patients.Analysts said Merck’s decision to offer its medicine at a big discount was a sign that pharmaceuticals companies were adjusting to a new pricing environment in the US, where Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, has pledged to crack down on drug prices.“The list price of $54,600 is significantly below that of the competitors and may raise some eyebrows,” says Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “Merck may have taken the strategy of a lower gross price to limit negative headlines given the ongoing public debate around drug pricing.”Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says: “In our opinion, one might see this headline price as Merck trying to make sure it is politically protected, and a public relations move, knowing there is very high focus on drug pricing right now.”"
54;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Merck launches hepatitis C drug price war;New treatment for liver disease pitched at 40% discount to market leader Gilead’s product;"Merck has launched a price war in the treatment of hepatitis C by setting the list price of its new drug at a 40 per cent discount to rival medicines, a move designed to steal market share from a controversial $1,000 pill made by competitor Gilead.Zepatier, a new once-daily pill from Merck that was approved by regulators on Thursday evening, will be priced at $54,600 for a 12 week course of treatment, versus $94,500 for Gilead’s Harvoni.The price paid by the insurers, employers and government schemes that foot the bill for drugs in the privatised US healthcare system will be lower still, analysts said, as these “payers” usually demand large discounts in return for access to their patients.Shares in Gilead, down more than 16 per cent since the start of January, fell a further 4.5 per cent in early New York trading on Friday, as investors also digested an announcement that the company’s chief executive would step aside to become chairman after two decades at the helm.Merck’s shares rose 1.3 per cent.Gilead prompted a public outcry when it priced its hepatitis C medicines at roughly $1,000 a pill last year, and the company is widely credited with sparking a wider debate over the soaring cost of drugs, which has become a central topic in the US presidential campaign.Gilead contends that its drug, which can cure the vast majority of patients after 12 weeks, is good value, especially when pitched against older treatments that were far less effective, as well as the roughly $300,000 cost of a liver transplant and end-of-life care for those who died from the disease.Merck had little choice other than offering a big discount because its drug has several drawbacks, said analysts; it is not suitable for all hepatitis C sufferers, and it can cause modest liver damage, prompting regulators to insist that patients are tested for liver function before being given the drug.“We believe the discounted list pricing strategy, before rebates, is necessary in this highly competitive segment,” said Andrew Baum, an analyst at Citi. “While Merck’s hepatitis C agent is clearly inferior to incumbent competitors, we expect the launch of Zepatier to further drive net price reductions for all market participants.”Robert McMahon, an executive at Merck, described Zepatier as a “highly effective treatment” for a broad range of patients, including some of whom are ill-suited for existing drugs.He added: “We are embracing the opportunity to partner with payers and healthcare professionals in an effort to broaden and accelerate access to treatment for these patients.”Analysts said AbbVie, which makes a rival hepatitis C drug, would be hardest hit by the launch of Merck’s product. Its drugs share some of the same flaws as Zepatier, but patients must take multiple pills rather than a once-a-day tablet.“Ultimately, we see Harvoni’s impressive product profile keeping Gilead firmly entrenched as the dominant player in the hepatitis C space, with Merck and AbbVie battling for a distant second place position,” said Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Shares in AbbVie, which reported earnings on Friday, were down 3.6 per cent in early New York trading, as investors fretted that it was becoming too reliant on a blockbuster arthritis medicine that is facing competition from copycat versions."
55;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2016-01-18T16:46:32Z;Pharma sell-off threatens to stifle appetite for IPOs;Cautious sentiment risks cutting off funding for smaller biotechs;After months of battling a public outcry over high drug prices, the pharmaceuticals and biotech industry had hoped that its annual gathering in San Francisco last week would provide an opportunity to start the year on a positive note.The JPMorgan Healthcare Conference is the largest event of its kind, providing a forum for companies to trumpet their prospects, and for healthcare bankers to cook up deals.Shire, the Anglo-Irish drugmaker, kicked off proceedings by announcing its long-awaited $32bn takeover of US-based Baxalta on Monday. But investors reacted to the proposed deal by promptly sending shares in both companies tumbling, adding to a growing sense that appetite for large deals is waning.There was little else on offer to convince investors to start buying again after the recent sector sell-off. The Nasdaq biotech index finished last week down roughly 6 per cent, compared with a fall of about 2 per cent for the S&P 500.Celgene, one of four large-cap biotech groups, added to the gloom by cutting its profit forecast for 2015 and predicting that revenues this year would be below analyst expectations. Robert Hugin, chief executive since 2010, also spooked some investors by announcing that he is to stand down in March and become chairman.Industry executives argue that investors are missing the bigger picture: biopharma companies are discovering more drugs than they have in years, such as cancer immunotherapies that are producing some remarkable results in tumours which have hitherto been untreatable.They also point to other potentially huge advances: if solanezumab, an Alzheimer’s drug being developed by Eli Lilly, is successful when data from a large trial are published later this year, it would be the first medicine proven to delay the onset of the disease.Investors remain wary, however. Just over a third say they believe solanezumab will work, according to a survey by Evercore ISI, the investment bank. And, at any rate, the data are not due until the fourth quarter — which seems like a long time when stock markets are so volatile.Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisationsAs investors scurried around the conference halls of Westin St Francis hotel, nervously checking the sea of red on their smartphone stocks apps, bankers and lawyers tried to put a positive gloss on tumbling valuations. They say that the recent market sell-off could spark a fresh wave of deals as acquisitive companies go bargain hunting.Last year was a record for healthcare deals, with much of the activity being driven by a group of drugmakers loosely known as “specialty pharma”, which typically increase profits and sales through acquisitions rather than discovering their own drugs.That is unlikely to be the case in 2016. Allergan, the largest specialty pharma group, has said it will refrain from large deals ahead of its takeover by Pfizer. Valeant, the beleaguered Canadian drugmaker, has pledged to abstain from acquisitions so it can pay down a $31bn net debt position that is making its investors nervous.Instead, bankers expect large, cash-rich biotechs to drive dealmaking, such as Gilead and Amgen, which recently told the Financial Times they were actively seeking acquisitions.However, David Hallal, chief executive of Alexion, a rare diseases specialist, says it will take time for directors of smaller biotech companies to accept that they are worth considerably less than they were in the summer.“Capitulation doesn’t just happen all of a sudden, especially when you juxtapose today’s valuations with where you were just a month or two ago,” says Mr Hallal.Some cash-rich companies will have the luxury of waiting for stock markets to improve, but there are many smaller groups that had hoped to raise funds from investors in the early part of this year through initial public offerings. Others had planned to return for a second or third follow-on financing.“Where the pressure is going to be is on those who are thinking about coming out with their IPO and then all the secondaries,” says Mr Hallal. “Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisations.”The head of healthcare at one large investment bank said the week would prove crucial for companies considering raising capital. Editas Medicine, a group focused on modifying genetic defects that cause diseases, will test the markets with its IPO, as will BeiGene, a Chinese biotech in the field of cancer.The banker, who is not involved in either fundraising, predicted the companies would complete their listings due to strong support from their existing shareholders, but said if their stock prices subsequently tumbled it could prevent others from following suit.If IPO markets do freeze up, it would leave some cash-strapped companies with little option but to sell at a knockdown price. Many companies are ready to pounce, such as Horizon Pharma, an acquisitive group that is trying to turn itself into a rare diseases specialist.“I think you’re going to see a trend, depending on the next few months, of people being scared about the IPO markets and not being able to access them,” says Timothy Walbert, chief executive of Horizon.“When we do start seeing an increase in trading in private companies, we will have the ability with our cash balance to be active.”A panel of experts appointed by the US Food and Drug Administration is set to recommend on Friday whether or not the medicines watchdog should approve a new drug for a rare and deadly childhood disease.There is no treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness in boys, leading to paralysis in early infancy, and cardiac and respiratory problems during a sufferer’s teenage years. Most patients die in their twenties.Sarepta Therapeutics, a tiny biotech group, is hoping to secure the first approval for a DMD drug, but a negative briefing document published by the FDA on Friday does not bode well. Shares in the group fell 55 per cent following its release.If the FDA rejects the drug, it will be the second time it has rejected approval for a treatment for DMD this year. Last week, it refused to approve a similar treatment made by BioMarin, a rare diseases specialist.The knock-back was an embarrassment for BioMarin, which took a big gamble by buying the drug’s maker, Prosensa, for $680m last year, even though the medicine had failed in late-stage clinical trials and lost the backing of its big partner, GlaxoSmithKline.PTC Therapeutics has also applied for approval for its DMD medication, even though the medicine failed to hit its primary target during a clinical trial last year. The drug is conditionally approved in Europe, pending the results of further trials.The failure of all three drugs, which have secured billions of dollars in investment, would underline the sometimes risky endeavour of developing medicines for rare diseases.Because the number of people suffering from a rare disease is by definition so small, it can be hard to design clinical trials that show a clear benefit — even though the cost of the medicines often runs to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for each patient.A highly organised group of parents who have campaigned for the medicines to be approved fear that if the FDA rejects the drugs, its decision will discourage drugmakers from pursuing other potential treatments for the disease.

57;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-12-17T15:59:25Z;Gilead invests $2bn in Galapagos alliance;US group to develop arthritis drug with Belgian biotech firm;Gilead Sciences has agreed to invest up to $2bn to develop a rheumatoid arthritis drug with Belgian biotech group Galapagos — just three months after AbbVie pulled out of a similar alliance with the Mechelen-based company.News of the deal reinforces Galapagos’s standing as one of Europe’s most promising biotech companies, and repairs the damage caused in September by AbbVie’s decision to abandon a partnership in favour of its own rival drug.Gilead will now join forces with Galapagos in developing the Belgian company’s product, called filgotinib, in a head-to-head contest with AbbVie.California-based Gilead agreed to an upfront payment of $725m in return for a 15 per cent stake in Galapagos and a licence to co-develop and commercialise filgotinib. Further payments of up to $1.35bn may come from royalties and profit sharing if the product reaches the market.For Gilead, the partnership promises to strengthen its position in treatments for inflammatory diseases as it seeks new sources of growth after its success in hepatitis C and HIV.Onno van de Stolpe, Galapagos’s chief executive, said he was still disappointed about the way AbbVie announced its exit from their partnership without consulting the company first. But he added he was happy to have a new partner committed to putting filgotinib at the centre of its inflammation franchise.Galapagos held talks with eight potential investors after AbbVie’s withdrawal, Mr van de Stolpe told the Financial Times. Gilead was felt to be the best fit because of its greater nimbleness compared with bigger pharma groups.“Gilead has built its HIV and [hepatitis C] franchises into a fantastic company with quite a small footprint of only 7,500 people,” he said. “The culture fits extremely well with Galapagos.”Shares in Galapagos rose 11 per cent following the announcement to an all-time high of €58.55 — more than recovering the sharp losses they suffered after AbbVie’s exit. This gave it a market capitalisation of €2.3bn.Mr van de Stolpe said another appeal of Gilead was its willingness to share marketing rights in some European countries and work together on development — supporting his aim to build Galapagos into one of Europe’s first big biotech groups.$725mUpfront payment from Gilead in return for 15% stake in Galapagos and licence to co-develop and commercialise filgotinib“It’s about time Europe built something substantial in biotech,” he said. “That is something that has been lacking because companies have been acquired too early rather than being given the time and capital needed to grow.”Gilead’s Galapagos deal marks the second boost for European biotech within weeks after Genmab of Denmark won approval from US regulators for the Darzalex blood cancer drug it is developing with Johnson & Johnson.Genmab is ranked second in terms of market capitalisation among European biotech companies, at about $8bn, behind Actelion of Switzerland at $15.5bn.However, they remain just a fraction of the size of US biotech groups such as Celgene, Biogen and Gilead, whose $147bn market valuation is greater than all but two of Europe’s traditional pharma groups.Galapagos said it planned to start late-stage trials of filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease next year and would fund 20 per cent of the development costs, with Gilead paying the rest.Mr van de Stolpe said he was convinced filgotinib was a safer product than AbbVie’s ABT-494, but their relative efficacy was still to be determined. Analysts have forecast annual peak sales in excess of $3bn for filgotinib, which Galapagos hopes will reach market in 2019.

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
59;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Cash-rich Gilead hits acquisition trail;US biotech group scouts for drugs ‘complementary’ to liver diseases after hepatitis C successes;Gilead, the US biotech company behind the most lucrative drug launch yet, is on the hunt for acquisitions as it seeks another blockbuster, the group’s chief scientist told the Financial Times.Since Gilead launched its hepatitis C drugs at the tail-end of 2013, the medicines have earned the group about $27bn in revenue, thanks in part to its contentious decision to implement a list price that works out at about $1,000 a pill. But many analysts think that sales have peaked, because the treatment is so effective that patients do not need to keep taking it.“People ask, ‘What are you going to do with all your money?’ ” Norbert Bischofberger, executive vice-president of research and development, said in an interview. “Well, we have our eye on the external world — we have incredible cash flows and we are looking for opportunities.”Any deal would come after a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the drugmaking sector, including Pfizer’s agreed takeover of Allergan for about $160bn.Since the start of the year, more than $649bn of healthcare deals have been announced, according to data from Thomson Reuters — more than the previous two years combined.Gilead, based in Foster City, California, is traditionally known for its HIV medicines, but in 2012 it completed what is now considered one of the shrewdest deals in the history of pharmaceuticals: the $11bn takeover of Pharmasset, a developer of drugs for hepatitis C.Harvoni, which can cure hepatitis C in more than 90 per cent of patients, and Sovaldi, an older version of the drug, accounted for three-fifths of the company’s $24bn of revenues in the first nine months of the year.The company estimates that about 600,000 patients have been cured in the US and Europe by taking a course of one of its drugs.However, investors fret that Gilead will eventually run out of patients to treat. The introduction of a competing drug from Merck next year could also push down prices, helping to explain why the company’s stock price trades at a relatively low multiple of about 10 times earnings despite the runaway success of its hepatitis C medicines.Mr Bischofberger said that Gilead was looking particularly for target companies that have drugs that are already proven to work in early-stage trials. Such groups tend to be more expensive but they carry a much lower risk of failing later on.“We have typically preferred to wait for answers before we jump in,” he said. “Philosophically, we prefer to wait for more certainty and pay more money, which is what we did with Pharmasset, rather than getting something cheap with uncertainty.”Analysts say companies in this category typically fetch upwards of $10bn, a pricetag that Gilead could easily pay, given that it recently raised $10bn of debt and has a net cash position of $15bn.Mr Bischofberger said that Gilead would prefer to find a target that was “complementary” to its unit that focuses on liver diseases such as hepatitis C, although he said that such a company could be “difficult to find”.“In the end, we wouldn’t be opposed to making an investment in something completely different,” he added.As well as units focused on HIV and liver diseases, the company also makes drugs for blood cancers and is investigating a range of drugs to treat cardiovascular illnesses, respiratory conditions and inflammation.Shares in Gilead, which are up about 10 per cent this year, closed at $104.07 on Friday in New York, giving the company a market value of more than $146bn.Amgen, another California-based biotech, is also looking for an acquisition with a pricetag of up to $10bn, people close to the situation said.
60;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-12-03T17:51:21Z;Pre-exposure drug is new HIV front line;Focus switches to once-a-day pill that has been shown to block acquisition of the virus;When sexual health professionals marked the 27th annual World Aids Day earlier this week there was much to celebrate.A person infected with HIV today will probably live as long as someone who does not have the virus, providing they live in a rich country and have access to the latest drugs. That is a dramatic improvement on three decades ago, when the virus was considered a near-certain death sentence.“We’ve moved on even from 1995, when we had a cancer-like thinking, where you were just trying to keep a person alive, to a diabetes-style thinking,” says Dr Andrew Cheng, executive vice-president of clinical research and development at Gilead, one of the biggest makers of HIV drugs.“Now this is a chronic disease, where we’re asking what can keep people with the best quality of life for as long as possible,” adds Dr Cheng.However, after a decade of radical advances in the treatment of HIV, the march of progress has slowed. Many of today’s improvements are incremental: the newest medicines are slightly safer, pills are smaller and patients often need only take one tablet a day.Treating HIV with fewer, smaller pills could have the biggest impact in developing countries — home to the vast majority of the 1.2m people who died from Aids-related causes last year — because it will result in lower manufacturing costs.In developed countries, attention has turned to searching for a cure — a difficult scientific challenge given the nature of HIV, which integrates into the genome so that copies of the virus proliferate in a patient’s DNA.One theory, known as the “kick and kill” approach, tries to awaken resting “t-cells”, the soldiers of the immune system, before encouraging them to root out and destroy the virus, although the science is still in its infancy.“We have two things in clinical development, but it’s very early and I don’t want to promise anyone that we can cure HIV,” says Norbert Bischofberger, chief scientific officer at Gilead. “It’s five to 10 years away, if it’s even possible.In the meantime, researchers are working on a “functional” cure, where an HIV sufferer would undergo treatment once or twice a year, which would protect their immune system and ensure they could not communicate the virus to someone else.Until then, the biggest advance in HIV treatment is not going to be the type of drugs on offer, but the way in which people take them. A growing body of evidence shows that large numbers of people at risk of contracting the virus should be on medication as a preventive measure.Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PREP, is a strategy where patients take a once-a-day pill to reduce their risk of acquiring the virus. Gilead’s Truvada, approved for PREP in the US in 2012, is currently the only drug available for this type of treatment, although Viiv, a joint venture between Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, is pursuing a rival medicine.Truvada is awaiting approval in Europe, although some doctors are already prescribing the drug on an “off label” basis to patients who request it.Clinical trials have shown PREP is remarkably effective, stopping the acquisition of the virus in more than 90 per cent of patients. A large San Francisco-based study released in September found that all of the 600 participants, who were considered to have a high risk of contracting the virus, were HIV-free after up to two-and-a-half years.Just 21,000 people take Truvada for PREP, but the US Centers for Disease Control reckons the number should be roughly 60 times higher. In a report last month, it identified 1.2m Americans who should at least consider taking the drug, including one in four sexually active gay men, one in five injectable drug users, and one in 200 sexually active straight adults.Encouraging adoption at those levels could prove difficult, however, given that one in three primary care doctors in the US have never even heard of PREP.There are also fears that the widespread uptake of PREP could result in people practising unprotected sex, undoing years of successful public campaigns that encouraged condom use in the wake of the 1980s Aids epidemic.While PREP reduces the risk of HIV, it does nothing to stop people contracting other sexually transmitted diseases.Michael Weinstein, president of the Aids Healthcare Foundation, has waged a campaign against Truvada, which he describes as a “party drug” — a reference to the fact that he believes it will reduce people’s sexual inhibitions.However, the scientific evidence does not support such fears.“We’ve not seen a substantial change in the number of sexual partners or in condom use,” says Dr Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “There are dozens of studies — a few show a trend to riskier behaviour, but most do not.”Kevin Frost, chief executive of the Foundation for Aids Research, shared similar fears when PREP was first introduced three years ago, but now describes himself as a “cautious convert”.“I was concerned about it, but the scientific data has been overwhelming,” says Mr Frost. “I think disinhibition is going to be an issue — you’re going to see an uptick in gonorrhoea and syphilis.”“But none of that outweighs the benefits of reducing rates of HIV.”
61;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-11-26T00:18:56Z;Unhealthy drugs: Pharma struggles with its reputation;Some of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies struggle with poor ethics, unpopular management and weak communication;"An industry dedicated to saving and extending lives might be expected to find empathy easy.Instead, some of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies struggle with poor ethics, unpopular management and weak communication.Merck and Gilead Sciences of the US and GlaxoSmithKline of the UK all languish in the bottom half of the Global Empathy Index, the ranking of 160 companies across all sectors by Lady Geek, a UK consultancy that aims to promote healthy corporate culture.Reputational challenges are nothing new for big pharma; controversy has swirled round the industry for decades over issues ranging from dubious payments to doctors and secrecy over clinical trial data to animal testing and keeping drugs from the poor.The empathy research did not make moral judgments on industries but it found several big drugmakers performed weakly on objective measures such as corporate fines, boardroom gender diversity and the pay differential between chief executives and the rest of the workforce.Another, more subjective factor behind some drugmakers’ low empathy scores was poor communication, says Belinda Parmar, Lady Geek’s chief executive. “They do not engage with social media or encourage dialogue.”This may reflect the tight regulations that govern the industry’s relationship with doctors and patients and restrict what companies can say about their medicines. But Ms Parmar says it is no excuse. “The finance industry is also highly regulated but they have still found ways to use social media in imaginative ways.”Not all pharma companies were poor performers. Johnson & Johnson of the US made the top 10, while Swiss Novartis and the UK’s AstraZeneca were among the top 30. However, the industry’s performance was hurt by laggards such as Merck, which ranked seventh from bottom, weighed down by factors including a lawsuit over alleged falsification of vaccine data. The company said the lawsuit is without merit.Meanwhile, GSK’s score was hit by a corruption scandal in China, and Gilead’s was influenced by the $189m pay package of its chief executive, John Martin."
62;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Amgen on the hunt for potential deal of up to $10bn;Companies with drugs already in clinical testing are being evaluated;Amgen, one of the four largest US biotech groups, is on the hunt for potential acquisitions, according to people familiar with the situation, as it prepares to end its self-imposed exile from the boom in pharmaceuticals mergers and acquisitions.More than $850bn of healthcare deals have been announced since the start of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, but Amgen has so far stayed on the sidelines, eschewing large or medium-sized transactions.Instead, it has focused its efforts on buying or licensing a handful of unproven drugs that are in early-stage testing and typically command much smaller price tags.However, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said it had recently “opened the aperture” and was now evaluating companies worth up to $10bn, with drugs that have been proven in clinical testing and are almost ready to bring to market.Companies that have recently completed similar acquisitions include Celgene, another biotech group, which paid $7.2bn for cancer specialist Receptos, and Alexion, which spent $8.4 on Synageva, a rare diseases specialist.Amgen, which ended last week with an equity value of $121bn, has also been seen as a potential target and has been linked to Allergan, the drugmaker that is in talks about combining with Pfizer.One investor who recently held meetings with Amgen’s management team said the company had contacted shareholders in the past few weeks to get “everybody prepared” for an acquisition.Amgen declined to comment.Amgen’s last major acquisition was Onyx, which it bought in 2013 for roughly $10bn, primarily to secure the rights to its cancer drug Kyprolis.$121bnAmgen’s market value on FridayInvestors initially turned sour on the Onyx deal amid lacklustre sales of the medicine, but many shareholders revised their opinion this year, after the US drugs watchdog approved Kyprolis for use in a cocktail of medicines to treat patients with cancer of the plasma cells.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration paves the way for a big jump in sales, according to analysts.“They’re taking a lot of comfort from the Onyx acquisition,” the investor said.Amgen would probably finance an acquisition by raising debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s thinking.Although the company’s balance sheet has $30bn of debt it also has roughly the same amount in cash, with the vast majority trapped offshore. Repatriating cash to the US to fund a deal would incur a hefty tax bill.Amgen, founded in 1980, is one of the four cornerstone groups of the US biotech sector, along with Celgene, Gilead and Biogen, and is credited with developing some of the first successful “biologic” drugs.It is now facing competition to some of its top-selling products from a new generation of “biosimilar” copycat medicines. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the first ever biosimilar version of Neupogen, an Amgen medicine that had sales of $1.16bn last year.Last year, Dan Loeb, the activist investor, acquired a stake in Amgen through his Third Point vehicle and pushed for cost-cutting and a potential break-up of the company. Subsequently, the group said it would make roughly $1.5bn of cuts.However, Amgen has fiercely resisted any attempt to split in two, and Mr Loeb has, for now, dropped the idea.
63;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-10-14T14:16:06Z;Big pieces of pharma M&A jigsaw have yet to be placed;Even as scepticism grows J&J, Pfizer, Allergan and Gilead remain on the prowl;"A rout in pharmaceutical and biotech stocks has altered the equation for chief executives thinking about big-ticket mergers and acquisitions.On one hand, target companies are much cheaper than they were: roughly $130bn has been wiped off the Nasdaq biotech index since Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, pledged to crack down on high drug prices three weeks ago.But it would be a brave chief executive who engaged in transformational dealmaking when investors are so nervous about healthcare stocks.Since the start of 2014, the industry has been gripped by an M&A frenzy — more than $850bn of transactions have been announced, but there are signs investors may be turning sour on deals.In the past three months, more than half of healthcare companies that have proposed an acquisition worth $1bn or more have been punished with a next-day decline in their share price, according to an FT analysis.Bankers and lawyers who advise on pharmaceutical deals are now starting to quietly ask whether the M&A juggernaut is slowing down.Despite this, four big groups are still said to be on the prowl for deals: Johnson & Johnson, the largest of the US drugmakers; Pfizer, the number two; Irish-domiciled Allergan; and Gilead, a leading US biotech group.“You’re going to continue seeing the midsized deals, especially in the $10bn range. But, as for transformational deals, I think there is really only one, maybe two, left in this cycle,” says one banker who advises several large pharma companies.Johnson & Johnson has sat on the sidelines of the recent flurry of dealmaking, but it has been more open than most in signalling it is still on the hunt.● Target: Pharmacyclics● Value: $21bn● Year: 2015● Verdict: Despite missing out in a three-way auction for Pharmacyclics, J&J is actively pursuing M&A opportunities. This week its chief financial officer said it had the financial strength for a $10bn share buyback and remained open to deals “of any scale”Despite announcing a $10bn share buyback alongside its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday — often a sign that a company has given up on large deals — the company insisted it was “actively pursuing” ways of deploying its $17bn of net cash and was open to acquisitions of “any scale”.Earlier this year, the group tried to buy Pharmacyclics, the maker of a blood cancer drug, but missed out in a three-way auction that resulted in the company being sold to AbbVie for $21bn. J&J has a longstanding partnership with Pharmacyclics and receives a share of sales of Imbruvica, its top selling drug.However, one person who advised J&J on that deal said the company was “institutionally conservative” when it came to large acquisitions and had been unwilling to bid as much as AbbVie.US biotech valuations are roughly one-fifth lower than they were a month ago, so J&J might find some targets it considers to be better value. But its chief financial officer, Dominic Caruso, on Tuesday suggested the company would be more open to deals outside of the US, where it has amassed a significant portion of its cash reserves. He said there would be “more to come on that at a later date”.Ever since Pfizer, abandoned its $118bn pursuit of AstraZeneca, its Anglo-Swedish rival, last year, investors have been wondering what is next for the world’s second largest drugmaker.● Target: Hospira● Value: $17bn● Year: 2015● Verdict: The deal brought Pfizer a specialist in “biosimilars” — a new type of copycat drug — and added heft to its established products division. But it was not the sort of game-changing deal some think Pfizer needs to revive its fortunesThat deal would have enabled the group to shift its domicile to the UK, cutting its corporate tax bill and making it more competitive against rivals that have already made similar moves. But a crackdown on “tax inversions” by the Obama administration has made such deals trickier.In February, Pfizer bought Hospira, a US-based maker of generic drugs, for $17bn, a deal that some investors saw as an attempt to “fatten up” its established products division before splitting the group into two companies: one that owns older medicines and another focused on discovering innovative new drugs.Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, has hinted that the company is looking for another target, most likely a company that would add heft to the innovative side of the business ahead of such a split. Pfizer also bid unsuccessfully for Pharmacyclics, and, according to a person familiar with the company, has held late stage talks with several companies before pulling out over price.Pfizer has been burnt in the past with deals that destroyed value, but chief executive Ian Read may find targets more appealing after the recent sell-off.Some shareholders say the company has recently dialled back talk of splitting up in 2017 and instead appears to be focused on inversions again.At a recent investor dinner, Mr Read said if Pfizer were to move its domicile, he would prefer for the deal to close before the end of 2016, because tax reform might move back on to the agenda when a new US Congress is elected in 2017, according to an account of the meeting by Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Despite the inversion crackdown, Pfizer could still pull off such a deal, as long as its shareholders ended up with less than 60 per cent of the combined company. One of the few targets that would fit this equation is Allergan, the maker of Botox, which is domiciled in Ireland and paid an effective tax rate of 4.8 per cent last year versus 25.5 per cent for Pfizer.So far, Allergan has been a hunter rather than a target in the M&A game. In the last three years it has completed a string of acquisitions, as it shifted from an $8bn maker of copycat medicines to a specialist in branded drugs with a market cap of $110bn.● Target: Actavis (now renamed Allergan)● Value: $70.5bn● Year: 2015● Verdict: Completed the transformation of Actavis from a generic drugmaker to a specialist in high-margin branded medicines, and also provided a new name for the company. But the stock price has not done as well as management had hopedThe group, which was called Actavis until taking the name of its 2014 purchase, is again on the hunt for deals, armed with the proceeds of the $41bn sale of its generic drugs unit in August. Chief executive Brent Saunders says the rout in pharma shares could help.“I think over time, if it stays like this, then it should benefit a cash buyer,” he says. “But the market could still bounce back — the real issue is how sustainable is the decline, and does it put us in a good position.”One large investor in Allergan has suggested that Amgen, one of the four large-cap biotech companies, could be a target, though Mr Saunders has so far completed only friendly deals. Its market capitalisation of $106bn might make it a stretch for Allergan. But Dan Loeb, the activist investor who owns a small stake in the company has suggested Amgen should split itself in two; one of the two resulting companies might be easier to digest.Fred Hassan, the former chief executive of Schering Plough, recently joined the board of Amgen, the investor pointed out. Mr Hassan was a mentor to Mr Saunders earlier in his career and is credited with “discovering” the executive.Gilead is often held up as the biggest success story of biotech. It has overtaken some of the biggest names in the industry, such as GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, in terms of market capitalisation.● Target: Pharmasset● Year: 2012● Value: $11.2bn● Verdict: Acquired a blockbuster cure for hepatitis C that became the most successful drug launch in history, but investors are asking where growth will come from when it eventually runs out of patients to treat.The company’s $11bn purchase in 2012 of Pharmasset, the maker of a cure for hepatitis C, was one of the highest-return deals in the drug industry’s history. The medicine it acquired, Sovaldi, and its successor, Harvoni, pulled in revenues of almost $10bn in the first half of the year alone — thanks in part to a pricetag of $1,000 a day— all but covering Gilead’s initial outlay.Turning a life-threatening illness into one that is in effect cured after a 12-week course of treatment is a huge achievement, but it poses a conundrum for investors: eventually Gilead will run out of patients to treat. Some analysts say the second quarter represented the high water mark for sales of its hepatitis C drugs.Having spent much of the past year damping down talk of M&A, Gilead has shifted emphasis and is now openly discussing deals, according to two large shareholders. “They really have changed their tune,” says one.Last month, the group raised $10bn of debt. Added to its roughly $15bn net cash position, that gives it $25bn to spend on a target. In a recent survey of investors conducted by Evercore ISI, respondents identified Vertex and Incyte, biotech groups that have a market capitalisation of $25bn and $18bn respectively, as potential targets.But one adviser familiar with Gilead’s thinking says its executives were quite taken with the $7bn acquisition of Receptos by Celgene, and that they are more likely to focus their energies on companies in this price range."

However, the junket operators have said “liquidity has since then stabilised”. They added that they are “cautiously optimistic on mass traffic” ahead of the important Golden Week holiday in China.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 with shares up 23 per cent to $63.47.

The news pushed shares of the luxury goods retailer 5 per cent higher to $75.08.Micron Technology shares climbed 8 per cent to $15.91 after the chipmaker reported better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and said the outlook for memory chips looked favourable in the long term.Profits fell 59 per cent from a year ago to $471m or 42 cents a share, but well ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings of 29 cents a share. Sales declined 15 per cent to $3.6bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.Favourable supply dynamics for its memory chip along with “Micron’s technology progress, and emergence of new categories of demand with smartwatch[es] and car[s], would allow Micron to grow its revenues and earnings faster than its peer group of tech companies over the next 12 to 18 months”, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies said.Shares in Gilead Sciences slid as much as 2.4 per cent to $95.99 after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and maintained their $127 price target. Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares also fell 2 per cent after Morgan Stanley analysts cut their rating on the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and lowered their target price to $200 from $284.

The high cost of drugs has also been a target for Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is also competing. The rhetoric has raised concerns that the speciality pharma sector will come under increased scrutiny and that it could create pricing pressures for its companies.Shares in Gilead Sciences slipped 5 per cent to $94.80, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell more than 7 per cent to $453.98 and shares in Biogen dropped 4.4 per cent to $272.28.But analysts have said that any big reforms would need an act of Congress and are unlikely to be implemented in their current state or in the near term.“The sell-off in the absence of fundamental change creates an opportunity for an entry point in high quality names,” Cory Kasimov, an analyst at JPMorgan, said. He noted that innovation in biotechs remained at “all-time highs” and that the regulatory environment continued to be “very favourable”.Verastem shares were the biggest decliners on the Nasdaq biotech sector, falling 67 per cent to $1.85, after the company said it would stop a phase 2 mesothelioma cancer study. The small-cap company saw $135m wiped off its market valuation overnight.Shares in Cal-Maine Foods declined 12 per cent to $50.63 after the egg producer reported fiscal first-quarter profits that missed forecasts.The Jackson, Mississippi-based company reported profits of $143m, or $2.95 a share, compared with $27.7m or 57 cents a share in the year-ago period.Sales jumped more than 70 per cent year on year to $609.9m, as the average selling prices for shell eggs jumped to record levels during the first quarter and were up 65.7 per cent from the year-ago period.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $3.13 a share, on sales of $597.7m.Egg prices have jumped after an outbreak of avian influenza in the upper Midwest led to a cull of the national laying hen flock. “We believe that egg prices will remain very high until the supply situation returns to more normal levels,” said Dolph Baker, chief executive of Cal-Maine.Alcoa shares jumped 6 per cent to $9.60 after the aluminium producer announced plans to split into two companies.Shares in Williams Cos fell 12 per cent to $36.57 after the company said it would merge with Energy Transfer Equity in a $37.7bn deal, including the assumption of debt. Investors were disappointed as the deal was worth less than Energy Transfer’s offer in June.

66;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-09-27T23:00:57Z;High healthcare prices force payers to find ways to cut their bills;Health providers are joining forces in an attempt to negotiate discounts;Nothing strikes fear into pharmaceutical executives so much as pricing.Those who pay for healthcare — whether the insurance companies in the US or the public health systems in other countries — have warned they cannot cope with rampant drug price inflation at a time when society is ageing.Yet there is one area that has proven relatively sheltered from pricing pressure: orphan drugs for rare diseases.This is all the more surprising, given that these drugs normally command very high prices.Soliris, a drug made by Alexion Pharmaceuticals to treat two rare diseases, costs between $400,000 and $560,000 per patient per year, for instance.An Alexion representative says it has experienced little difficulty getting the drug on to US “formularies” — the lists of approved drugs compiled by the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who buy medications.The rationale for charging such high prices is that orphan drugs, by their very nature, will only ever be prescribed to a small number of patients.If a pharmaceutical company is to recoup the investment it takes to develop a new medicine and have it approved, it must charge more per head for orphan drugs than traditional ones.In a recent report, Express Scripts (the largest of the PBMs) used this argument to justify its decision to take on another company, Gilead, which charges $1,000 a pill for a drug that treats hepatitis C, a common illness.“Orphan drugs are among the most expensive medications in the US, often costing tens of thousands of dollars per prescription,” the report said. “[They] treat extremely rare conditions . . . typically only several thousand patients or fewer. The high price tag is necessary — and justified — to fund manufacturer research and development costs.”However, orphan drugs are not entirely immune from pricing pressure. In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year, researchers found that many insurers were demanding that doctors get explicit permission before prescribing orphan drugs, or requiring that patients undergo a clinical diagnostic test to ensure they have the relevant condition.Analysts at Wells Fargo bank think PBMs will continue to support the makers of orphan drugs, because, while they cost more per head, these companies tend to evaluate medicines on the “pooled” price rather than an individual basis.They also reckon that PBMs do not want to contend with the negative publicity of denying someone with a rare, quite often deadly condition a potentially life-saving drug. “The political risks of denying reimbursement or coverage may outweigh any potential cost-savings,” the Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a recent note for investors.Some policymakers know those risks all too well. Two years ago, the Belgian health ministry found itself at the centre of a row over its refusal to pay for Soliris for a seven-year-old boy suffering from a rare kidney disease. It eventually agreed to foot the bill after negotiating a discount from Alexion. The case suggests that, while Alexion might be able to set high prices in its domestic market, it could face pressure from health systems in other countries.This year, Belgium formed a partnership with the Netherlands to purchase orphan drugs jointly in an attempt to extract discounts from manufacturers.Canada, too, exerted pressure in February when one of its regulators launched a hearing to review what it described as “excessive” pricing for Soliris.With orphan drugs accounting for roughly a third of all new medicine approvals in the US, says Christopher Milne, an orphan drug specialist at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it is an open question as to how long rare disease drugmakers would be able to withstand pricing pressure in the world’s largest and most lucrative healthcare market.But currently there is little sign of a crackdown. If anything, politicians are heading in the opposite direction.US policymakers are trying to institute a change in the law that could prove lucrative for orphan drugmakers. The so-called 21st Century Cures bill is seeking to give a six-month extension of marketing exclusivity to existing drugs that are repurposed for rare diseases.The Congressional Budget Office reckons the legislation would cost the federal government at least $869m by 2025, and possibly more if it delays the introduction of generic “copycat” drugs seeking to treat the illnesses for which the drug was originally intended.Others in the pharma industry warn of unintended consequences. They say that by offering drugmakers such lucrative incentives for orphan indications, they could discourage them from developing treatments for more common diseases, and thus stop them saving more lives.
67;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-09-24T18:14:22Z;Pharmaceuticals: Value over volume;Outcry over a 5,000% price rise has rattled stocks and hardened opinion for change on pricing models;It was probably the most expensive tweet in history. A 21-word missive from Hillary Clinton on Monday wiped more than $40bn off the value of US pharmaceutical and biotech stocks.The Democratic presidential frontrunner decried as “outrageous” the “price gouging” by some drugmakers and promised action to stamp it out. The next day she announced a package of measures designed to rein in pharmaceuticals “profiteering”.Her intervention coincided with an outcry over a 5,000 per cent price increase levied on an anti-infective drug used by Aids and cancer patients. The company — Turing Pharmaceuticals — is run by a 32-year-old fast-talking former hedge fund manager, Martin Shkreli, who instantly became the unapologetic face of an industry accused of putting profits over public health.Mr Shkreli responded to the ensuing media storm with a tweet linking to an expletive-filled Eminem song, “The Way I Am”, containing the lyrics: “I’m tired of all you, I don’t mean to be mean. But that’s all I can be is just me.”This tale of two tweets has thrust drug pricing to the centre of the US presidential campaign and sent investors fleeing in fear of a clampdown on one of the world’s biggest and most profitable industries.While the furore reflects the unique excesses of the US drug market, it also feeds into a broader global debate about the cost of medicines. From restrictions on pricey cancer treatments in Britain’s cash-strapped National Health Service to reforms of the way drugs are procured in Chinese hospitals, the industry is under pressure around the world as societies battle to contain the rising cost of healthcare for ageing populations and growing middle classes.Until recently, the US has seemed immune from such forces. Drug prices have been rising at an annual rate of at least 10 per cent since 2010 even as they stagnated in Europe. The sustainability of this growth is being called into question as the showdown between Mrs Clinton and Mr Shkreli heaps scrutiny on why America’s drugs bill is rising so fast.Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, says Mr Shkreli’s aggressive approach is the natural consequence of a US system that allows drugmakers to charge what the market will bear for products essential to human health. “This guy just happened to get caught in a perfect storm but it had been brewing for some time.”A market out of control?The US has long been an outlier from the regulated pricing and controlled market access in other developed countries. This has made America by far the most lucrative place to sell medicines, accounting for about 40 per cent of global sales. Annual US per-capita spending on pharmaceuticals almost doubled between 2000 and 2012 to $1,010, compared with the $498 average among OECD members. Any move to rein in the US market, therefore, would shake the industry to its foundations.Mrs Clinton’s proposals include opening the market to cheap imports from Canada, mandating pharma companies to spend a minimum proportion of sales on research and development and allowing the government to negotiate prices paid by the public Medicare health insurance programme. The latter measure has for years been resisted by drugmakers and their Republican allies, who fear a slippery slope towards the rationing of care commonplace in socialised European health systems.Yet the absence of government leverage over drug pricing is one of the main reasons why Americans pay so much more for their medicines than the rest of the world. US prices are typically 20-40 per cent higher than in Europe and sometimes more. Novartis’s Gleevec cancer drug costs $106,322 a year in the US but only $31,867 in the UK, according to researchers at the University of Liverpool.Is this all about to change? Mrs Clinton’s attack appeared driven in large part by campaign politics as she battles to neutralise the threat posed by Bernie Sanders, her leftwing rival for the Democratic nomination who had already promised action on drug prices.Andrew Baum, an analyst at Citigroup, describes Mrs Clinton’s plan as “more fiction than future”, noting that even if she were elected to the White House next year the measures would probably founder if Republicans kept control of Congress. Yet, while radical reform seems unlikely in the near term, Mr Baum says this week’s controversy shows that “political pressure on drug pricing in the US is high and will continue to rise”.Tensions over pricing have been growing for more than a year since Gilead Sciences launched a breakthrough medicine called Sovaldi, which cures most cases of hepatitis C within weeks — at a cost of $84,000. This weighed heavily on insurers and public health providers because of the large number of people — 3.2m in the US — with the disease. Spending by Medicare on hepatitis C increased 15-fold in 2014 from the year before to $4.5bn. The price has since fallen after the introduction of a rival product from AbbVie. But the case demonstrated the unfettered pricing power held by pharma groups in the US when no competition exists.Mr Shkreli exploited this freedom to raise the price of its Daraprim brand from $13.50 to $750 per pill after buying the product, the only one of its kind, for $55m from another small drugmaker last month. But he backed down on Tuesday with a promise to reduce the increase by an unspecified amount.Even fellow drugmakers joined the criticism, alarmed at the damage being caused to the industry’s already shaky reputation by one renegade company. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main US industry trade group, briefly broke from condemning Mrs Clinton’s proposals to tweet that Turing “does not represent the values” of its members.Controversy over drug pricing is hardly new. The industry faced opprobrium in the 1990s when it was accused of keeping HIV drugs out of reach of the poor. Pharma leaders have always defended their right to make a return on heavy investment in research and development. But, in a series of interviews with the Financial Times before this week’s events, executives acknowledged that business models must adapt to an era of constrained health budgets.“We need to make sure we are taking the choices for long-term acceptability by society,” says Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. “If we don’t, society is going to react through regulation or some other pendulum shift.”Wider benefitsThere is increasing consensus that a clearer connection must be made between the price charged for a medicine and the measurable benefit it delivers to patients and society. Sir Andrew and his peers want to shift the focus from the cost of medicines to the value they create, for example by allowing someone to return to work earlier or keeping them out of hospital.This may sound like an uncontroversial idea but the concept of “value-based pricing” marks a departure from traditional practices. The big pharma business model was built by dispatching armies of sales reps to push the largest possible quantity of pills at the highest possible price without looking back to see whether the medicine worked. Joe Jimenez, Novartis chief executive, says those days are coming to an end. “The industry has to shift over time from what is today a transactional approach to an outcomes-based approach.”He cites Novartis’s new Entresto heart drug as an example. The medicine, launched in July, was shown in clinical trials to reduce hospitalisation by over 20 per cent. But the Swiss group faces a challenge to persuade customers to adopt it over older drugs that are less effective but much cheaper. It is trying to do this by offering the medicine at a discount with the potential for bonus payments if it succeeds in cutting rates of costly hospitalisation.Other companies are experimenting with similar pay-for-performance models, harnessing big data to measure the “real world” impact of medicines rather than relying on the results of clinical trials. “If companies can show that they are producing real value they will be able to sustain reasonable prices,” says Chris Stirling, head of life sciences at KPMG, the consultancy. “But they are going to have to put in more effort than before. Having a big sales force is no longer going to be enough.”Demonstrating value, however, is only half the problem. Gilead’s Sovaldi might be cost-effective over the long term by curing patients whose hepatitis would otherwise have imposed a prolonged burden on health systems. The cost of a liver transplant — the fate of some hepatitis C patients — is several times higher than the cost of Sovaldi. Yet this potential future saving is of little comfort to the healthcare managers whose budgets have been overwhelmed by the upfront cost of the drug.Preoccupied with profitsThis problem is prompting a radical rethink. James Wilson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, says annuity-style payments over a number of years would provide a sustainable way to reward investment in one-off curative treatments that produce big long-term benefits.Others propose a simpler solution: companies should lower their price expectations. The 10 biggest drugmakers had an average net profit margin of 19 per cent in 2013 — similar to banking and double the level of the oil and gas sector. Andrew Hill, an expert on drug pricing at the University of Liverpool, says pharma could afford to charge less while still making ample profit.This is disputed by Yevgeniy Feyman, fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative US think-tank, who says margins are comparable with other research-intensive sectors such as technology. High-risk drug development must reap high rewards, he says, “otherwise investors would direct their money to the next Snapchat instead of an Alzheimer’s cure”.Mr Feyman says the fixation on prices is perverse when the almost $300bn spent annually on prescription medicines in the US is dwarfed by the $1tn on hospital care. Similar ratios apply in Europe, where pharma executives lament that it is easier for politicians to squeeze drug budgets than to restructure inefficient health infrastructure.There are signs that the US may be starting to rein in its bloated healthcare spending. At 18 per cent of GDP, that is by far the highest in the developed world yet outcomes are inferior compared with some countries that spend less. President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms included incentives to increase efficiency, while consolidation among care providers and insurers is increasing economies of scale.In the long run these trends could help drugmakers if they create more headroom for spending on medicines and reward products that reduce long-term care costs. The most immediate effect, however, has been a more aggressive approach to price negotiations by the healthcare “payers” who buy drugs. GSK, for example, has been forced to sharply cut the price of its best-selling Advair asthma drug.“For years in Europe we have had price cuts and restrictions in availability of new products and we’re beginning to see the same in America,” says Sir Andrew. “It’s not going to be exactly the same as Europe but the direction of travel is similar.”Mr Baum agrees that the most competitive fields such as respiratory and diabetes drugs will face pressure. But he predicts that medicines offering a clear improvement over existing treatments will maintain pricing power — citing the new class of cancer “immunotherapies”.This pressure to innovate helps explain the record wave of mergers and acquisitions that has swept the sector over the past two years as drugmakers have vied to strengthen their R&D pipelines. Mrs Clinton has fuelled questions over whether the high valuations paid for many of these assets will be justified if pricing comes under attack.Severin Schwan, chief executive of Roche, admits there will be “tough negotiations” ahead. “It’s a market-driven system. But I think the US will continue to reward innovation — I’m absolutely sure of it.”

It was recently acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals, which immediately raised the price of a single pill from $13.50 to $750. The backlash prompted Turing to say on Tuesday evening that it would lower the price.Mrs Clinton’s intervention in the drug pricing debate prompted a $38bn decline in the value of biotech stocks on Monday, and investors continued selling stocks on Tuesday.The Nasdaq biotech index was down more than 3 per cent in early afternoon New York trading on Tuesday, having already lost 4.3 per cent on Monday. It recovered some of those losses to close down 1.7 per cent.Shares in Valeant, which has a reputation for implementing sharp price hikes, have fallen 10.4 per cent since the start of week, including a 5.4 per cent drop on Tuesday.Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have surged in recent years, amid a proliferation of new drug discoveries and a mergers and acquisitions boom. But valuations are predicated on the belief that companies can achieve premium prices in the US, the world’s largest healthcare market.However, even before Mrs Clinton’s proposals, there were growing signs that policymakers and “payers” — the health insurance companies and employers who pay for drugs in the private US healthcare system — were looking for ways to contain the rising price of medicines.Ronny Gal, an analyst at Bernstein, said: “The US is gradually moving towards more management of drug prices . . . and payers are getting more aggressive.”She’s a candidate, a presumptive leader in a primary race — you have to put things in contextLast year, Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy group, refused to treat hepatitis C patients with a $1,000 a day pill made by Gilead, a biotech group, and secured a big discount on a rival medication from another company. That forced Gilead to discount its own drug sharply, a move that led to a big sell-off in biotech stocks at the time.Brent Saunders, chief executive of Allergan, described the case of Daraprim as an “egregious one-off”, and said “it’s never very good when anyone in your field does something that’s reckless”.However, he said it was too early to fear Mrs Clinton’s plan: “She’s a candidate, a presumptive leader in a primary race — you have to put things in context.”Bernie Sanders, a challenger to Mrs Clinton who has been gaining in the Democratic primary polls with his populist message, has been an outspoken critic of high drug prices and has called for a national healthcare programme that is similar to Canada and some European nations.On September 1, he announced plans to allow the US Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies as part of the Medicare public insurance programme for pensioners. “We must not only enact a national healthcare programme, but also implement prescription-drug policies that work for everybody,” Mr Sanders tweeted on Monday.Ahead of Mrs Clinton’s speech, her campaign said: “This is an issue that affects every American family and individual. Every month, 90 per cent of seniors and around half of all Americans take a prescription drug.”Mrs Clinton is building her presidential campaign on a platform of wanting to help the middle class, which is suffering from a decline in real wages and increased costs of items such as medicines.However, any plan to expand Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform, is likely to face massive resistance on Capitol Hill where Republicans are expected to maintain their majority regardless of which party wins the White House.Almost all of the Republican presidential candidates have made repealing the programme a central part of their campaigns.Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerableRead moreThe Clinton campaign said drug companies were earning as much as $90bn a year in profits at high margins as they charged Americans more for medicines than customers in other countries.It said Mrs Clinton would try to eliminate tax breaks for drug companies unless they invest more in research and development as opposed to marketing.Her plan would also provide more funding for the Food and Drug Administration so that it would speed up the approval of generic drugs, to bring down the cost for consumers.In addition, Mrs Clinton wants to speed up the introduction of “biosimilar” drugs— a class of copycat drugs that aim to replicate “biologic” medicines, which tend to be very expensive.She would also allow Americans to import drugs from outside the country, as long as they had approval from the FDA. “If the medicine you need costs less in Canada, you should be able to buy it from Canada — or any country that meets our safety standards,” she tweeted on Tuesday.

Turing Pharmaceuticals recently bought the rights to Daraprim, which treats toxoplasmosis, a rare parasitic infection. It then increased the price of the drug 55-fold. This brings to mind other expensive drugs, most famously Gilead’s Solvadi, which treats hepatitis C at a cost that can surpass $100,000 for a course. Many commentators drew the obvious parallel; Hillary Clinton went further, suggesting that drug companies generally were “profiteering” and suggesting various policy responses. Drugmakers’ shares, including those of Gilead, sagged.The two cases are distinct, however. Gilead holds a patent on Solvadi; Daraprim is generic. Normally, were Turing to make windfall profits, another manufacturer would begin producing the drug. This may happen yet but there appears to be a barrier. In the US, distribution of Daraprim to pharmacies and hospitals is reportedly tightly controlled, apparently because the drug is dangerous if misused. In practice, this makes it hard or impossible for would-be competitors to obtain samples, which they would need to establish the medical equivalence of competitive versions. When Martin Shkreli, Turing’s chief, was running another company, he described how this closed distribution strategy “neuters” the substitution rules upon which generic competition depends.To the extent that Turing’s strategy depends on closed distribution — the company has not responded to requests for comment — it is extracting, rather than creating, wealth. Solvadi may be overpriced but it is innovative, and Gilead is playing the capitalist game the right way: making a better product and charging what the market will bear until something better comes along.Martin Shkreli has become the face of a drug’s 55-fold price riseRead moreTuring says it will invest its Daraprim profits in new treatments for toxoplasmosis. This defence is laughable. Society does not grant the exclusive right to market a product in return for a promise that the marketer will use the proceeds to do good. It offers rewards as an incentive for inventing new products — to be paid after the product is invented, in the form of patent protection, not before.Hopefully a competitor will soon offer another version of Daraprim. In the meantime, the drug industry had better explain the distinction between expensive but innovative drugs and rent-seeking generics — and call out the rent-seekers in its midst.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
70;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-09-22T08:29:42Z;How US biotech valuations got stretched;Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerable;After a stunning rise, US biotechnology shares have had the air taken out of them.After suffering its second biggest decline of the year on Monday, the Nasdaq biotech index slid a further 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, promised to take on “outrageous” price-gouging in the industry.The comment, sparked after a report highlighted how privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals had raised the price of a 62-year-old drug by more than 5,000 per cent, unnerved investors who had sent the combined market valuation of companies within the Nasdaq biotech index to more than $1tn for the first time earlier this year.Of the 144 companies on the Nasdaq biotech index, shares of 137 groups have fallen over the past two days, including drops of more than 15 per cent by Bluebird Bio, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Horizon Pharma, ImmunoGen and Retrophin.The index’s valuation has sunk more than $150bn from its peak as investors shift out of US stocks and the Federal Reserve readies to raise interest rates. That has added acute pressure to the Russell 2000 biotech index — home to younger, less-established small-cap biotech groups — whose valuations are dependent on future cash flows and a continued wave of merger and acquisition activity.Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, said valuations had become “aggressive, particularly in the small-cap space” after a sustained six-year rally.“Whenever you have aggressive valuations, any sniff that [the sector] may not be able to deliver — and today we had concerns about pricing power — you’ll have an outsize reaction,” he said.Valuations have been a concern for investors in US equities this year, who have broadly preferred European and Japanese stocks as central banks there continue to ease.The Nasdaq biotech index trades at 41.86 times forward earnings, down from a peak of 55.76 earlier this year but a substantial premium to other parts of the US stock market, according to FactSet. In contrast, S&P 500 healthcare companies — including blue-chips such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth — trade at 16.75 times expected earnings over the next 12 months.“While healthcare in general is reasonably priced, biotech valuations are stretched,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “It’s hard to put a p/e on a dream.”Those valuations have been supported by an expanding drug pipeline and a surge in deals. Some 747 mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries worth nearly $300bn since the year began, up 46 per cent from the same point in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Analysts with Citi warned that political rhetoric would intensify, which they argued could “impact the assessment of potential acquisition targets” by blue-chip pharmaceutical groups seeking growth through M&A.Against a backdrop of slow economic expansion, boards of US companies have often decided to buy faster growing companies instead of investing in research and development. The prospect of strong earnings and sales growth, often linked to successful medical trials, has appealed to investors after two consecutive quarters of sales declines by the S&P 500.Earnings for healthcare companies within the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 13 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, faster than any other sector, according to S&P Capital IQ.The potential for blockbuster new drugs has also enticed investors. Analysts with Barclays note that roughly a dozen biotechs have key catalysts before year end, including data from trials undertaken by Gilead, Biogen Idec, Neurocrine Biosciences and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Gilead has epitomised how a novel medical treatment can catapult a company’s share price and valuation. Sales at the company, known for its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, have more than tripled over the past four years, while its market valuation has soared from $29bn to $155bn.Despite the recent declines, the Nasdaq biotech index remains 10.4 per cent above where it started the year, outpacing the 0.4 per cent advance by the overall Nasdaq Composite. Shares of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Exelixis and Prothena Corp have all climbed more than 100 per cent.Biotechs have also seen strong demand for new issuance. Some 94 companies have come to market, raising a total of $8.5bn year-to-date, Dealogic data shows. The figure is tracking ahead of the record $11.6bn raised in 2010, when 77 companies floated. Of the 39 debuts in the US, share prices have advanced 24 per cent on average.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on,” Mrs Clinton wrote in a tweet, referring to a company that hiked the price of a medicine for a form of parasitic infection from $13.50 to $750 overnight.The tweet sent the Nasdaq biotech index down by almost 5 per cent in New York trading. Shares in Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical group that has a reputation for implementing steep price hikes, fell by 5.4 per cent.In August, Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is running against Mrs Clinton for the Democratic nomination, wrote to Valeant, asking why it had sharply raised the price of two heart drugs after acquiring them last year.On the day it secured the rights to the drug, Valeant hiked the price of a vial of Isuprel more than sixfold to $1,346.62 while tripling the price of Nitropress to $805.61.Shares in Biogen, which makes a multiple sclerosis drug that costs roughly $55,000 a year, fell by 5.6 per cent, while Alexion, which makes a drug for rare blood disorders that costs roughly $500,000 per patient, fell by 3.6 per cent.Gilead, often seen as the poster child for high drug prices because of its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, fell by 2.5 per cent.Mrs Clinton’s tweet referred to the case of Daraprim, a 62-year old drug for a life-threatening parasitic infection. It was bought in August by privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals, which immediately raised the price by more than 5,000 per cent.In an interview with CNBC, Martin Shkreli, Turing’s chief executive, defended the price hike and said the company planned to use the extra revenues to fund research into a better alternative.Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerableRead more“There’s a lot people who die from toxoplasmosis and the field desperately needs new ways to treat it,” he said. “We’re working hard on trying to find new ways.”“At this price, Daraprim is still at the low end of what ‘orphan drugs’ cost,” Mr Turing added, using the term to describe medicines for rare illnesses.Mrs Clinton’s tweet followed weekend comments on Face the Nation, a Sunday talk show, where she applauded President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform, the Affordable Healthcare Act, for “lots of positives” but said there were still “issues that need to be addressed”.“I’m going to address them this week, starting with how we’re going to try to control the cost of skyrocketing prescription drugs. It’s something I hear about everywhere I go,” she said.You create a drug that cures a hitherto difficult and expensive-to-treat killer disease. How much should you charge for your invention? Read moreBiotech valuations have soared in recent years amid a proliferation of new drug discoveries and an M&A frenzy, but the sector’s stellar performance is predicated on a belief that companies can continue to secure premium prices in the world’s largest healthcare market.The US is often seen by pharma executives as the only market where they can recoup large investments in new drugs, given the presence of pricing regulators in many other parts of the world, such as the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.The US has just 4.6 per cent of the world’s population but accounts for 33 per cent of global drug spending.

A bear market is a 20 per cent or more decline from a recent peak.Biotech has been one of the best performing sectors in US equities in the bull market of the past seven years as investors have chased the returns that follow the discovery of new blockbuster drugs.But with global markets now turning, the sector is falling fast and dropped another 2.6 per cent to 3,470.76, its fifth day of losses. The
index is down 16.6 per cent since its July peak.“Everyone was hiding [in biotech], trying to still go up in a flat market,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “They drove those valuations too high and they’re paying the piper now so to speak.”Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Celgene and Biogen, known as the “big four” of biotech, were all hit.Celgene plunged 21.2 per cent on the open, before recovering to trade down 1.2 per cent lower at $117.62 in the afternoon. Gilead dropped as much as 8 per cent before trading 0.8 per cent lower at $104.49 later in the day.Amgen initially dropped 9.3 per cent but later traded just 1.2 per cent down at $117.62, while Biogen slid 9 per cent but was trading 1.2 per cent lower at $291.82 by the afternoon.Daniel Koller, of Swiss investment company BB Biotech, said the sell-off had driven valuations of large-cap biotech stocks to “very attractive levels”.“We see the current sector correction in the context of all equity markets under pressure given no change to the fundamentally very sound biotech business model,” he added.Since March 2009, the Nasdaq biotech index had risen 580 per cent by the time it reached its July peak, and putting it up by 31.1 per cent for the year.The index is now up just 9.1 per cent year-to-date and has returned to its lowest level since February.The impressive run has been driven by a flood of private companies going public and mergers and acquisitions activity.Just 11 biotech and pharmaceutical companies floated in 2011, a number that had rocketed to 84 in 2014. So far this year, 37 companies had raised $3.7bn going public, according to Dealogic.Biotech’s rise had led to warnings the market was showing signs of dotcom era exuberance and had been driven by an era of cheap money that has helped change the dynamics of drug development.With interest rates at rock-bottom levels, biotech start-ups have increasingly turned to the public markets to fund drugs through clinical trials instead of partnering up with big pharmaceuticals.According to estimates from Silicon Valley Bank, more than 40 per cent of venture capital backed “biopharma” companies that came to the market in 2014 were yet to complete phase 1 trials or were pre-clinical.However, the carnage in global markets is already deterring companies from coming to market.RainDance Technologies pulled plans for an initial public offering, citing “market conditions”.The Massachusetts-based company makes medical devices for genetic testing and was planning to raise $60m from public markets."
74;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Drug pricing comes under the microscope;How do you value life-saving, ‘precision’ drugs?;"You create a drug that cures a hitherto difficult and expensive-to-treat killer disease. How much should you charge for your invention?Do you price it at a level linked in some way to the cost of development and manufacture? Or should you mark it up for the “value” you believe you are offering the patient — even if that far exceeds what the market may be able to bear?The drugs industry has little difficulty answering this question. Increasingly it opts aggressively for the value-based approach.Perhaps the best example is Sovaldi, a recently launched blockbusting treatment for the potentially fatal liver-wasting virus, hepatitis C. Unlike previous drugs, which have nasty side effects and cure only one-third of patients, it eliminates the virus in about 95 per cent of those who take a largely uneventful 12-week regimen.The snag is the cost. Sovaldi’s manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, has set a list price for that regimen of $84,000. The company says this is justified because it compares favourably with the cost of liver transplants for patients whose condition has degenerated into cirrhosis. But this is a last-ditch treatment applying to only a minority of cases.More than 3m Americans suffer from hepatitis C, out of an estimated 150m worldwide. Just treating those US patients would cost almost $300bn — a budget-busting sum for creaking healthcare systems.Sovaldi’s price has of course thrilled Wall Street, and Gilead is now valued at $170bn: more than Merck, the world’s fifth-largest pharmaceutical company by sales. But it has incurred considerable odium among the healthcare systems that must pay. Medicare and Medicaid, two US public insurance programmes, stumped up $6bn for Sovaldi last year (out of the drug’s total $12bn of sales worldwide). The latter now says it has no option but to ration access to the most serious sufferers.Pfizer has been accused by the UK’s competition watchdog of abusing its dominant position in the supply of an anti-epilepsy medicine and inflating the NHS drugs bill by tens of millions of pounds.Read onMedicaid’s boss, Jeff Myers, compares Gilead’s conduct unfavourably with those of past drug inventors. “If Jonas Salk had priced the polio vaccine like Gilead, we’d still have polio,” he grumbles. The economist Jeffrey Sachs is even more scathing: “Gilead’s mark-up over costs may be close to 1,000-to-1, probably a world record.”Gilead isn’t alone in setting very high prices for new “precision” drugs. Vertex, another up-and-coming pharma group, recently launched Kalydeco, a cystic fibrosis pill that costs $300,000 a year. Sanofi’s Praluent, a new cholesterol treatment, will retail at $14,600, against statins that cost a few hundred dollars a year. These prices help to explain why the total US drug bill rose 14 per cent in 2014.Value-based pricing may sound plausible. After all, many healthcare systems have some sort of accounting measure that ascribes a cost to a life — however morally queasy that may sound. Britain’s National Health Service does some complicated sums to calculate “ quality adjusted life years” — the amount it might pay for an additional year of life a patient would otherwise have missed.David Crow discusses the sharp falls in biotech stocks that followed Hillary Clinton’s pledge to crack down on the rising cost of prescription drugs after Turing raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a pill and whether such proposals will end ‘price gouging’.But it is very questionable whether this is the right model for drugs companies to employ. Think of the businesses where value-based models are common. Airlines use it to allocate scarce seats on popular flights. Manufacturers of luxury goods use it to justify prices for goods that are out of all proportion to the cost of production. As the healthcare economist Jack Scannell points out, it is a way of charging more.The public accepts all this because it can respond by walking away; by not taking that flight to Bali, for instance, or spurning that Chanel handbag. That is not the case, however, with life-saving remedies, especially when alternatives are non-existent — or far less effective. Aggressive value maximisation also sits ill with a patent system that suppresses competition by awarding a drug company a legal monopoly for a time to sell a drug it has discovered.Rationing is the ultimate consequence of high drug prices. Unsurprisingly, this is unpopular and is causing a backlash. In a number of US states, politicians are seeking to pass legislation forcing drug companies to disclose more information about the cost of producing their high-priced remedies. There is even talk of capping prices.$84,000Gilead’s list price for a regimen of SolvadiThe industry argues that such caps would drive capital out of the industry, cutting innovation and ultimately harming patients. But that is a hard argument to sustain when companies such as Gilead and Vertex are earning gross margins of 90 per cent and share prices are sky high. Pharmaceutical innovation has been one of the great successes of the past century, improving the lives of people immeasurably round the globe. But if the current dispensation is to continue, the industry must learn to price with greater restraint.jonathan.ford@ft.com"

Sales fell nearly 41 per cent to $2.6bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast a loss of 56 cents a share, on sales of $2.5bn. Adjusting for one-off items the company reported a profit of 1 cent, ahead of forecasts for a loss of 52 cents.Oil production of 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) topped estimates for 301,000.The unexpected profits were driven by lower operating costs and a rise in oil output driven by its Wattenberg field in Colorado and by output in Delaware and the Gulf of Mexico.Total oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production of 846,000 boepd was, however, shy of forecasts for about 862,000.“All of Anadarko Petroleum’s large projects are advancing and new discoveries, which will likely be unappreciated in this market, should add long-term value, all else being equal,” said Michael Scialla, an analyst at Stifel.Shares of Anadarko Petroleum, which have declined 30 per cent in the past year, rose 4.7 per cent to $76.28 and were among the best-performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 on Wednesday.Elsewhere, Yelp suffered its biggest one day decline on record after the online review site cut its full-year sales outlook roughly 5 per cent on Tuesday and projected revenues short of Wall Street forecasts.The stock plunged 25 per cent to a two-year low of $25.11.Twitter was also high on investors’ sell lists. Shares in the social media platform known for its 140-character messages tumbled 14.5 per cent on Wednesday to $31.24, wiping more than $3bn off the company’s valuation after its finance chief warned meaningful user growth was not yet in sight.A top gainer, Citrix Systems rose 8.1 per cent to $75.27.

76;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-07-12T12:32:26Z;Drugmakers premiere summer blockbusters;New multibillion-dollar drugs offset patent expiries;Blockbuster drugs are back. A wave of new multibillion-dollar medicines for heart disease and high cholesterol, added to recent breakthroughs in cancer and hepatitis C, is reviving optimism that the pharmaceuticals industry has moved beyond the heavy patent losses of the past few years.Last week, Entresto — a heart disease treatment from Novartis, which cut death rates by 20 per cent in clinical trials — was approved by US regulators. Analysts are now tipping it to reach $6bn in annual sales.Similar expectations surround anti-cholesterol drugs from Sanofi of France and Amgen of the US, both of which look set for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in coming weeks. They were recommended by the regulator’s advisory panel last month.These three weapons against heart failure— the world’s biggest killer — come on the heels of a new category of cancer drugs that harnesses the human immune system to destroy tumours. The first of these so-called immunotherapies was launched by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb last year and analysts expect them to generate $35bn of annual sales within a decade.Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences has sold about $20bn-worth of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine and a follow-on product called Harvoni since the former was approved 19 months ago — making it the most successful drug launch in history.All of the successes reflect a broader pharmaceuticals resurgence. A record 61 drugs were introduced around the world last year, according to Citeline, the research firm, compared with an annual average of 34 in the previous decade.Elias Zerhouni, president of research and development for Sanofi, says the industry is finally feeling the benefits of scientific advances triggered by the sequencing of the human genome 15 years ago. This has led to more targeted treatments and a deeper understanding of the biological processes behind disease.“People are using human genetics in ways that have never been possible before,” he says, citing the way that Sanofi’s new Praluent drug targets a particular protein, called PCSK9, associated with high levels of the “bad” cholesterol linked with heart disease.Praluent and Repatha, the rival Amgen product, are aimed at people who do not respond to statins, the mass-market cholesterol-busters that emerged from pharma’s last golden age of innovation in the 1990s. It was the expiration of patents on blockbusters from this era — such as Pfizer’s Lipitor statin — that sent the industry into a slump from which it is only now recovering.Sales lost to cut-price generic competition reached a peak of $37bn in 2012, according to Evaluate, the research group. But that figure is now falling and forecast to reach $12bn by 2020 — because the paucity of innovation over the past decade has meant fewer drugs patents are ending.A combination of declining patent expiries and rising drug launches ought to create fertile conditions for growth. With an ageing world population, increasing incidence of chronic disease and widening access to healthcare, there is certainly no shortage of demand. Investors appear confident: S&P’s pharmaceuticals index has risen by almost a quarter in the past year.Amid all this optimism, however, there is little sense of triumph among pharma executives. Instead, the mood has been unsettled as a wave of mergers and acquisitions have swept the sector. Big drugmakers have been scrambling to buy promising young biotech companies and trading businesses with each other as they jostle to build the strongest product portfolios.Rather than a sign of confidence from a resurgent industry, some explain this M&A boom as preparation for challenges ahead.Downward pricing pressure hitherto associated with the cash-strapped public health systems of Europe has been spreading across the Atlantic, as the US gets serious about cutting waste from its private health market. A backlash by insurers and health providers against Gilead’s $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C drugs last year was seen by many as a harbinger of tougher times in the world’s biggest pharma market.Alert to these pressures, Novartis has indicated that it will experiment with outcome-based pricing for Entresto in an effort to encourage wide uptake. This would involve a link between price and performance to ensure the company is only rewarded if the medicine works.Sanofi and Amgen are also braced for difficult negotiations over the price of their PCSK9 drugs. Mr Zerhouni acknowledges that, while levels of innovation have risen, so too have commercial hurdles. “If you are not first in class, best in class or a very fast second you will not see a return [on investment].”June 2015: An NHS decision not to stock a new cancer drug from AstraZeneca has seen the UK pharma group accuse the country of stymieing scientific innovation. Andrew Ward explains the predicamentWatch videoThese pressures are also prompting a rethink of the way drugs are developed. Secretive in-house R&D operations are being broken up in favour of collaboration with academia and biotech. Sanofi’s Praluent, for example, was developed in partnership with a smaller US partner called Regeneron. Meanwhile, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have launched fast-track approval processes to speed the path of breakthrough medicines.All these factors have played a role in the R&D renaissance. But Julian Remnant, life science partner at Deloitte, warns that productivity is still depressed by high costs. According to the Tuft Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, the average bill for a new drug has risen to $2.6bn, from $802m the last time an estimate was made in 2003.Return on R&D investment edged up to 5.5 per cent in 2014, from 5.1 per cent the year before, according to Deloitte, but Mr Remnant says it is too soon to declare an improving trend. “The industry has got wind in its sails again but it needs to use this momentum to drive change.”Big pharma was supposed to have moved beyond the blockbuster era. Instead of medicines for the masses, many of today’s drug breakthroughs are targeted at specific genetic mutations in smaller numbers of patients.However, there are still plenty of opportunities where the potential market size and price are high enough to achieve blockbuster drug status: annual sales in excess of $1bn. Eleven blockbusters are expected to launch this year, up from three in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. These include:Praluent (Sanofi/Regeneron): A clinical trial last week showed it reduced “bad cholesterol” by an average 64 per cent among patients with an inherited form of high cholesterol or pre-existing heart disease. Forecast 2019 sales: $4.4bnEntresto (Novartis): A twice daily tablet that reduces strain on a failing heart. Reduced hospitalisation and deaths by one-fifth in trials compared with an existing drug. Forecast 2019 sales: $3.7bnIbrance (Pfizer): Granted conditional approval by US regulators in February for women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer — the most common form of the disease. In combination with AstraZeneca’s Faslodex, the drug slowed cancer progression by 9.2 months, compared with 3.8 months for Faslodex alone. Forecast 2019 sales: $2.8bnRepatha (Amgen): A rival to Sanofi’s Praluent targeting the PCSK9 protein associated with high cholesterol. Both were recommended by an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration last month but questions remain over how widely they should be used. Forecast 2019 sales: $1.9bn
77;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-05-13T04:08:06Z;Drug ‘super spenders’ cost US healthcare system $52bn;Express Scripts report finds big rise in number of patients with bills exceeding $50,000;More than half a million Americans each consumed at least $50,000 worth of prescription drugs last year, a jump of 63 per cent compared with a year earlier, according to research that will fuel the debate over rising US healthcare costs.In a report entitled “Super Spending”, Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy group, found that 576,000 patients each took prescription drugs with a combined pricetag of $50,000 in 2014, versus 352,000 in 2013.The number of individual Americans taking at least $100,000 worth of prescription drugs jumped almost threefold to 139,000, due in large part to a new $1,000-a-day pill for hepatitis C made by Gilead, the California-based biotech company, which patients must typically take for 12 weeks.Express Scripts, which manages more than a billion prescriptions a year, said the research highlighted a “$52bn challenge for the US healthcare system”, which has been contending with years of rising costs due to the launch of new expensive drugs, an ageing population, and a culture of waste and inefficiency.Among patients whose costs reached $100,000 or higher, more than a third were being treated for 10 or more conditions and approximately 60 per cent took at least 10 different medications. Almost three-quarters had prescriptions from at least four different doctors.The practice of pharmacies mixing drugs especially for individual patients, known as “compounding”, was also blamed for the spike in “super spenders”.“A lot of creams and ointments were being mixed up with exotic things, and then the pharmacist was charging something like $10,000 versus pennies for some other product,” said Dr Glen Stettin, a senior vice-president at Express Scripts.Dr Stettin, who said some pharmacists had committed “egregious abuses”, added: “In the worst cases, pharmacists were crushing up nerve and pain pills and putting them into mixtures — who knows how safe they were.”Express Scripts said it has since reduced spending on compounded drugs by 95 per cent in its patient population, by putting in new controls to eliminate the practice. It has also switched to a cheaper hepatitis C medication marketed by Gilead’s rival AbbVie.However, the pharmacy group warned that new medications due to launch in the next 12 months had the potential to push the cost of “super spenders” higher still. It cited a class of medicines known as PCSK9-inhibitors, designed to reduce cholesterol, which could cost up to $1,000 a month.

79;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-04-12T17:00:56Z;Pharma combats diversion of cheap drugs;Gilead tries to stop generics for poorer countries going elsewhere;Under fire over the high price of its Hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi, Gilead decided last year to make the drug available in 91 developing countries for $300 per bottle, or $900 per 12-week course – just 1 per cent of the medicine’s $1,000 per pill US sticker price.According to the US-based biotech company, its decision – which permits a clutch of selected Indian drugmakers to produce and sell generic versions of Sovaldi in those markets – will give affordable access to the potentially life-saving treatment to patients in the world’s poorest countries.But as the first Indian-made generics start to roll off the production lines, Gilead is coming in for heavy criticism. Médecins Sans Frontières, the medical charity, is accusing the US group of promoting overly-intrusive patient surveillance to stop the generic, called sofosbuvir, being diverted to patients in developed countries where the drug is more costly and tightly rationed by strained public health systems.Sofosbuvir is therefore becoming a test of big pharma’s ability to sell drugs at widely divergent prices in different parts of the world. It comes at a time when the industry is attempting to defend hefty profit margins in rich countries while providing affordable access to treatments in the developing world.Leena Mengahaney, head of MSF’s drug access campaign in South Asia, says people in high-price developed countries — where expensive treatments are reserved for the sickest first — will be aware of the price differential. “There are bound to be patients on the waiting list who think they should get on a plane and get access before they get really sick.”Gilead, she says, is “trying to turn the Indian generics makers into their police to police the system”.Its hepatitis C medicine is an extreme case, because it involves an especially high-priced drug to treat a disease that is widespread in poorer countries. However, similar situations are sure to arise as global drugmakers focus on more specialist and high-priced therapies while a growing middle class in the developing world demands access to modern medicines.In recent years, many Western drug companies have introduced so called ‘tiered global pricing’ for patented drugs to treat diseases like cancer and diabetes, making medicines available to patients at slightly discounts in emerging markets like India. Such price differentials aren’t wide enough to trigger Western patient interest in procuring medicine from abroad, as most are able to access the drugs through insurance or public health schemes.But the October 2000 drama of South African HIV/Aids activists arriving in Thailand and publicly buying suitcases full of a low-cost generic version of the Aids drug Fluconazole take back home – where the medicine was patented and to expensive to be within reach of many who needed it – is a cautionary tale of what can happen when price differentials between different countries grow too wide.Gilead denies requiring Indian generics companies, and their distributors, to collect and maintain records of all patients purchasing the drug in India, but says it has asked generic firms to take reasonable steps to deter large-scale “diversion” of the drug to other countries.“There are bound to be patients on the waiting list who think they should get on a plane and get access before they get really sick.”“We are not going to prevent people coming and bringing a couple of bottles or even a box back in their suitcase, or a person from the US or Europe coming and seeking to access the product,” says Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice-president for corporate and medical affairs.“We are trying to do something practical that enables simple, easy access in the countries where we intend the product to be used, and can have some impact on preventing broad, wide-scale diversion.”Executives at Indian drugmakers say that Gilead had been pushing for strict surveillance over sofosbuvir use in India – where the generic versions have just been launched. In addition to asking companies to collect patient data – which is highly sensitive in a country where many hepatitis C patients are co-infected with HIV – the company had initially wanted patients to return empty bottles of their medicine before they received the next batch.This requirement is in force in Pakistan, where most low-price sofosbuvir is dispatched directly to patients through a courier system, bypassing pharmacies.But Gilead has since softened its stance in India following “pushback” from activists and the generics companies themselves.$1,000 per pillUS sticker price of Hepatitis C drug sold for $300 per bottle to 91 developing countries“They were trying to say, ‘keep tabs on every patient’ and pushing pretty hard on how to do anti-diversion,” explains the chief executive of one of Indian-generic firm authorised to sell the medicine in emerging markets. “In the end, sensing the ground realities in a country like India, I think they have mellowed down.”Denis Broun, public access and global affairs director for Mumbai-based Cipla – another of the sofosbuvir licensees – said many of Gilead’s proposed anti-diversion measures were unfeasible, given India’s size, highly-fragmented drug distribution channels and regulations barring companies from dealing directly with patients.These measures also threatened to become barriers to access for genuine patients. “With these promises, we would be using a sledgehammer to kill a fly when we are not even sure the fly exists,” Mr Broun said.However, he said Cipla is asking distributors to ensure sofosbuvir purchasers have valid prescriptions from Indian doctors, and it plans to regularly monitor the general flow of the drug.“It is very difficult to ask manufacturers to take responsibility for diversions,” Mr Broun said, “but we see peaks in certain areas, then we are going to take measures to explain them, or discontinue the authorisation to the distributors.”51Number of “middle-income countries” where Indian generics firms are barred from selling, under terms of their licence with GileadNevertheless, Gilead’s attempts to monitor sofosvubir use highlights the difficulty in trying to maintain a tiered global pricing structure in a world of easy mobility and communications.Along with the prospect of some generic sofosvubir reaching Western patients, Gilead is concerned about the potential flow of Indian-made generics to 51 middle income countries. These are countries that, combined, suffer a quarter of the global hepatitis C burden – but where the Indian generics firms are barred from selling, under the terms of their license from Gilead.Gilead aims to supply these middle income countries – which include Brazil, China, and Thailand – at prices yet to be fixed. It is in talks with some governments to start national hepatitis C treatment programmes, which would allow for sale of the drug directly to health administrations.But many of these countries have not have approved Sovaldi, or sofosbuvir, for sale, as yet, which could lead patients to turn to India. “Most of the diversion isn’t going to be to western Europe or the US,” Mr Alton predicts. “It’s going to be to eastern Europe and Asia . . . where you are going to have a lot of patients with some ability to pay that aren’t going to have access to product.”As he fends off criticism of its anti-diversion efforts, Mr Alton also notes that Gilead is doing far more than rivals such as AbbVie to make hepatitis C treatment available to the world’s poor. “We are trying to change the conversation to show that we can have intellectual property and provide access,” he says.
80;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-03-10T09:23:29Z;Buybacks sustain US bull run;Apple alone bought $45bn of its own stock last year;The fatigued US bull-run has one piston that continues to fire.S&P 500 companies spent more than $900bn on share buybacks and dividends over the past 12 months, more than twice the level recorded five years ago as the US began to emerge from the financial crisis, and a key driver in the stock market’s ageing six-year rally.The consistent buying by US corporates, often prompted by shareholder activism, has supported the stock market rally into 2015, offsetting wide selling by investors who see more opportunity in European equities. Investors have pulled roughly $28.5bn from mutual funds and exchange traded funds invested in the S&P 500 since the year began, data from fund tracker Lipper shows.Flush with cash, US multinationals spent $553.2bn on buybacks and $350.4bn on dividends in 2014, choosing shareholder returns over investment in research and development and capital expenditures given the bumpy global economic backdrop, according to preliminary data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.“Cash in the fourth quarter set another all-time record in the index,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It’s what they chose to do. In this case [companies] are being pushed by outside people to give back more. It does not mean they are being generous at all.”The practice, while appeasing shareholders, has been cause for criticism as analysts wait for a meaningful rise in sales — the missing link in the current recovery. S&P 500 corporates are not expected to move the needle this year, with bottom-up consensus forecasts projecting a meagre increase in revenues, largely the result of a slump in oil prices.Investors expect cash to continue to funnel to buybacks and dividends. Despite the record levels of returns, dividend payouts stood at 38 per cent of earnings last year — below historic levels, Mr Silverblatt noted.Orrin Sharp-Pierson, a strategist at BNP Paribas, added that buybacks have been “very important” to the S&P 500’s gains and that slower earnings growth “will generally not impact the flow”.He added: “The ‘stock effect’ is that companies have bought back around 20 per cent of market capitalisation since Lehman’s collapse, or around $3.8tn using today’s equity prices.“Compare that to the $4.5tn Fed balance sheet or a very similar expansion of $3.5tn.”Apple has become the exemplar for share buybacks, purchasing $45bn-worth of its stock last year, more than the combined value of shares bought by ExxonMobil, Intel, IBM and Wells Fargo, the SPDJI data show. Analysts on Wall Street expect the iPhone maker to increase its programme this April, with those at Credit Suisse forecasting $165bn-worth of buybacks to be completed over the next two and a half years.The Cupertino-based group is not alone, as companies increase buyback schemes to negate expiring employee options. On Monday, Qualcomm lifted its buyback authorisation to $15bn and the management team said they intended to complete two-thirds of the purchases within the next 12 months. Home Depot, Gilead Sciences and PepsiCo have also authorised $10bn plus buybacks since the year began.Two-thirds of companies in the S&P 500 have reduced their share count in the past year, including more than a fifth who have done so by more than 4 per cent. Those reductions signal capital discipline, investors say, particularly amid the frenetic pace of dealmaking at the start of the year.“Once you use cash to buy back stock, it can’t be used to overpay for an acquisition or invest in an underperforming division,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said. “That’s a constructive message to shareholders in what remains a very sluggish global growth environment.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
81;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;M&A helps lift US healthcare stocks;Rising profits blunt concerns that the sector is overvalued;Gilead Sciences, the biotech behemoth that has seen its market valuation soar to a cool $145bn, has put in a strong performance over the past 14 months with its shares rising more than 30 per cent.The gain, however, is seemingly modest compared with many of Gilead’s compatriots, several of which doubled over the same period. A dozen of its S&P 500 peers have climbed more than 40 per cent.US healthcare stocks have staged a vibrant rally over the past six years, buoyed by novel drug treatments, an ageing population and industry-wide consolidation. Rising profits have blunted concerns that the sector is overvalued and equity strategists on Wall Street continue to recommend that clients invest in the industry.Since the start of 2014, the S&P 500 healthcare index has advanced 26 per cent, including gains of more than 100 per cent by Hospira, Mallinckrodt and Allergan — two of which agreed to takeovers — while the Nasdaq biotech index has climbed 40 per cent. The wider S&P 500 has risen 11.5 per cent over the same period.“More than any other sector, healthcare is benefiting from strong demographic and secular trends: ageing population, expanding insurance coverage, growing middle-class around the world, new product launches,” says Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, equity strategist with JPMorgan.The fourth-quarter earnings season added to Mr Lakos-Bujas’s confidence. “Healthcare companies reported the strongest organic growth of all sectors — 11 per cent revenue growth and 22 per cent earnings growth — and ranked the highest on beats,” he says.That trend is likely to continue. S&P 500 healthcare earnings per share are expected to climb 8.9 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, outpacing forecasts for a 1.7 per cent rise in the broader blue-chip index, data from S&P Capital IQ show. The industry’s sales growth, projected at 7.1 per cent this year, is thought to only trail the tech sector’s 9.1 per cent year-on-year gain.The brisk pace of growth has made valuations more palatable, says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. Mr Ablin points to metrics including the price-to-sales ratio, which stands at 1.84 times 2015 results for the S&P 500 healthcare sector, in line with the blue-chip index and below that of the technology complex.“In general, we like cheap sectors that are moving in the right direction and healthcare has been cheap relative to its peers pretty consistently for the last six years,” he says.Strategists with Barclays note the biotech sector has fuelled much of the earnings growth within the healthcare industry, as companies like Gilead bring new products to market. The California-based company’s revenues more than doubled in 2014 to $24.9bn, while its profits rose nearly fourfold to $12.1bn. Analysts on Wall Street expect sales of the company’s blockbuster Harvoni and Sovaldi hepatitis C treatments to top $61bn between 2015 and the end of 2018.“Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader markets,” says Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.Portfolio managers have increased exposure to the sector through new issues, with healthcare companies raising more than $10bn through initial public offerings in 2014, the highest level in at least two decades, according to Dealogic.Merger and acquisition activity has also buoyed valuations, with $10bn-plus deals announced between Allergan and Actavis, Covidien and Medtronic, Hospira and Pfizer as well as CareFusion and Becton Dickinson. The prospect of further consolidation has acted as a floor on share prices, and bankers and investors on Wall Street broadly expect the pace of deals to continue.“There were three things driving M&A over the past year, and two of the three are intact,” says Marshall Gordon, senior healthcare analyst at ClearBridge Investments, which has $115bn assets under management. “The first, big companies still need more products, their growth is somewhat uneven and some still need a help in the shorter term. Secondly, financing continues to be extremely inexpensive.”Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader marketsBut the third driver fizzled when the US Treasury Department clamped down on tax inversions last autumn, killing AbbVie’s $55bn merger with Shire. A deal in Washington to tax overseas cash piles, remove certain credits or to introduce a tax on foreign earnings, none certain to pass, could also weigh on the sector — a point Citi has highlighted as it rates the sector underweight.“Individual companies though could experience major shifts, especially if certain deductions would be removed like R&D tax credits which benefit technology, biotech, drug and med-tech companies the most,” says Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist with Citi.Morgan Stanley recently cooled on the healthcare sector, shifting to a market-weight rating after four years in the overweight camp in December. The sector came under pressure in early February after Gilead warned it would cut the price of its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill as insurers and pharmacy benefit managers angled for greater discounts. The reverberations were clear: payers were pushing back.For Morgan Stanley and Citi, another point sticks out: after six years of gains, valuations are not as attractive as they once were.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
82;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-02-04T18:27:44Z;Gilead sinks on discounting worries;Consumer discretionary and telecoms offer support to S&P 500;Gilead Sciences shares tumbled on Wednesday despite exceeding fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates after it said it would have to offer discounts on its hepatitis C drug.The California-based company said it would make a “gross to net adjustment” of 46 per cent on US sales of its Harvoni and Sovaldi pills this year.Sales of the company’s older hepatitis C medication, Sovaldi, slowed to $1.73bn from a quarter earlier as patients transitioned to its successor, Harvoni.The new medication, which has a cure rate of 94-99 per cent and a $94,500 price tag for a 12-week treatment, beat Wall Street estimates at $2.11bn. Sales a quarter earlier were limited as the medication was only available in Europe.“Gilead expects lower margins to be offset by higher patient volumes and fewer eligibility restrictions, including treating F0 patients (no fibrosis) in select agreements,” said Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura.Gilead expects to have capacity to treat more than 250,000 patients for hepatitis C in 2015.Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS, said market penetration would rise as the drug became more affordable, but in the short term “more patients are captured by Gilead ahead of further competition”.But he added that year estimates beyond 2015 would decrease because more patients would have been cured.Gilead profits more than tripled from a year earlier to $3.49bn, or $2.18 a share in the three months to the end of December, while sales more than doubled to $7.3bn.Gilead announced that it would pay a 43 per cent quarterly dividend and announced a $15bn share buyback programme.Shares of Gilead, which have climbed more than 18 per cent in the past year, fell more than 8 per cent to $98.43, wiping $16.5bn in market capitalisation.Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 7 per cent to $676.00 after the restaurant chain reported a 16.1 rise in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, shy of Wall Street estimates for 16.5 per cent growth.Earnings of $3.84 a share topped forecasts, while sales of $1.1bn were in line with estimates.Ralph Lauren was the worst performing stock on the US benchmark after the company reported a 9 per cent drop in fiscal third-quarter profits to $215m or $2.41 a share and sales of $2.03bn that missed Wall Street estimates.The retailer expects fiscal 2015 revenue to rise 4 per cent in constant currency terms, lower than its previous estimates for 5-7 per cent growth. Its shares fell 18 per cent to $139.71.Walt Disney shares advanced nearly 8 per cent to $101.28 after it topped fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales estimates driven by sales of consumer products and home entertainment related to its 2013 animated hit Frozen.Kohl’s reported a 3.7 per cent rise in same-store sales, ahead of its forecast for 2-3 per cent growth, lifting shares up more than 6 per cent to $66.87.Consumer discretionary and telecoms stocks offered support to the US benchmark as lower oil prices and healthcare stocks weighed on the index.The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 2,041.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 17,673.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 4,716.70.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
83;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-02-04T00:43:37Z;Gilead to cut price of $1,000-a-day pill;US pharmacy groups had threatened to seek cheaper hepatitis medicine;Gilead warned investors on Tuesday that it would have to offer steep discounts on its controversial $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill, after US pharmacy groups and insurers threatened to switch to a cheaper alternative.The biotech company said it would have to make a “gross to net adjustment” of 46 per cent on US sales of its Harvoni and Sovaldi pills in 2015, sending its shares down 5.5 per cent in after-hours trading. Most analysts and investors were working on the assumption that Gilead would have to offer discounts of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.Groups that buy medication for US patients have been demanding bigger concessions after AbbVie launched its rival hepatitis C drug, Vikera Pak, at the end of last year, and the competitive pressure has weighed on Gilead’s share price.Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefits manager, in December announced it would exclusively use AbbVie’s drug, wiping $20bn off Gilead’s market capitalisation in a single day and sparking a broad sell-off in the biotech sector.Since then, Gilead has unveiled its own exclusive deals with groups including CVS/Caremark and UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, although it is now clear it had to offer significant price cuts to win the business.Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, described the news as a “shock” because Gilead had been “fairly outspoken about its ability to maintain price due to its differentiated product and strong position with physicians”.Gilead’s once-a-day hepatitis C pills are extremely effective, with success rates of between 94 and 99 per cent, but their cost has sparked an outcry among doctors and health insurers and triggered questioning from senators. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni has a “sticker price” of $94,500 — or $1,125 a pill.AbbVie’s drug is just as effective but it requires the patient to take between three and six pills per day, making it a more cumbersome treatment. Merck has said it will file for approval of an alternative single-pill treatment later this year.If there is this much discounting when there are just two competitors in the market, everyone will be asking what happens when there are three“If there is this much discounting when there are just two competitors in the market, everyone will be asking what happens when there are three,” said Mr Porges.The company said the bigger discounts would be offset by higher volume and that it was “confident a substantially higher number of patients will be treated in 2015”.The discount warning came as Gilead unveiled fourth-quarter results that underlined the huge success of its hepatitis C franchise, which launched in 2013.Excluding one-off items, the company earned $2.43 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.47 a year earlier, on revenues of $7.3bn, compared to $3bn a year earlier. Analysts had typically expected $2.22 in earnings per share and revenues of $6.76bn.However, it said it expected product sales in 2015 to be between $26bn and $27bn, less than the $28bn typically forecast by analysts.Gilead said it would pay a maiden quarterly dividend of 43 cents a share starting in the second quarter of this year and announced a new $15bn share buyback programme.
84;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-02-02T05:05:36Z;Big pharmaceuticals groups faces biosimilars challenge;Drugs pipeline improves but report finds biological treatments are beginning to face competition;Global pharmaceuticals companies have seen an improvement in their drugs pipelines but the industry is facing a fresh challenge as the first generation of blockbuster biological drugs begins to face competition.Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have the strongest late-stage pipelines relative to existing revenues, while AstraZeneca has shown the greatest improvement over the past two years, says a report by credit rating agency Moody’s.However, those same three companies also face the greatest exposure to patent expiries over the next three years, highlighting the perennial battle faced by drugmakers to develop new medicines as old ones lose market exclusivity.Eli Lilly is one of five companies, together with Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer and Merck & Co to have seen an increase in patent exposure since Moody’s previous study in 2013.Michael Levesque, the report’s author, said this reflected rising competition from biosimilars— drugs that aim to mimic biological medicines at a lower price.Pharmaceuticals companies have been gradually shifting from chemical-based pills to more complex biological therapies derived from living cells. Whereas traditional drugs typically face low-cost generic competition as soon as their patents expire, so-called biologics are much harder to replicate.This has allowed biological products such as Roche’s breast cancer treatment Herceptin to maintain market dominance even after their patents have begun to expire.Mr Levesque said biosimilars were still a long way from threatening the almost overnight collapse in price and market share faced by non-biological drugs when they go off-patent. But he noted they were gradually gaining acceptance from regulators. In December, an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration paved the way for the first US biosimilar when it recommended approval for a copy of Amgen’s Neupogen cancer medicine by Novartis of Switzerland.“Companies with strong emphasis on biotech such as Roche and Biogen Idec still have the greatest protection from patent exposure but competition from biosimilars will gradually increase,” he added.Overall, Moody’s study showed a strengthening in outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry in the last two years ago as drug-development pipelines have improved.The FDA last year approved 41 new medicines— the most for 18 years and its second-highest tally on record. One of these was Opdivo, a hotly-anticipated cancer drug whose $4bn of forecast annual peak sales helped secure Bristol-Myers Squibb top spot in Moody’s ranking of pipeline strength.Amgen and Merck & Co were among others of the 16 companies analysed to show pipeline improvement compared with 2013.Mr Levesque said the industry was showing steady rather than dramatic progress, forecasting that operating profits would grow, on average, in the low-single digits over the next three years.In addition to patent exposure, increased pricing pressure was another brake on growth, he said, highlighting the recent push by US insurers to force discounts from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs.

Already this month the Nasdaq biotech index has risen 5.7 per cent, rebounding from a sell-off during December and adding more than $40bn to its market cap, compared with the broader S&P 500 which is little changed.The leadership by biotechs reflects how companies in the sector sit at the cutting edge of potential medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs, promising huge rewards for investors. In a low-growth environment biotechs are seen by investors as one of the few sectors that can deliver compelling opportunities.After four years of double-digit gains for the sector and five years when it has finished ahead of the benchmark S&P 500, Wall Street believes the biotech boom can continue.“We have witnessed significant innovation in the biotech industry over the early part of this decade, highlighted by cures in hepatitis C and transformative advances in prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and numerous orphan diseases,” said Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.“Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovation.”The bank also expects brisk earnings growth and projects a 19 per cent rise in large-cap biotech earnings this year, compared with an 8 per cent advance by the S&P 500 and an 11 per cent rise by healthcare, given drug launches and a slate of trials.But risks remain high, particularly for smaller companies awaiting data from trials and for looming drug launches. Goldman Sachs noted that expectations for some upcoming debuts varied greatly, which could present a hurdle for stocks. Forecasts for Vertex’s much-anticipated cystic fibrosis treatment range between a low of $1.3bn and a high of $2.8bn in 2016, which could represent three-quarters of the company’s overall sales.Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovationThe potential for lower payouts from pharmacy benefit managers and a rotation into other sectors of the market could also dent the biotech bull run.“Any sector that has had a three year-plus run like biotech, the risk grows as correlations between stocks grow,” says Matthew Harrison, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “A speed bump for one of the major biotechs appears to have significant sector implications.”Market valuations of three stalwarts of the industry — Biogen Idec, Gilead and Regeneron — have more than doubled over the past two years. New treatments, including Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C medications, have proved a fillip. Wall Street expects the latter to generate sales of $39.6bn between 2015 and 2017.The soaring valuations of the largest biotech companies are not particularly troublesome, according to analysts with Barclays and Morgan Stanley, who point to metrics such as price/earnings and equity value-to-sales ratios. The Nasdaq biotech index trades with a p/e of 42.7 times expected 2015 results, below the 72.6 level recorded in 2012 but far above that of the S&P 500, data from Bloomberg show.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
86;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Gilead and AbbVie take hepatitis C battle to Europe;Competition for new drugs will be welcomed by public health systems in Europe;Europe is to become the next battleground between Gilead Sciences and AbbVie in their scramble to win share of the fast-growing market for hepatitis C drugs.The companies have been fighting a high-profile price war in the US over a new generation of blockbuster medicines that can cure most people with the virus within weeks.The pair are preparing to open a new front across the Atlantic after European regulators gave AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatment the green light on Friday.Competition will be welcomed by public-funded European health systems that have been rattled by the high cost of Gilead’s Sovaldi medicine, which is priced at £34,983 for a 12-week course in the UK.Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, said the company was “committed to working with local governments and healthcare systems to support broad access” to its treatment.According to the World Health Organisation there are about 15m people infected with hepatitis C in Europe — about one in 50 of the population. The disease leads to potentially life-threatening liver cirrhosis in about a third of cases.It was announced last week that NHS England would delay full-scale introduction of Sovaldi by four months until the end of July to give it more time to prepare. Patient groups saw this as a cost-saving measure.Charles Gore, chief executive of the UK-based Hepatitis C Trust, urged European governments and health providers to use the arrival of AbbVie’s product as an opportunity to push for lower prices and wider access.He said: “Governments should say: ‘give us a better price and we will guarantee higher volumes’. Here we have a life-threatening infectious disease which is suddenly curable in most cases. So let’s find a way to give it to everyone.”The negotiating power of Europe’s single-payer health systems has already secured discounts from Gilead of more than 36 per cent over the US price of Sovaldi and the entry of AbbVie could drive deeper cuts.AbbVie launched its product in the US last month at a price of $83,319 for a 12-week course — just below the price of Sovaldi and sharply less than the $94,500 charged by Gilead for a new Sovaldi-based combination treatment called Harvoni.This has triggered a discounting battle as the pair compete to sell their medicines to rival US health insurance plans.Both companies declined to comment on their European pricing strategy.AbbVie’s treatment was approved on Friday by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with the genotype 1 form of hepatitis C, which represent 60 per cent of cases.The market for hepatitis C drugs is forecast by Datamonitor Healthcare to increase from $2.9bn in 2013 to $19.2bn in 2016. Of this, the top five European markets — France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK — accounted for $872m in 2013, rising to a forecast $4bn next year.The medicines are replacing old interferon-based treatments that have much lower success rates and more unpleasant side effects.Gilead and AbbVie have sought to justify their high prices by arguing that curing the disease saves money in the long-run by avoiding the higher cost of liver transplants and other care.
87;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-01-14T19:48:46Z;India spurns Gilead over hepatitis C patent;Refusal looks set to prompt cheap generic versions of blockbuster treatment Sovaldi;India’s patent controller has rejected a patent application from Gilead Sciences for a key compound for its blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, a refusal that activists said would allow Indian companies immediately to start producing cheap generic versions of the medicine.The ruling marks another example of India’s sceptical approach to pharmaceuticals patents a month after Bayer of Germany lost its bid to block a cheap version of its Nexavar cancer drug from being produced in the country.Gilead’s patent application was challenged by Natco Pharma, a Hyderabad-based generic drugs manufacturer, and a New York non-profit group called Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge.The patent controller ruled that the active compound in Sovaldi, also known as Sofosbuvir, was not sufficiently different to a previously-known molecule.Leena Menghaney, a campaigner for Médecins Sans Frontières’ Access to Medicines campaign, said the decision appeared to pave the way for “open competition” for the medicine in the Indian market.She said its price could drop as low as $1 a pill compared with $1,000 in the US.While the application for the final form of the drug is still pending in India, lawyers and activists say the rejection of the patent on the base compound significantly increases the likelihood that a patent will be refused for the final compound. However, activists expect Gilead to challenge the rejection, starting a long court battle over the issue.Sovaldi, which cures hepatitis C within 12 weeks in more than 90 per cent of cases, has become the latest flashpoint for activists campaigning for wider access to low-cost medicines in the developing world.The drug generated $8.6bn of sales in the first nine months of last year, a record for a new medicine, but its high price has caused controversy in the US as well as overseas.In September, Gilead signed a licensing agreement with seven leading Indian generics producers to make Sovaldi for 90 developing countries, a move that the US company said would ensure affordable access.But activists complained that many of the countries with the highest hepatitis C burden were excluded from the arrangement.Gilead said it would introduce Sovaldi itself to the Indian market at about $300 per bottle, or $900 for a full course, about 1 per cent of the US price.Ms Menghaney said the Indian patent controllers’ rejection of the application for the base compound of Sovaldi would create a truly free market for the drug in India.“What Gilead was introducing was managed competition, but now there is going to be open competition with companies other than those who have signed licences with Gilead,” she said.She added that the plunging price of the drug in India would draw international attention to the low cost of manufacturing the medication, increasing pressure for price cuts elsewhere. Gilead did not respond to requests for comment.India’s patent controller rejected the application on the grounds that the compound did not fulfil the criteria laid out in Indian patent law. The relevant clause states that any compound derived from a previously known compound can only be patented if it can show a substantial improvement in efficacy.
88;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2015-01-05T23:09:08Z;Gilead hepatitis-C drug wins CVS/Caremark backing;Agreement follows withdrawal of Express Scripts support;One of the largest US pharmacy groups has said it will make a $1,000-a-day pill the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers, boosting Gilead, the drug’s maker which recently lost the backing of America’s largest pharmacy benefits manager.CVS/Caremark, the number two pharmacy benefit manager, said that Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni pills would be the preferred treatment for sufferers of the disease, lifting Gilead shares by 2 per cent on Monday.CVS’s larger rival, Express Scripts, last month granted exclusivity to a competing drug made by AbbVie. That move wiped $20bn off Gilead’s market capitalisation in a single day and sparked a broader sell-off in the biotech sector, due to fears that healthcare groups would start forcing down the prices of expensive new drugs.Gilead’s once-a-day hepatitis-C pills are extremely effective, with success rates of between 94 and 99 per cent, but their cost has sparked an outcry among doctors and health insurers and triggered questioning from senators. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni costs $94,500 — or $1,125 a pill.Some pharmacy benefit managers, which manage prescription drug programmes on behalf of insurers, employers and other healthcare providers, had threatened to ditch Gilead’s drug when AbbVie started selling its rival hepatitis-C medicine, Viekira Pak.Express Scripts was the first to follow through last month, when it said it would make Viekira Pak the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers among the 25m patients whose employers deal directly with the company. It said it would also encourage representatives of a further 65m patients to switch.Viekira Pak has a success rate of up to 96 per cent and carries a price tag of $83,319 for a 12 week treatment — although Express Scripts secured a big discount in exchange for granting the drug exclusivity.However, Abbvie’s drug requires the patient to take between three and six pills a day, compared to just one for Gilead’s Harvoni, making it a much more cumbersome treatment. Given that many hepatitis-C patients are either vulnerable or ageing, doctors say a complicated regimen could have a negative impact on success rates.A spokesperson for CVS/Caremark said it had decided to make Gilead’s drugs the preferred treatment from Wednesday following “a thorough evaluation of the existing and new hepatitis C therapies”.They added: “Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C.”The company did not say what discount it had received from Gilead in exchange for exclusivity.Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said CVS/Caremark’s decision had removed an “overhang for Gilead as it achieves near-guaranteed access to a large [patient] population”. He also said the move reduced concerns that AbbVie would be better able to win significant market share by offering big discounts.Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said he did not regret doing an exclusive deal with AbbVie. “There would be no discounts if we hadn’t done what we did,” he said.“We found a partner in AbbVie that changed the whole dynamic. Today’s decision from CVS is a natural extension of the good work that we’ve done.”Shares in AbbVie closed 1.9 per cent lower in New York trading.
89;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-12-22T18:35:27Z;Gilead slides after hepatitis drug setback;S&P 500 higher after recent record-breaking run;Gilead Sciences shares backtracked from their giddy ascent of the past three years, falling more than 10 per cent after the company’s flagship hepatitis C treatment fell out of favour with the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US.The company, which has made its name with a hepatitis C treatment whose cost has drawn political criticism, fell after a rival medicine for the disease was awarded exclusive status by Express Scripts, which helps organise treatments for 25m Americans.Express Scripts, which helps manage the cost of healthcare plans offered by companies as well as some government programmes, said it had chosen Viekira Pak, a medicine developed by drugmaker AbbVie, as the “exclusive option” for patients.Viekira Pak won approval from US regulators on Friday and 12 weeks of treatment will cost just over $83,000.Steve Miller, the chief medical officer of Express Scripts, said the decision “marks a fundamental change in how sustainable access and affordability will be delivered to hepatitis C patients”.Gilead charges $84,000 for a 12-week course of its Sovaldi pill and is levying more for a successor, Harvoni.The company, which has a market value of $145bn, has defended the price on the grounds it is expensive to develop and has a high success rate.Gilead shares fell 14 per cent to $92.90 by close in New York. The market value had more than quadrupled since the start of 2012.AbbVie shares were nonetheless slightly weaker, down 1 per cent to $66.97, after rising from a low of $52.90 in mid-October.Shares in Enanta Pharma, which helped develop the AbbVie drug, rose 10 per cent to $51.31.Achillion Pharmaceuticals, which said it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs, also benefited from the Express Scripts shift with a 9 per cent rise to $15.49. Express Scripts shares were 2 per cent higher at $82.33.Latest data showing earlier than usual winter weakness in the US housing market weighed on the sector.Sales of previously owned homes fell more than 6 per cent to an annual pace of 5.25m in November, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. That was a far steeper drop than the 1.5 per cent forecast by analysts.Although housing sales have recovered after being hobbled by a brutal US winter at the start of the year, few economists expect them to accelerate significantly in 2015.Almost three years of rising house prices and more cautious lending by banks have been constant headwinds for the market in 2014. The pace of sales in November was at its weakest since May.The PHLX housing sector index, which tracks about 20 companies exposed to the construction market, including building and prefabrication of homes, mortgage insurers and suppliers of building material, shrunk 0.5 per cent before recovering losses by close.Shares in Taser International continued to rally after a surge over the past two months as a result of a spotlight on policing following a decision by a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, not to bring charges against a police officer involved in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager.The Arizona-based stun gun and wearable camera maker has announced a number of orders for its police-worn cameras in recent months, from cities including most recently Los Angeles, as well as Miami, Dallas and Winston-Salem.Its latest announcement that it had received orders for 1,879 weapons from the Ontario provincial police spurred the stock up another 9 per cent on Monday to $26.06. The company was trading at about $16 at the start of the year.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.4 per cent after its recent record-breaking run, closing at a new peak of 2,078.54. The Nasdaq Composite similarity rose 0.3 per cent to 4,781.42 on low holiday season volumes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent at 17,959.44.
90;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-12-01T00:01:55Z;‘Milestone’ in fight against Aids as treatment outpaces infections;Treatment rates for the disease outpace new infections for the first time;The world has passed an important tipping point in the fight against Aids, according to data showing that more people gained access to HIV drugs last year than became infected with the virus.This marks the first time since antiretroviral medicines were introduced 27 years ago that treatment of HIV has expanded at a higher rate than incidence of the virus itself.“We’re not saying the end of Aids is near but we have reached an important milestone where, for the first time, we are getting ahead of the disease,” said Erin Hohlfelder, health policy director for One, the anti-poverty campaign group that highlighted the inflection point in a report to mark Monday’s World Aids Day.In 2013 – the most recent year for which data are available – 2.3m people were added to HIV treatment programmes compared with 2.1m new infections.This marked an improvement from the year before when 1.6m people gained access to medicines for the first time while 2.2m were newly infected.The data highlight the progress made by the multibillion-dollar international effort to curb the spread of HIV, with antiretroviral drugs now reaching 13.6m people around the world.However, this still represents less than half the estimated 35m people living with HIV and Ms Hohlfelder warned there was a long way to go before victory could be declared.“We’ve passed the tipping point globally but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel.”Global funding for anti-HIV programmes reached an all-time high of $19.1bn last year but this is still below the annual $22bn-24bn that the UN says is needed.Ms Hohlfelder said middle-income countries were beginning to contribute more but the three leading donors – the US, France and Britain – were carrying an “unsustainable” share of the burden.“Many donor countries – such as Australia, Japan and some in the Middle East – really haven’t stepped up as much as we’d have liked.”Activists and health officials warn against the risk of complacency in an era when HIV is increasingly viewed in the developed world as a manageable chronic disease because of the potential for people to live an almost normal lifespan on the latest antiretroviral drugs.They say HIV remains one of the gravest health threats across much of the developing world, especially Africa, which has almost 70 per cent of cases.Further rapid gains may be hard to achieve as the virus becomes increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach groups, such as sex workers and drug users, as well as gay people and youths who may shun testing and treatment.Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS, which leads the global response to HIV, says a big push is needed to meet a target to end the epidemic by 2030.“We have bent the trajectory of the epidemic. Now we have five years to break it for good or risk the epidemic rebounding out of control.”Pharmaceutical companies, once pilloried for keeping HIV drugs out of reach of the poor, have increasingly lent support to the effort by licensing their medicines for generic manufacturers to make on a low-cost basis in the developing world.AbbVie of the US on Monday became the fifth big pharma company to grant a licence for generic production to the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, following Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Roche and ViiV Healthcare, a joint-venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.The agreement with AbbVie involves two antiretrovirals formulated for children and helps address a shortage of treatments suitable for the 3.2m children with HIV in the world.AbbVie’s lopinavir and ritonavir drugs will be available to generic producers in 102 countries where 99 per cent of children with HIV live.“This is a crucial licence for paediatric programmes in resource-limited countries,” said Greg Perry, executive director of the Medicines Patent Pool.The deal was welcomed by Aaron Motsoaledi, health minister of South Africa, who said: “Medicines are urgently needed to end the HIV paediatric crisis.”
91;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-11-25T12:25:28Z;Nations thrive by uniting professors and entrepreneurs;Business opportunities are lost when academics and entrepreneurs inhabit separate worlds;"I’ve recently appointed a chief executive for a medical research organisation I chair. The task was a fascinating one, mainly because the job needs that rare blend of scientist and manager – with just a touch of the industrialist. And it made me think hard about this intersection of learning and business.The territory is incredibly important. Nations like Britain possess outstanding centres of scholarship: according to the latest QS world university rankings, four of the six top higher education establishments internationally are in Britain. We receive 11 per cent of total scientific paper citations. Since 2001, Britain claims more scientific Nobel laureates than Italy, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Finland, South Korea, Switzerland, Ireland, India, Belgium, Taiwan, Denmark, Canada and Austria combined. But we do not fully exploit this academic prowess economically.The UK should be a world leader in terms of scientific companies – pre-eminent in sectors like advanced materials, photonics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology and the like. But Japan, Germany, South Korea and Taiwan generally profit more from technological developments.Britain is only just in the top 10 nations by patent filings. We should somehow replicate those models which translate discoveries made in centres of learning into commercial successes. As Sir Andrew Witty’s review of the sector suggested, universities should see their “third mission”, alongside education and research, as wealth creation.Importantly, more academics need to embrace entrepreneurship as a second career. Unfortunately the world of education and research places emphasis on awards, degrees, citations and professorships. This pressure to publish can discourage academics from filing patents.As a rule, academic plaudits are irrelevant to entrepreneurs, who are primarily interested in industrial applications. Likewise, many of those who seek to discover the secrets of the universe in laboratories spurn the profit motive and the marketplace.When I studied medicine at Oxford university in the 1980s it was clear to me that virtually none of my fellow students or tutors was interested in starting a business or making a fortune. The culture of discovery for its own sake is reflected in the fact that Tim Berners-Lee, a Briton, is credited with being the inventor of the world wide web: but essentially all the large businesses that have taken advantage of his ingenuity are American.California does things differently. In 1987 a 29-year-old doctor called Michael Riordan founded a biopharmaceutical company called Gilead Sciences, specialising in antivirals. Gilead has become one of the largest such businesses in the world, capitalised at $150bn, partly thanks to the remarkable hepatitis C treatments Harvoni and Sovaldi, which may well become the most profitable pair of drugs ever.Societies require patient capital to take advantage of scientific ideas. Innovation requires plentiful early stage funding for high risk investments, and later stage money to scale up the real breakthroughs.America’s rare combination of academic excellence, substantial government support and an appetite for commercial risk led to the creation of modern venture capital and, thanks to that, the biotechnology and computer industries. As we all know, the rewards for big inventions can be extraordinary. It requires a blend of venture capital, government intervention, charitable backing and corporate venturing. All the forms of money need championing because the failure rate can be very high.London has become a world capital for crowdfunding and is a major hub for venture capital. The City is a huge banking centre and Britain a magnet for business and scientific talent. Aim is perhaps the best small company stock exchange in the world. The rule of law applies here, as do property rights, and new “patent box” legislation creates an exceptionally favourable tax regime for intellectual property.There should be no excuses. The Wellcome Trust charitable foundation recently commissioned a review by Bain & Company asking why Britain’s innovation ecosystem falls short. It pinpoints weaknesses, and offers possible solutions. Policy makers, academics and financiers would do well to study its recommendations.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk

Increasingly, this concept was being used in middle-income countries such as China and India where there are extremes of wealth and poverty. “In these countries companies have to win the market but also reach the poor,” said Mr Leereveld.Recent breakthroughs include a deal by Gilead Sciences of the US to license its groundbreaking Sovaldi drug for hepatitis C to generic producers in 90 developing countries, allowing it to be sold at a steep discount to its $1,000-a-day price in the US.Meanwhile, GSK is closing in on the world’s first malaria vaccine after filing for regulatory approval in July. The company has said it will sell the product at 5 per cent above cost price, with profit reinvested in further tropical disease research.GSK’s top ranking represents a fillip for Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive, whose efforts to make the company a standard-bearer for responsible practice in the developing world were dealt a heavy blow by revelations about its bribery of doctors in China.Ethical marketing standards are one of the factors measured by the index and Mr Leereveld acknowledged that GSK would have lost points had its £300m Chinese fine in September come while research for this year’s ranking was still active. But he said it would not have knocked the company off top spot.Eighteen of the 20 biggest research-based drugmakers in the index were found to have breached ethical standards during the period of analysis – ranging from bribery to delaying entry of cheaper generic medicines. This raised questions over companies’ governance standards, the foundation said in its report on the index.Lack of transparency around intellectual property was another area of continued weakness, the report said, with medicine procurers and generic manufacturers denied information about where patents are active and when they expire. “There is still much further to go,” said Mr Leereveld.Sanofi of France and Pfizer of the US were the biggest fallers since the 2012 index. Last week, Pfizer announced an agreement with the Gates’ foundation to expand access to a long-acting contraceptive pill in 69 poor countries for $1 a dose.

Analysts on Wall Street were looking for a loss of 9 cents a share on sales of $1.15bn. Adjusted earnings of 73 cents a share beat expectations for 53 cents a share.The company also said it now expects $41.8bn in non-GAAP revenue in fiscal 2015, up from its previous guidance for $4.1bn. It expects non-GAAP earnings of $2.05 a share, up from $1.85 a share.The delay in the release of Battlefield 5 did “overshadow” the earnings beat in after-market trading, as it creates “a hole in the company’s line-up”, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush.He expects the company will fill its holiday schedule with Star Wars Battlefront.“At issue is the company’s ability to emulate competitor Activision’s success with annual instalments of its Call of Duty franchise, alternated among three studios each on a three-year cycle,” Mr Pachter said.Shares of Electronic Arts, however, climbed 4 per cent to $38.91 on the beat and have risen 70 per cent this year.Shares of Gilead Sciences slipped 2 per cent to $110.72 after the biopharmaceutical company missed third-quarter earnings and reported slowing sales of its hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.The company reported net income of $2.73bn, or $1.67 a share, in the three months ended in September on sales of $6.04bn.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of $1.75 a share on sales of $6.04bn.Sovaldi sales slowed 20 per cent from the previous quarter to $2.8bn. Analysts said sales lost traction ahead of the next generation hepatitis C drug, Harvoni.Terence Flynn, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, projects hepatitis C sales of $12.5bn and $15.5bn in 2014 and 2015, respectively.He added: “Beyond 2015, we have sales declining due to increasing competition, patient mix shift and a shrinking patient pool.”Hershey shares fell 2 per cent to $94.03 after the confectioner lowered its full-year earnings and sales guidance on the back of lacklustre international demand and commodity volatility.Hershey expects sales to rise 4.75 per cent this year, below earlier forecasts for between 5 per cent and 7 per cent growth.It now expects adjusted earnings per share at 8 per cent, from 9 to 11 per cent previously.Facebook shares fell 6 per cent to $75.86 after the social media company said “significant investment” would weigh on margins next year.Shares of Shell Midstream Partners, a master limited partnership spun off from Royal Dutch Shell, climbed 42 per cent to $32.76 in its New York debut.This bucked the trend of lacklustre first day gains over the past month, which have slowed the IPO market.Stocks turned mildly negative ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision.The benchmark S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,982.30, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 16,974.37.

It is the successor to Gilead’s Sovaldi, which has accrued more than $7bn in US sales since it became available in the final quarter of 2013.Early data suggest Harvoni is poised to be even more of a success. Doctors wrote 445 Harvoni prescriptions in the week beginning October 14, when the drug first went on sale, almost three times the number of Sovaldi treatments handed out when it launched in December 2013.“We believe this confirms the potential for Harvoni to reaccelerate prescription growth and draw increasing numbers of patients on to therapy,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams in a note to investors.However, the price charged for Harvoni and Sovaldi by Gilead has prompted an outcry among politicians and healthcare companies. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni costs $94,500 – or $1,125 a pill – over $10,000 more than Sovaldi.“Gilead has made clear that it values Wall Street above the interests of patients, the insured and taxpayer,” said John Rother, president of the National Coalition for Healthcare, a non-profit coalition of lobbying groups.Shares in Gilead, which has a market cap of more than $170bn, have risen more than 61 per cent over the past year, outperforming the US biotechnology sector, which is up 28.2 per cent over the same time.Gilead said Harvoni eliminated the need for peg interferon injections and ribavirin pills, both of which must be taken with Sovaldi. The total price for 12 weeks of Sovaldi with the additional drugs is $94,726, meaning treatment with Harvoni is slightly cheaper overall, a representative said.“We believe the price of Harvoni reflects the value of the medicine. Harvoni offers a cure at a price that will significantly reduce hepatitis C treatment costs now and deliver significant healthcare savings to the healthcare system over the long term,” she added.Hepatitis C is a viral disease that can cause liver failure, cancer or other life-threatening conditions. More than three million individuals in the US are infected, including many infected through blood transfusions carried out before 1992, when screening was first introduced. The disease is most often transmitted through intravenous drug use and blood-to-blood contact. If left untreated patients can end up needing a liver transplant, at a cost of $300,000.Because many hepatitis C patients are either poor or ageing, Gilead’s treatments are putting a strain on government-funded healthcare schemes such as Medicaid for those with low incomes and Medicare for Americans aged 65 and older.Jeff Myers, president of Medicaid Health Plans of America, said his members were already dealing with a “tsunami of cost” from Sovaldi that would only get worse with Harvoni.“Because Harvoni is all-oral and there are less side-effects, we expect more doctors to prescribe it than Sovaldi. That means there is a second wave that will wash over the ocean wall,” he said.Mr Myers said some states were already imposing some form of restrictions on Sovaldi prescriptions, limitations that he expects to be extended to Harvoni. Thirty-five states are insisting that patients undergo a pre-authorisation before being prescribed Sovaldi, which normally involves undergoing a liver biopsy to determine the severity of their disease.Gilead has made clear that it values Wall Street above the interests of patients, the insured and taxpayerOther states are insisting that patients abstain from drugs and alcohol for a minimum of three months before and during treatment or imposing a “once in a lifetime” rule that means patients who drop the regimen are not allowed a second chance.In July, two US senators announced an inquiry into the pricing of Sovaldi. The drug is significantly cheaper in other countries, such as the UK, where The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the agency that approves drugs, negotiated a 30 per cent discount.Gilead reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday evening that missed Wall Street estimates due to lower-than-expected sales of Sovaldi. Some doctors held off prescribing the drug in anticipation of the Harvoni launch. Shares in the company fell 3.5 per cent in after-hours trading.Excluding one-off items, earnings per share were $1.84, around 9 cents lower than analyst consensus. The company reported net sales of $2.8bn for the period, compared to expectations for $2.96bn. Total revenue more than doubled compared to a year ago to $6.04bn.
95;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-10-24T15:34:57Z;Progress against Aids spurs GSK plan to float ViiV Healthcare;Market for antiretroviral drugs roughly the same as that for insulin;As the pharmaceuticals industry races to find a cure for Ebola, there was a reminder this week of the medical innovation spurred by a previous global health emergency.GlaxoSmithKline’s plan, announced on Wednesday, to float a minority stake in its HIV business on the London Stock Exchange showed how this other modern scourge of mankind has become one of big pharma’s greatest success stories.A nation terrified in the 1980s by the British government’s famous “tombstone” public advertisements about Aids now finds itself asked to view a standalone HIV drugs company as a possible investment opportunity.The likely entry of ViiV Healthcare into the FTSE 100 – with a £10bn-£15bn market capitalisation that would rank it alongside household names Rolls-Royce and Tesco – highlights this transformation of HIV from a death sentence to a chronic, but manageable disease.Global HIV drug sales totalled about $20bn last year, roughly the same as the market for insulin. This reinforces the view articulated by some health professionals that HIV has become a disease akin to diabetes – with a similar stream of life-long revenues flowing to big pharma from each patient.David Redfern, chairman of ViiV, says: “It’s one of the industry’s biggest achievements of the past 20 years to go from the first antiretroviral drug cocktails in the 1990s that kept people alive but with big side effects, to the situation today where people are able to take one tablet a day and live an almost normal lifespan.”Health activists say such optimism rings hollow outside the developed world. Of the 35m people living with HIV in 2013, less than half were receiving antiretroviral drugs. Yet access to the medicines is widening – on a non-profit basis in the poorest countries and at discounted prices in middle-income economies. Annual deaths from Aids have fallen from a peak of 2.3m in 2005 to 1.5m last year. In the US the figure fell from a high of about 50,000 in 1995 to 7,683 in 2011.GSK has been at the forefront of the medical response to Aids from almost the beginning. One of its predecessor companies, Burroughs-Wellcome, was responsible for AZT, the first HIV drug approved by US regulators in 1987 – and the focus of last year’s Oscar-winning film, Dallas Buyers Club. When Burroughs-Wellcome merged in 1995 with Glaxo, another UK company with an early HIV treatment, the combined group became the undisputed market leader.Drug companies face ethical scrutiny on virus responseIt maintained that position for a decade until its crown was seized by an upstart US company called Gilead Sciences. “We missed out on the next generation of medicines,” admits Mr Redfern, who, in addition to his role with ViiV is GSK’s chief strategy officer.Deciding what to do with the HIV business was an early priority for Sir Andrew Witty when he took over as GSK chief executive in 2008. His solution was to pool assets with Pfizer of the US, which also had a lacklustre HIV portfolio. This was the genesis of ViiV Healthcare, now 80 per cent owned by GSK.The joint venture initially struggled to claw back lost ground from Gilead, but its prospects were transformed by the approval last year of a new drug called Tivicay. Taken in combination with two other medicines, the once-a-day treatment was judged a step forward in terms of both improved efficacy and reduced side effects.Analysts predict annual sales of Tivicay could reach $2.2bn, pushing ViiV’s total revenues from £1.4bn last year to £2.5bn in 2018. This would still leave the company trailing Gilead, which sold about $9bn of HIV drugs last year, but for the first time ViiV is putting its US rival under pressure.This raises the question why GSK should wish to loosen its grip on one of the fastest growing parts of the group.Analysts see it as a way to unlock value for shareholders at a time when the stock is under pressure from weakness in the core respiratory drugs business. The plan was part of a wider restructuring announced by Sir Andrew on Wednesday, including £1bn of cost cuts.Mr Redfern says an IPO is a natural step, as ViiV is already run as a separate company. Analysts think a full spin-off is likely in future.An investment in ViiV would not be without risk, as its older drugs succumb to generic competition as well as the resistance that HIV eventually builds against all antiretrovirals. “We need to keep coming up with new treatments to stay ahead of the virus,” says Mr Redfern.The next big hope for ViiV is a long-lasting medicine administered through a once-monthly injection which has shown promise in mid-stage trials.However, the two biggest remaining prizes in HIV remain stubbornly elusive: a vaccine or an outright cure. Hopes were raised by the so-called “Mississippi baby” who was born with HIV in 2010 and fleetingly appeared to have been rid of the virus only for it to reappear this year. Still, the case showed the potential for modern antiretrovirals to reduce HIV to undetectable levels.Gilead has this year hinted at the riches that await any company that comes up with a lasting cure. Its new Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine – which eliminates the liver-harming virus in more than 90 per cent of cases – is on course to generate a record $10bn of sales in its first year on the market. A cure for HIV would have similar potential.This success has propelled Gilead’s market capitalisation to $160bn – almost 40 per cent more than the entire value of GSK. While other parts of its business have fallen flat, the UK group is hoping an IPO of ViiV would unleash some fizz. But it may also mark the start of GSK’s retreat from the market where it has left arguably its greatest medical legacy.Big pharma battles charge of tardiness on EbolaProminently displayed on a bookshelf in Sir Andrew Witty’s west London office is Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.It reflects the GlaxoSmithKline chief executive’s affinity with South Africa, where he cut his teeth as a young country manager in the early 1990s.But, by signalling respect for the late president, it is perhaps also a repentant nod to the public relations disaster of the late 1990s when big pharma decided collectively to sue the Mandela government for violating HIV drug patents.Fifteen years later, the industry is once again under ethical scrutiny as critics question why it has failed to make more progress in tackling Ebola in the four decades since the deadly virus first emerged from the jungles of central Africa.GSK and its peers have been ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into programmes to treat other neglected tropical diseases in recent years, but Ebola research had been largely left to US government scientists worried about potential use of the virus for bioterrorism.Big pharma is now belatedly scrambling to help, with GSK and Johnson & Johnson both accelerating development of experimental Ebola vaccines that had previously received little attention.But the crisis has again raised questions over whether the pharmaceuticals industry, with its strong patent protections and profit motive, is adequately meeting the health needs of the developing world.David Redfern, GSK’s chief strategy officer, says the company has learnt lessons from past mistakes. Its HIV drugs are now licensed on a non-profit basis to an organisation called the Medicines Patent Pool, which in turn makes them available for generic manufacturers to supply at low prices to poor countries.In middle-income nations, GSK uses a tiered pricing system based on countries’ ability to pay.Rohit Malpani, policy director for the drug access campaign of Médecins Sans Frontières, the medical charity, says the industry has not gone far enough. Too few countries are covered by royalty-free licences and the discounted prices in middle-income countries are too high to ensure widespread access, he says.Urging an overhaul of the intellectual property system, he adds: “Governments should take steps to ensure access to low-cost medicines.”Back to the top of the page
96;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-10-16T21:04:55Z;Pharma giants face developing market ambitions;Domestic producers find conditions in their favour;As the pharmaceuticals industry careered towards the edge of its notorious patent cliff over the past decade, there was one main hope for a soft landing.Emerging markets were supposed to be big pharma’s salvation, as many of its most important products lost market exclusivity without enough new drugs to replace them.Growth in China, India, Brazil and other developing economies would revive the industry, as rising living standards, ageing populations and increased incidence of diseases such as cancer and diabetes fuelled higher healthcare spending.To some extent, this new world has begun to materialise. Take Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker, which has increased revenues from emerging markets by a fifth since 2010, even as those from the developed world have stalled.Emerging markets accounted for a third of sales last year – comfortably ahead of the US and Europe as Sanofi’s biggest geographic division. Others, including Bayer of Germany and GlaxoSmithKline of the UK, have been making similar strides in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Yet the general upwards trend masks pockets of volatility, as drugmakers grapple with local healthcare and regulatory systems that vary widely in their structure and maturity.GSK’s £300m fine from Chinese authorities in September for “massive and systemic” bribery of doctors to boost sales highlighted the potential pitfalls in chasing rapid growth in unfamiliar and often opaque markets.In India, meanwhile, big pharma has been waging a running battle over intellectual property, as regulators have opened some patent-protected medicines to low-cost generic production by local manufacturers such as Cipla and Sun Pharma.Novartis, for example, saw its best-selling drug, Glivec for leukaemia, denied patent protection by the Indian Supreme Court last year. Health activists have welcomed such rulings as a step towards more affordable access to medicines.Some industry leaders, however, accuse India of using public health as a pretext for giving domestic drugmakers a free ride on western innovation. Should other emerging markets take a similar stance, the intellectual property framework underpinning the industry could be threatened, they fear.A deal struck last month by Gilead Sciences of the US to license its blockbuster hepatitis C medicine, Sovaldi, to several big Indian manufacturers showed that some companies are willing to find middle ground.Gilead has been among the pioneers of tiered pricing models that offer drugs more cheaply in poor countries. However, finding a fair level can be difficult in places such as India where wealth coexists with extreme poverty.Pricing looks set to remain tough and contentious across the developing world, as governments seek to widen access to healthcare while containing costs. But Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi chief executive, says the twin trends of urbanisation and an expanding middle class will support a steady rise in spending.In India, big pharma has been waging a running battle over intellectual property regulation“Some 80 per cent of the world’s population live in emerging markets. Many of those people are not treated today. Many of those people are gaining greater incomes . . .[and] that’s going to be a strong growth driver.”China alone is forecast to provide more than a third of global growth in pharmaceuticals spending between 2012 and 2017, as Beijing aims for universal health insurance coverage by 2020. This would increase China’s share of global sales from 8 to 15 per cent over the same period, surpassing the top five European markets combined, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.This helps explain why GSK was so profuse in its apology to the Chinese people after its bribery fine last month, as it seeks to repair the damage to its business in a country where it has 7,000 employees and six manufacturing sites.Others are also scrambling for position. Bayer has supported a training programme for doctors in Tibet in an example of how western drug companies are willing on China’s development into a healthcare superpower.Beijing has been more accommodating than New Delhi to big pharma. However, GSK’s fate in a Hunan province courtroom last month represented a flexing of muscle by Chinese authorities against the industry.For now, China is happy to welcome companies such as Novartis, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which have all opened Chinese research and development centres or are planning to do so.But in the long run, few observers doubt that Beijing wants Chinese companies to be producing blockbuster drugs of their own.China has overtaken the EU to become the second-biggest source of published scientific research papers and is on course to displace the US from the top spot.With India and Brazil also promoting domestic life sciences, the risk for western drugmakers is that the developing world will gradually begin to look more like a threat than an opportunity.
97;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-09-25T23:02:31Z;Drug development: Big pharma back in the game it made;Harnessing a patient’s defence system to attack the disease has prompted excited reaction;Big pharma is back. That, at least, is the impression created by a wave of new cancer drugs rapidly approaching market. After years of hand-wringing about an innovation drought, there is hope that this month’s US regulatory approval for a groundbreaking skin cancer medicine from Merck signals a revival in productivity.Keytruda, shown to extend significantly the lives of some people with advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is first among a fresh class of treatments that harness the immune system to kill cancer cells.Bristol-Myers-Squibb, another big US drugmaker, is hot on Merck’s heels with its own melanoma medicine, while Roche of Switzerland and AstraZeneca of the UK are also in the mix.Cancer is not the only area where innovation has picked up. Hepatitis C has also seen advances that are producing big commercial dividends.However, whereas Gilead Sciences, the relatively young Californian biotech company, has so far been the main beneficiary of the hepatitis C windfall, the breakthroughs in cancer are breathing fresh life into more established players.Andrew Baum, analyst at Citigroup, predicts that annual revenues from so-called immuno-oncology drugs could climb as high as $35bn – outstripping the value of previous blockbuster categories such as cholesterol-lowering statins.Others are more cautious but few doubt that these products promise a shot in the arm for the industry.This optimism is reflected in Merck’s share price, which has gained more than a quarter over the past year in large part because of the prospects for Keytruda, which analysts predict will achieve $1.5bn in annual sales by 2017.The drug is known as a checkpoint inhibitor which works by blocking a protein called programmed death receptor 1, or PD-1, which cancer cells latch on to in order to avoid detection by the immune system.By targeting this protein, Keytruda and similar drugs aim to unleash the body’s disease-fighting T-cells against tumours. Most people with advanced melanoma previously died within a year. Recent data showed that, when treated with Keytruda, 69 per cent of patients were still alive after a year and 62 per cent after 18 months.Rival anti-PD-1 drugs have produced similar results but challenges remain.Although highly effective when they work, checkpoint inhibitors so far seem to benefit only a minority. Researchers are trying to find biomarkers that will identify those patients most likely to be responsive. Meanwhile, the drugs are being tested in combination with others with the aim of creating more potent and more broadly-effective treatments.Another priority is to extend the drugs beyond melanoma. Merck, for example, has been testing Keytruda on gastric and bladder cancer, with data expected in coming days at the annual conference of the European Society of Medical Oncology in Madrid.Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca will also issue updates on their progress in various tumour types.While the leading pack battle for early dominance, almost every big pharmaceutical company and a host of smaller biotech companies are looking for a share of the expected spoils from immuno-oncology. Pfizer is working with Merck on combination therapies, while Celgene has teamed up with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Novartis, Johnson & Johnson and others are quietly positioning themselves for the next generation of checkpoint inhibitors as the science becomes more sophisticated.Peter Lebowitz, head of cancer research at Janssen, the pharmaceutical arm of Johnson & Johnson, says there is no guarantee the initial leaders will be the long-term winners. “It’s really just the beginning,” he says. “We’ve come a long way but there’s much further to go.”Novartis is at the forefront of another form of immuno-oncology which involves genetically re-engineering the white blood cells to hunt down and destroy tumours. These are known as cART therapies, referring to the cancer-killing chimeric antigen receptor T-cells that have produced impressive results in early stage testing on children with lymphoblastic leukaemia.In hot pursuit of Novartis are the US biotech companies Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics. The latter has raised $300m in private funding over the past year to accelerate its programme, with Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, among its backers.“This is going to be a revolutionary treatment,” says Alessandro Riva, head of oncology at Novartis, vowing to defend the company’s leadership in this type of therapyPeter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, cautions that modified T-cell technology of the kind being pioneered by Novartis is “extremely complex” as well as expensive.The safety of these and other immuno-oncology drugs also remains a concern. Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb have been hurt in recent months by concerns over side effects from its checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, after some patients suffered adverse reactions .Further setbacks are likely, warns Prof Johnson: “Cancer research tends to go in cycles, with big breakthroughs followed by the slow, hard grind of delivery.”
98;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Europe struggles to catch US biotech bulls;The Nasdaq biotech index is on the rise again;Boom times are back for US biotechnology. After a wobble in the spring when Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, warned that valuations were stretched, the Nasdaq biotech index is on the rise again, up 20 per cent since January.Yet, across the Atlantic, the mood is more subdued. Valuations are rising in Europe too, but without the fizz that has surrounded the US sector for most of the past two years.Almost $4bn has been raised by US biotech companies in 43 initial public offerings and follow-on fundraisings this year, while in Europe the comparable figures are $1.4bn from 28, according to Dealogic.“UK and European IPO markets have been doing almost as well as the US market this year, but whereas the US has been led by biotech listings, there have been relatively few in Europe,” says Richard Truesdell, head of capital markets at Davis Polk, the law firm.To seasoned observers, this more cautious European approach might seem welcome given the heavy losses suffered after the previous biotech boom 15 years ago.However, to others, it is evidence of a lack of risk appetite that is undermining European life sciences. “When I go to London and explain the biotech growth story they view the sector as very risky,” says Geoffrey Hsu, partner at OrbiMed, a US-based healthcare fund manager. “There have been some failures that still colour perceptions even though the sector has changed a lot in the past decade.”As bulls such as Mr Hsu see it, Europe is missing out on a historic re-rating of the biotech industry as commercial dividends finally start to flow from the decoding of the human genome and other scientific advances.Sceptics say they have heard this story before. Hype about the potential of genetic sequencing to open a new era of personalised medicine, in which treatments are tailored for individual patients, helped inflate a biotech bubble in the late 1990s that quickly deflated as it became clear such breakthroughs were still years away.However, Mr Hsu and others say the sector is now more mature, with big biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences, Amgen and Biogen producing revenues to rival traditional big pharma, and a new wave of upstarts such as Regeneron and Alexion showing similar promise.In Europe, such success stories are rare. The £32bn sale of UK-listed Shire to AbbVie of the US in July will, once completed, remove one of the few young European life science companies to have broken into the big league.After Actelion of Switzerland, with a market capitalisation of $13bn, it is a big jump down to the next rank of young pretenders, such as Morphosys of Germany, Genmab of Denmark and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum with valuations of around $2bn.Gilead, king of the US biotech sector, in contrast, is now bigger even than traditional European pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, with a valuation of $157bn after the success of its groundbreaking hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.There are many factors that explain the transatlantic disparity. Some say the greater entrepreneurial drive in the US helps commercialise scientific discoveries that in Europe might remain languishing in a university laboratory. Others say it reflects the incentives for innovation created by America’s private healthcare market compared with Europe’s cash-strapped public health systems.Whatever the underlying reason, it manifests itself in a much tougher financing environment for European biotech – both in terms of venture capital and equity funding from public markets. This translates into slower and more cautious drug development compared with lavishly funded US rivals.This has led several European companies to make initial public offerings in the US, including GW Pharmaceutical, the UK-based maker of cannabis-based medicines for epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Its shares spent a decade stagnating on London’s junior AIM market before adopting a dual listing on Nasdaq last year. The stock has since soared from an offer price of $8.90 to $88.56 after success in clinical trials, valuing the company at $1.8bn.However, there are tentative signs that Europe could be warming up to the biotech growth story.While, still a long way short of US levels, the amount raised by biotech companies in European equity markets this year is already more than double the amount raised in the whole of 2013, according to Dealogic. A big part of this was the £200m raised in London in March by Circassia, an anti-allergy specialist, in what was the largest biotech float anywhere in the world so far this year.A steady stream of IPOs has followed, especially in Paris, spurred by French tax incentives for investment in research-based companies.Rafaèle Tordjman, managing partner at Sofinnova, a healthcare-focused French venture capital fund, says American investors are increasingly looking to European biotech as valuations soar in the US. In some recent fundraisings they have accounted for as much as two-thirds of the participation.While nobody is expecting a Nasdaq-style boom, numerous European biotech companies are considering IPOs. Hugh Griffith, chief executive of Nucana, an Edinburgh-based cancer drug developer, says he will consider both London and New York for a potential float. “The breadth of analyst coverage and the depth of the investment pool in the US is attractive, but the UK market is opening up.”This optimism is echoed by Jim Phillips, chief executive of Midatech, an Oxford-based specialist in nanotech-based medicines which is considering an IPO. “I am surprised how vibrant London is feeling,” he says. “I think there is hope for the sector.”Wrong formula: groups struggle to make successes payWhen AbbVie moves its tax domicile to the UK in coming months, it will mark a homecoming of sorts for the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company’s most important product, Humira.The rheumatoid arthritis medicine was the world’s best-selling drug last year, with revenues of $10.7bn, and it owes its success to scientists in the UK, where it was developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT).But the medicine was licensed to Abbott, of which AbbVie used to be part, and CAT was bought by AstraZeneca, creating a case study in how the spoils of drug innovation often land a long way from the laboratories where they were discovered.As AbbVie proceeds with its £32bn takeover of UK-listed Shire – a so-called inversion deal in which the US company will move its tax home to Britain – the story of Humira also shows how European biotech companies have struggled to match the success of US counterparts in commercialising scientific breakthroughs.Shire and CAT are among a series of promising UK life science companies that have been swallowed by big pharma over the past 15 years, in contrast to US biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences and Biogen, which have become powerhouses in their own right.Richard Girling, partner and healthcare specialist at Centerview Partners, the investment bank, says the UK in particular has an opportunity to thrive in biotech through its world class university science and government initiatives such as the 100,000 Genome Project, which aims to harness genetic research within the National Health Service.However, Mr Girling says investors need more patience if they are to build a life science sector to rival that of the US. Many have been stung by past failures in an industry where only about 7 per cent of drugs in early-stage development reach market.“Most biotech companies don’t succeed on their first molecule or target so they need time and financial headroom,” he says. “There is more venture capital money coming back into the European market…but it is going to take a few years to really rebuild.”
99;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-09-15T16:11:47Z;Gilead in deal with India labs to produce Sovaldi;;Gilead Sciences will allow seven large Indian generic drug producers to make and sell its blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi in more than 90 developing countries, in a move it says will ensure affordable access to the potentially life-saving treatment.The deal with companies including Cipla and Ranbaxy Laboratories follows months of fierce debate over the price of Sovaldi, which has been hailed as the biggest breakthrough in treatment for hepatitis C since the virus was discovered in 1989.Sovaldi is on course to become the most successful new drug in industry history after generating $5.7bn of sales in the first half of this year. But its high price– at $1,000 a day in the US – has drawn criticism from politicians, activists and insurers.California-based Gilead said on Monday it would introduce Sovaldi to the Indian market at a price of $300 per bottle, or around $900 for a 12-week course – about 1 per cent of the US price.But Gilead also said seven India-based generic manufacturers would be free to set their own prices for the drug – without any mandated floor price. The companies are to pay 7 per cent of their revenues as royalty to Gilead, which will provide full technology transfer to the Indian manufacturers, allowing them to produce both the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished formulations. Gregg Alton, executive vice-president of Gilead, said he believed the agreement would create a competitive marketplace that would help bring down the price and ensure widespread access. “The purpose of these partnerships is to help us reach as many patients as possible, regardless of where they lie and regardless of how poor they may be,” Mr Alton said in New Delhi.Subhanu Saxena, chief executive of Cipla, said the deal showed that drugmakers had learned the lessons of past controversy over pricing of HIV drugs. “The pharmaceutical industry is understanding the need for affordable access across the globe. Some companies have understood this better than others.”But activists from Médecins Sans Frontières, and others lobbying for improved access to life-saving medication, criticised Gilead for excluding key countries with high hepatitis C burdens, including China, Brazil and Ukraine, from the deal. That means Indian generic drugmakers will not be able to sell their less expensive medicines to those markets, unless any of those governments issues a compulsory licence overriding Gilead’s patent.Mr Alton insisted that the drugs would be made available to patients in all emerging markets through Gilead’s own tiered-pricing system. “We’ll be having prices for countries like Thailand, Mexico and Brazil that are very different than the US price.”Around 185m people globally are believed to be suffering from hepatitis C, which can lead to fatal liver disease, and the greatest numbers are in low and middle-income countries. In clinical trials, Sovaldi, whose generic name is Sofosbuvi, cured more than nine out of 10 patients within 12 weeks. This is a big improvement on previous drugs, which had much lower success rates, longer treatment times and nasty side effects.MSF activists, who staged a small demonstration at the hotel where the Gilead announcement was made, said that even under the discounted price proposed for India, Sovaldi would still be more costly than many Indian patients could afford.The other India-based generic drugmakers involved in the deal are Cadila Healthcare, Hetero Labs, Mylan Laboratories, Sequent Scientific and Strides Arcolab.
100;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-09-02T20:47:33Z;Biotech stocks buoyed by bullish broker UBS;US equity markets waver following Monday holiday;US biotech stocks were buoyed on Tuesday after brokerage UBS lifted price targets for a swathe of companies in the sector on its view that new medications and potential merger and acquisition activity will boost earnings.The investment bank said it remained bullish on the sector, despite a 22 per cent advance by the Nasdaq biotech index this year, ahead of the release of new trial data this autumn.If successful, analysts with the bank say it could “trigger price-to-earnings multiple expansion” as expectations are currently low.“We continue to see new product cycles and mid to long-term growth as a strong basis for valuation despite relative outperformance of large-cap biotech over the past few years,” Matthew Roden, an analyst with UBS, said.Mr Roden added large biotech groups, flush with cash from recent drug hits, would aid shares of smaller companies in the sector.“We are more bullish on mergers and acquisitions given the inflection of cash flows in large-cap, coupled with the need for large-cap to address toughening growth comps by 2016-17, and because mid-caps have done a good job in value creation,” he said.The sector’s advance this year has been in fits and starts, cooling after US politicians, as well as officials at the World Health Organisation, voiced concerns over the price tag of a successful Hepatitis-C treatment.Strong sales results from the Gilead medication alleviated some of those concerns. Several analysts on Wall Street predict first year sales of the treatment will near $10bn.UBS increased its price target on Gilead to $125 from $115, Achillion to $15 from $11, Regeneron to $360 from $320 and Amgen to $155 from $129.Regeneron shares climbed 3 per cent to $359.50, Achillion rose 6 per cent to $12.27 and Gilead advanced 2 per cent to $109.36.Tuesday offered another lesson for investors in biotech: disappointing trial data can cut short a stock’s rally, as was the case with Exelixis.The company, which is engaged in prostate cancer research, said it would lay off 70 per cent of its staff after an experimental drug failed a late-stage study, sending shares 55 per cent lower to $1.85.Family Dollar, which has agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, said it would review a new $80-a-share offer presented by Dollar General, lifting all three companies.In a short statement it said that its board “has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Dollar Tree”.Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General’s first, $78.50-a-share bid, arguing that the chief obstacle was its concern that US competition regulators would quash a deal to combine the country’s two largest discount chains.Dollar General said it would divest more stores in an attempt to gain regulatory compliance.Family Dollar shares rose nearly 1 per cent to $80.22, Dollar General increased 1 per cent to $64.36 and Dollar Tree advanced 2 per cent to $54.46.Norwegian Cruise Line agreed to pay $3bn in cash and shares for smaller rival Prestige Cruises, which operates the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises brands.Kevin Sheehan, the chief executive of Norwegian, said that the acquisition would provide for a “solid accretion to earnings per share and drive long-term shareholder value”.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus said the deal “makes sense” considering Prestige’s position in the luxury cruise market.“Luxury has been the one area of cruise which has been relatively stable over the past couple of years, whereas the contemporary brands have been more impacted by economic events while also being impacted by negative press headlines about the cruise industry,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said.Shares of Norwegian soared 11 per cent to $36.99.Overall, US equity markets wavered following a Monday holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,002.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,067.56. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,598.19.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
101;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-08-14T23:02:11Z;UK watchdog backs £400 a day hepatitis C drug;;Britain’s drug cost watchdog has given provisional approval for a £400 a day hepatitis C treatment that has ignited controversy on both sides of the Atlantic about the price of medicines.The draft go-ahead for Sovaldi, made by Gilead Sciences of the US, comes amid international debate over a drug that promises to transform treatment of a deadly virus but at a high price to governments and insurers.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said Sovaldi was a “clinically and cost-effective” medicine, opening the way for its widespread adoption within the NHS.The institute based its decision on a proposed price of £34,983 for a 12-week course of treatment – a 30 per cent discount from the $84,000 price in the US.Sovaldi is on course to become the most successful new drug on record after generating $5.7bn of sales in its first six months on the US market this year.However, it has become a lightning rod for concern about the high cost of a new generation of cutting edge drugs under development for conditions ranging from cancer to ultra rare diseases.Nice, which decides which medicines offer value for money to the NHS, demanded more evidence from Gilead in June to support the company’s case for Sovaldi but announced on Friday that it had been convinced.“The draft recommendation by Nice takes us one step closer to making the elimination of hepatitis C a realistic possibility,” said Charles Gore, chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust.The approval, which must be ratified at a Nice board meeting next month, came on the same day that the institute recommended against use of Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga prostate cancer drug at an earlier stage in the disease.The contrasting decisions highlight the difficult balancing act facing Nice between embracing life saving innovation and ensuring value to taxpayers.Nice sparked controversy las week by rejecting Roche’s Kadcyla breast cancer drug, which typically extends a patient’s life by about six months at a cost of £90,000.Some US critics have portrayed Nice as a “death panel”, rationing care on the basis of economic criteria rather than patient need: supporters say it provides a healthy check on drug industry profiteering.The draft recommendation by Nice takes us one step closer to making the elimination of hepatitis C a realistic possibilityGilead’s decision to offer a hefty discount on Sovaldi in the UK highlights the leverage that Nice has over drugmakers seeking access to the NHS, the world’s biggest single payer public health system.This contrasts with the unregulated US market, where the $1,000-a-day price of Sovaldi has sparked a backlash from politicians, insurers and activists.Gilead says Sovaldi, also known as sofosbuvir, will save money for health systems in the long run by reducing costly hospitalisations and, in some cases, liver transplants.The medicine, which has a cure rate of more than 90 per cent, is the first of several new drugs that promise to treat hepatitis C more effectively, more quickly and with fewer side-effects than previous medicines.Stelios Karagiannoglou, head of Gilead in the UK, welcomed the draft guidance but noted that some restrictions had been proposed by Nice which would limit access for patients with some subtypes of the disease.Nice said an estimated 160,000 people in England were living with chronic hepatitis C in 2012. More than half do not know they are infected because symptoms often appear only years after infection.
102;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-07-31T17:30:41Z;Drug pricing: Bitter pill;A hepatitis treatment’s soaring price is prompting the debate that most alarms the industry;"When delegates turned up for a big healthcare conference at New York’s plush Waldorf Astoria hotel in February, they were met by placard-wielding activists.That in itself was not unusual. Big pharma has long been the subject of angry campaigns over issues such as animal testing and access to Aids drugs in Africa.Yet the focus of these protesters was something different: the high cost of a new hepatitis medicine in the US.This small-scale insurrection on a Manhattan sidewalk has since turned in­to something approaching a national rebellion against Gilead Sciences and its drug known as Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment. Scrutiny increased further last week when the California-based biotech company announced that sales of the medicine had reached $5.7bn after six months on the market, making it the most successful drug launch on record.But while investors were celebrating – Gilead’s share price is up 50 per cent in the past year – many in the industry were nervously monitoring the growing political debate over drug pricing that Sovaldi has triggered.Last month two senior members of the US Senate finance committee wrote to John Martin, Gilead’s chief executive, asking him to justify Sovaldi’s price and expressing “serious concerns about the extent to which the market for this drug is operating efficiently and rationally”.Such an intervention is unusual in the US, which, alone among big developed economies, has no government powers to regulate pharmaceutical pricing. The letter from Ron Wyden, Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Charles Grassley, a Republican, has raised questions over whether this laisser-faire approach could be destined to change.After a slowdown since the financial crisis, US healthcare costs have started to rise again. At about 17 per cent of gross domestic product, they are the highest in the developed world. Pharmaceuticals account for only one in every $10 spent on health but they are among the most visible to patients because of the steep co-payments demanded by insurers.President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms have increased incentives for healthcare providers to control costs as insurance coverage is widened. But Sovaldi has shown that, when a new medicine arrives with high demand and no competition, there is little to stop drugmakers charging what they wish.“Other countries have come up with frameworks to make drugs affordable for people whereas in the US it has always been a case of what the market will bear,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts, one of America’s biggest prescription management companies. “We think the market is no longer bearing up.”For the pharmaceuticals industry, there is nothing that causes greater anxiety than the idea that its cherished pricing freedom in the US could be imperilled. Annual US per-capita spending on pharmaceuticals is $1,010, more than double the $498 average among members of the OECD.This high US spending underpins the economics of the global pharmaceuticals industry. More than half of all sales from new drugs launched between 2009 and 2013 were made in the US, compared with 23 per cent in Europe.Seldom has the international disparity in drug pricing been starker than in the case of Sovaldi, a drug hailed as the biggest breakthrough in hepatitis C treatment since the virus was discovered in 1989. In more than nine out of 10 cases, the treatment will lead to complete cure within 12 weeks.Gilead agreed to sell the drug in Egypt, the country with the world’s highest prevalence of hepatitis C, at a 99 per cent discount to the US price. The move was aimed at heading off the kind of controversy faced by drugmakers in the 1990s when the industry was accused of keeping HIV medicines out of reach of poor Africans.However, while few would begrudge efforts to make the medicine more affordable in the developing world, many Americans have been asking why, if Gilead can afford to price Sovaldi at $11-a-pill in Egypt, does it charge $1,000 in the US.“The answer is because it can,” says Dr Miller, one of Gilead’s fiercest critics. “Sovaldi has shone a light on the fact America is subsidising healthcare innovation for the rest of the world.”US drug prices are high because, unlike in most other countries, the government does not use its purchasing power to contain them. There is nothing like the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), for example, which acts as a gatekeeper for new medicines.Before a treatment is recommended for use in Britain’s National Health Service, its manufacturer must convince Nice that the product represents value for money.The result is that fewer new drugs are adopted in the UK and those that are command a lower price than in the US. Gilead, for example, has priced Sovaldi at a 30 per cent discount to its US price in Britain. Yet even that has not been enough to convince Nice of its clinical value. The agency told Gilead in June to come back with more data to support its case for the drug. France, too, is playing hardball.To many in the US, the notion of government rationing drugs and regulating prices is wholly un-American. Republicans have long characterised Nice as a “death panel” that epitomises all that is wrong about European socialised healthcare. A study sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry lobby group, in July showed that almost 80 per cent of cancer drugs reviewed by Nice in the past seven years have had some type of restriction placed on access. This, said the lobby group, could explain why the average five-year survival rate for US breast cancer patients is higher, at 90 per cent, than the UK’s 78 per cent.Yet the fact that the US industry issues warnings against “centralised, one-size-fits-all value assessments” across the Atlantic exposes its concern that such concepts could be gaining ground in the US.Nobody expects a US equivalent of Nice or anything similar to be adopted in the foreseeable future. Political resistance is too strong and the health system too fragmented and privatised. However, there are increasing signs that politicians and health officials are taking a harder look at how to rein in rising costs.“We can’t ignore the elephant in the room,” says Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, which represents health insurers. “The Sovaldi case brings all these issues together in a very stark way: How much is too much? Can this price be sustained? What happens if it blows up your budget? This is a debate we’re just on the cusp of having in our society.”Sovaldi is not the most expensive drug on the market. What sets it apart is the size of the patient population it aims to treat. There are an estimated 3.2m people in the US infected with hepatitis C, four times more than the number with HIV.So far 70,000 patients have been prescribed Sovaldi but its impact is being felt throughout the healthcare system. WellPoint, one of the biggest US health insurers, for example, spent $50m on hepatitis C treatment in the first quarter – as much as the whole of last year. State governments warn that their social healthcare budgets risk being crippled. Louisiana would have to spend more than its entire transportation budget if everyone who was eligible was treated with Sovaldi, says Express Scripts.While Sovaldi may be an exceptional case, there is a growing number of expensive speciality medicines emerging from laboratories that collectively promise to put further stress on budgets. As mass-
market blockbusters, such as statins and beta-blockers, have gradually lost patent protection, many drugmakers have refocused on speciality treatments. These are often cutting-edge biological drugs that draw on breakthroughs in genomic science over the past decade to target rare diseases and subtypes of more common conditions, such as cancer. In order to recoup high development costs from relatively small patient groups, prices tend to be very high. Take, for example, a cystic-fibrosis drug, called Kalydeco, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which costs $300,000 a year.Increased spending on speciality medicines explains why the average price of branded medicines in the US has almost doubled since 2008, according to Express Scripts. The overall drugs bill has been growing more slowly because of the falling price of generic medicines, which represent 86 per cent of all US prescriptions.However, rising use of speciality products is expected to create more upward pressure in future. While they account for less than 1 per cent of total prescriptions, they drain more than a quarter of pharmacy spending.Gilead and other drugmakers argue that their prices are justified both by the need to provide a return on investment in research and development and by their long-term value to patients. John Castellani, president of the PhRMA, says that, by curing hepatitis C, Sovaldi has the potential to save the US healthcare system $9bn a year in the long run by reducing hospitalisations from the liver disease that often results from the virus.“It is penny wise and pound-foolish to focus solely on the price of a new medicine while completely ignoring the value it provides to patients and the healthcare system broadly,” says Mr Castellani. A broader debate is needed, he adds, about “outdated” insurance models that force patients to pay an ever-growing share of prescription drug costs while shielding them from the typical $5,000-a-day cost of hospitalisation.However, industry leaders accept that they have a role to play in bringing healthcare costs under control. It has become almost obligatory for pharma executives to espouse a shift towards more “value-based” pricing models that reward drugmakers based on measurable health outcomes. This is code for acknowledging that the era of overpriced “me too” drugs is drawing to a close, while making clear the industry expects to be rewarded for true innovation.“If you are not number one or two to market or you do not have a demonstrable clinical advantage over rival products you are going to be up against it,” says Daniel Hoffman, president of Pharmaceutical Business Research Associates, a consultancy.This trend is already visible in the most competitive parts of the market. GlaxoSmithKline, the UK drugmaker, last week issued a profits warning in large part because of increased pricing pressure on respiratory drugs in the US. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive, said several factors, including consolidation within primary care networks, were eroding pricing power. The Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act had “added some fuel to this fire” by making the whole system more cost-conscious, he added.The question is whether such pressures will influence pricing of high-margin speciality drugs such as Sovaldi. A big test will come in the months ahead when AbbVie and
Bristol-Myers Squibb are expected to launch rival hepatitis C medicines. If they significantly lower prices, the controversy may be quickly forgotten and the primacy of market forces in the US healthcare system reasserted. If not, calls for some form of government intervention are likely to grow. “It will tell us,” says Mr Hoffman, “whether this is a competitive market or a cartel.”Innovation: A young company reshaping the industryCritics have cast Gilead Sciences’ $1,000-a-day pricing of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine as an example of drug industry greed at its worst, writes Andrew Ward. To others, it shows how market forces are the only reliable way to drive medical innovation. Founded in 1987 by a 29-year-old medical doctor with a Harvard MBA, Gilead is among a new generation of young US biotech companies that are reshaping the pharmaceuticals industry.It is already bigger by market capitalisation, at $143bn, than some traditional pharma mainstays, including GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca.This reflects the phenomenal success of Sovaldi, on top of breakthrough treatments for HIV and flu. Sovaldi is on course to generate more than $10bn of sales in its first year on the market. The medicine is the first of a new category of hepatitis C drugs that treat the virus more effectively, more quickly and with fewer side effects than previous therapies.While Sovaldi shows how much of the best drug innovation comes from biotech companies rather than traditional big pharma, Gilead’s own scientists cannot claim credit. The medicine was acquired in 2011 through an $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset, founded by Sovaldi’s inventor, Egyptian-born Raymond Schinazi. The speed with which Gilead has started to recover that investment is cited by critics as evidence that its drug is overpriced.Addressing investors last week, John Milligan, the company’s chief operating officer, said the full value of Sovaldi was only now becoming clear. Patients who previously had faced up to a year of treatment with nasty side effects and patchy success rates are now cured within 12 weeks in most cases.“I don’t think anybody disagrees with the fact that Sovaldi is a remarkable drug,” he said. “It’s an outlier because we are curing people of a horrible disease in a very rapid timeframe, and that’s a very unusual thing for payers to think about.”Gilead’s success has intensified the race among rivals to catch up. AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb are nearing market with similar drugs, and in June Merck & Co paid $3.85bn to buy Idenix, a hepatitis C specialist, to strengthen its position."
103;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Cost of hepatitis C treatment may be barrier for emerging markets;Affordability and regulators are twin threats to progress;The high price of Sovaldi– the most recent advance in treatment for hepatitis C – is creating concern within healthcare systems in Europe and even triggering political resistance in the US. It also risks being a barrier to any improvements at all in lower-income countries around the world.While $84,000, the US price for one 12-week supply, is high for many Americans and Europeans, the deeply discounted tariffs proposed for those on low incomes elsewhere risk causing more fundamental worries, sparking debates over access comparable to those for HIV antiretroviral treatments since the late 1990s.“There’s real concern over [the high] cost of the new hepatitis medicines,” says Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis at Médecins Sans Frontières’ access campaign in Geneva.“We are concerned about the ability to scale up treatments because of prices in emerging markets, because of the patent barriers that exist and the need to combine different medicines.”Gregg Alton, executive vice-president in charge of access at Gilead Sciences, Sovaldi’s developer, stresses that his company is working on a pricing policy that will make the drug available far more affordably to those in poorer countries. “In all cases, we are lowering the cost of curing hepatitis C,” he says.The company has set a minimum threshold price of $300 a bottle, enough for a month. With three months typically required for a full course – and taking into account the currently approved combination with interferon – the total cost per patient would be about $900 for a complete treatment.Its current plan, still with room for expansion, will offer that price to at least 80 countries, whether to governments or to non-profit organisations.It has largely targeted the world’s poorest nations for the lowest price, but also included some middle income ones with a particularly high burden, such as Egypt, which has the highest hepatitis C prevalence in the world.Gilead signed an agreement with the Egyptian government in early July that should lead to the introduction of the drug at the start of September. This would make the country the first to have access to Sovaldi outside the US and the EU.In line with the company’s past approach to its HIV medicines, it will also offer to license production of the new drug to a number of rival low-cost Indian generic drug companies. They will be offered manufacturing knowhow and allowed to source and competitively price the product at whatever level they choose.But Mr Malpani dismisses the current proposals as “highly underwhelming and inadequate”. “We think it will have to be improved dramatically. The prices are not representative of people’s ability to pay and will not foster competition and affordability.”He also cautions over parallels with HIV – another treatment field where Gilead offered discounts to lower income countries and licensed access to its medicines via generic companies. They in turn supplied them to many low income countries with a high prevalence – and with no patent protection on the drugs.“There’s a tendency to analogise with HIV, but there are some fundamental differences,” he says. “Hepatitis C is a middle-income country disease with a very different set of challenges and strong enforcement of intellectual property.”The price in countries such as Ukraine and Iran, for instance, remains unclear. Furthermore, Gilead is seeking to enforce patents on Sovaldi wherever possible, limiting the option for rival lower cost producers to sell it outside the terms of the contracts with its partners.Yet Mr Alton argues that the real obstacle to treatment is not price. In another parallel with HIV that his company faced in the past, he fears that many countries will prove slow to mobilise domestic regulators to approve and register Sovaldi.Some, such as India and China, are not satisfied with the tests conducted in the US and elsewhere. They want additional clinical trials to be conducted on their own patients as a precondition for authorisation – which will add extra costs and delays.“The big impediment to access in India is regulatory approval,” Mr Alton says, adding that the authorities have not even recognised Sovaldi’s patent domestically.“Funding will be a challenge no matter what the price is. Interferon is already generic but the price is not affordable to people. Rejecting the patent does not necessarily enable broad access.”Others point out that India and similar countries with weak government health systems that require patients to pay from their own pocket will also struggle to diagnose and supervise those requiring treatment. MSF, which recently received a grant from Unitaid, the UN-backed donor health funding agency, concedes that costs of diagnosis also remain an expensive obstacle.“Our feeling is that we are pricing Sovaldi fairly, and providing it at a level that is affordable. The real focus should be on finding funding,” says Mr Alton.“If we don’t take action now to look at funding, and go beyond drug costs, we are not going to be successful.”
104;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-07-27T20:00:33Z;Advances in hepatitis C research prompt calls for improved prevention;The latest research has enhanced the status of experts in the disease and stirred up political controversy over pricing;For specialists in hepatitis C, the past few years have been disconcerting. After decades in the shadows struggling to attract attention and funding, they have suddenly become the rock stars of the medical science community.This year has seen the introduction of a breakthrough medicine for hepatitis C which, in more than 90 per cent of cases, will cure the disease within 12 weeks. Further drugs are expected to be approved in the next few months, representing the biggest advance in treatment for hepatitis C since the virus was identified in 1989.This has made hepatitis C one of the most closely watched areas of drug development. Gilead Sciences of the US has broken industry records with the success of its new Sovaldi medicine as analysts predict a market worth £20bn by 2020.All this suggests that a disease often described as a silent killer is finally attracting resources commensurate with its global health impact. An estimated 150m people, just over 2 per cent of the world population, are infected with chronic hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that can cause deadly liver damage.Until recently, hepatitis C struggled to compete for attention with HIV/Aids, despite there being four times more people living with the former. But as antiretroviral drugs gradually slow the Aids epidemic, hepatitis C is rising up the agenda.So why, given all this progress, is there not a sense of jubilation surrounding the scientists, health professionals and activists who have toiled for years to put hepatitis C in the spotlight? Instead of celebrating the arrival of transformative treatments, the past few months have seen furious debate over the high price of the new drugs and worries that the breakthrough will distract from efforts to improve prevention and detection.In part, this is a natural stage in the cycle of any public health threat. First, comes the long battle to raise awareness and find a solution. Then, once that is achieved, the focus shifts to ensuring access to the remedy and preventing complacency from setting in as scientists and policy makers move on to the next problem.“Right now there is a huge momentum for action,” says Charles Gore, president of the World Hepatitis Alliance, a non-governmental organisation. “The new drugs could be game-changing but we must see governments and the World Health Organisation emphasising prevention if the drugs are going to make the global impact we’re hoping for.”The challenge of translating a scientific breakthrough into sustainable public health gains looks set to be especially tricky in the case of hepatitis C for two reasons. First, the new drugs are exceptionally expensive. Second, 75 per cent of people with the virus do not know they have it.The pricing issue has been making headlines since Sovaldi won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last December, heralding the first of a new generation of drugs that treat hepatitis C more effectively, more quickly and with fewer side effects than previous medicines.“As far as the treatment is concerned, I’m over-the-moon optimistic,” says Susan Simon, president of the Hepatitis C Association, a US patient advocacy group. She contracted the virus from a contaminated blood transfusion in 1966 but has recently been given the all-clear after taking part in one of the new drug trials. “It’s a very exciting time. However, the pricing is outrageous and will be a huge barrier.”With Sovaldi priced at $84,000 for a 12-week course in the US, each daily pill works out at $1,000. Gilead and its allies say this reflects the cost of development and value to patients.Lori Reilly, head of policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group, argues that more effective treatment will produce long-term savings for the healthcare system compared with the cost of treating liver disease and, in some cases, carrying out transplants.“This is a disease that kills more people in this country than HIV/Aids. It is the leading cause of liver cancer. For these patients, for the first time, there is a hope of a medicine that will cure this disease.”Critics say the price will keep the drug out of reach of many and cripple healthcare budgets. Sovaldi’s price is hardly unique among drugs but what makes it unusual is that the hepatitis C population size is so large and concentrated among people who rely on social healthcare.In Louisiana, it would cost $1.4bn, greater than the state transport budget, to treat everyone with hepatitis C who receives health coverage through the Medicaid programme or the prison system, according to Express Scripts, the prescription management company. “The unsustainable pricing of this medication has, essentially, become a tax on all Americans,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts.Similar arguments are made in Europe as the drug is pushed beyond the US. Marisol Touraine, France’s health minister, this month said the French government was co-operating with 13 other European countries to haggle with Gilead. “If we accept such a high price, we won’t be able to treat everyone and we will also be creating a risk for our social security system,” she said.Gilead has promised to make the drug available at a steep discount in the developing world, where the majority of hepatitis C cases occur. In Egypt, which has the highest infection rate at 12 per cent of the population, a deal has been struck to supply Sovaldi for $900 a course.The World Health Organisation in April recommended use of Sovaldi and Janssen’s Olysio as new treatments for hepatitis C but said a “concerted effort” was needed to make them “affordable and accessible for all those who need them”.Increased competition should help as a rival drug from AbbVie nears market with others to follow.The so-called nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes”, promise to eliminate the need for the interferon injections. The nasty side effects and patchy success rate of the interferon injections have made hepatitis C so hard to treat.Right now there is a huge momentum for action. The new drugs could be game-changingActivists and healthcare experts worry that expensive drugs will divert resources from detection and prevention – difficult matters given a virus that often betrays no visible symptoms for decades. By the time people become aware they are carrying the disease the liver is often badly damaged.Mr Gore says in the long term the way to control costs is to reduce the number of infections. “If prevention is neglected and governments see no progress towards reducing the numbers, they will lose the appetite to continue funding these new drugs,” he argues.Research is under way into possible vaccines but progress is slow. Prevention measures include educating people about the risks of sharing needles, which in poorer countries can even happen in a medical environment.Providing access to testing is challenge. Even when a test is available, people can be reluctant to take it because of the social stigma of hepatitis C.While commonly associated with illegal drug use, the virus was often contracted unwittingly by people such as Ms Simon from blood transfusions and other means before it was identified in 1989. Many are carrying it now without knowing.
105;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-06-30T23:04:33Z;AbbVie puts investor patience in European drugmakers to the test;;Will the last mid-sized European drugmaker please turn off the lights? AbbVie’s £27bn takeover approach for UK-listed Shire has highlighted the scarcity of companies bridging the gap between big pharma and small biotech in Europe.Whereas the US has nurtured a cadre of biotech powerhouses such as Amgen, Biogen Idec and Gilead Sciences that are shaking up the traditional pharmaceuticals industry, Europe has few such examples.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, is due in London this week to seek backing from Shire shareholders for a takeover. If he eventually prevails, it would add to a history of European drugmakers being sold before they reach full maturity.“In Europe, investors have not always had the patience to give biopharma companies the time they need to grow,” says Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, pictured, urging investors to back the board’s rejection of AbbVie’s offer.Shire is an unlikely poster child for European life science. While it was founded in the UK, today its management and research are largely US-based and much of its revenues come from treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among American teenagers.Yet it remains European in one important respect: its London listing puts it among the top quartile of the UK’s FTSE 100 index, bigger by market capitalisation than household names such as Tesco, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems.Since Dr Ornskov took charge last year, Shire has produced the highest shareholder return of any FTSE 100 company. Its takeover would mark the loss of one of the world’s fastest-growing drugmakers from the European investment landscape.Having shifted its tax domicile to Ireland and reduced its UK workforce below 500, Shire cannot count on political support of the kind that helped AstraZeneca, the much bigger British drugmaker, fight off an unwanted £69bn approach from Pfizer last month.The company is almost the definition of the “mid-Atlantic floating entity with no allegiance to anybody except the lowest tax rate” that Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, once warned was eroding public trust in business.Dr Ornskov bridles at such criticism, arguing that all drug companies are global and owe their allegiance to patients and shareholders. But, with nearly half of Shire’s shareholder base in the UK, he says the company has a firm anchor in London.AbbVie’s approach, therefore, provides a test of whether European investors are willing to forgo a hefty premium – of 58 per cent over Shire’s share price in mid April before takeover speculation intensified – in the hope of bigger long-term rewards. Dr Ornskov has predicted a doubling in revenues to $10bn by 2020 as it moves aggressively into high-margin treatments for rare diseases.“Shire together with Actelion have the potential to do something similar to what we have seen from Gilead and Biogen in the US,” says Dr Ornskov, referring to the Swiss biotech company often touted as a takeover target. “If these high-growth European companies keep getting taken out, they are going to get pretty scarce.”The pharmaceuticals sector has been convulsed by deal-making this year as cash-rich drugmakers hunt for growth. For US predators, European companies carry the added appeal of big tax savings by providing a vehicle through which to shelter offshore cash from high US rates.Europe has no shortage of big pharmaceutical groups, with Roche and Novartis of Switzerland, Sanofi of France and GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of the UK all powerful global players. It also has a strong research base with three of the world’s top five medical science universities – Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London – in the UK, according to Times Higher Education.But while there are several thriving biotech clusters across Europe, relatively few companies reach the scale of Shire or Actelion. Promising UK companies such as Celltech, PowderJect and Cambridge Antibody Technology, have been gobbled up by bigger rivals just as they were hitting their stride.“The US has been much better at developing mid-sized companies,” says Sir John Bell, professor of medicine at Oxford University. “We’ve had 35 years of biotech [in the UK] but very few companies have broken through.”Europe was at the forefront of biotech when Biogen was founded in Geneva in 1978. However, the company soon moved to Boston and listed on Nasdaq, drawn by the greater depth of capital and risk appetite in the US, as well as the bigger drugs market. European biotech has struggled to keep pace ever since.Several promising European companies are emerging, such as Genmab in Denmark, Morphosys in Germany and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, with more following behind. Almost $500m has been raised by biotech companies from five initial public offerings in Europe so far this year, exceeding the $305m raised from six IPOs in the whole of last year, according to Mergermarket.However, the tally pales in comparison with Nasdaq, where 32 biotech IPOs have taken place so far this year, raising $1.98bn.Whereas the US has many specialist healthcare funds attuned to the rhythms of drug development, European companies are more dependent on generalist investors.David Solomon, chief executive of Zealand Pharma, a Danish biotech company, points to Novo Nordisk as proof of what can be achieved with long-term support. The Danish diabetes specialist has grown into a near-$100bn company backed by the foundation that controls it.“You need large funds that see the long-term value and build a durable partnership with the company,” says Mr Solomon. “That has been the challenge in Europe.”

Some 75,000 people in those regions suffer from cystic fibrosis, which congests the lungs and has no cure.Goldman Sachs estimates the drug could tally sales above $5bn a year at its peak. Vertex plans to submit applications for US and European regulatory approval and expects to launch the treatment some time in 2015.The Boston-based company’s market capitalisation jumped by $6.5bn overnight to more than $22bn as shares climbed 40.41 per cent to close at $93.53.The news lifted the broader sector as well. The Nasdaq Biotech index climbed 1 per cent to 2,668.28.Unexpected optimism on the corporate PC market from US chipmaker Intel two weeks ago may not have been a one-off for the sector.Micron Technology, the largest US maker of flash memory, said it would increase production of dynamic-random access memory, which is mostly used in PCs.Micron will also ramp up production of Nand flash chips, which are used mainly for tablets and smartphones.The guidance came as the company said sales in the three months to May 29 soared 72 per cent from a year earlier to $4bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Profits rose more than 18-fold to $806m, or 68 cents a share.The company has been lifted by stable prices and steady supply, after years of market turmoil. Micron acquired Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Elpida Memory in 2013, helping to drive a wave of consolidation.Shares of Micron, which have outpaced the broader benchmark S&P 500 since the beginning of the year, rose 3.97 per cent to $32.50. Intel climbed 0.89 per cent to $30.50.Lorillard and Reynolds American were under pressure after broker Morgan Stanley cut its ratings on the cigarette makers to underweight from equal-weight, saying a potential tie-up was already priced into shares.Lorillard shares fell 1.98 per cent to $62.27, Reynolds American declined 1.36 per cent to $60.94 and Altria dipped 0.80 per cent to $42.35.Walgreens declined 1.70 per cent to $72.48 after the drugstore chain said sales and profits in the three months to the end of May came up short of Wall Street estimates. Revenues climbed to $19.4bn from $18.3bn, while profits rose to $722m from $624m.Overall, US equities shifted higher following better than expected housing and consumer confidence reports, though early gains later faded. The figures showed new home sales in May hit their fastest pace since 2008, rising 18.6 per cent to an annualised pace of 504,000 units.“Net net, two economic numbers today each pulling in the same direction, convincing evidence that the economy continues to expand after a sharp drop in the first quarter,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey said.The S&P 500 slipped 0.64 per cent to 1,949.98 after hitting a new record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.70 per cent lower to 16,818.13.

107;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Drug cost watchdog demands more evidence to support case for hepatitis C treatment;;Britain’s drug cost watchdog has demanded more evidence to support the case for a new hepatitis C treatment that has triggered a fierce debate in the US over its $1,000-a-day price.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said it was “minded not to recommend” Sovaldi for use in the National Health Service unless its US-based maker, Gilead Sciences, provided more data to prove its effectiveness.Sovaldi is on course to become the best-selling new drug in pharmaceutical history after generating $2.3bn of sales in its first three months on the US market this year.However, its price of $84,000 for a 12-week course has exposed Gilead to accusations of profiteering from US politicians and healthcare providers.Sovaldi has been described as a “canary in the coal mine” alerting governments to the rising cost of a new medicines under development that threaten to place further strain on cash-strapped national healthcare systems.Nice said its reservations about the drug were focused on its clinical effectiveness and had nothing to do with price.However, the agency’s negative stance reflects the tough scrutiny expected to face Sovaldi from governments across Europe as Gilead attempts to replicate its successful US launch.Sovaldi has been portrayed by its advocates as a wonder drug that cures more than 90 per cent of patients, marking a big step forward in the treatment of a virus that affects 150m people worldwide.Nice acknowledged it was effective against certain types of chronic hepatitis C but said evidence was lacking for some patient subgroups.Gilead has priced Sovaldi at £35,000 for a 12-week course in the UK, representing a 30 per cent discount to the US price but still much higher than most medicines.The company said the price was justified by the high cost of development and the long-term savings that result from curing a virus that, if left untreated, can lead to liver failure and cancer.Nice said it would only start assessing Sovaldi’s cost-effectiveness if it was first convinced of its clinical value. A consultation will be held with a July 4 deadline for submissions.Gilead said it would work closely with Nice to address its concerns. “There is an urgent need for hepatitis C patients to have rapid access to effective treatments,” the company said.Sovaldi is already available to about 500 patients after a decision by NHS England in April to allocate £18.7m to fund the drug for the most acute cases. However, approval from Nice would be needed for it to be extended to more of the 160,000 people chronically infected with hepatitis C in England.In the US, Sovaldi has sparked debate over whether the country needs more European-style powers to regulate drug prices. John Rother, president of the US National Coalition on Health Care, which represents insurers, employers and healthcare providers, said last month: “Sovaldi is the canary in the coal mine, alerting us to . . . a tsunami of expensive medicines that could literally bankrupt the healthcare system.”
108;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-06-10T22:10:41Z;Hepatitis C: Gilead’s Odyssey;Progress shows why big drug companies are good things;The Hepatitis C virus is the kind of problem that drug companies are meant to solve. The World Health Organisation thinks as many as 150m people have chronic HCV infections, and as many as half a million deaths a year result. Until recently, the standard treatments – interferon and ribavirin – offered poor efficacy and serious side effects.Gilead’s $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset, in 2011, brought along an HCV treatment, sofosbuvir. In clinical trials, in combination with the old treatments, as many as 90 per cent of patients were effectively cured. The drug was approved last December. In the first quarter of this year alone, its sales were a stunning $2.3bn – nearly half of Gilead’s total. Hopes are high. ISI Group thinks that the HCV market will be worth $15-$20bn annually by 2018. And Gilead’s stock has run up nearly 300 per cent over three years.Sofosbuvir is, however, one of three new classes of drug – NS5As, protease inhibitors and nucleotide inhibitors – that attack the virus at different points. And the race is on to develop an ideal combination. The contestants: Gilead, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The combined research and development budgets of these companies run to $25bn a year. Combinations of two of the drug types from Gilead, Bristol-Myers and AbbVie are under review with the US authorities. Merck just spent $3.85bn to buy Idenix, a nucleotide developer, making way for one pill containing all three types.A bonanza for patients, and a sterling example of why for-profit drug development works. A puzzle for investors, though. How will the profits be split? Will winner take most? If there are multiple good treatments, will governments and insurers play one company against the other, bringing prices down? Hard to say. This is reflected in Gilead’s valuation: while robust growth is expected, it trades at 13 times earnings, below the group average. The progress against HCV shows why big drug companies are good things, and why their shares tend to be cheap.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
109;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

The Nasdaq rose 0.6 per cent to 4,321.40.The strategy of Vail Resorts, the operator of the namesake ski resort in Colorado and Tahoe, California, to sign customers up for the next season while they still have their skis on appears to be paying off, sending shares 6 per cent higher to $76.22.Sales of season passes for next winter rose by 14 per cent through the end of May, the company said on Thursday, as it reported higher third-quarter profits.Last quarter, Vail relied on the performance of its Colorado resorts, which recorded a 5.6 per cent increase in visitors from a year earlier.With its merger with Jos. A. Bank nearly sewn up, Men’s Wearhouse executives were able to focus on their own business and managed to top Wall Street forecasts – an infrequent occurrence.For the quarter to May 3, sales rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $630m. The report marked the third time Men’s Wearhouse has beaten analyst revenue expectations over the past two-and-a-half years.Profits fell 50 per cent to $16.5m, or 34 cents per share, from $33.1m a year earlier.Adjusting for certain items, primarily related to the Jos. A. Bank transaction, the company would have reported earnings of 69 cents a share.Along with its first-quarter results, chief executive Doug Ewert said he expected the company to complete its merger with Jos. A. Bank in the coming weeks. Men’s Wearhouse shares rose 6 per cent to $54.25 by the close of trading Friday.Both Men’s Wearhouse and Vail were among the top 50 performers within the Russell 2000 on Friday.Diamond Foods, the maker of Kettle brand potato chips and Pop Secret popcorn, was under pressure on Friday after the company missed Wall Street forecasts, weighed down by poor performance in its nuts division.Overall sales rose 3 per cent to $190.9m, while its net loss widened to $105.6m from $15.6m a year earlier. Its shares declined 11 per cent to $29.74.Drugmaker Gilead lagged behind the market after analysts at Wells Fargo lowered their annual sales forecasts for its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug.The investment bank now expects Sovaldi to generate sales of $9.6bn, down from projections of $10.4bn earlier. Shares in the company fell 1 per cent to $82.39.Hertz shares slumped after the company said it would have to restate its 2011 results because of errors and warned that it may need to restate results for 2012 and 2013.

111;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-05-08T16:51:15Z;Tech stocks recover on Morgan Stanley backing;Rating on Twitter shares upgraded by broker;Technology stocks recovered on rising confidence from broker Morgan Stanley on Thursday, after a difficult start to the year erased nearly 50 per cent of the market capitalisation of some of the sector’s most closely watched companies.Analysts at the investment bank lifted their rating on Twitter from ‘underweight’ to ‘equal-weight’, citing lower risks for a further decline in shares.“Although concerns regarding user growth and mainstream adoption remain, we see Twitter as likely to meet investor financial expectations over the next few quarters,” analyst Jordan Monahan said.Since the start of the year, weakness in Twitter shares has cut $17.5bn from the company’s market capitalisation. Mr Monahan noted Twitter was now trading at a similar equity valuation-to-revenue ratio as Facebook.The investment bank also upgraded its view on Yelp to ‘overweight’ from ‘equal-weight’ on the expectation that it will be able to expand into new products and capture a greater share of the online local advertising market.“Yelp’s large database of high-quality local reviews and its highly engaged (and growing) user base are key competitive differentiators that may allow Yelp to outmanoeuvre larger competitors,” Mr Monahan said.Despite the upgrades, Morgan Stanley guided investors to larger companies such as Facebook and Google for their scale and execution advantages.Shares in Twitter climbed 4.24 per cent to close at $31.96 while Yelp advanced just over 1 per cent to $53.29 and Google was 0.2 per cent up, at $511.00. Facebook shares initially rose, but ended the day 1.08 per cent lower at $56.77.Separately, Zillow, the most-visited real estate website in the US, reported a surprise adjusted quarterly profit, sending shares 4.02 per cent higher to close at $97.39. Analysts from at least eight investment banks increased their price targets on the company following its results.Electric carmaker Tesla was under pressure after the company said an acceleration in production had increased its costs. The company delivered 6,457 cars in the first quarter, better than the 6,429 analysts had expected and its own prediction of 6,400.Tesla’s move to quicken production pushed up its costs in the period, helping to drive the company to a loss of $49.8m compared with a profit of $11.2m in the same quarter in 2013. Revenues climbed from $562m to $621m, the company had said after market close on Wednesday.The company also forecast second-quarter deliveries of 7,500, shy of Wall Street expectations. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the lower second quarter forecast meant Tesla would have to increase its sales rate over the second-half of the year. Shares fell 11.3 per cent to end at $178.59.Keurig Green Mountain led the benchmark S&P 500 higher on Thursday after the company reported better than expected sales and profits for its second quarter and expanded a partnership with JM Smucker to produce coffee for its Keurig machines.The company said it had signed a multiyear agreement to market and manufacture Folgers coffee, as well as some of Smucker’s other brands, for its consumer and commercial brewing systems. Shares in Keurig rose 12.99 per cent to close at $104.19 while JM Smucker increased 0.59 per cent to $99.19.Gilead Sciences, the maker of the Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment at the centre of a political row in the US, initially advanced after the company said its board had authorised the repurchase of $5bn worth of shares.The announcement follows a blockbuster quarter for Gilead, with the $1,000-a-day medication tallying $2.3bn in sales during its first full quarter on the market. The new buyback adds to a share purchase programme that had $2.9bn remaining under authorisation. Shares in Gilead later fell back to end largely unchanged at $78.73.Overall, US equity markets ended mixed. Initial jobless claims, the main economic report on Thursday’s diary, showed an improvement in the past week after an unexpected spike around the Easter holiday.The S&P 500 fell 0.14 per cent to close at 1,875.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 per cent to 16,550.97. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.4 per cent off, at 4,051.50.
112;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-04-23T16:54:17Z;US airline industry gathers speed on strong results;;The US airline industry, which has outperformed a broadly turbulent market this year, gathered further speed on Wednesday after results from Delta and Boeing topped Wall Street profit forecasts.Shares in both companies advanced in early-afternoon trading, as Delta shrugged off severe winter weather and Boeing reported robust global demand for commercial jetliners.Delta, the third-largest US airline, said net revenues grew 5 per cent from a year earlier, to $8.9bn, as it flew more densely packed flights in the US and expanded domestic and Latin American service.Profits in the quarter rose to $213m, or 25 cents per share, compared to $7m a year earlier. When adjusting for restructuring and other expenses, earnings per share rose to 33 cents, ahead of expectations. Analysts at Goldman Sachs called the results “solid”.Boeing also surprised Wall Street as it reported an 18 per cent rise in deliveries of its passenger jets and increased earnings guidance for the current year.Revenues at its commercial aeroplane division rose by almost a fifth to $12.7bn in the quarter, while operating margins firmed to 11.8 per cent from 11.4 per cent. Boeing reported a commercial order backlog of $374bn, which included 235 net new orders during the quarter.“Despite some variation in emerging market growth rates, we see no softening of demand for commercial aeroplanes,” Jim McNerney, chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “In fact, underpinning the strength of the cycle relative to past ones is a sustained high level of replacement demand.”The results from Delta and Boeing come a day ahead of earnings from airlines representing more than half of US domestic passenger air capacity and revenues. They include United Continental, American Airlines, Southwest and JetBlue.Four of the five top-performing members of the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which also includes rail and freight shipping companies, have been airlines. The index itself has climbed 5 per cent this year, compared to a small dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Shares in Boeing rose 2.41 per cent on Wednesday to end at $130.62 while Delta climbed more than 6 per cent to close at $37.07, putting it among the top performers on the benchmark S&P 500.Gilead Sciences said sales of Sovaldi, the $1,000-a-day hepatitis C drug at the centre of a political row, tallied $2.3bn during its first full quarter on the market. The debut helped lift Gilead’s net sales 97 per cent from a year earlier to $5bn, while profits tripled to $2.2bn, or $1.33 per share.Both sales and profits easily topped Wall Street forecasts. Shares in the company climbed 3 per cent before settling back to finish 1.39 per cent higher at $73.87.Analysts at Citigroup estimate the hepatitis C treatment could enjoy sales of more than $12bn at its peak in 2016.Despite the better than expected earnings from Boeing, Delta and Gilead, as well as Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, and Norfolk Southern, stock markets slid. The benchmark S&P 500 broke a six-day winning streak, slipping 0.22 per cent to close at 1,875.39 after new home sales showed a second consecutive month of decline.“The trend in the data has been soft for a while now, and separate reports on mortgage purchase applications and homebuilder sentiment as well as figures related to the existing home sales market are indicative of weak conditions in the housing market persisting for the time being,” JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.08 per cent to 16,501.65 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 0.83 per cent lower at 4,126.97.Intuitive Surgical led the declines on the Nasdaq 100, home to the largest companies on the wider Nasdaq index, after cutting forecasts for sales of its surgical robots.First-quarter profits slid 77 per cent to $44m, with procedure growth on Intuitive’s da Vinci systems expected to rise 2 to 8 per cent this year, compared with as much as 12 per cent earlier. Its shares fell 11.46 per cent to close at $373.93.
113;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-04-23T15:20:54Z;‘Croci’ pushes the limits of value investing;It is not a cheap approach, but the strategy has paid off in Europe and the US;"Here is a quiz. Which of these stocks is cheaper; Gilead Sciences, in the booming biotech sector, which currently trades at a multiple of trailing earnings of about 26, or Gazprom, the hegemonic resources group in Russia, which trades at a price/earnings multiple of about 2.5?The answer, according to Deutsche Bank’s Francesco Curto, is Gilead. And this is not because of any attempt to measure the political risks surrounding Russia. Rather, it is driven by Deutsche’s “Croci” investment process (it stands for “cash returned on capital invested”), an attempt to make a systematic search for value stocks, and make valid comparisons between otherwise different companies.Like much of value investing, the insight behind Croci is simple, but putting it into practice involves a lot of hard work. It is based on adjustments to public accounts to screen out manipulations.Instead of market value, Mr Curto’s team at Deutsche uses enterprise value, thus including debt and operational liabilities such as future leases. Rather than the official book value (assets minus liabilities on the balance sheet), it uses net capital invested. This requires adjusting assumptions on depreciation, and instead imposing an “economic depreciation” based on an estimate of how long a company’s assets will actually last. This allows an estimate of the actual replacement value of a company’s assets. The team also values intangible assets that generate cash but do not appear on the balance sheet – such as brands and patents. Finally, it accounts for inflation.This leads to a cash return on capital invested, to replace the accounting concept of return on equity, and an “economic p/e ratio” to replace what Mr Curto’s team calls the “accounting p/e”.This is not a simple quantitative screen. Rebuilding a company’s balance sheet to take into account economic factors requires assumptions, even if they are applied systematically. Deutsche employs some 60 analysts, most of them based in India, to do this work – so this is not as cheap as other value screens, which can be bought as exchange traded funds.The conclusions that Croci reaches are often fascinating. Perhaps most importantly, the Croci process suggests that much of emerging markets’ current cheapness is “only optical”. In the case of Gazprom, Deutsche estimates its true economic p/e at 28.6, radically higher than the published 2.5. The gap between the two is largely because Gazprom keeps engaging in wasteful capital expenditures. Meanwhile Gilead’s p/e was only slightly changed, rising from 25.3 to 26.8 as a result of the exercise (which suggests that Gilead is also no bargain).As for emerging markets as a whole, since 2007 economic earnings are down (after inflation is taken into account), and they are returning less capital now. In other words, their productivity is slowly falling, because they are over-investing. This helps the economy, at least in the short term, but does not help shareholders. Chinese steel companies, for example, suffer a mismatch between the economic life of their production facilities, and the probable demand for their product. Their factories are likely to outlive demand for steel, and this will create losses for banks.Another insight is that healthcare and pharmaceuticals offer much better value than conventional analysis reveals. This is largely because their book values tend to be understated, thanks to the difficulties in accounting for brands and patents. Under the Croci process, healthcare has shown up as one of the three cheapest sectors globally every year since 2009.Mr Curto points out that Pfizer now has much the same number of employees as it did 10 years ago, even after a series of acquisitions. Pharma companies’ costs, for sales networks and even for research and development, can be consolidated and cut far more easily than in other sectors.Thus Croci implies that the rash of deals in healthcare does not imply any great irrational exuberance. Rather it suggests a rational search to release the value that is trapped within healthcare companies.Does the Croci approach work? The investment strategies that use the approach have been in operation since 2004, and manage some $12bn. Deutsche has also produced indices weighted according to Croci measures.The US version of the Croci index has gained 170 per cent in the decade since launch, compared with 101 per cent for the S&P 500. In Europe, it has outperformed the Stoxx 50, by 114 per cent against 86 per cent. But in Japan, graveyard for many value strategies, the approach does not yet work so well. The Croci index has gained 43 per cent since launch, against 35 per cent for the Topix 1000 – but the Nikkei 225, crudely weighted using share prices, has gained 63 per cent.The bottom line is that this is a fascinating attempt to systematise traditional value investing. It provides insights of which all investors should be aware."

Scott Brun, head of clinical development for AbbVie, said the Chicago-based company planned to file for US regulatory approval within weeks, burnishing its status among the most advanced challengers to Gilead.But Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb also revealed strong trial results at the International Liver Congress in London, which ended on Sunday, leading analysts to predict an increasingly competitive market.Gilead is widely predicted to remain in the lead after it produced fresh evidence for the effectiveness of its drug. But more competition for Sovaldi would be welcomed by healthcare providers and policy makers amid mounting criticism of its $1,000-a-day price tag.The World Health Organisation last week called for a “concerted effort” to drive down the price of new hepatitis treatments and Express Scripts, a big US prescription management company, said Sovaldi’s price was “unsustainable”.Gilead has promised to make the drug available more cheaply in developing countries – and recently struck a deal with Egypt at a 99 per cent discount – but insists the $84,000 price of a 12-week treatment in the US represented good value.Before Sovaldi’s launch, hepatitis C patients had to be treated for up to a year with multiple drugs – including an inconvenient injected medicine – that produced much lower cure rates and worse side effects.Drug industry leaders say Sovaldi and rival medicines will save money in the long run by reducing the number of cases in which hepatitis C leads to serious liver disease – including cirrhosis and cancer – requiring more costly treatment.“Policy makers . . . need to value innovation and stop implying that it comes cheap,” said John Castellani, president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group.
115;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-04-11T22:04:38Z;US retailers fall after Gap reports sales slide;Financial sector also weakens in wake of JPMorgan results;Shares in US retailers were under pressure on Friday after one of the country’s largest apparel chains reported difficult March trade, upending a rising view that consumers were once again opening their wallets after months of severe weather.The Gap, owner of its namesake brand as well as Old Navy and Banana Republic, said same-store sales in March fell 6 per cent from a year earlier, far below Wall Street estimates.“We entered the first quarter with inventory levels that were above our current sales and traffic trends, and then February conditions made matters worse,” said Katrina O’Connell, vice-president of investor relations. “Unfortunately, traffic in March was well below our expectations and remained negative.”Comparable sales at Old Navy and Banana Republic also declined in the month and the company warned margins would continue to decline in the quarter as it remains promotional. Executives nonetheless affirmed full-year earnings guidance of $2.90 to $2.95 per share.“While we expect improvements in April from better weather, Easter and pent-up demand, we believe that the Gap will have to continue to be promotional in order to bring inventories in line with sales, particularly at the Gap segment,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson said.Gap shares fell as much as 6 per cent to $37.00 before paring losses, closing at $38.40, down 2.3 per cent.Express shares dipped 3.3 per cent to $15.06 while shares in Urban Outfitters fell 2.99 per cent to $36.01.The financial sector also weakened on Friday after JPMorgan reported its worst start to the year in fixed income trading since the depths of the financial crisis, sending ripples across the industry.Profits at the bank fell 19 per cent from a year earlier to $5.3bn, or $1.28 cents a share, below analyst forecasts. Overall, revenues slid 8 per cent to $23.9bn.The bank blamed a slowdown in mortgage refinancing and lower client activity in fixed income markets for weaker-than-anticipated results.JPMorgan’s shares fell 3.6 per cent to $55.30. Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.09 per cent to $152.72, Morgan Stanley weakened 2.67 per cent to $28.47 and Citigroup fell 1.19 per cent to $45.68.Zynga advanced after analysts at Morgan Stanley lifted their view on the company, a day after shares tumbled 7 per cent following the latest management shake-up.The investment bank upgraded it to equal-weight from underweight as expectations rise for Zynga’s newest game, FarmVille 2: Country Escape.“Zynga management appears to be reinvigorating innovation in the company, which could help it return to positive bookings growth [and] double-digit ebitda margins by the third quarter,” analyst John Egbert said. “The new FarmVille mobile title exhibits signs of reaching $100m plus in annual bookings after it launches broadly in the second quarter.”Zynga shares were flat at $4.07.Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company under intense pressure from policy makers and insurers over its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company revealed new data on the drug.At a presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Conference in London, Gilead said a two-drug treatment of its Sovaldi and ledipasvir drugs showed a cure rate of 94 per cent.Shares in the company advanced 0.84 per cent to $66.03.Zoe’s Kitchen, the US restaurant chain, jumped in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 64.8 per cent to $24.72 on strong investor demand.The company, which has 110 restaurants across the US, sold shares on Thursday evening at $15 apiece.Overall, markets slid for a second day as investors continued to rotate out of momentum stocks and into safer investments – including US Treasuries.The S&P 500 fell 0.95 per cent to 1,815.69 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened 0.89 per cent to 16,026.75. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.34 per cent to 3,999.73.
116;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Price of hepatitis C drug attacked;;Gilead Sciences is facing mounting pressure over its new $1,000-a-day hepatitis C drug after the World Health Organisation joined US politicians and healthcare companies in voicing concerns over the price.Sovaldi is on course to become the most successful new drug in industry history with some analysts forecasting that the US biotech company will enjoy sales of more than $9bn this year.But the WHO on Wednesday called for a “concerted effort” to drive down the price of the treatment and a rival product from Johnson & Johnson to make them “affordable and accessible for all those who need them”.The intervention came a day after Express Scripts, a big US prescription management company, warned that the cost of Sovaldi was “unsustainable for our country” and threatened to boycott the drug when cheaper rivals enter the market.Democrats in the US House of Representatives last month wrote to Gilead executives asking them to explain the price tag, sparking a broad sell-off of US biotech stocks amid market fears that drug pricing was becoming a political issue.Gilead says the $84,000 price for a 12-week course in the US is justified by the high cost of development and offers better value for money than older treatments that are less effective and often leave patients needing expensive liver transplants.Drugmakers have traditionally faced much less pressure on pricing in the US than in Europe but the outcry over Sovaldi has led some analysts to suggest this could be changing.Steven Miller, chief medical offer of Express Scripts, said Gilead’s treatment threatened to bust the US healthcare system if it was prescribed widely among the 3m to 4m people in the country with hepatitis C.“Never before has a drug been priced this high to treat a patient population this large,” he said. “The burden will fall upon individual patients, state and federal governments, and [insurers] who will have to balance access and affordability in a way they never had to before.”Gilead has promised to offer the treatment much more cheaply in developing countries – home to most of the 150m people in the world living with hepatitis C.The company recently agreed a 99 per cent discount for Egypt and plans to offer voluntary licences to several Indian generic manufacturers.In new guidelines published on Wednesday, the WHO recommended use of Sovaldi and Johnson & Johnson’s Olysio but urged industry to work with governments, international agencies and aid donors to ensure wide access.Hepatitis C is spread through blood, often via contaminated needles, and causes cirrhosis and liver cancer.The furore over Sovaldi’s pricing has echoes of past disputes over HIV drugs when big pharma came under fire for keeping life-saving medicines out of reach of the poor.
117;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Investors brace for end of the biotech run;;When the long bull run in biotech stocks came to a shuddering halt last week, Wall Street looked south to Capitol Hill for an explanation.Henry Waxman, the veteran Democratic congressman, was blamed for spoiling the party after he and two colleagues wrote to Gilead Sciences questioning the $84,000-per-patient price of its new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.This sparked concern over whether politicians might imperil the sky-high returns forecast for a wave of new medicines emerging from the sector.With little prospect of bipartisan support for intervention, the letter seemed a flimsy pretext for a market rout. But analysts say the Nasdaq biotech index was ripe for correction after rising two-thirds in the past year and more than threefold since a six-year low in 2009.The focus now is on whether the pullback – the index was down 12 per cent from a month ago on Tuesday – represents a renewed buying opportunity or the start of a sustained reversal in what has been among the top performing sectors of US equity markets for the past two years.“Some investors are rotating out of biopharma into financial, technology, industrial and consumer sectors,” says Ying Huang, analyst at Barclays. “Investors are wondering if we have seen the peak of biotech for the foreseeable future.”Biotech bears point to the sector’s stretched valuations, with stocks trading at an average 400 times reported earnings and almost 94 times estimated forward earnings, as evidence of a bubble.The sector has always had a feel of the casino. While big pharma’s research and development risks are insulated by strong cash flow from existing products, biotech companies often involve bets on the success of a single experimental drug.But, even by the industry’s high-rolling standards, some of the valuation rises of the past year have been exceptional.Take Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a Manhattan-based company with 50 employees which reported revenues of $1.6m and net losses of $67.8m in 2013.There are high hopes for the company because it is developing what would be the first approved drug for a form of liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which affects up to 5 per cent of Americans and is rising in incidence because of a connection with obesity.Since listing at $15-a-share in 2012, the stock is now more than 20 times higher at around $346, valuing the company at $6.75bn. On one day in January its shares climbed nearly fourfold on the back of positive clinical trial data.Yet, the stock has fallen more than 25 per cent in the past week – outstripping the wider market decline – after Intercept revealed that patients taking part in a trial had experienced an unusually high number of heart-related problems.The company is still confident of the treatment’s prospects but the setback brought a reminder that apparent wonder drugs are often derailed before reaching market.Biotech bulls say such risks are more than outweighed by the potential rewards, pointing to the success of Gilead, whose new Sovaldi drug could top $5bn of sales this year – by far the most successful launch in industry history.Others such as Biogen Idec have also produced huge returns for early investors as breakthrough drugs have catapulted them into the realm of big pharma.Optimists say this time really is different to previous booms and busts because of advances in genetic science that enable companies to develop more targeted treatments for niche patient groups. This allows them to be tested in smaller trials, which accelerates development.They also point to cuts in R&D investment by big pharma that has left the industry increasingly reliant on innovation from smaller biotech companies, either through lucrative licensing deals or takeovers.Among the 10 biggest biotech companies, average annual sales and earnings growth is more than three times that of the S&P 500 average. “You could argue for much higher price to earnings than we are currently seeing,” says Mark Schoenebaum, biotech analyst at ISI.The sector’s strength has been fed by a flood of generalist investors chasing growth stocks. This has supported more than 60 US biotech IPOs in the past year with more scrambling to reach market before the window closes.Vadim Zlotnikov, strategist at AllianceBernstein, says the recent sell-off is part of a broader downward re-rating of growth stocks as improving economic prospects and a rising interest rate environment reduces the appeal of long-term gambles.“It feels gut-wrenching,” says one large investor. “But I don’t think it is time to get out because the fundamentals haven’t changed.” The next few weeks will reveal whether others have equally steely nerves.
118;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Biotech sell-off heightens fears that sector has reached peak;Questions over pricing of drugs unsettle investors;Heavy selling in biotechnology stocks on Monday heightened nervousness over one of the US stock market’s best-performing sectors, as investors debated whether its multiyear rally had reached its peak.The Nasdaq biotechnology index shed 3.02 per cent by the close in New York, extending a slide that began late last week when the sector suffered its worst single day of losses since October 2011.Analysts said trading volume on the index, which comprises 121 companies, hit its highest level in nearly 10 years on Friday, when biotech shares lost 4.4 per cent. Volumes were likely to surpass that level on Monday, they said.Investors attributed the sell-off to a letter from US House Democrats that raised concerns over the price of a hepatitis C drug treatment from Gilead Sciences.The drug, known as Solvadi, is administered over 12 weeks and costs $84,000 per treatment, leading some lawmakers to question the company’s pricing.Analysts at ISI said they did not believe the inquiry from Congress would force changes at Gilead. The move was intended to get the company to explain its pricing in a public forum and implicitly “shame” regulators at the Food and Drug Administration for allowing the drug to be sold at such a price.One large investor in a fund focused on the sector said: “In an environment where everyone is so nervous about valuations, something like that [Congressional letter to Gilead] can set off a panic on everything. There has been a period of benign neglect where we know what we own is overvalued and today there was follow-through on that sentiment.”The day’s selling was sharpest among smaller companies in the sector, whose share prices have soared because of speculation from investors that the innovative rare treatments being developed might one day lead them to be acquired by a large company in the sector. Shares in Agios Pharmaceuticals dropped 15.72 per cent to close at $37.47 and PTC Therapeutics fell 14.54 per cent to $26.50.“There is a massive rotation from growth to value going on,” said Mark Schoenebaum, biotech analyst at ISI. The bulk of the selling was coming from generalist investors and long-only fund managers who had piled into the sector.Larger companies in the sector, which investors believe sport more justifiable valuations, fared better. Gilead was up 0.08 per cent to $72.13, Biogen Idec fell 1.86 per cent to $312.60, Amgen dropped 1.34 per cent to $121.28 and Celgene shed just over 2 per cent to finish at $141.48.“The level of volatility is increasing and investor concern continues to go higher,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets. “Sentiment is waning the most we’ve seen in the last [two to three] years.”Gilead acquired the hepatitis C drug when it bought Pharmasset for $11bn in 2011, which helped spark a revival in the fortunes of the biotechnology sector. The Nasdaq biotech index gained 31.9 per cent in 2012 and 65.6 per cent in 2013, becoming one of the best-performing asset classes on the US stock market.
119;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2014-03-22T01:03:49Z;US biotech stocks suffer sharp slide on Congress letter;Lawmakers raise concerns over price of hepatitis C drug;Biotechnology stocks, the standout asset class of the soaring US equity market, suffered their sharpest decline since October 2011 on Friday after US congressional representatives raised concerns over the price of a hepatitis C drug treatment from Gilead Sciences.The sell-off was triggered by a letter from the House Energy and Commerce committee to the chief executive of Gilead questioning its plans to sell the 12-week treatment, Sovaldi, for $84,000 per dose.The lawmakers wrote: “These costs are likely to be too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and those with private insurance,” in a letter dated March 20. They also argued that because Hepatitis C is most prevalent among low-income, minority patients, the expense of the drug will saddle state Medicaid programmes with steep costs.The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell 4.4 per cent and Gilead Sciences tumbled by 4.6 per cent to $72.07. The day’s losses extended across the large-cap biotech sector as Biogen Idec fell 8.2 per cent to $318.53, Celgene dropped 3.7 per cent to $144.40 and Amgen lost 3.2 per cent to $122.93.The share losses came as investors have questioned how much higher biotechnology stocks could run after climbing 110 per cent over the past two years.The sector index hit a record high last month in part due to frequent upward revisions to estimates of sales at the largest biotechnology companies such as Gilead, which has a market capitalisation of $107bn.Larger biotechnology companies have generated huge sales from new treatments that target rare or orphan diseases as they charge large sums for the drugs. That in turn has fed a cycle of new medical research and experimentation with many small laboratories gaining funds in an attempt to come up with the next big medical breakthrough.Analysts at Nomura expect Sovaldi to generate more than $4bn in sales this year for Gilead. Several state Medicaid programmes have limited the access to Sovaldi to “only the sickest” patients, because of its expense. And pharmacy benefits managers such as Express Scripts have been encouraging doctors to delay prescribing the drug, according to the letter.This letter is a ‘bank shot’ that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of SovaldiThe California Technology Assessment Forum, a group affiliated with insurers that has been evaluating the drug, warned that at $1,000 per pill Sovaldi could cost the state nearly $30bn a year.The committee has asked Gilead to provide a briefing on the drug’s pricing by April 3. Gilead could not be reached for comment.Analysts at ISI, the hedge fund research company, said: “This letter is a ‘bank shot’ that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi.”There are nearly 4m chronic cases of Hepatitis C in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2010, the illness was responsible for more than 16,000 deaths.The disease is even more prevalent globally, infecting an estimated 170m people. It can be transmitted through blood transfusions, from syringes shared by drug users and from mothers to their children.

121;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Biotech: it’s back;Burst of dealmaking keeps things interesting in healthcare’s Silicon Valley;If you are an investor in Celgene you can stop reading now. You are already on your own private island, bought with some of the 1,400 per cent total return the US biotech company has delivered since 2003, and it is approaching cocktail hour. The rest of us should listen up.The biotech sector has recovered from a long slump after the 2000 technology crash. The Nasdaq Biotech index is 18 per cent above its high, after a bumper rally this year. A burst of dealmaking is keeping things interesting. Is this another bubble?The quick answer is yes. The rally has left no room for disappointment. When Amgen turned in sales numbers for the first quarter of 2013 a whisker below what Wall Street had pencilled in, its shares sank 7 per cent. (They are still up strongly on a 12-month basis.) Given the tough economic climate and tangled regulatory approval environment, there may well be more negative earnings surprises in store.Consider the long answer, though. Biotech is the Silicon Valley of the healthcare industry. It is where seed capital chases the best new drug ideas. The pharmaceuticals sector is grappling with a patent expiry crisis, and biotech – which often concentrates on a single drug or treatment area – is the beneficiary.Inflows into exchange-traded biotech funds are running at half as much again in 2013 as in all of 2012. That has fuelled a sharp outperformance – the NBI has offered almost double the returns of the S&P 500 in the year to date. Even a relative minnow such as the London-listed Biotech Growth Trust has offered twice the returns of the FTSE 100 this year. And the sector is not overpriced. Research from Deutsche Bank shows that biotechs’ price/earnings multiples are not historically high.Some biotechs are so big – Celgene, Amgen and Gilead are worth a combined $215bn – they could be mistaken for Big Pharma. Yet Sanofi’s purchase of Genzyme in 2011 did not spark large-scale consolidation. Deals are centred on smaller companies such as Elan and Life Technologies. This rally may well point to the prospect of bigger ones.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
122;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2013-05-21T23:21:42Z;M2M case study: Drug effectiveness receives boost;Patients with HIV need to take the right doses at the right times, writes Jessica Twentyman;It is almost impossible to know if someone is taking prescribed medicines correctly, or indeed if they are taking them at all.Many patients forget to take medicines at the right time or in the right doses and some will see any improvement in their symptoms – or no improvement at all – as a reason to abandon their treatment.In the medical profession, this failure to stick to a prescribed drug regime is referred to as non-adherence and it can have serious consequences for patient health.The World Health Organisation estimates non-adherence accounts for one in 10 hospital admissions worldwide.This is the problem that medical technology specialist Trxcare is trying to redress with a range of systems based on machine-to-machine technologies.The company supplies healthcare providers and drugs companies with smart dispensers – typically pill cases and inhalers – that contain an electronic monitor that records each time the device is used and a SIM card to send a message to Trxcare’s server using the Vodafone mobile phone network.Patients can use self-care apps running on smartphones and tablets to receive messages that remind them of missed doses and to prompt them to refill their dispensers.They can also receive reports on their adherence over the previous week and be alerted to upcoming appointments with their doctors.In the UK, Trxcare’s service is being used to deliver treatment to patients with HIV in partnership with pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences.HIV is a condition in which strict adherence to medication regimes, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (or Haart), is essential, says Andrew Donlon, Gilead’s UK-based associate director of HIV marketing.Mr Donlon says it is crucial patients adhere to their medication at least 95 per cent of the time.“One thing that is quite different with HIV, compared to other diseases, is that, if you only partially adhere to an HIV regimen, you have the potential to develop resistance to one or more drugs,” he explains. Resistance can mean the effectiveness of individual drugs, and potentially whole classes of drugs that might otherwise be used to fight the virus, may be compromised.Trxcare also provides dietary guidance on what foods HIV sufferers should eat alongside their medication, to aid absorption of chemicals in the drugs. Such services can be configured to meet the needs of patients with different illnesses around the globe, says Markus Glimm, Trxcare’s chief executive.The company is working on schemes for patients with Hepatitis C in the UK and with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Brazil.A version was developed for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Japan and an animated version supports young cystic fibrosis in Australia.Mr Glimm says pilot testing among 7,000 patients when the company was founded four years ago showed an average improvement in adherence rates of about 35 per cent.“Our conviction is that the more contact, dialogue, involvement and communication that clinicians have with patients, the more likely [patients] are to take their medication,” he says.
123;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2012-11-16T13:13:26Z;Letter from Lex – transitions;;After the US presidential election last week, it was China’s turn this week to orchestrate a smooth transition of power. The new seven-man (no women) Politburo Standing Committee at the centre of power of China’s Communist party is unlikely to bring radical reforms overnight: it may be too conservative for that. But at least the transition was a decisive move, unlike the pathetic mess of unintended consequences that the never-ending merger saga of Glencore and Xstrata has become ahead of Tuesday’s shareholder vote.Tough times, too, for the private equity industry, which is having to target the hoi polloi. US private equity giant KKR launched two new retail investor-focused funds covering high-yield credit and distressed opportunities. Diageo is finding opportunities in India with its purchase of up to 53 per cent of United Spirits for £1.3bn. Proving that mergers and acquisitions can offer real value, the shares of Gilead Sciences soared after its purchase of Pharmasset last year to acquire the HIV drug sofosbuvir appeared to pay off handsomely as the drug scored exceptionally well in clinical trials.Supermarket chains are starting to feel the effects of the tough battle for customers’ wallets. Choices, choices: is Target more attractive because of its focus on the US (the least sclerotic of the big developed economies) or should it be Walmart with its global presence. Ahold may also be feeling the effects of the European slowdown, but the Dutch group’s stronger balance sheet and cash flow may give it an edge. A share price surge for Abercrombie & Fitch, however, may have flattered: its failure to execute in its home market of the US makes its rapid international expansion look tenuous and unsustainable.BP has removed one of the clouds hanging over from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico accident with its $4.5bn settlement of criminal claims with the US authorities. As works in progress, though, the Italian banks take some beating – their third-quarter results offered few clues to how they intend to return to top-line growth.
124;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Actelion;Investors appear to be vindicated – all the drug has to do is deliver;Life-saving drugs can sometimes save drugmakers’ lives. That might be something of an overstatement in the case of Actelion, one of Europe’s biggest biotech companies by sales. But prospects for the Swiss-based group looked much brighter on Monday after it published positive results from late-stage clinical trials of its big new drug hope. This involves using macitentan to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in arteries connecting heart and lungs). Excited chief executive and former Roche scientist Jean-Paul Clozel says the company now plans regulatory filings for the product by the fourth quarter of 2012. Actelion shares jumped 15 per cent to SFr39.Progress could not be more timely. About 85 per cent of Actelion’s 2011 revenues came from its existing hypertension drug Tracleer, which faces patent expiration in 2015/2016 and is already under competitive pressure from Gilead Sciences’ Letairis. If all goes well, macitentan could even be co-promoted with selexipag, another potential PAH treatment well-advanced in Actelion’s pipeline, improving margins for both.Valuation, though, is tricky. Standard analysis would take discounted future earnings from existing drugs and add a probability-weighted valuation for the pipeline products. But even if regulatory risks to macitentan are much reduced, its commercial potential – and the ability to move Tracleer patients over to the new drug – needs to be proved. That said, JPMorgan suggests that removing a previous 60 per cent risk-adjustment off macitentan should add about SFr8 a share. And, with bigger drug companies keen to fill their own pipelines, bid talk could yet revive. At the very least, investors who backed management during last year’s recent bout of shareholder agitation appear to be vindicated.

125;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2012-02-17T15:44:43Z;Wall Street rally shrugs off Greek deadlock;;Investors shrugged off delays to a deal on bail-out funding for Greece to push US stocks to within touching distance of four-year highs.The S&P 500 index climbed 1.4 per cent over the week to close at 1,361.21, just five points shy of its post-crisis closing high reached last April.The benchmark US index has now climbed more than 100 points in 2012, the first time US stocks have ever clocked up a century points gain by mid-February, according to Standard and Poor’s Capital IQ.The previous best points return seven weeks into a year was 79 in 2010.Apparent deadlock in the Greek bail-out negotiations briefly threatened to derail the rally on Wednesday as the S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent for only the third time this year but a fall in jobless claims to near-four year lows on Thursday quickly focused investors back on the domestic economy.“Despite the histrionics in Europe, there is a sense on Wall Street that a Greek deal will be hammered out,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That means investors can focus above all else on US economic data, which for the most part suggest this recovery will be durable.”Apple shares broke above $500 a share for the first time, peaking at $526.29 on Thursday before sliding slightly as the company pulled the iPad 2 from Amazon China because of an ongoing trademark dispute, while mutual and exchange-traded funds appeared to sell the stock as its weighting exceeded maximum requirements for a single stock.Shares ended the week at $502.12, for a gain of 1.8 per cent, leaving the company $60bn clear of Exxon Mobil as the world’s largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation.Apple has contributed ten of the S&P 500’s 100-point rally in 2012, according to Bloomberg, while its results have also given a healthy glow to US corporate earnings.Were Apple’s results stripped out, Barclays Capital estimates earnings growth at S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results would be 2.9 per cent rather than 6.7 per cent.Mike Walkley, a tech analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said its shares could hit $665 within a year.“Apple appeals to growth investors because its share price performance has been strong but it also appeals to value investors as its still trading at a very modest multiple to earnings,” Mr Walkley said.Apple’s stellar start to the year has helped push the Nasdaq Composite index to 11-year highs and the index climbed another 1.7 per cent to 2,951.78 this week.That would have been even better were it not for a dip on Friday as shares in Gilead Sciences fell 14.6 per cent to $46.82.Gilead said the majority of hepatitis C sufferers enrolled in a trial of one of its treatments suffered relapses within four weeks of completing a 12-week course.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent over the week to 12,949.64, closing above 12,900 for the first time since 2008 on Thursday. But the transport sector of the index fell 0.3 per cent in what could be a bearish indicator for stocks: Dow theory suggests the transport sector leads the rest of the index, as it is the first to show signs of an economic slowdown.Yahoo shares fell 7 per cent to $15.01 after the internet portal company's attempts to sell its Asian assets appeared to break down on Tuesday, triggering a boardroom rebellion by activist investors.JPMorgan analysts, who had argued that a tax-free sale of stakes in companies such as Alibaba could yield a $20 share price bounce for Yahoo, expressed frustration at the drawn-out process.Doug Anmuth wrote in a note: “A taxed sale … remains possible – and we believe that may be better than doing nothing at all – but we think the board and management need to arrive at a conclusion in the near term so Yahoo can focus fully on its core business.”Financials had a mixed week. Bank of America fell 0.7 per cent to $8.02 for its first weekly loss in 2012 as at least two analysts said the bank no longer represented compelling value after its 44 per cent rally this year.John McDonald at Bernstein Research and Keith Horowitz at Citigroup both said investors will switch focus from BofA’s capital position, which has improved markedly, to its earnings potential, which remains subdued.Morgan Stanley also lost ground, falling 2.5 per cent to $19.16, after Moody’s, the rating agency, warned it could downgrade the investment bank’s debt by three notches.Citigroup was flat at $32.92 and JPMorgan Chase climbed 2.3 per cent to $38.47, although Moody’s put both banks on watch for two- notch downgrades.Devon Energy climbed 15.9 per cent to $74.95 after the oil and gas explorer said it would cut back investment on new exploration and also declared a smaller fourth-quarter loss than expected.Other oil and gas explorers also rallied as natural gas futures climbed to their highest level since January, easing pressure on margins.Chesapeake Energy was up 11.7 per cent to $24.71 and Cabot Oil & Gas rose 9.2 per cent to $36.64.
126;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2012-02-03T18:19:55Z;Big pharma tipped as tonic for investors;High-yielding multinationals offer balance of risk and return;Investors attracted to pharmaceuticals stocks as a source of growth are being advised to look beyond the “exceptional” gains from small takeover targets, to larger higher yielding multinationals.Speculation over renewed merger and acquisition (M&A) activity has boosted the share prices of several smaller US biopharmaceutical companies in recent weeks.In early January, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay $26 a share to gain control of hepatitis C drug developer Inhibitex – a 163 per cent premium to its share price before the deal. It led to an immediate jump in the share prices of two other groups – Idenix and Achillion – that are independently developing hepatitis C treatments. Since the Inhibitex deal, Merck & Co, the second-largest pharmaceutical company in the US, has said it is also considering acquisitions to boost its hepatitis C drug pipeline.HIV drug developers have attracted large takeover premiums as well, with Gilead Sciences paying $137 a share last November to take over biotech rival, Pharmasset – 89 per cent uplift on the market price, even though Pharmasset has no clinically-approved products as yet, and made a net loss of $91m in the year to September 30.Further stockpicking opportunities will arise “almost inevitably”, according to Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, as large pharma groups see “increasing opportunities to make selective acquisitions of specialist companies to further progress, as opposed to relying entirely on the R&D budget.”Jonathan Jackson, head of equities at Killik & Co agrees: “We do expect more consolidation, and clearly it is better to own the target than the predator given the takeover premium involved.”However, while attention has been focused on the takeover targets, shares in potential acquirers have also benefited from steady buying. In the past 12 months, the average return from the eight largest US pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies has been 34 per cent, according to Capital IQ.For UK private investors, analysts suggest that this may offer a better balance of risk and return. “Buying smaller companies tends to be a high-risk strategy,” says Hunter. “Should the company become an acquisition target, there is scope for some exceptional capital gain. A rather more sedate strategy would be to buy shares in the acquiring companies who, after all, should also benefit from the bolt-on acquisitions they have made. Blue-chip pharmaceuticals remain investments in their own right, due to their cash generation, prospects and dividend yields.”These fundamentals strengths are still not fully reflected in London-listed pharmaceuticals stocks, argues Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at broker The Share Centre. “GlaxoSmithKline offers a balanced investment for investors with an attractive yield for income seekers, currently around 4.5 per cent, but also the potential for longer term growth…[it] is a low risk investment and offers investors stability in a portfolio.”Risks remain, he acknowledges – not least the “long, expensive” process of drug discovery, and the launch of generic imitations when patents expire, which “can eat into revenues swiftly”. Hunter also notes the “recent lack of blockbuster drugs” from large pharma groups.Even so, Killik recommends a large-cap stock and a specialist fund to clients. “Although the stocks performed well in 2011, they are still attractively valued,” argues Jackson. He picks Sanofi as a direct holding, for its seven growth opportunities: emerging markets, vaccines, consumer healthcare, diabetes, animal health, rare diseases and innovative products. He notes that the shares, at €56, are trading at a discount to global peers’, and yielding 4.7 per cent – with pay-outs expected to rise for the next two years.His colleague Mick Gilligan picks out the International Biotechnology investment trust, which trades at a 15 per cent discount to its net assets – stakes in quoted and unquoted biotechnology companies – even though “performance in this sector has been strong”, and has driven the trust’s NAV higher in recent weeks.Hunter suggests using generalist funds with a high pharma exposure, rather than a specialist vehicle. “The likes of Bill Mott’s PSigma Income fund and Neil Woodford’s Invesco Perpetual High Income fund are well regarded, and both have significant weightings in global pharmaceutical companies: 18 per cent and 24 per cent respectively,” he says.Additional reporting by FT intern Maria Tadeo
127;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;US pharma: keep taking the tablets;Biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet than the pharma stocks;Time to get off the drugs? We’ve had a good time, after all. Over the past 12 months, the average return of the eight-largest US pure-play pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies by market value is a dizzy 34 per cent, according to Capital IQ, compared with the S&P 500’s buzz-killing 3 per cent. Before going cold turkey, keep a distinction in mind. The big eight fit in two broad categories. Pfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly are very slow-growing, dividend-paying pharma stocks. Amgen, Gilead, Celgene and Biogen Idec are big-cap biotechs that are expected to squeeze out solid single-to double digit sales growth over the next few years.For the more staid former cohort, there are two general explanations of the strong one-year performance (up 24 per cent). Big-cap dividend stocks across all sectors have had a great run. And the year before the four were flat as a group, while the S&P rallied mightily, rendering them cheap and paving the way for them to perform well simply by reverting to the mean. The big biotechs (up 45 per cent) have been driven more by specific product and pipeline successes, for example a new multiple sclerosis drug at Biogen, and one for osteoporosis at Amgen.The pharma stocks, then, have run up less and, except for Bristol-Myers, are cheaper than the biotech stocks. It would be a mistake to think that price-to-earnings multiples in the single digits are a signal of low risk, however. As drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, Bristol’s Plavix, Lilly’s Zyprexa and Merck’s Singulair lose patent protection, revenues are expected to fall at all four companies over the next few years. The big pharmas will rely on their pipelines or acquisitions to turn things around – a chancy business either way. The biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet.

128;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2012-01-26T18:09:39Z;Illumina adopts ‘poison pill’ against Roche;;US diagnostics company Illumina has moved to fend off Roche’s $5.7bn hostile takeover bid by announcing that it will adopt a “poison pill” to protect its shareholders.Through the rights agreement, Illumina shareholders can buy new common stock if a bidder acquires 15 per cent of the company’s shares. The move is intended to deter Roche, the swiss drugmaker, or other potential acquirers by making Illumina more expensive to acquire.“The Illumina board has taken this action to ensure that our stockholders receive fair treatment and protection in connection with any proposal or offer to acquire the company, including the proposal announced by Roche,” said Jay Flatley, Illumina’s chief executive.The bid for Illumina comes as dealmaking in the healthcare sector has proved resilient amid the economic slump. Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies are doing deals as they try to replace revenues lost from drugs coming off patent and to establish their position in emerging treatment and diagnostic areas.In a second high profile healthcare deal this week, Amgen of the US on Thursday unveiled a $1.16bn agreed takeover of Micromet, a biotechnology business founded in Germany with a leading experimental cancer compound and a broader technology with scope for a wider range of treatments.The $11 per share cash offer gives Amgen control of Micromet’s experimental drug Blinatumomab, currently in mid-stage clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with scope for a range of other diseases. Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s head of R&D, said: “Our goal is to bring new therapies to patients in need. These are rare assets, and we have enormous confidence in our freedom to operate with them.”Separately on Thursday, Celgene, another US biotech group that specialises in cancer therapies, said it is acquiring Avila Therapeutics for $350m in cash plus another $575m pending the development of some of its drug candidates. Avila is developing promising drugs to “silence” problematic proteins associated with diseases.This news follows an uptick in dealmaking activity in the sector that started late last year.Gilead Sciences, the US biotechnology company which pioneered treatments for HIV, last November said it would buy fellow biotech Pharmasset for about $11bn, a sizeable bet on the fast-developing market for oral remedies for the treatment of hepatitis C. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which faces losing patent protection on several top-selling drugs, followed suit in January agreeing to buy Inhibitex for $2.5bn, another developer of new treatments for hepatitis C.Both deals were struck at substantial premiums to the target’s stock price – something advisers say is typical in a sector where the value of emerging technology and drugs in testing and development has yet to be fully established.Illumina’s decision to put in place a poison pill, which was announced on Thursday, suggests the company’s board is intent on forcing Roche to pay a higher price for the company. Illumina’s shares are already trading substantially above Roche’s $44.50 cash offer, although they slipped 2.85 per cent to $53.51 on Thursday.Industry advisers were this week doubtful that a counterbidder would emerge for Illumina, given Roche’s reputation and previous success in launching hostile bids and its financial firepower.
129;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-12-23T17:37:57Z;J&J opts out of HIV rights sharing pool;;Johnson & Johnson has rejected calls to offer patent rights on its HIV medicines to generic drug companies through a “pool” designed to boost research and affordable access for patients. It has warned that the approach could set back treatment progress by years.Paul Stoffels, worldwide head of pharmaceuticals at J&J, the US healthcare group, and a doctor with experience of treating patients in Africa, cautioned that the pool could trigger a “mixing and matching” of medicines that would cause a rapid surge in patient resistance to innovative HIV drugs.He told the Financial Times: “We want the right therapy at the right time. We will not get there by leasing our intellectual property to all companies, throwing our drugs on the market without any guidance or control. That would cause a huge disaster.”His decision – condemned by health activists – is a rare case of public defiance among companies working on HIV, a number of which have privately expressed concerns over the patent pool but sought to avoid a resurgence of criticism damaging to their image.Médecins sans Frontières said: “By saying no to the Medicines Patent Pool, Johnson & Johnson today made a conscious, wilful decision to turn its back on people living with HIV in the developing world.”The Medicines Patent Pool, backed by government donors and a focus of lobbying by HIV advocates over several years, creates a mechanism designed to promote lower-cost sales in poorer countries and the development of new combinations of drugs and reformulations suitable for children or hotter and more humid climates.The organisation, discussed since 2008, was formally created as a Swiss foundation last year with an budget this year of $4m. It says it is in talks with companies holding intellectual property on antiretroviral drugs for HIV including Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, Sequoia Pharmaceuticals and ViiV Healthcare.It has so far only signed up Gilead of the US, which had already independently agreed a series of bilateral deals with generic drug companies. Since joining the Medicines Patent Pool last summer, it has offered slightly improved terms, lowering royalties and expanding the number of countries in which it is willing to authorise others to sell its drugs.J&J, as well as Abbott and Merck, have refused to enter discussions with the Medicines Patent Pool, while some generic companies have argued they have no incentive to become involved unless it extends to more profitable middle-income countries – where the drug developers want to retain their patent rights.Mr Stoffels stressed J&J was ensuring its drugs were available at low cost in developing countries, but that it preferred to agree bilateral licences with generic companies to ensure adequate quality and monitoring of use.Ellen ‘t Hoen, head of the Medicines Patent Pool, said: “We are not concerned, but disappointed J&J came to the conclusion they are still not ready to make the jump.” She said the Medicines Patent Pool would be stronger if every company participated, and she was expecting “good news” next year from others. She added the Medicines Patent Pool allowed negotiation on terms that could meet J&J’s demands.
130;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-12-16T20:29:35Z;US to rule on preventive use of HIV drug;;US regulators are to consider a groundbreaking – but potentially controversial – new application to use an HIV medicine as a way to prevent healthy people from becoming infected with the lethal virus.Gilead, the California-based pharmaceutical group, has filed with the Food and Drug Administration for a new authorised “indication” for “pre-exposure prophylactic” – or prep – use of Truvada, its pill that is currently the backbone of HIV treatment around the world.If authorised, it could substantially boost efforts to reduce the risk from a disease that continues to infect nearly 2.7m people a year around the world and kill 1.8m, and prove a sizeable boost for Gilead’s sales.However, it also risks undermining the effectiveness of Truvada for existing patients, weakening existing prevention efforts, and could even trigger legal actions against the company from those currently without HIV who experience side effects or become infected.Tenofovir, one of two drugs in the once-daily Truvada pill sold by Gilead, is already widely authorised by international regulators and used by nearly 3m people living with HIV around the world, generating more than $6.3bn in sales for the company last year alone.But in recent years, several studies have highlighted its additional potential for prevention, both by reducing the risk of patients with HIV transmitting the virus to others, and by reducing the risk of those without HIV becoming infected if they take the drug.The two most significant clinical trials submitted this week to US regulators showed that Truvada reduced the risk of contracting HIV in men who have sex with men by 44 per cent, and by 73 per cent among heterosexual couples when one of the partners was already infected.John Martin, Gilead’s chief executive, said: “The data from these large-scale clinical trials suggest that Truvada may have a role to play in meeting the urgent public health need to reduce new HIV infections.”Criticisms which regulators will have to debate including the argument that wider use of Truvada could trigger the development and spread of a form of HIV resistant to the pill, undermining its use as a therapy particularly if it is only taken intermittently. Evidence of resistance in the two trials was very limited.Others have suggested that those without HIV taking the pill could be “disinhibited”, taking greater risks and abandoning other practices which sharply cut the likelihood of infection such as the use of condoms.Mitchell Warren, head of Avac, an advocacy group, welcomed Gilead’s decision to seek approval, while cautioning the drug would need to be prescribed with broader preventive advice. “Prep is not just a pill.”The Aids Healthcare Foundation, a US-based HIV treatment and advocacy group, cautioned this autumn that preventive use should not be pursued “at the risk of contributing to, rather than controlling, the epidemic”.For those on low incomes in developing countries and with inadequate health insurance, including in the US, Truvada’s preventive use could also create fresh ethical problems, with tensions between patients and those without HIV both seeking access to the medicine.
131;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-11-27T18:42:44Z;Vertex: competition fears hit hard;It has other products in its pipeline to go along with one that dominates the market;The stock market’s motto is not: “What have you done for me lately?” It is more: “What will you do for me tomorrow?” Current success is quickly discounted in favour of future possibilities. In the case of US biotech company Vertex, this has been taken to an extreme.Vertex reported $660m in sales and $150m in net profits in its last quarter, against $24m in sales and a steep loss a year ago.The difference is Incivek, its new protease inhibitor for hepatitis C infection, which generated $420m in North American sales. (Johnson & Johnson has European rights to the drug.) Incivek has taken 80 per cent of the protease inhibitor market, leaving Merck’s Victrelis with the scraps.Analysts expect the winning streak to continue, estimating $2.5bn in sales and earnings per share of more than $5 for Vertex next year.All this prosperity makes what has happened to the company’s share price remarkable: it has fallen by more than a half from its May peak and, at $27 now, amounts to six times 2012 earnings.The shadow of future competition has fallen heavily on Vertex. Pharmasset, which has a hepatitis C product in clinical trials, has just been bought at a huge premium by Gilead. Others are piling into this so far under-penetrated market, too. Giants such as Johnson & Johnson, Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb, along with start-ups including Inhibitex, Achillion and Idenix, all have potential rivals to Incivek in the clinic.Competition is a particular threat because a course of Incivek, which costs about $50,000, frequently leads to a cure. So new patients must be won to maintain sales.But Vertex has other products in its pipeline to go along with a product that works well and dominates the market, while the competition still has to prove itself in the laboratory.Another good slogan worth remembering: “A bird in hand is worth 10 in the bush.”Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
132;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-11-25T20:20:23Z;US financials hit amid steep falls;;Sharp drops for energy and financial groups led the worst week on Wall Street in two months as investors reeled amid European sovereign woes and the collapse of US budget deficit talks.The S&P 500 index fell 4.7 per cent on the week after breaking below its 50-day moving average during trading on Monday.The break triggered further selling and the index ended at a six-week low of 1,158.67 by close on Friday. It was the worst performance for the S&P during the Thanksgiving holiday week since 1941, according to Bespoke Investment Group.“Investors are shooting first and in liquidation mode and year-end balance sheet considerations are likely to make matters worse in coming weeks,” said Richard Gilhooly, strategist at TD Securities.Over the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 4.8 per cent to 11,231.94, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off by 5.1 per cent to 2,441.58.The week began with the “ supercommittee” group of US lawmakers, tasked with agreeing a new budget plan to forestall automatic cuts of more than $1,000bn next year, abandoning their talks.But rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch all said they would not alter their US sovereign credit ratings.Most of the action took place on Wednesday when the benchmark US index slumped 2.2 per cent after investors shunned an auction of German government bonds.The week’s decline was led by energy groups, which fell 6.2 per cent on the week as Brent crude fell to its lowest level since early October.Financials fell 5.7 per cent as the Federal Reserve announced plans to restart stress tests of US banks, testing their ability to withstand 13 per cent unemployment and a 6.9 per cent fall in eurozone gross domestic product.Bank of America dropped 10.5 per cent over the week to $5.17, having touched $5.11 on Wednesday, its lowest level since March 2009. The cost of insuring its debts against default also rose to an all-time high.However, shares in Jefferies, the investment bank that has been scrutinised since the fall of MF Global in October, rebounded. They ended 4.9 per cent higher at $10.66.The company’s chief executive published a letter responding to what he termed “outright lies” about the bank’s European exposure. Analysts at Oppenheimer agreed that claims the bank needed to raise fresh capital were “just flat out wrong”.“Jefferies telegraphed broader worries about financials and took its turn as the one in the spotlight,” said Bernard McDevitt, vice-president of institutional trading at Cheevers & Company. “It all comes down to uncertainty about the impact of Europe on the banking system.”Meanwhile, recently listed web companies were hit hard by investor fears that the tactic of floating small numbers of shares in initial public offerings could lead to sharp price declines.LinkedIn, the social network, and Fusion-io, a “cloud” computing group, both did large secondary offerings this month ahead of the end of six-month restrictions on insider share sales – standard after an initial public offering.LinkedIn fell 12.4 per cent on the week to $63.08, matching its lowest price since it began trading in May. Fusion-io fell 25.8 per cent to $29.38, below its IPO price of $33. As the sector was sold off, Groupon, the online coupon seller, fell 36 per cent to $16.75, below its own IPO price of $20.Consumer staples groups were the best performers on the week, falling just 2.3 per cent. Walmart, the discount retailer, was down just 0.6 per cent to $56.89 after reporting strong crowds on “Black Friday”, the day after Thanksgiving and the traditional beginning of the US holiday shopping season.Netflix ended the week down 18.2 per cent to $63.85, well off the $300 level it was trading at earlier this year. This sell-off came after the web streaming and DVD delivery company said it would raise $400m in new capital, diluting existing shareholders by 10 per cent.Hewlett-Packard, the PC maker, ended the week off 9.3 per cent to $25.39 after chief executive Meg Whitman said the company only expected to achieve earnings per share of $4 in fiscal 2012. A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected but the scale took analysts by surprise.Apple outperformed the market on the week, off 3 per cent to $363.57, after analysts at Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research groups have suggested.Gilead Sciences bounced back from a fall of more than 10 per cent on Monday when investors had baulked at the $11bn pricetag it had agreed to pay for Pharmasett, the maker of a hepatitis C treatment. The shares were down 1.5 per cent to $39.28.John Deere, the farming equipment maker, ended the week lower just 0.8 per cent to $73.64 after easily beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of $1.62.

the second quarter of this year.“The company has been buying its own stock high and is now selling it low. It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65. The computer maker fell as low $25.25 in early trading as investors reacted with dismay to the company’s pessimistic outlook for 2012.A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected, but the scale took analysts by surprise: new chief executive Meg Whitman predicted full-year earnings per share of $4, well below the $4.56 median analyst prediction, with the company downbeat on both consumer and business demand.Jeffrey Fidacaro, a computer analyst at Susquehanna, said HP had at least frontloaded bad news.”We believe this could provide a conservative floor to prudently set up the stock for estimate increases from here,” he told clients.Strong earnings boosted Medtronic. Shares in the medical research group surged 4.5 per cent to $34.75, after profits for the quarter ended October 28 jumped 50 per cent compared with the same period in 2010.Declining soup sales knocked Campbell’s, which fell 5.3 per cent to $31.84, as quarterly profits fell 4 per cent year on year.Starwood Hotels and Resorts slipped 4.7 per cent to $45.39 after Nomura analyst Harry Curtis, lowered earnings estimates, citing the company’s strong exposure to Europe. Starwood derives as much as 12 per cent of total earnings from the continent, twice as much as rivals such as Marriott International.Nvidia continued to benefit from widespread reports that it will supply semiconductors for the next generation of Apple MacBooks. Shares rose 3.1 per cent to $15.08 putting the stock up 8.3 per cent for the week, and only 3 per cent off for the year.Fellow semiconductor stock Analog Devices fell 3 per cent $33.32, after the company revealed the extent of the fall in orders through the third quarter.Gilead Sciences bounced back somewhat from its 10 per cent fall on Monday, as investors got over the initial shock of the $11bn price tag it agreed to pay for Pharmasset.The stock traded 6.9 per cent higher at $38.76, as analysts weighed up the long-term potential of the acquisition. “We believe that this makes a lot of sense and will provide Gilead with a highly synergistic asset with a very long tail,” Yaron Werber at Citigroup wrote to clients.Groupon fell 14.9 per cent to $20.07, within touching distance of its $20 debut price, with options traders buying puts for the right to sell the stock for as little as $13.Gold miner Newmont Mining prospered in market volatility yet again, up
0.8 per cent to $65.79, with bearish investors possibly seeking exposure to gold.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, but the big US banks avoided hefty losses.Jefferies, whose European exposures and funding model have come in for intense scrutiny, was down 1.4 per cent to $10.06.The IntercontinentalExchange was up 1.5 per cent to $115.91, as the derivatives exchange benefited from negative sentiment towards its larger rival the CME Group.The CME was partially responsible for regulating MF Global, the broker-dealer which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the month.

Pharmasset shares surged 84.6 per cent to $134.14.“This deal could see a step change in the treatment of Hep C, but the valuation is the rub,” said Maged Shenouda, healthcare analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “You can make the numbers work, but it’s going to take a long time.”Every member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the red, as the index fell 2.1 per cent to 11,479.5.Hewlett-Packard fell 4 per cent to $26.86 ahead of quarterly results due after the bell. Jason Nyoland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, said the largest computer maker would probably cut its fiscal 2012 forecast.Chevron lost 2.3 per cent to $95.66 in anticipation of a hefty fine for an oil spill from a rig off Brazil’s coast, which has been leaking for more than a week. Transocean, the company hired by Chevron to drill the leaking well, was down 4.1 per cent to $45.53.Both companies may face possible restrictions on future activity in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro state, according to comments attributed to government and state officials.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.6 per cent to 2,505.96.Not all investors were in panic mode, however.“Inaction by politicians is priced into the market,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Tulsa-based Capitol Advisors, in response to the supercommittee’s travails. “And I think the budget deficit here poses less of an urgent threat than Europe’s debt crisis.”The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2.7 per cent with big US banks once again in the spotlight. Bank of America fell 5 per cent to $5.49, and Citigroup was off 4.9 per cent to $25.00.Jefferies shares closed up 0.4 per cent to $10.20, after the investment bank released a statement attacking “half-truths, false rumours and lies”, as investors zeroed in on its dependence on short-term funding.Jefferies finances part of its inventory by pledging securities in return for cash via repurchase agreements with other banks.Separately, Glen Schorr, Nomura analyst, warned that ratings downgrades could be in the pipeline for US banks as Standard & Poor’s implements a new ratings methodology, which focuses on the role of governments and central banks in system-wide funding.Highly-cyclical material stocks led the broader market sell-off, as a senior Chinese official said the world economy would slump into long-term recession.Steel stocks were especially hard hit after Matthew Cross, Nomura analyst, said a slowdown in investment in new housing in China would sap global demand for steel.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for the manufacture of steel, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.26. AK Steel Holding Corp fell 4.8 per cent to $8.01 and United States Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $24.50.Shares in Alleghany were down 6.7 per cent to $293.01 after the US insurer said it would buy Transatlantic Holdings for $3.4bn in cash and stock, ending a lengthy battle over the reinsurer.Alleghany will pay $59.79 per share, a premium of about 10 per cent to Transatlantic’s Friday closing price of $54.53. Transatlantic shares were up 0.8 per cent to $54.84.Several tech stocks new to the market were also caught in the crosshairs, notable property search group Zillow, which fell 13.1 per cent to $23.52.Russian search engine Yandex fell 8.9 per cent to $19.72 and Groupon fell 10 per cent to $23.56 – nearing its $20 debut price.Semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia Corp was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 5 per cent to $14.63 on reports that it would supply components for the next generation of Apple MacBooks.
135;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
136;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-11-21T22:06:54Z;Gilead acquires Pharmasset for $11bn;;Gilead, the US pharmaceutical company, has agreed to buy Pharmasset in an $11bn cash deal designed to diversify away from HIV drugs and give it a lead in the fast-growing market for hepatitis C medicines.The deal, Gilead’s largest acquisition to date, values Pharmasset at $137 a share, an 89 per cent premium above its closing share price on Friday, and a 59 per cent premium to its all-time high closing price. It far exceeds Gilead’s previous acquisitions, including Myogen, bought for $2.5bn in 2006 and CV Therapeutics, bought for $1.4bn in 2009.Gilead shares closed down 9.08 per cent at $36.26 on concern the price was too high for a company not expected to generate profits for two years. Pharmasset’s shares rose 84.59 per cent to $134.14“While we understand the strategic rationale, the price tag is lofty for a pre-commercial asset and not aligned with what we would like to see from Gilead in terms of capital allocation,” said Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Leerink Swann.Pharmasset is developing oral drugs for hepatitis C, which Gilead expects to become important as patients switch from existing inconvenient therapies which must be taken more regularly, require injection and have significant side effects.The purchase – one of the largest in the drugs sector in recent months – will strengthen the company’s position in the fast-developing field and reflects a strategy it has used to become one of the leading producers of HIV treatments, including tenofovir.“The acquisition of Pharmasset represents an important and exciting opportunity to accelerate Gilead’s effort to change the treatment paradigm for HCV-infected patients by developing all-oral regimens for the treatment of the disease regardless of viral genotype,” said John Martin, Gilead’s chief executive.A number of leading drug companies are investing heavily in the treatment of hepatitis C as the market moves towards a once-a-day oral cure, rather than the cocktail of medicines currently used to control the disease. Merck, Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Vertex are among those targeting the market.Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes the liver to swell. Gilead said estimated global HCV prevalence was 160m people, including 12m infected in major markets, while only 200,000 patients are currently treated. According to the US National Institute of Health, the disease affects about 1.5 per cent of the US population.The deal consolidates Gilead’s own hepatitis treatments with two approved medicines and a further half a dozen in its pipeline. Pharmasset has three hepatitis C drugs undergoing clinical trials, including one in a partnership with Roche. Schaefer Price, the company’s chief executive, said Gilead’s marketing and antiviral drug development expertise would make the acquisition a good fit.The company said the deal would be dilutive to earnings until 2014 and accretive from the following year. It will temporarily suspend its share repurchases and fund the transaction with cash and additional borrowings.Les Funtleyder, an analyst and fund manager at Miller Tabak, said some investors find the deal risky because it is dependent on the success of clinical trials. “Many people are reading this as an act of desperation for Gilead, meaning that maybe their pipeline wasn’t really so great,” Mr Funtleyder said.Barclays Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Gilead on the deal and provided $6.2bn in new debt financing. Morgan Stanley advised Pharmasset.
137;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-11-21T18:15:37Z;Gilead-Pharmasset: side effects;Acquisition has considerable advantages in spite of its mind-boggling price;Here’s a phrase Gilead shareholders probably did not particularly enjoy reading on Monday morning, in the press release about their company’s $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset: “accretive in 2015 and beyond.” The “and beyond” bit is especially dispiriting. When a company spends the equivalent of a third of its enterprise value, and for its money will not get an actual marketed product for at least three years, the effects are predictable – Gilead’s stock fell by more than a 10th.But holders of Gilead stock should have known what they were in for. Here is a company with $5bn in gross cash on its balance sheet, 50 per cent operating margins and excellent cash flow, but which depends on a portfolio of drugs for HIV with slowing sales growth and patents beginning to expire in the middle of this decade. These drugs are simply too big to replace with internally developed products. Something had to be done.The Pharmasset acquisition, despite its mind-boggling price tag, is not simply a desperate or overpriced deal. It has considerable advantages. The market for hepatitis C drugs, on which Pharmasset focuses, is huge (9m patients in the US and European Union alone) and under-penetrated. Most patients are undiagnosed, untreated, or both. US rival Vertex sold $420m of its hepatitis C product in the most recent quarter – which it only launched in May. The potential helps offset two big risks: that a side-effect problem for the main pipeline product, PSI-7977, shows up in late-stage trials, and that one of the hundreds of hepatitis C drugs now in development is even better than 7977’s impressive clinical results. It is hard to assess the balance of risk and reward in Gilead’s gamble. The salient point for investors in all maturing pharma and biotech companies is how high the stakes are for any company that wants to stay in the game.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
138;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Biogen Idec: waking from the dream;It had the all the attributes of a great pharma value stock but it no longer checks the value box;"The stock investors’ dream is a company whose risks are diminishing while its return potential is growing. Biogen Idec has been just such a company recently. As a result it is the best-performing large capitalisation healthcare stock in the world year-to-date, according to Capital IQ. The shares have risen by over two-thirds.On the risk side, revenues of Biogen’s fastest-growing drug, the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri, have come to look much more sustainable. Investors and patients had been focused on the small risk of dangerous infections that accompanies use of the drug. But increased availability of a test for a virus implicated in the infections has made it possible for patients to gauge the risks ahead of time.More importantly, Biogen’s key pipeline product, BG-12 for MS, has had strong late-stage clinical results. It is delivered orally rather than by injection, making it easier to use, and it appears to be safer than the only other oral MS drug currently available, Novartis’s Gilenya. Credit Suisse estimates annual sales of the drug could be $3bn; Bernstein reckons $4.2bn. Significant figures, given that Biogen has a bit over $5bn in annual revenues currently.Risks have not disappeared: safety data about both BG-12 and Tysabri will continue to roll in, for better or worse. And MS patients and their doctors are notoriously careful about switching to new treatments, so adoption of BG-12 may be slow, if it is approved. Biogen’s shares trade at a significant premium to its big biotech peers such as Gilead and Amgen, suggesting that much of the upside from BG-12 and Tysabri is priced in.Biogen a year ago had the all the attributes of a great pharma value stock: products addressing serious medical needs, an innovation-driven growth story, and a low valuation. It no longer checks the last box.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

Bank of America closed at $7.40 and Citigroup at $29.94. Overall, financial stocks were down almost 2 per cent.Although the stock market has calmed this week, the S&P 500 index remains more than 5 per cent down for the year.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 0.7 per cent at 11405.93 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 2523.45.Consumer staples was the only sector of the S&P 500 not to record a fall, thanks to strong earnings reports from large US retailers.Home Depot led a small group of advancers in the S&P 500, gaining 5.3 per cent to close at $33.12.The housing goods retailer earned 86 cents a share versus forecasts of 82.4 cents and raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $2.34 per share from $2.24.Frank Blake, chief executive, was cautious, saying strong sales were driven in part by a one-time boost due to floods and storms throughout the US during the second quarter.David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets said Home Depot had benefited from weak results announced by its rival Lowe’s yesterday. Mr Stresser expects the company to continue to gain market share from its rival.Walmart also beat earnings forecasts to report $1.09 a share compared with expectations of $1.08. Its shares added 3.9 per cent to end the day at $51.92.Though Walmart’s same-store sales declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and its chief executive warned of pressures on customers, it raised its 2012 earnings guidance to as much as $4.51 a share from $4.41.Barclays Capital’s Robert Drbul, whose target price of $62 a share is above the Wall Street consensus, said the company’s proved ability to deliver cost savings more than made up for falling same-store sales.But shares of Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer, fell 6.3 per cent to $27.84 after same-store sales declined versus a year ago, the largest non-financial decline on the S&P 500.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets lowered their price target on Urban Outfitters from $38 to $35 a share but still recommended holding the shares, saying they “continued to view [it] as an attractive turnround story”.Marshall Edwards, the San Diego-based medical company, was the biggest gainer of the Nasdaq Composite index. Its shares rose almost 40 per cent to $1.91 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its application to trial a new cancer drug.Gilead Sciences was up 4.2 per cent to $38.85. Analysts at JPMorgan said the shares were “de-risked” following the approval of a new drug and strong testing results for another. They said the current price did not reflect the potential of those two drugs, which could result in as much as $23 a share’s worth of earnings.Shares in Google continued to fall after its announcement of a $12.5bn bid for Motorola Mobility, slipping 3.3 per cent to $539.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research cut Google to sell from buy recommendation, and reduced its target price to $500, arguing “the purchase of [Motorola Mobility] would negatively impact growth, margins and balance sheet.”Mobility’s shares closed at $38.02, close to Google’s $40-a-share bid.Stock in Sprint rose for a second day. The telecoms group was up 3.2 per cent at $3.59 amid speculation that Google might seek to acquire a network, as well as a handset manufacturer.News Corp shares gained 1.4 per cent to close at $17.14. But earlier in the day they had traded close to the $18 last seen before phone hacking allegations in the UK engulfed the company. Allegations resurfaced in London in the afternoon, reversing the shares’ rise.
140;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-07-13T21:47:34Z;Gilead agrees to ease HIV patents;;One of the world’s largest developers of HIV treatments has become the first pharmaceutical company to relinquish wide-ranging rights on its patented drugs to generic producers, easing efforts to make these medicines available to the poor.Gilead, based in California, has assigned control of several of its current and experimental medicines in the developing world to the Medicines Patent Pool, a Geneva-based foundation, which seeks to stimulate the availability of low cost and new formulations of life-saving drugs.Ellen ‘t Hoen, executive director of the Patent Pool, said: “Today marks a milestone in managing patents for public health. The licence agreement with Gilead Sciences will help make medicines available at a lower-cost and in easier to use formulations without delays.”Under the terms of the deal, Gilead will allow generic rivals based in India to produce cheaper versions of its medicines for Hepatitis B and HIV including tenofovir, one of the most widely used medicines for HIV treatment, in exchange for royalties of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent.The move follows several years of negotiations with the Pool and health agencies, which have long claimed that high prices and the difficulty of negotiating patent rights have hindered patient access to new drugs.Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of Unitaid, the multilateral funder which has helped finance the Pool, said: “Pharmaceutical companies have not become saints, but they are changing.”However, the new agreement will not have any immediate impact because drugs such as Gilead’s tenofovir need to be used in combination with medicines from other companies who have yet to sign up to the pool. The licenses are limited to producers in India and exclude the rights to sell the drugs in many middle-income countries including China and Brazil, where Gilead retains all commercial rights over its medicines. Under the terms of the license, generic manufacturers must also grant Gilead free rights to any innovations they contribute with the drugs, including more efficient production techniques.Gilead has agreed bilateral licensing deals for tenofovir with 13 Indian producers and on Wednesday unveiled its agreements with four companies. These deals raised questions over the need for the Patent Pool, which will charge a 5 per cent fee on the royalties paid through its system.Yusuf Hamied, head of Cipla, one of the largest Indian generic drug makers, said: “If this license is fair, reasonable and equitable, we will accept it.” But he cautioned that it would still typically take five to six years from the granting of patents via the pool to the development and regulatory approval of new formulations by Indian companies.About 7m people currently receive HIV medicines but the UN last month agreed to try to double this number by 2015.
141;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-07-13T16:55:50Z;HIV drug sharply cuts infection risk;;A medicine used to treat patients with HIV can cut the risk of transmission to their uninfected heterosexual partners by at least three-fifths, according to a study that will sharply boost calls for the use of drugs to prevent the spread of the virus.A clinical trial by the University of Washington in people at high risk of infection in Kenya and Uganda showed that those who took a daily prophylactic dose of the drug tenofovir had 62 per cent fewer infections than those on a placebo. Those taking a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine had 73 per cent fewer infections.A separate study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Botswana showed that the two drugs in combination in uninfected heterosexual couples cut the risk of HIV by 63 per cent.The data, released ahead of the International Aids Society conference in Rome next week, will reinforce the findings of other recent studies showing the effectiveness of the treatment in cutting the risk of infections in gay men, and in women who use it as a vaginal microbicide gel.It will underline calls from doctors and health activists who have been appealing for rapid expansion in use of the treatment, against a backdrop of research suggesting that providing medicine earlier after infection helps reduce the risk of transmission to others.“This is a major scientific breakthrough which reconfirms the essential role that antiretroviral medicine has to play in the Aids response,” said Michel Sidibé, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids. “These studies could help us to reach the tipping point in the HIV epidemic.”With 2.6m people newly infected with HIV each year, 33.3m living with the virus, and only 7m receiving treatment, public health specialists have been keen to identify ways to fight the disease.The latest results will provide a fresh boost to Gilead, the US pharmaceutical company that developed tenofovir, which is now used in one of the most widely adopted drug regimes to treat HIV around the world.However, apart from the short-term costs of a substantial rise in use of the drug, there are concerns over whether the use of tenofovir for prevention could undermine its effect in treatment by provoking resistance. Many individuals may also prove reluctant to take the drug daily and risk side effects if they are not infected.
142;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-05-23T20:51:00Z;Business diary: John Martin;;As chief executive of the US’s Gilead, John Martin is one of the few big drug company heads with a research scientist background. One of the top 10 global pharmaceuticals companies by market capitalisation, Gilead’s income includes royalties on Tamiflu, and Viread for HIV patients. Mr Martin is based in San Francisco.● I never live more than 10 minutes from the office. I wake at 5am because the east coast has already been working for three hours and Europe is close to the end of the day. I go through e-mails on my iPad before I get out of bed, then I drive to work, making calls on the way.I have breakfast at 7.30am in the cafeteria, where I end up talking to lots of people – we are a very informal company. We have free bagels every Wednesday but I limit myself to two a year.● I travel so much that usually I spend only half my time at our head office and, over the past year, it was closer to 30 per cent. However, it’s easy to keep in touch and I’m on the phone a lot.Recently, I was travelling for four weeks with just one day back in the office. I flew to a policymakers’ conference in the UK on HIV funding, after spending several days in Thailand for a scientific meeting on liver disease.After dinner one evening in Bangkok, I went back to my hotel to attend a board meeting by phone from midnight to 2am to approve our purchase of Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, the Seattle-based biotech. Then I flew to Boston for a scientific meeting on HIV, back to San Francisco, and then to our manufacturing plant in Ireland.● With so many opportunities to meet people at the top of the field, it’s fairly easy to keep up with what is happening in our sector.I have an iPad and an iPhone – we have a technology culture at Gilead that may be surprising considering the generation we are from. We don’t even mind if people e-mail during meetings – you can’t stop it, so you might as well allow it. A lot of people take notes on iPads. Some use PowerPoint but I don’t like to sit through something for half an hour if I can read it in three minutes, so they send the presentation in advance.● There is an enormous amount of reading and I spend time in the evening catching up. I’m not around the lab much these days, though – it has been years since I worked in one and I would be viewed as dangerous.● My day is less than 50 per cent structured meetings. The other time I spend doing paperwork, talking to people informally. The number one thing someone in my position does is deal with people issues: who does what, how to turn things round if needed, how to stay focused on the right things.Gilead is a very lean organisation, which means I need to communicate a lot. As well as outsourcing most of our manufacturing, we rely on outside advice and information in many areas – it makes for a lot of dinners.● We feel strongly that it’s important not to build a lot of infrastructure. It’s like the game Whac-a-Mole: you club one and it pops up elsewhere. When people talk about expansion, we ask if it is really necessary. It’s rarely true that you save money by doing things internally.● One of the biggest lessons I have learnt is that there is a regular interval at which different parts of the company go through change, typically every 18 months. Often the volume of decisions grows, there are changes to the type and complexity of work ahead of us, and we need to bring in more people. Then productivity per person goes down for a period, until people come up to speed, volume increases again, and it’s not workable any more. I have made people suffer with my unique drawings on the whiteboard in my office, and this is one of the graphs I often draw to depict the cycle. Periodically, we need to think about if we should operate differently.● In our industry, you need excellent scientific capabilities inside and a track record so potential parties will trust you. We need to be able to work with others. When your R&D budget is far less than 1 per cent of what is spent globally on medical research, the odds are so far against you developing drugs in-house that you have to work with others.
143;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-05-17T20:52:31Z;Roche and Merck tie up on hepatitis treatment;;Roche has formed a partnership with its US rival Merck to commercialise and develop worldwide the treatments and diagnostics for Hepatitis C.The Swiss pharmaceuticals company said it would initially co-market in the US Merck’s treatment Victrelis, known generically as boceprevir, alongside its own drug Pegasys and its related diagnostic PaqMan.Separately, the two companies will in future agree to share the costs of clinical trials testing combinations of their experimental Hepatitis C medicines, reflecting the need to use a “cocktail” of different drugs for effective treatment.Chronic Hepatitis C is a serious viral infection estimated to affect more than 3m Americans and killing 12,000 a year.Studies suggest a significant proportion of patients can be cured using a triple combination, such as the two companies’ drugs plus an off-patent drug called ribavirin.The Merck-Roche partnership represents the latest in a series of intensifying efforts by drug companies to share the costs and risks of medicine development, and moves to share the costs of marketing.It follows the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration last week of Victrelis, which Merck has said it plans to sell in the US for a wholesale price of $1,100 per week, with treatment typically lasting up to 44 weeks. It has applied for regulatory approval in Europe.The deal comes at a time when investors have expressed doubts over the value of Merck’s own equivalent of Pegasys, called Peg-Intron. The tie-up strengthens the US company’s potential in the market for Hepatitis C ahead of the expected launch of a competitor from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, analysts said.“With Roche on board, this potential shortcoming [with Peg-Intron] gets more than removed, in our opinion,” said Bernstein in a research note.GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer have created a joint venture called ViiV Healthcare for the development and marketing of all their combined HIV treatments, and Gilead has similar partnerships for HIV medicines with companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb.Merck maintains a development and marketing partnership for vaccines in Europe with Sanofi-Aventis, and until the recent collapse of talks it was planning a renewal of Merial, its long-standing partnership with the French pharmaceuticals company for animal health products.Merck has unveiled previous cost-sharing experimental drugs development partnerships, notably for cancer drugs with AstraZeneca, reflecting the need for combinations of different therapies.
144;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-02-08T18:35:55Z;Pace of US equity buy-backs picks up;;US companies have announced share buy-backs at the fastest pace since the fall of Lehman Brothers as companies search for ways to put their record cash holdings to work in a still nascent economic recovery.Buy-backs announced by 24 US groups were $27.3bn last week, topping $26.5bn the previous week and the most in any week since September 2008, according to figures compiled by TrimTabs Investment Research.Volumes are typically higher during the quarterly results season but this is the busiest earnings period for buy-backs since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to TrimTabs.Last year, buy-backs rose 174 per cent to $357bn in total.The largest percentage of buy-backs in 2011 have come from consumer and technology groups. Drugmakers Gilead Sciences and Pfizer announced $5bn buy-backs last week.The biggest single buy-back was $10bn announced in January by Intel, the computer chipmaker.Companies saw their available cash grow to record levels in 2010, to $1,081bn for the S&P 500 companies in the third quarter, as they scaled back inventories and laid off employees while the nascent economic recovery has driven modest revenue growth.Buy-backs are typically rewarded by shareholders, as they reduce the outstanding float of a company’s shares, which has the effect of raising companies’ diluted earnings-per-share.However, they worry economists, as it suggests that companies are not seeing expansion or acquisition opportunities.“If the appropriate M&A opportunities cannot be pursued, buy-backs might be the only option to deliver EPS growth in a tepid economy,” said Carsten Stendevad, a corporate finance analyst at Citigroup in New York, in a recent report.Wasif Latif, portfolio manager at asset management company USAA, said: “Companies aren’t growing as much organically. But that may be still to come, as we are just entering the part of the cycle when companies deploy cash.”Figures from Deutsche Bank show that 83 per cent of companies that bought back shares in the fourth quarter have beaten analyst earnings forecasts so far in the fourth quarter reporting periodCitigroup’s research estimated that 37 per cent of expected growth in earnings per share growth for the S&P 500 companies could be because of buy-backs if the pace of actual buy-backs, rather than announcements, matches the pace in 2010.TrimTabs estimates the actual deployment of announced buybacks is running at a rate of $1.7bn daily in the fourth quarter of last year, up from $1.3bn reported by S&P in the third quarter.Buy-backs are only one of several ways to use corporate cash. Mergers and acquisitions and dividends are also both on the rise.M&A volumes in January were the highest for the month since 2008, according to Dealogic. Seventeen companies increased their dividends in January, compared with the 15 that did so in January 2010, according to Standard & Poor’s. S&P said the dollar value of dividends paid by the S&P 500 companies was up 62 per cent in January at $3.28bn compared with the same month in 2010.
145;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2011-01-11T00:13:12Z;Red tape ‘stifling’ medical research;;"Bureaucracy and complexity are “stifling” health research in Britain and driving clinical trials abroad, without any benefits for patient safety, the Academy of Medical Sciences says today in a report to government.The academy recommends replacing the plethora of approval processes with a health research agency that would cover the ethics and governance of medical research.Though the report was commissioned early last year by the Labour government, Andrew Lansley, the new health secretary, and David Willetts, science minister, welcomed its findings and said the recommendations would be implemented.The main bodies funding health research in the UK – public agencies, charities and companies – also issued statements supporting the academy’s call for a streamlined regulatory pathway that would bring healthcare innovations more quickly to patients by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy.Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, led the academy’s study group that prepared the report. He said while funding of health research had improved over the past decade, “a devastating series of restrictions” had prevented Britain benefiting from the extra money.One problem was the European clinical trials directive, which took effect in 2004 and, according to Sir Michael, was implemented more restrictively in the UK than elsewhere. The European Commission is reviewing the directive. But, regardless of European requirements, Sir Michael said the National Health Service was plagued by bureaucracy – particularly the way each individual NHS trust taking part in a research project insisted on carrying out its own elaborate checks, delaying the approvals process.The net result, according to the report, was that Britain’s share of patients taking part in clinical trials globally fell from 6 per cent to 2 per cent over the past decade. Cancer Research UK estimates that unnecessary regulation adds 10 per cent to the costs of conducting medical research in Britain.On average it takes the charity two years to start a clinical trial, after making a research grant.“We want to bring that delay down from two years to two months from the announcement of the grant,” said Peter Johnson, professor of medical oncology at Southampton University. “At present, having built a Rolls-Royce to carry out health research in this country, we are driving it down a cart track.”David Gillen, who represents industry on the academy’s working group and has moved from Pfizer to Gilead Sciences as head of international medical affairs, said pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies would carry out more clinical research in the UK if the regulations were streamlined.“In my former company Spain was seen as the gold standard in Europe [for research regulation]; for my present company Germany is the gold standard,” he said. “The UK is never seen as the gold standard.”"
146;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-11-23T19:14:45Z;Drug study raises Aids prevention hopes;;A combination of drugs used to treat HIV reduces the risk of people becoming newly infected by 44 per cent, raising the prospect of a powerful new prevention technique against Aids, according to a new study.Published in Tuesday’s New England Journal of Medicine, the study of 2,499 uninfected gay and transgender men in the Americas, Asia and South Africa found that nearly twice as many who took a placebo became infected compared with those who took the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine.The details came on the day that UNAids released its latest annual report estimating that last year 2.6m people were newly infected with HIV, increasing to 33.3m the numbers living with the virus. Last year, an estimated 1.8m died from complications of the virus, even though more than 5m are receiving treatment.However, the UN report said the global incidence of HIV infection fell by 19 per cent between 1999 and 2009. It said the adoption of safer sexual practices by the young and greater availability of condoms in countries most at risk were important factors in the fall.The results of the new drug study represent a significant boost to researchers struggling to find ways to prevent the spread of HIV.However, a number of experts gave warning that concerns over funding, resistance, use and logistical challenges could limit widespread use of the drugs for prevention.In the trial – called iPrEx (pre-exposure prophylaxis initiative) – 36 men who took tenofovir and emtricitabine over an average of more than a year developed HIV, compared with 64 who took the placebo.The development is the latest breakthrough in the use of drugs or vaccines to cut infection. In clinical trials last year an experimental HIV vaccine reduced infections by 31 per cent, and a vaginal microbicide gel cut transmission by 39 per cent.The conclusions are a fresh boost to Gilead, the US drug company that developed tenofovir, which has become an increasingly widely used “first line” treatment for HIV and was also used in the microbicide trial.Mitchell Warren, head of Avac, an HIV prevention advocacy group, said: “This builds on an incredible year in prevention. Each of these results is a bit better and the hat-trick in combination is leading us in new directions.”The latest study, which recruited men at high risk of infection across the Americas, South Africa and Asia, was co-ordinated by Robert Grant from the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology at the University of California San Francisco.A separate editorial in the New England Journal cautioned over cases of drug resistance in participants who had already become infected but whose HIV was not detected before the trial began, and poor rates of compliance with the daily dose, partly because of side-effects.Mr Warren suggested that this meant any future prophylaxis use of drugs would require counselling and testing, regular monitoring to boost compliance, and the need to continue with other forms of prevention, including greater use of condoms and circumcision.Kevin Frost, head of amfAR, the Foundation for Aids Research, welcomed the findings but warned of “the incredible costs and other logistical hurdles that will be faced in trying to operationalise this approach”.
147;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-11-03T00:37:37Z;Doctor faces insider trading charges;;"US prosecutors on Tuesday arrested a French doctor for allegedly engaging in insider trading by leaking confidential information on a clinical drug trial to a hedge fund that allowed it to avoid losses of $30m.In their complaint, US officials said Yves Benhamou, a doctor at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, broke securities laws by sharing with a hedge fund manager in 2007-08 negative findings on a clinical test of Albuferon, an experimental drug to treat Hepatitis C then being developed by Human Genome Sciences.While the complaint does not name the investment firm or the individual manager who received confidential information from Dr Benhamou, people familiar with the matter identified the fund as FrontPoint Partners. Morgan Stanley, which bought FrontPoint about four years ago, recently agreed to reduce its stake in the $7bn fund.“We are co-operating fully with this investigation,” a FrontPoint spokesman said. “We have placed Dr Chip Skowron on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. We have no further comment at this time.”Dr Skowron, co-portfolio manager of the FrontPoint Health Care Fund, did not return a call or e-mail seeking comment. The complaint, filed by the US Attorney’s Manhattan office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claims Dr Benhamou was a member of the HGS steering committee overseeing the trial, but also received consulting fees from the hedge fund, which, it is claimed, sold its 6m HGS shares after his tip-off and ahead of public disclosure that cut HGS’s price by 44 per cent.Preet Bharara, US attorney, noted that the investigation was continuing. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil charges against Dr Benhamou.The case highlights the potential for abuse of commercially sensitive data generated by quoted drug companies, which is shared by a network of external medical advisers ahead of market disclosure.Hedge funds and financial analysts frequently seek to tap medical experts in efforts to assess the likelihood of drugs in development making it to the market, as new drugs offer the prospect of billions of dollars in revenue for the pharmaceutical companies – or even the collapse of smaller biotech businesses if a drug proves unviable.Dr Benhamou is listed in public filings as a consultant to other drug companies including Abbott; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Gilead; GlaxoSmithKline; Idenix Pharmaceuticals; Roche; Valeant; and Vertex.Dr Benhamou, who was arrested on a trip to Boston, will be held in custody ahead of his transfer for a court hearing in New York.Alongside charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, the SEC said it was seeking “disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty”."
148;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-07-22T22:55:29Z;HIV / Aids: Discordant visions;Funds to fight the epidemic are under threat;It was the talk of Vienna and spread rapidly around the world: a study unveiled at the International Aids Conference in the Austrian capital this week suggested a microbicide gel could significantly cut women’s risk of contracting HIV.This boost to demoralised researchers, who have been battling for three decades to halt the virus, follows a rising optimism among doctors and patients in the two years since the previous conference in Mexico City. An increased availability of treatment has helped tackle an epidemic that has infected more than 33m people around the world and still kills 2m annually.But the brutal realities imposed by the financial crisis mean budget cuts threaten to squeeze domestic and international support for healthcare and halt recent progress. The alarm is only just being raised about the painful trade-offs that are likely to be required ahead.“I am scared by what I see today,” Michel Sidibé, head of UNAids, the United Nations’ coordinating group on the disease, told the conference in his opening speech. “Prevention models are coming up short. Some governments are cracking down on vulnerable groups. Treatment is not sustainable. Costs are rising.”Since the start of the millennium, intensifying international action has led both to a gradual decline in the rate of new HIV infections and to a surge to more than 5m patients in the developing world who have been given drugs to keep them alive. Now, further work on HIV risks being squeezed by both a deceleration in fresh funding and a shift by many donors towards other diseases and approaches.Some refuse to believe that the pace of HIV funding has to slow. Advocates such as Paul Zeitz from the Global Aids Alliance demand that US President Barack Obama should be held to his election promises to provide more support. He calls for an international tax on banks’ financial transactions to fill the gap. Even official agencies are adopting an attitude that may well prove overoptimistic. The UN-backed Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, which channels donor support from richer to poorer countries, has unveiled ambitious new fundraising goals.Ahead of a pledging meeting this autumn, it has set a preferred target of $20bn (£13.1bn, €15.5bn) based on anticipated demand, and a minimum of $13bn, for the next three-year round of its operations. But just $10bn was agreed in the previous round – some of which still has to be paid over by donors. “If we had the resources, we could virtually eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, save millions of lives through treatment and tens of millions through prevention,” says Michel Kazatchkine, the executive director of the Global Fund. “I can’t believe we will get less than what we have now. The question is how much more.”There is hope for maintained support from some countries. The UK has ring-fenced both health and foreign aid budgets even as it undertakes deep cuts in almost all other departments. But elsewhere, the trend is less positive. Germany and Italy are among those thought likely to reduce foreign giving as they cut back at home. Zeke Emanuel, in charge of health issues at the US Office of Management and Budget, defends the modest increases proposed by the White House for global health by saying: “With a flat budget, this was a much harder sell than ever.”A survey released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US think tank, shows disbursement for Aids from international donors already slipping, from $7.7bn in 2008 to $7.6bn in 2009, after a sixfold increase over the previous six years. Adding in contributions from poorer countries themselves, as well as companies and other funders, that left a $7.7bn gap to reach UNAids’ estimate of the resources needed to tackle HIV during 2009 of nearly $24bn – a hole that seems set to grow.…T he tensions are triggering demands for greater efficiencies in the $16bn Aids “industry”, symbolised by the 25,000 people – from academics and policymakers to patients – who together spent tens of millions of dollars attending the Vienna conference.Speaking at the Monday opening, Bill Clinton, former US president, set the mood: “We have to cut the cost of delivery. In too many countries, too much money pays for too many people to go to too many meetings and get on too many planes. We have to spend …on people the money was designed to help.” Others, like Daniel Halperin from Harvard University, point to the need for greater targeting of existing funds to projects shown to deliver better results. That means less on general campaigns of sex education and more for circumcision, which in parts of Africa can cut infection.But greater efficiency has its limits. The absolute sums spent have grown much larger in recent years – partly because the more HIV patients are given drugs, the longer they survive. This growing “treatment mortgage” means ever more new money is required to sustain existing programmes, before even adding a single new patient. The tension has been compounded by recently released changes to international treatment guidelines, which say patients should be started on therapy at an earlier stage after infection, when their immune systems are still stronger.There is a hope that the long-term effect will be to ease the burden on doctors and hospitals by reducing or deferring the more serious stages of the disease. But the short-term consequence is yet more patients requiring antiretroviral drugs, at an estimated additional cost of $2bn a year.Another hypothesis gaining traction among the optimists, but subject to intense debate, is the idea of “treatment as prevention”. Underlying this is the controversial notion that if patients’ viral load falls to undetectable levels – as is the case for a significant proportion of those in the west who receive consistent treatment – their ability to pass on the infection all but disappears. So if more infected patients in developing countries received drug therapy, the protection it gave “discordant” partners (those of a different HIV status) could reduce overall infection rates in their communities, almost like a vaccine.The naysayers point out that much transmission takes place in the weeks after people have first acquired HIV, long before they have sought a test, let alone been put on treatment. Never mind that western countries still have significant new infections, including a rise among older people.Less open to question is that the longer that more patients are on treatment, the more there are who will develop resistance to “first line” drugs and require alternative fallback therapies, most of which remain on patent and at higher prices. Brazil, which has long championed widespread HIV programmes, is already facing such pressures and is intensifying demands for a fresh attack on intellectual property rights that allow pharmaceutical companies to charge high prices for their innovative medicines.Dominique Limet, head of ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture of GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer that develops and sells HIV medicines, says patents are needed not just to reward the investments companies make in new research but also to control the manufacturing quality of a new generation of drugs. He argues that companies such as his are helping ensure that new treatments are made widely available, through licensing their patents to producers and discounting drug prices.“Everyone is excited about intellectual property,” he says. “But it’s about funding, infrastructure and the ability to deliver the product including the use of community groups.”Lydia Mungherera, a Ugandan doctor and activist who herself has HIV, like many living on the frontline of the epidemic is frustrated with such abstract discussions. “We are already being told to turn away people who have tested positive for HIV. That will lead to men taking the drugs prescribed for their wives,” she says. “It’s a disaster. When we start seeing people dying, we won’t be saying the same thing.”In a report this month, Médecins Sans Frontières, the medical charity, warns of “alarming backtracking” on funding, saying that turning away patients discourages people from even being tested and, provoking a resurgence in new infections.…Uganda also shows, however, that countries with serious epidemics need to do more to ensure they use money effectively. The Global Fund suspended some grants after clinics inexplicably ran out of medicines and officials would not account for how money was spent.Donors such as the Global Fund may in future need to be much more ruthless in deciding which countries to support. That means scaling back on funds to richer recipients such as China, which Mr Kazatchkine argues should pay more itself for HIV work abroad as well as at home.Mr Sidibé singles out Russia as among countries that need to ease laws that impede efforts to tackle HIV. It still criminalises methadone, for example, an oral drug that elsewhere is offered as a substitute for opioids to persuade users to abandon the use of shared syringes.More broadly, UNAids has just unveiled Treatment 2.0, a set of proposals designed to improve efficiency through measures including “task shifting”, so that community health workers and nurses take on much treatment work until now conducted much more expensively by doctors.Pepfar, the bilateral programme established by George W. Bush, former US president, has itself modified policies that had been driven more by ideology than evidence, such as a previous refusal to fund groups involved in needle exchange programmes for injecting drug users, or which explicitly refused to condemn prostitution.Eric Goosby, who oversees Pepfar, is focused on achieving what he estimates could be savings of 20-30 per cent through administrative changes, shifting work away from US-based consultants to people living in recipient countries. He also calls for more focused prevention efforts, without which treatment will struggle to catch up with the number of new infections.In the years ahead, that should include more focus on circumcision as well as potential new approaches including the microbicide gel. Meanwhile, all those working on HIV are hoping they can rely on greater value for money to overcome funding shortfalls. As Mr Sidibé puts it: “Our success will not be measured by increased coverage but by the number of lives we are able to save.”The search is back on but poses pharma with a commercial challengeA topic that has long been practically taboo among those working on Aids is coming back into fashion: the search for a cure. The subject was the centre of a “really interesting buzz” at this week’s global conference on the virus in Vienna, says Kevin Frost of Amfar, an American policy group funding research in the field.Frustrating efforts in the 1980s and 1990s left industrial and academic researchers believing that the search was a distraction from more practical short-term work to tackle the spread and treatment of HIV. But studies presented in Vienna suggest a spirit of enthusiasm among a new generation.Hopes were raised last year by a report of a Berlin HIV patient who appeared to have been cured. But Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health warns that the case was “very much an outlier”. It involved a stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation to a patient with leukaemia who had received radiation therapy. “True eradication” – by which all of the virus is removed from the body – is “very, very difficult. We do not yet have the drugs that are able to accomplish it.”By contrast the “functional cure” described in the journal, Science, by Didier Trono of Lausanne’s Ecole Polytechnique, this month holds out more promise. Such a cure helps maintain the virus at extremely low levels in the body without the need for antiretroviral drugs.Professor Trono points out that, while the “viral load” can be very substantially reduced by cocktails of antiretroviral drugs used in recent years, it rapidly builds up again once treatment is stopped. Yet the drawbacks of long-term use include side-effects and increased resistance.On Thursday in Vienna, Bionor Immuno, a Norwegian company, showed that its “therapeutic vaccine” has enabled some patients to remain off antiretroviral therapy for months while retaining very low viral loads.Like products at still earlier stages of development, it boosts the body’s own immune system, allowing it to fight the virus and reducing the need for additional drugs. The vaccine works best if taken early, before the body’s natural defences are irreparably damaged. Several other biotech companies, and larger pharmaceutical groups such as Merck and Gilead, continue to research in the area.However, the new generation of vaccines poses a commercial challenge. If a functional cure requiring only very occasional use were developed – in contrast to combinations of drugs taken for many years – there would be enormous demand. But high rates of HIV among the poor would create huge pressure to sell at low prices. Which would leave drug companies with the problem of how to make a profit.
149;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-07-21T21:00:11Z;Pharmaceutical groups set up generics initiative;;"Three of the world’s largest pharmaceutical groups have agreed to offer manufacturers of generic drugs royalty-free rights to all their existing and experimental HIV medicines to sell at low cost in developing countries, in a snub to a United Nations-backed rival “patent pool”.Dominique Limet, head of ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer for their HIV medicines that also includes new drugs compounds being developed by Shionogu of Japan, said he preferred to “move quickly to accelerate access” rather than sign up to the pool being established with funding from Unitaid, which raises money from governments to buy medicines for the poor.The move allows generic drug makers able to guarantee quality the right to sell the drugs in 69 least-developed countries. It will have little financial impact on the three pharmaceutical companies, given the low prices they would be able to charge in poor countries. But it opens the possibility of far lower manufacturing costs for generic drug companies.It comes just as Ellen ’t Hoen, who is co-ordinating the patent pool, said it was “ready for business”.Urging pharmaceutical companies to join the patent pool has become a rallying cry for many HIV activists in recent months including Médecins Sans Frontières, which argues intellectual property rights on newer drugs are limiting access to the poor.Ms ’t Hoen told the Financial Times that Merck, Gilead and Tibotec, part of Johnson & Johnson, were among the companies that had expressed most support for the pool, which would ask them to assign their patents on medicines for use by generic drug companies in exchange for a 5 per cent royalty.She said she had recently brokered discussions with Abbott, and was planning shortly to meet Bristol Myers Squibb, two of the remaining HIV drug producers that have traditionally been less willing to endorse the pool.Precise terms are still under negotiation, with generic companies arguing the pool will not be financially attractive unless the patent rights allow them to produce for middle-income countries such as Brazil, while the patent-holders prefer to control richer markets while offering them at discounts to western prices.A €4.7m ($6m, £4m) initial budget for the first year has been allocated for the pool, which has just been incorporated as a Swiss foundation. Ms ‘t Hoen said she hoped within a year to announce some deals. She said top priorities for medicines that should be made available more cheaply for the poor included a planned new combination of Gilead’s tenofovir with an experimental compound from Tibotec; and a protease inhibitor suitable for children.Mr Limet said: “The pool’s key focus has been political in getting access to IP without explaining how it will work. It’s not the issue. It’s about the will and money to invest in new drugs, and ensuring there is enough demand and infrastructure to ensure access. The €4.7m they will spend could save thousands of lives [by buying drugs.]”●The Austrian government came under attack for contributing just €1m to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria since its creation in 2001, by far the lowest contribution among important EU countries. Michel Kazatchkine told the International Aids Conference in Vienna it was “shameful,” noting that Vienna is estimated to generate €45m simply by hosting the conference this year."
150;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-07-20T16:49:52Z;HIV gel research lifts spirits;;The announcement that a new gel may provide a breakthrough in preventing HIV infection has raised hopes around the world and lifted spirits at the bienniel international Aids conference underway in Vienna.Against a gloomy backdrop of funding pressures for HIV programmes globally and numerous costly failures as potential drugs have proved ineffective, the Caprisa 004 study – conducted by the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa – showed the potential for a microbicide gel containing the drug Tenofovir to cut the risk of contracting HIV by up to 54 per cent.The gel is applied to the vagina before and after sex and could prove a significant advance for women given that many have little power to insist on use of a condom.Until now abstinence and the use of condoms have remained the safest ways to avoid sexually transmitted infections, and data suggest male circumcision could significantly cut the risk of HIV infection.Rajiv Shah of USAid, the US overseas aid body that helped fund the trial, said the research was “the first ever proof of concept that a microbicide can safely and effectively reduce the transmission of HIV from men to vulnerable women”.Quarraisha Abdool Karim, one of the lead researchers on the study, said: “This new technology has the potential to alter the course of the HIV epidemic, especially in southern Africa where young women bear the brunt of this devastating disease.”The estimated 2.7m new cases of HIV each year have pushed researchers to seek new ways to tackle prevention as well as treatment. Tenofovir was developed by the US company Gilead. The drug has already become the backbone of treatment for HIV patients and its potential to limit infection is a boost for those trying to tackle the epidemic.However, experts remain cautious. The latest findings, published in the journal Science, are nuanced. While infection fell 54 per cent in “high adherers” who used the product consistently in line with instructions, the overall drop was 39 per cent. In widespread use, adherence rates are likely to be lower. Caprisa was a phase 2 mid-stage clinical trial conducted in fewer than 900 women. Before regulators could approve its use, they would need to examine far more extensive data from at least one phase three trial to verify the drug’s safety and efficacy.While the findings will boost Gilead’s scientists, they will not create windfall profits for the company – and could even be a burden.Gilead has licensed Tenofovir for use in microbicides to two non-profit groups, Conrad and the International Partnership on Microbicides, which manufacture and sell the product if it is approved.However, depending on the cost of the microbicide, the company could be drawn into any debate on access to it for people in low income countries.More directly – and just as worrying to scientists – is that widespread use of Tenofovir for prevention could foster HIV resistance to the drug, undermining its use as a treatment.There will also be substantial costs to using Tenofovir for prevention. The existing data suggest a gel alone would only help some women and not guarantee full protection. It would therefore have to be offered alongside alternative approaches. Patients would also have to be regularly tested to check that they remained free of the virus, and treated if they did not. However, such testing programmes are already inadequately funded. With funding for research also squeezed, Mitchell Warren, head of the Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, cautions that competing groups of researchers will have to better co-ordinate to use funds most effectively to tackle prevention.“This is a historic day,” he said at the conference. But he added: “As exciting as this result is …it is critical to manage expectations while maintaining urgency.”
151;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-07-19T15:43:05Z;HIV infections halved by gel treatment;;A gel applied by women before and after sex has reduced the risk of HIV infection by more than half, according to experts briefed on a ground-breaking study to be released on Tuesday that could help revolutionise prevention.Findings of the so-called Caprisa study, conducted in 900 women in South Africa, show for the first time the potential of a microbicide applied to the vagina to sharply cut infection.The research – which will still require substantial analysis and several years before it could lead to widespread applications – marks the first time that a product containing an antiretroviral drug used for treating HIV has been successfully applied to prevention.Several earlier studies with alternative microbicides have proved unsuccessful.It signals a boost to Gilead, the US pharmaceutical company that developed the drug, known as Tenofovir, and will help the demoralised research community regain confidence, after setbacks with a series of other microbicides and HIV vaccines.A second approach to using Tenofovir for prevention is in the form of a pill for those at high risk of HIV infection. Safety findings are also set to be released at this week’s International Aids Society conference in Vienna, although efficacy data will only be published later in the year.The results also mark a particular fillip for South Africa, which has one of the world’s highest rates of HIV but was involved in both conducting, designing and funding the trial.The journal Science is due to release the full findings on Tuesday but two people breifed on the study said it showed that in patients who took the microbicide consistently, it cut HIV infection by 39 per cent, rising to 54 per cent among those who were consistently using it in line with instructions.While the speed of new HIV infections has been slowing since the start of the decade, the United Nations estimates 2.7m people are contracting the virus for the first time each year, adding to 33.4m already infected.Aside from abstinence and use of condoms, circumcision is the only new approach to cutting HIV infection that has been proven to work in the last few years and which is now being offered in a number of high risk countries in Africa.Before the microbicide could be used widely, it will have to undergo far more extensive late-stage clinical trials for safety and efficacy, and pass scrutiny by regulators. There will also need to be consideration of how best to market it and ensure it is used consistently in order to provide the maximum protection from infection.One concern is that widespread use of the drug for prevention could jeopardise its potential for treatment by increasing the chance of HIV developed resistance to the medicine. Tenofovir is part of the cocktail of drugs most widely used in the developed world and is becoming increasingly common in patients in poor countries.There could also be substantial costs in making the microbicide widely available.Speaking on Monday ahead of publication of the Clarisa results, Bill Gates, the businessman and philanthropist, said he would work to ensure that funding was not an obstacle to the use of tenofovir in prevention if it proved effective. But he warned it could still take several years even if was proved safe and effective in microbicides or as a pill, because of regulatory, manufacturing and marketing hurdles. He also cautioned of the risks of “disinhibition” – that those taking such approaches to prevention could feel protected and participate in activities putting them at high risk of infection.

Japanese groups were judged to be the least active.The assessment – which analyses research on treatments for diseases of the poor, marketing, pricing and drug donations – reflects a desire by drug groups to improve their image after suing the South African government to retain their control of HIV drugs a decade ago.It comes at a time of interest by investors in the potential of emerging markets and strategies to boost volumes by cutting prices and extending sales to those on lower incomes while western drug markets stagnate.My-Linh Ngo, associate director of sustainable investments at Henderson, which manages £726m (€870m) in ethical funds, said: “Industry still needs to go a lot further, but emerging markets are where the larger growth is. Better access to medicines helps position them.”The rankings, compiled by a Dutch consultancy on behalf of the Access to Medicine Index Foundation – backed by donor governments and philanthropists – reflect greater information than was available in 2008 and improvements in sharing intellectual property, research collaborations and reduced pricing in lower-income countries.Andrew Witty, GSK chief executive, said: “Long-term value creation will come from keeping in step with society. I don’t want to look back …and say I was in a pretty unusual position to improve healthcare around the world and didn’t take advantage of it.”The lower rating of US companies may reflect less exposure to the developing world.
153;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-05-19T20:51:27Z;Wall Street lower on Europe growth worries;;US stock markets reversed opening gains as traders sold shares tied to the global economy, ignoring the usually bullish signal of a stronger euro.“What’s interesting is that we’re still seeing the same risk-off trade,” said Jeremy Zirin, US equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We’re shifting from structural concerns about the eurozone to worries about European growth rates and the global recovery.”After opening higher, the S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent to 1,115.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 10,444.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support. Amgenadded 1.1 per cent to $55.26. JPMorgan reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gilead, citing the likelihood of approval for a key drug, boosting the shares by 1.9 per cent to $39.01.
154;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-05-17T16:12:15Z;Astellas clinches OSI with $4bn offer;;Astellas Pharma, the Japanese drugmaker, on Monday agreed to buy OSI Pharmaceutical, the US-based oncology specialist, for $4bn in cash, following a long battle.The Japanese drugmaker secured the deal after sweetening its offer by more than 10 per cent to $57.50 a share. The raised offer was based on non-public information to which OSI gave Astellas access, following the US company’s rejection of the first offer of $52 a share.Astellas said it aimed initially to acquire at least 50 per cent of the company, after which it hoped to purchase the rest of the shares.The agreement with OSI, which it first informally approached in December 2008, marks a change of dealmaking fortunes for Astellas. The group last year lost out in its $1bn bid to buy CV Therapeutics of the US, which Gilead Sciences subsequently bought.Astellas needed an acquisition because its best-sellers – Prograf for organ transplants, and Flomax/Harnal for enlarged prostate and urinary disorders – face competition from generics. The company last week estimated a drop in operating profit for the fiscal year ending next March.The OSI acquisition would give Astellas instant profits from the US company’s Tarceva cancer drug, as well as access to its product pipeline, and an enhanced geographical presence. It estimates that a majority stake in OSI would contribute Y34bn ($367m) to this fiscal year’s revenue.“It’s a little bit unusual in that a Japanese company should decide to go hostile, but shows their determination, and emphasises that for pharmaceutical companies this use of M&A to supplement their R&D activities is not just nice to have, it’s pretty fundamental,” said an investment banker. “It’s not as if there is some vast long list of companies available and a nice fit.”There has been a surge in healthcare M&A. Pharmaceutical-related deals reached a record $169bn in 2009, the first time the total has crossed $100bn annually, Dealogic data shows.Japanese companies are also threatened by Tokyo’s plan to increase the use of generic drugs to 30 per cent of the market to curb rising healthcare costs as the population ages.OSI had revenues of $428m last year, more than 80 per cent related to Tarceva. Roche has an agreement with OSI to develop and market Tarceva, which last month was approved for the treatment of lung cancer.OSI’s shares closed at $59.80 on Friday, higher than the new offer, suggesting the market was hoping to get even more for the company. Astellas’s shares outperformed the Tokyo market on Monday, closing down 0.3 per cent at Y3,135.Centerview and Lazard are advising OSI. Citigroup is advising Astellas.
155;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-04-23T21:20:59Z;Strong macro data trigger Wall St rally;;US stock prices advanced in a late rally Friday as data releases described a sharply improving economic picture, which came against a backdrop of mostly positive corporate earnings.US new home sales surged 27 per cent in March, the most in five decades, though enthusiasm was muted to a degree because an expiring tax break was credited for some of the increase. Homebuilder shares rose 4.4 per cent.Durable goods machinery orders were up 8.6 per cent and inventories up 0.2 per cent, both catalysts for GDP growth. The ECRI also reported that its leading economic indicators index rose to its highest level since May 2008.In spite of a sharp drop at the end of last week after the Goldman Sachs fraud charges were announced, which led many people to predict a correction would follow, US markets have grasped at positive catalysts, such as earnings beating consensus expectations by Goldman and Apple. Eighty per cent of S&P 500 companies reporting for the quarter have beaten earnings expectations, the highest level since 1993, according to Bloomberg data.“The market has absorbed the Goldman news, a surge in Greek yields, the threat of US financial reform,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at agency brokerage Instinet. “For the bears, it must feel like trying to hold a beach ball under water with lotion-coated fingers.”At close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,217.28, and 2.1 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to a weekly 1.7 per cent rise, to 11,204.28, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,530.15, clipping a five-day jump of 2.0 per cent.Energy shares led Friday’s gains, with Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, advancing 6.6 per cent, to $72.68, after its chief executive said margins in his industry had bottomed out. El Paso, the pipeline owner, was also up 6.8 per cent, to $12.50.The big focus for traders during the week were tech shares, as top players reported earnings. Apple jumped 9.5 per cent, to $270.83, touching all-time trading highs, after bursting through expectations for the quarter.Xerox saw shares rocket to $11.32 on Friday, a jump of 8.3 per cent. It beat profit expectations and projected an improvement in its printer-services business. The sector rose 1.7 per cent for the five days.Market sentiment was somewhat damped by reduced outlooks from two key tech bellwethers. Shares in Microsoft on Friday fell 1.3 per cent, to $30.99, as it reduced earnings projections for later this year. Amazon.com, the online retailer, fell 4.3 per cent to $143.63 after it also forecasted a decline in second-quarter revenues.“If we’re going to put a cap on financials through regulation, the question is, can tech produce enough incremental earnings surprises to keep the market moving higher?” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at BNY ConvergEx.Financials, for the time being, showed no signs of slowing. They rose 2.3 per cent on the week, led by regional banks’ improving consumer credit results. Huntington Bank was the top advancer, rising 29 per cent for the five days, as it turned a profit for the first time since 2008.Goldman Sachs said it nearly doubled its earnings, to $3.5bn, for the quarter, though shares declined 2.1 per cent on the week to $157.40. On Friday, American Express was up 2.7 per cent, to $48.05, after profits jumped on rising customer spending.Healthcare were the only fallers on the week, off 0.9 per cent on concerns about the impact of healthcare reform. Baxter International, a supplier of medical chemicals, was down 17 per cent as it reduced its full-year expectations. Biotech drugmaker Gilead Sciences dropped 8.8 per cent.
156;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-04-21T20:34:42Z;Strong earnings bolster anxious Wall St;;US stock prices put in a mixed performance on Wednesday as they see-sawed around the flat mark, in spite of results from Apple that smashed analysts’ expectations, with Morgan Stanley and Boeing also posting better-than-expected first-quarter numbers.“This suggests that recent market advances may have fully priced in expectations of this quarter’s results,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,205.94, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent 11,124.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,504.61.Apple led the technology stocks in the Dow higher, rising 6 per cent to $259.22. The company reported a 90 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and a 49 per cent increase in revenue after the session’s close on Tuesday, far surpassing bullish Wall Street estimates.The consumer technology products group had been expected to record earnings per share of $2.46 on sales of about $12bn, instead, it reported earnings of $3.33 per share, or $3.1bn in total, on sales of $13.5bn in the first quarter.AT&T, the largest US phone company by revenue, lost 1.2 per cent to $26.34 as first-quarter sales came in slightly below average analyst expectations. The company’s exclusive contract with Apple to offer the iPhone helped drive earnings but a number of analysts raised concerns over its dependency on the contract.Yahoo was 5.1 per cent lower at $17.45 as the search engine provider forecast lower-than-expected second-quarter sales after the session’s close on Tuesday, citing falling market share.The company also reported first-quarter sales that missed average analyst estimates.Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter results before the session’s open yesterday morning, and its shares rallied 4 per cent to $31.68.The bank’s earnings beat average analyst estimates, helped by a strong performance of its fixed income division.Earnings from continuing operations, including a 21 cent tax benefit, were $1.03 per share, compared with analysts’ average expectations of 57 cent per share.Wells Fargo slid 2 per cent to $33.01 as it reported first-quarter earnings that were lower than the same quarter a year earlier, however, non-collectable loans were lower than the fourth quarter of last year. The bank also originated fewer mortgages compared with a year earlier.Gilead Sciences fell 9.6 per cent to $40.76 after the drugmaker which focuses on Aids treatments lowered its full-year forecasts, and said sales of Truvada and Atripla, its flagship drugs, missed expectations in the first quarter.Boeing was up 3.9 per cent to $74.16 as the aircraft manufacturer reported higher-than-expected first-quarter results. But it cut full-year guidance due to the higher costs of providing health benefits to employees as a result of recent US healthcare legislation. It maintained its full-year delivery guidance of 460 to 465 aircraft, saying those were all sold. Revenues would be $31bn to $32bn.Altria, the world’s largest tobacco company, added 1.4 per cent to $21.46 on its first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, helped by a strong performance by its smokeless tobacco business.The company left its full-year guidance unchanged, adding that high unemployment and economic pressures continue to weigh on its customers.Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, was 1.5 per cent higher at $86.25 even after reporting lower first-quarter profits and reducing its full-year outlook, also partly due to the impact of the healthcare bill. Net earnings in the quarter fell 18 per cent to $547m, or $1.45 per share, compared with $666m, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier.For the full year Lockheed said that earnings per share would be $7-$7.20 per share, down from its prior estimates of $7.15 -$7.35 per share.AMR, parent company of American Airlines, slumped 9.2 per cent to $7.77 after reporting a widening loss amid higher fuel prices and meagre growth in passenger traffic.
157;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-03-15T15:54:20Z;OSI rejects hostile bid from Japan’s Astellas;;OSI Pharmaceuticals rejected a $3.5bn, unsolicited takeover offer from Astellas Pharma on Monday, leaving its Japanese suitor in hostile pursuit of a US target for the second time in a year.Astellas, which last year made a hostile offer for CV Therapeutics but lost out to Gilead Sciences, wants to expand its US presence and build up its activities in oncology. Two weeks ago it offered OSI investors $52 a share in cash, having failed to persuade the management of the merits of a deal in informal talks that started more than a year ago.OSI’s board of directors on Monday unanimously rejected the Astellas offer, which at the time of Astellas’ original announcement represented a 40 per cent premium to the share price. The board argued that the price did not reflect the value of its core business, built around the drug Tarceva, and that it valued OSI below where other recent deals in oncology have been agreed.Robert Ingram, chairman, said: “We believe that OSI is a unique asset – the only profitable, mid-cap biotech company with a growing high-quality and fully integrated oncology franchise and a strong diabetes and obesity franchise, which also has a proven track record of success.”OSI management, instructed by the board, will contact other potential buyers, raising the prospect of Astellas again losing out to a “white knight” counterbid.Astellas said on Monday it would “proceed with its offer directly to OSI’s stockholders” and would also nominate a full slate of directors at OSI’s upcoming shareholder meeting. “We believe that the slate, if elected and subject to its fiduciary duties, will fully and fairly consider Astellas’ offer,” it said in a statement.Colin Goddard, chief executive of OSI, told the Financial Times on Monday that “the irony of the Astellas proposal is that it gives us a fantastic opportunity to shift attention away from day to day, nearer term factors and onto the potential of OSI.”Last year OSI’s revenues rose about 13 per cent to $428m, about four-fifths of which came from Tarceva.However, the company argues that Astellas has underestimated the future revenues which Tarceva could generate, for example in treating different types of cancer, as well as overlooking the value in its business developing drugs to tackle diabetes and obesity.Japan’s second-largest drugmaker needs to expand its pipeline as it faces a tough domestic market, with three drugs coming off patent over the next few years as well as a growing generics market as the government battles increasing medical costs with its ageing population. It last year bid for CV Therapeutics, which focuses on the treatment of cardiovascular disease.An acquisition of OSI would help Astellas become more competitive in oncology medication and OSI’s existing drugs and pipeline would provide Astellas with both short and medium-term profits, analysts said.Shares in OSI rose 1.4 per cent in early trading to $58.50.Centerview Partners is advising OSI on its defence with Lazard. Citigroup is advising Astellas on the the deal.
158;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-03-01T20:27:10Z;Astellas / OSI;Japanese pharma company gets aggressive in America;A bird in the hand may or may not be worth more than two in the bush. The market’s initial response when Japan’s Astellas Pharma made an unsolicited $3.5bn cash offer for OSI Pharmaceuticals of the US was to send the target’s shares soaring 9 per cent above an offer already 40 per cent higher than its price on Friday.Shares in OSI are not being bid up because investors believe in management’s line about the offer undervaluing the company as a going concern. Instead, they are banking on one of two things happening. Astellas was embarrassed a year ago when its offer for CV Therapeutics was trumped by white knight Gilead for a 25 per cent premium. Investors may reason that Astellas is good at putting companies in play but shy about closing the deal. A counter-offer might be forthcoming from Roche, which licenses OSI’s blockbuster cancer drug Tarceva. But why buy the cow when one already has the milk?More plausible is Astellas keeping some powder dry this time round for a better offer. With the benefit of hindsight, Gilead probably overpaid for CV but OSI is anchored by a far stronger stream of cash flows. And unlike CV, OSI can easily fund its largely early-stage oncology and diabetes pipeline. It is also a less risky acquisition.It is always tricky to call management’s bluff, but OSI might be playing hard to get. It noted recently that, if the pipeline does not produce a boost, it is “committed to monetising” Tarceva’s value. But that is the equivalent of rolling the dice with some of the money shareholders could have upfront, then handing back the rest if things go poorly. Investors unsure whether to take a bird in the hand should opt for a slightly plumper bird.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
159;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Astellas in $3.5bn bid to expand role in US;;Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, on Monday launched a hostile bid for OSI Pharmaceuticals of the US, offering $3.5bn in a deal designed to expand its US presence and activities in oncology.The company offered investors $52 per share, representing a premium of more than 40 per cent from the company’s closing price of $37.02 on Friday, and a 53 per cent premium to its three-month average.The hostile bid – rare in the pharmaceuticals sector and rarer still by a Japanese company – follows the failure of attempts by Astellas to convince OSI’s management to agree to a sale since the start of last year.It also comes within a year of Astellas’ unsuccessful bid for CV Therapeutics, which was acquired by Gilead Sciences, and raises the possibility of a fresh “white knight” making a counter bid for OSI.Masafumi Nogimori, Astellas’ president and chief executive, said: “We firmly believe in the compelling strategic rationale behind the combination and the opportunity it provides to the OSI stockholders to realise full and fair value, in cash, immediately.”OSI released a statement arguing that the $52 a share offer “very significantly undervalues” the company, but said it had already responded to Astellas’ recent approaches by offering to share “certain non-public information” with the company relating to OSI’s value.Shares in the US company on Monday jumped more than 50 per cent to $56.62, suggesting investors believe Astellas may have to pay more to win OSI.OSI’s existing drugs and pipeline would provide Astellas with revenues and add to its pipeline at a time when the Japanese company is facing threats in its domestic market, as drugs go off-patent.Pelham Smithers, managing director of Pelham Smithers Associates, said: “[Astellas] is effectively buying published growth. They have to move fast because they have three drugs expiring in the next two years and this is happening when generics are being pushed hard in the domestic market.”The Japanese government is trying to push more use of generic drugs to cope with rising medical costs amid its rapidly ageing population. Generic drugs account for close to 20 per cent of the whole pharmaceuticals market in Japan and the government is targeting that figure to reach 30 per cent by 2012.Citigroup is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Astellas on the OSI deal, which it plans to fund from cash.
160;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2010-01-26T18:25:25Z;Novartis in stealthy pursuit of change;;Daniel Vasella may be among the more youthful chief executives in the international pharmaceutical industry – but he is also among the longest-lasting. The decision to hive off his chief executive responsibilities marks his continued ability to adapt to survive as much as a symbolic moment for Novartis.While many recently appointed pharmaceutical bosses are only about Dr Vasella’s age of 57, he has already been chief executive for 14 years and held the combined role of chairman at Novartis for 11 years following its formation by the merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy.The changes published on Tuesday reflect long-standing shareholder pressure for change at Novartis to improve performance, broader corporate governance trends Europe-wide and intensifying peer pressure.The board only finally endorsed the new chief executive – Joe Jimenez – on Monday but Dr Vasella says he informed them of his intention to relinquish the chief executive role last June, setting off an internal competition pitting Mr Jimenez against the veteran insider Jörg Reinhardt.“The process has to be very clean,” said Dr Vasella . “There were no leaks. It reflects how we work.”North American pharmaceutical companies defend the combined roles of chairman and chief executive – but the European trend has long been in the opposite direction.In 2008, Roche – Novar-tis’s rival based across the Rhine in Basel – began a similar split function, with Franz Humer remaining chairman while Severin Schwan became chief executive. Swiss companies in other sectors have shifted in the same direction.Insiders say Chris Viehbacher, the German-Canadian appointed in late 2008 as chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis of France, fought late last year to combine his role with that of chairman once Jean-Francois Dehecq announced his intention to step down in May, but the board preferred to maintain two jobs.Very few of the larger pharmaceutical companies are now run by those with a scientific or medical background. Dr Vasella worked in medicine, and only John Lechleiter at Eli Lilly and John Martin at Gilead worked in research. Most of their peers are lawyers or salesmen – like Mr Jimenez, who won as an “outsider”. That reflects a desire for fresh ideas in the sale of patented prescription medicines and an ever more diverse range of products, from consumer health to eyecare.Coupled with the appointment of Jon Symonds, the former AstraZeneca and Goldman Sachs’ chief financial officer, the Swiss group has received a powerful injection of experience to its executive board in recent months.Yet Dr Vasella remains highly influential. This week’s decision is the latest in a regular departure of senior executives who have not met his demands. Three more were pushed out in the latest upheaval: Mr Reinhardt, Andreas Rummelt and Thomas Wellauer.As Morgan Stanley argued in a research note on Tuesday, the new team may herald more aggressive cost-cutting – but it also reflects “little change in corporate strategy”.
161;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

But the benchmark fell again in late trading and closed down 0.6 per cent near its lows of the day at 1,107.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 10,452.00 and the Nasdaq 0.5 at 2,201.05.Wells Fargo followed Bank of America and Citigroup’s lead by saying i t would pay back the $25bn it received under the troubled asset relief programme. Wells, the fourth-largest bank in the US, said it would sell $10.4bn in common stock to help pay back the government funds, lifting its shares 0.7 per cent to $25.66.On Monday, Citigroup shares dropped 6.3 per cent after the bank said it would raise $19.6bn to return $20bn in bail-out funds. The bank lost a further 3.8 per cent to $3.56 on Tuesday.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, reported quarterly profit above expectations. However, the shares fell 8.5 per cent to $41.53 after the company said gross margins over the forthcoming holiday period would come under pressure as it lured customers with deeper discounts. But the group said strong sales of notebook computers, flat-panel televisions, mobile phones and appliances had helped offset lower demand for video games, films and music.Hyatt Hotels rose 2.2 per cent to $30.15 after the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund, bought a 10.9 per cent stake in the hotel chain. Shares in the company, which went public in November, have been rated “buy” at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank and “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase.One of Hyatt’s rivals, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, was also raised to “buy” from “underperform” by Bank of America. The bank’s analysts said they believed there would be a strong recovery in the sector beginning late next year as demand for hotel rooms rose. The shares gained 2.1 per cent to $36.37.But the optimism did not extend to Host Hotels & Resorts. The real estate investment trust (Reit) offered $300m of senior debt to repay more pressing debts. Shares in the group, which owns hotels in Mexico and Europe, fell 2 per cent to $10.75.Weyerhaeuser, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper companies, announ­ced it would convert to a Reit and pay a special dividend as part of the move. Investors have been requesting the conversion for years, claiming the company should be considered a real estate builder rather than just a timber producer. As a Reit, the company will pay less tax and could provide greater returns to investors. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $43.11.Gilead Sciences fell 3.5 per cent to $45.31 after announcing disappointing results from a study of its experimental blood pressure drug Darusentan.Array Bio­Pharma surged 23.6 per cent to $2.78 after the drug research company said it would receive at least $60m from Amgen for exclusive rights to its experimental diabetes drugs.In the technology sector, shares in Qwest Communications International added 4.4 per cent to $4.26 after UBS boosted its rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, citing improving revenue trends.
163;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-12-15T17:12:36Z;HIV pool adds to pressure on drug groups;;Nine western pharmaceutical companies face fresh pressure to ease control over their HIV medicines following the establishment of an international mechanism designed to increase treatment access in the developing world.The board of Unitaid, the French-backed health funding agency, voted on Tuesday to create a “patent pool” to increase the freedom of rival companies to combine and sell almost 20 antiretroviral drugs to provide greater help to patients in poor countries.Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of Unitaid’s executive board, said: “This is an historic day. Unitaid has now put in place a mechanism that will make medical advances work for the poor while compensating companies for sharing their technology.”The pool details of which remain subject to debate – would allow low-cost generic drug companies in India and elsewhere to experiment with patented HIV medicines in order to create affordable “fixed dose combinations” and paediatric versions of the different drugs.Western companies would agree to be paid a small royalty on their patents, but relinquish control over manufacturing, distribution and pricing in the countries to which the pool applies, limiting their revenues.Unitaid is concentrating on putting into the pool 19 HIV medicines made by Abbott, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, Roche and Tibotec, part of Johnson & Johnson.The aim is to encourage new formulations to meet demand in developing countries, where the commercial market has been insufficient to promote innovation by the patent holders. Developing country demand includes the need for combined pills, heat-stable medicines and drugs adapted for easy use by children.While boosting total volumes of drug sales, the pool would also waive the patent holders’ legal rights to charge high prices for their drugs. Unitaid estimates the mechanism could save $1bn a year in medicine costs in the developing world.Several drug companies have expressed support in principle for the pool but are wary about the details.Some patent holders have indicated they are unwilling to take part in a pool that extends to richer emerging markets such as India, Brazil and Thailand. That is sparking tensions with the generic companies which say they will need the rights to sell the drugs in these markets in order to make a profit.Gilead, the US company that has the largest market share of HIV medicines, said: “We believe if structured appropriately, Unitaid’s patent pool can play a critical role in expanding access to antiretroviral treatment for patients around the world.”
164;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-12-14T23:14:45Z;Value added by best CEOs;;A rare event in the business world last week: everyone seemed to agree about something. When Procter & Gamble’s former chief executive, A.G. Lafley, announced he would be retiring as its chairman in the new year, there was universal acclaim for his work at the company. Fortune magazine’s verdict was typical. “It is not overstating things to say that Lafley brought P&G into the next century,” it said.Well done, A.G. But just to disrupt this mood of consensus for a moment, let me restate my belief that, sometimes, too much attention gets paid to individual CEOs, and not enough to the work that goes on elsewhere inside businesses. A.G. did not invent P&G’s blockbuster cleaning product Swiffer, for example, or lead on every aspect of the company’s merger with Gillette.How important are CEOs, exactly? “The CEO is responsible for creating and leading the team that will deliver great performance,” says Morten Hansen, professor of management at the University of California at Berkeley, and also at Insead. “A CEO can have great impact by creating a strong team.”Prof Hansen should know what he is talking about. With his Insead colleagues Herminia Ibarra and Urs Peyer, he has just finished researching the performance of almost 2,000 CEOs at 1,200 public companies over the past 15 years. (No CEO already in post in 1995 – Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jack Welch – was included.) The full results will be published later this week at www.hbr.org/top-ceos and in the new year edition of the Harvard Business Review. But here is a sneak preview.After crunching through a wealth of data on total shareholder returns (TSR) during a CEO’s tenure, which were adjusted for movements in stock markets and within industry sectors, and then looking at inflation-adjusted changes in the company’s market capitalisation, the researchers drew up their list of top-performing CEOs.Some expected names appear in the top 10: Apple’s Steve Jobs comes first, with Cisco’s John Chambers not far behind in fourth place. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Meg Whitman, formerly of Ebay, and Google’s Eric Schmidt are placed seventh, eighth and ninth respectively. But some less familiar figures crop up too. Yun Jong-yong, CEO of Samsung between 1996 and 2008, is second only to Mr Jobs as a wealth-creating boss. John Martin, head of Gilead Sciences, the California-based pharma company – maker of the antiviral drug Tamiflu – is sixth. Monsanto’s Hugh Grant comes 10th. One or two prominent bosses do not make it into the top 400: JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, for example, and GE’s Jeff Immelt.The research indicates that, when they reach the top job, company insiders tend to do better than those who are brought in from outside. In countries where reliable information is available, those with MBAs seem to do better than those without – although more than half the top 50 bosses do not have one. It also helps to take over from someone who has not performed well, in a company that is struggling. All the leading bosses proved their worth over an extended period, and not just in a brief period characterised by luck or (fleeting) brilliance.One last revealing discovery: there was virtually no correlation between fame, a strong reputation and actual performance. Out of the 30 “most respected CEOs in the world” named by the US magazine Barron’s in 2009, only five made it into this new list of top performers. Many celebrity CEOs got nowhere near the top.Time for a few caveats. However carefully the researchers adjusted the data, TSR numbers, which are derived from the sometimes irrational and excessive movements of stock markets, can never be a wholly reliable guide to the performance of a company. Messrs Dimon and Immelt, for example, might argue that, for different reasons and at different times, stock markets have not reflected the true value or strength of their businesses. And bosses who run privately held companies cannot by definition feature in lists such as these, which focus only on public companies. A.G. Lafley, incidentally, came 189th: inside the top 10 per cent, if not quite as high as the response to his retirement might have suggested.Here is the executive summary. Bosses set the pace and direction, and lead the top team. Their judgment and people management skills are vital. So how important are CEOs, exactly? I admit it.

165;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Gilead set to benefit from HIV guidelines;;Gilead, the US biotech company, is poised to benefit from new World Health Organisation guidelines for HIV which call for earlier treatment using more up-to-date antiretroviral drugs for millions of extra patients around the world.The company is expecting to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenues each year from the new approach, with significant extra sales for Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, its partner on one drug combination treatment.A number of low-cost generic drug manufacturers including several based in India will suffer falling sales, with the phasing out of the older antiretroviral medicine stavudine (also called d4T), which is now judged as too toxic to justify continued use.The changes follow new international HIV treatment guidance issued this week by the World Health Organisation, mirrored by similar advice in other influential national bodies including the Office of Aids Research Advisory Council in the US and the European Aids Clinical Society.The new recommendations to doctors and national medical bodies call for patients with HIV to be given drugs earlier in the development of their disease, with treatment beginning at the so-called CD4 count of their immune strength at or above 500 cells/mm3 compared with 350 currently. The WHO calls for treatment at 350 compared with 200 currently.In the developing world, the guidelines also call for the first time for a switch away from older therapies, and for longer use of newer drugs in mothers with HIV breastfeeding their children in order to prevent them transmitting the infection.In a research note, Maged Shenouda, senior pharmaceutical analyst for UBS in the US, estimated that the earlier start on treatment would increase Gilead’s $5.5bn annual sales of HIV medicines by 20 per cent, with more than 180,000 patients in Europe and the US given drugs. Currently more than 700,000 receive treatment in the developed world.“This will have a significant upside with more patients coming onto therapy,” he said, while cautioning that it could take up to three years for doctors to switch to the new guidelines.In the developing world, the World Health Organisation estimated that the new guidelines would add 3-5m patients to the 9.5m currently estimated to require HIV therapy.However, only about 4m of these patients currently received medicines, with others unable because of lack of diagnosis and poorly funded health systems to gain access to treatment.Yusuf Hamied, head of Cipla, the Indian generics company that is one of the largest providers of stavudine and other HIV treatments, dismissed the financial impact, pointing out that he could also sell Gilead’s principal drug in developing countries after overturning the US company’s patent on tenofovir in India.He said his concern was still more recent and expensive third and fourth generation medicines, which are subject in India to tougher patent restrictions. “Even if I received permission for those today, it would take three to five years to bring them to market,” he said.
166;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-11-30T17:13:39Z;Drugs: Cost is the highest barrier for treatments;;Research on new medicines to treat HIV has been matched in recent months by novel approaches to making drugs affordable and the way in which innovation itself takes place.Last month, GlaxoSmithKline took the most striking step with the launch of ViiV Healthcare, a groundbreaking partnership with its rival Pfizer. The new company has taken control of both its parents’ portfolios of existing drugs as well as the ones in their development pipelines.The advantages of the new, single-disease model include the ability to create a far greater focus on HIV, to share the financial risks of drug development, and to tap a broader range of experts and approaches from across the two companies – and in the future from other external partners too.“We are 100 per cent dedicated to HIV, so we can get closer to those living with it, reach out to more patients and do much more than either company on its own,” says Dominique Limet, the chief executive. “We remain absolutely focused on the pursuit of new medicines, including in the future how to stimulate the immune system.”The concern of some observers is that unless it fails to develop lucrative new blockbusters, ViiV may ultimately be spun off by its owners, marking the beginning of the end for two of the pioneering large pharmaceutical companies in the HIV field.Roche last year withdrew from HIV research entirely, and a recent study by Fist, a French intellectual property consultancy, concluded that others would be likely to follow. “The industrial pipeline is seriously drying up in certain areas,” it says, highlighting that after a steady rise in patent filings for HIV therapies during 1983-2002, the number has dropped consistently and considerably since.Gilead, market leader in HIV with drugs led by tenofovir, says it remains firmly committed to the field. “There’s a lot of work and money being spent on R&D in-house and we’re looking very actively outside,” says Paul Carter, the company’s senior vice-president for international operations.Alongside its own pipeline, it has navigated complex commercial and patent rights to produce combined products with rivals, launching Atripla with Bristol-Myers Squibb, a one-pill-a-day treatment that makes it easier for patients to adhere to treatment regimes. It is discussing another such multiple therapy with Tibotec, part of Johnson & Johnson.But with most of the world’s HIV patients concentrated in the developing world, and only half of those who require treatment currently receiving medicine, the issues of access and affordability are just as important as the development of new drugs.The World Health Organisation has just finalised new recommendations that recommend that poor countries switch their “first line” treatments from low-cost off-patent combination therapies to newer drugs including tenofovir. That will offer greater efficacy and fewer side-effects.But Ellen ’t Hoen, a senior adviser at Unitaid, a United Nations-backed agency that purchases drugs for HIV, TB and malaria, warns that the costs will also rise sharply. Escalating demand and ever tougher international controls over intellectual property rights are limiting generic competition, she says. “The effects on cost will be quite astronomical.”GSK, like Merck and several of its peers, has committed to deep discounts to western prices on treatments it sells in low-income countries. Gilead has a series of voluntary licensing agreements with 13 Indian generic drugs manufacturers and one in South Africa, which Mr Carter says can produce tenofovir at half of Gilead’s costs.For many activists, such approaches are insufficient. Later this month, the Unitaid board will discuss a “patent pool”, designed to stimulate greater and speedier involvement from generic drug companies. Patent holders such as GSK and Gilead – which have expressed cautious support for the idea – would license their drugs to third-party companies in exchange for a modest royalty.The hope is that the mechanism would reduce the costs and price of drugs, while stimulating new formulations that meet the specific needs of patients in poorer countries.But – with a pilot programme likely to be launched early next year – the large companies remain hesitant over the details, including the size of royalties, and whether the arrangement would cover middle-income countries.If they fail to agree, the risk is a return to conflict including the periodic stand-offs by countries such as Brazil and Thailand, which have overridden drug patents and permitted generic companies to produce lower-cost alternatives.Finding the right economic and political balance on drug pricing may yet prove as difficult as scientific discovery.
167;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-11-20T20:39:24Z;J&J stays true to its diversified model;;"After a period when break-ups and divestments were in vogue in the pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson’s long-standing healthcare conglomerate model has come back into fashion.However, the group’s diversified operations have not shielded it from the pain of many of its peers. Last week it unveiled job cuts for up to 7 per cent of its staff worldwide, or more than 8,000 employees.William Weldon, chief executive, defends vigorously the company’s strategy, with its three broad divisions of medical devices, consumer health and pharmaceuticals.In recent weeks, J&J took minority stakes in Crucell and Elan, two businesses that are active in vaccines and as well as drugs.“For years we were criticised; in today’s environment we’re praised,” Mr Weldon says.The market, he says, has recognised the benefits of the J&J model in softening the impact of patent expiries and research setbacks and not relying on a single product.“In five years’ time, we’ll be criticised again. You have to believe what you believe in.”In recent years Merck in the US, Novartis in Europe, and Daiichi Sankyo in Japan have been among those to follow J&J’s approach with acquisitions to spread risk and diversify products.“ Jeff [Kindler] has told me numerous times his regrets,” Mr Weldon says with a twinkle in his eye, referring to the head of Pfizer’s lament at the sale by his predecessor of its consumer health division to J&J in 2006.This year Pfizer backtracked, re-entering that business and others with its takeover of Wyeth, which was finalised this month.Mr Weldon says splitting his company is periodically discussed, but is always rejected because of the benefits of cross-fertilisation and diversity.“We challenge ourselves and ask if we could be better if we broke apart. But if we fast-forward, we’ll see much more blurring [between divisions].”So-called drug-eluting stents, which are used to treat narrowed arteries, combine the expertise of two J&J division, devices and pharmaceuticals, he says.In another example, when the group shifted its priority in pharmaceuticals to oncology, J&J found an application for its science-based dermatology businesses in consumer health.Mr Weldon foresees still tighter integration across the group’s businesses, including the growing scope for biomarkers and diagnostic techniques in the application of ever more targeted medicines.J&J’s diversification also contributes to its breadth of executive experience. “There are more J&J people with longer tenure than elsewhere,” he says. “Almost everybody in the executive group has been 25 years with the company. You can create a career without having to leave.”Mr Weldon believes in decentralisation, with divisions, run by “people who really know the business, markets and its products”.But further centralisation of functions, including manufacturing and administration, is likely in the latest restructuring.In the future, J&J is likely to take more minority equity stakes and develop partnerships like its recent investments in Crucell and Elan, and a joint drug development project with Gilead. The high costs, risks and uncertainties of healthcare make the case for such “risk-sharing” deals, he says.Some investors argue that J&J would still be worth more if broken up. Mr Weldon cites reverently as “our credo” the company principles drawn up in 1943 by Robert Wood Johnson, the chairman and member of the founding family of shareholders. It laid out shared responsibilities to patients, customers, staff, the community and – last – to shareholders.“They talk about a fair return to stockholders, not the best absolute return,” he says."
168;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-11-03T22:52:55Z;ViiV vows joint venture will help fight HIV;;The new head of the pioneering HIV joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer predicts his company can operate for at least five years without fresh funding from its shareholders.Dominique Limet, chief executive of ViiV Healthcare, which was formally launched on Tuesday, says it will generate £1.6bn a year in sales to finance its own research and would begin paying a dividend to its two owners in 2011 as it sells new products.“By being 100 per cent dedicated to HIV, we will reach more patients and do much more than either company on its own, with more products, more reach and more focus,” he says, stressing how the field is evolving as patients with HIV age and develop other illnesses that need to be treated in different ways.The joint venture, first outlined by the two large pharmaceutical groups in April, has been hailed by some as a clever way of sharing the risks and costs of drug development.But others view it more critically as a way for its parent companies to gradually withdraw from the field.Gbola Amusa, pharmaceuticals analyst with UBS in London, says: “This could well go down as one of the most innovative and important deals in pharma in the past 10 years. This is an out-of-the-box way to handle industry’s biggest issue: excess capacity.”ViiV, initially 85 per cent controlled by GSK and 15 per cent by Pfizer, combines the former’s well-established group of existing HIV medicines with the latter’s portfolio of drugs, which are largely still in development.The advantages for GSK include boosting future sales and keeping its marketing and manufacturing facilities in business, as its own drugs move towards patent expiry, while for Pfizer it avoids creating a new infrastructure as it seeks to refocus activities and cut costs.The arrangement allows the partners to share the risks and uncertainties of new drug development and to combine forces in a therapeutic field in which combinations of different medicines are essential to tackle disease.Mr Limet also stresses that creating a smaller company focused on a single therapeutic area will rekindle the spirit of innovation by allowing “nimbler responses”.ViiV will initially have 500 staff, plus be able to call – for a fee – on an extra 600 staff from its parent companies. However, he enters the HIV market at a difficult time. Pressure from activists and competition has slashed prices for antiretroviral therapy in the developing world, albeit while boosting total volumes.The science remains challenging, with Roche recently pulling out of the field entirely. Rivals are also expanding with their own therapies established using alternative approaches to partnership.The combined portfolio of HIV therapies from Pfizer and GSK – one of the pioneers in the field – is now only about 19 per cent of the global market of $8.4bn (£5.1bn), far behind the leader Gilead of the US, with 31 per cent.Gilead has combined its own medicines with those of other developers including Bristol-Myers Squibb, mixing them together to produce treatments such as Atripla.Theoretically, ViiV is just as free to forge alliances with third-party developers of medicines. It could have first right of refusal on new drugs in early stage research at GSK and Pfizer, once they show promise in initial trials. In practice, the dominance of its partners may hamper such freedom. Mr Limet says there are no current talks with any other partners to license their medicines, nor to seek other external funders or bring in non-executive directors other than those from GSK and Pfizer.That raises a final issue: whether in the long term Pfizer and GSK could seek to sell off their joint venture and leave the field entirely. GSK said there was no such “exit strategy” being considered.Mark Harrington, head of Treatment Action Group, a New York-based charity, says: “We want to know if they’re trying to spin off a less profitable line to focus on more lucrative targets.“We’d love to be proved wrong here. With ever earlier recommendations to treat HIV, novel compounds for treatment and prevention are urgently needed.”
169;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-10-25T22:48:36Z;J&J wants deals with rivals to share risk;;"Johnson & Johnson, the US healthcare group, will in future take more long-term minority stakes and forge alliances with rival pharmaceuticals companies in an effort to share the rising costs and risks of drug development.William Weldon, chief executive, told the Financial Times: “The cost of developing compounds has become so high and become so risky that we are looking to share the risks and opportunities and find more and more partnerships.”His remarks reflect a trend even by large, cash-generative pharmaceuticals companies to find new ways to share the potential costs as well as the profits in proving the safety and efficacy of new drugs to regulators and winning agreement by healthcare systems to reimburse them.Mr Weldon stressed that he had no deals under consideration, but that US healthcare reform had added even more uncertainty to the environment for drug development. “You’ll see more and more sharing of risks because the upside can be spectacular.”The comments came in an interview after J&J recently approved alliances involving the purchase of 18 per cent of the equity of Elan, the Ireland-domiciled biotech company, for Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis drugs, and a similar investment in Crucell, the Dutch vaccines business.In a different tack, J&J also this summer signed an alliance with Gilead, the US biotech group, by joint trials to develop a once-daily HIV therapy combining J&J’s experimental medicine TMC278, with Gilead’s Truvada, which combines its drugs Viread and Emtriva.J&J has long managed at arm’s length many subsidiaries in its three divisions covering consumer healthcare, medical devices and drugs. It allows them to retain considerable autonomy. But it has usually chosen fully to acquire these companies and centralise back-office operations.A growing number of large pharmaceuticals companies that traditionally took full control of drug development are forging similar partnerships to share risks, including
GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, which are combining their experimental and existing HIV medicines into a joint venture.Bristol-Myers Squibb has agreed joint drug development projects with AstraZeneca for cancer and with Gilead for HIV.As a result of its Elan deal, J&J has also become linked to Elan’s existing partners, Biogen Idec and Wyeth, now part of Pfizer, with which it is developing Alzheimer’s drugs. “We are very happy to partner with Wyeth,” Mr Weldon said.In both Elan and Crucell deals, the company has agreed to a standstill in its equity holdings for the coming years."
170;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-10-11T21:40:31Z;Gilead tops list for best investor value;;"In a volatile decade for the corporate world and its investors, Gilead Sciences, Apple and British American Tobacco stood out for their performances, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.The three companies top the list for creating the most value for their shareholders relative to peers that trade on the same home stock market.Gilead, the US medical device company, posted a total return more than 36 per cent better than the average listing, BCG said.Something that was more remarkable was that the company outperformed the market every year from 1999-2008.Apple, maker of the ubiquitous iPod music device and other consumer electronics, produced a total return 25 per cent better than that of the average company.BAT, a consumer goods company, boasted a return of almost 18 per cent above its local market average, according to BCG.There were four mining and materials companies, including Brazil’s Vale and BHP Billiton of Australia, and four medical technology manufacturers within the top 25.Although some of the top performers clearly benefited from some of the decade’s sweeping trends – for example, globalisation and rising commodity prices – the list’s overall diversity suggest there is more than one way to generate consistently good returns for investors.“When you get to top ranks, the secular trends don’t matter as much,” said Eric Olsen, a senior partner at BCG and one of the study’s authors.“It’s what you do with your company’s strategy, your capital deployment and your management agenda,” Mr Olsen added.Utilities such as Exelon of the US and Germany’s Eon found spots on the Top 25 list, as did mature industrial companies, including Lockheed Martin, Schlumberger and United Technologies.McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble also made the list.Mr Olsen and his co-authors’ study will be released on Tuesday.They observed that the decade’s most successful companies often took one of four pathways.They each delivered sales growth well above their home country’s gross domestic product; they churned out enough cash to appease investors; they transformed their portfolio of businesses through a series of timely acquisitions and divestitures; or they simply found a combination of ways to exceed shareholders’ expectations consistently.Gilead and Apple benefited from surging demand for their products, while the renewed focus of McDonald’s on boosting margins even as growth slowed rewarded investors with a total return of 7.9 per cent above the market average, Mr Olsen said.Of course, the Top 25 companies now have more in common than just an impressive 10-year total return: they face the daunting task of remaining at the head of the ranking for the next decade, he said.“It’s a matter of being able to beat expectations continuously,” Mr Olsen said.“That’s hard to do.”"
171;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-09-02T20:59:31Z;India overturns HIV drug patents;;HIV patients in developing countries stand to gain greater access to life-saving treatment after Indian authorities overturned the patents on a leading anti­retroviral drug.The Delhi patent office upheld an appeal by Cipla, the Indian generic drug maker, to reject the intellectual protection on tenofovir, known by the brand name Viread, one of the widely used HIV treatments.The decision, which could still be challenged by a parallel patent filing, eases constraints holding back India’s thriving low-cost generic drug companies from producing cheaper versions of the drug for sale in emerging markets. It also raises the prospect of greater competition and deeper price cuts.It is a blow to Gilead, the US-based biotechnology group that developed tenofovir and sought to streng-then international control over the drug. It will also hit the local companies with which it has lowered the cost of the drug to the poorest while protecting exclusivity in middle-­income markets.Yusuf Hamied, head of Cipla, said: “I am absolutely delighted. This is one of the world’s largest anti-Aids drugs and now I am free to promote it.”While seeking to use tougher patent protection on drugs introduced by India in 2005, Gilead had licensed local producers to make tenofovir but required them to pay royalties and not to sell the drug into middle-income countries such as Brazil and China.Cipla refused to agree to the terms and chose to challenge the patent while producing the drug, but many low-income countries were reluctant to buy its low-cost version for fear that the company would be forced to cease production if the patent were upheld.While low-income countries where tenofovir was not patented could buy the drug from generic suppliers, India’s patent laws made it difficult for its domestic manufacturers to produce them even for export.Gilead said it would consider its options once notified by the patent office.

John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.
173;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-05-13T21:30:20Z;Generic flu drug challenge to Tamiflu;;An Indian pharmaceutical company is gearing up to sell a cheap version of the leading patented antiviral flu drug Tamiflu to emerging economies, in a move that will pitch intellectual property rights against affordable access to medicines.Cipla, based in Mumbai, said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell significant quantities of its Antiflu preparation to Mexico, the country at the centre of the current flu outbreak.The move came only hours after the World Health Organisation said the drug was as effective as Tamiflu.Yusuf Hamied, the head of Cipla, confirmed that Mexico had already agreed in principle to purchase stocks of Antiflu, and talks were under way with a number of other governments in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.The launch risks provoking a clash with Gilead and Roche, the large pharmaceutical companies that developed and distribute Tamiflu, the drug known generically as oseltamivir, which Antiflu replicates.Cipla recently won a case within India against Gilead, which holds the patents on Tamiflu, paving the way for the manufacture of its version.If Mexico now issues a compulsory licence to waive the patent on the drug, existing international trade rules would allow purchases of Antiflu, although intense lobbying by large pharmaceutical companies has severely limited such practices until now.Amar Lulla, Cipla’s managing director, stressed he would only sell stocks of Antiflu to Mexico and other countries on condition that they indemnified the company against any legal action over patents.He said his company would offer Antiflu for sale at about $10 per course of treatment. Roche sells Tamiflu for government pandemic stockpiles at €15 ($20) for richer countries and €12 for poorer ones.Roche refused to say on Wednesday whether it would launch legal action, but stressed it was in continuing discussion with Mexico, to which it had supplied 1m doses of Tamiflu in recent weeks.It said: “We appreciate the current health situation in Mexico and we respect the right of all governments to take action on behalf of its citizens. Roche has confirmed its willingness and ability to provide the Mexican government with Tamiflu in significant quantities in a timely manner and therefore sees no rationale for compulsory licensing.”The company has already licensed several other generic companies with the right to produce Tamiflu, although only Cipla – with which it did not agree any deal – has so far filed for “pre-qualification” with the WHO, a process certifying the quality of its manufacturing and equivalence to another drug.
174;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-05-13T20:09:28Z;Female staff work to their strengths;;The financial crisis and widespread layoffs in the City have made many women anxious about their future but have also prompted them to redouble their efforts to network and find fresh career paths.The 2,000 spots at the eighth annual Women in European Business conference, held in London yesterday, sold out within 48 hours and 45 per cent of those attending were there for the first time, according to Deutsche Bank, the conference sponsor.As hundreds of women in suits exchanged business cards over cocktails and listened to panel discussions at the Barbican, some expressed anxiety at the effect of the credit crunch on an industry that is already heavily male.“If you look at the redundancies, a lot of the women have gone,” said one top City professional. “The senior managers think: ‘If I can only keep one, who is going to be there at 8pm on Sunday night?’ I’m hoping that I am wrong and they don’t think that way, but I don’t think I am.”A survey of 1,650 of those attending yesterday’s gathering found 46 per cent thought the recession would have a negative impact on their position in business vis a vis their male counterparts, while 31 per cent said there would be no gender differences. That pessimistic view surfaces despite the fact that more than half the participants thought their organisation had made at least moderate progress in supporting its female employees during the past three years.Conference speakers adopted a more upbeat attitude, arguing the financial crisis had formed new opportunities for women and reminded corporate leadership of the value of diversity.“The financial crisis has made us all focus on short-term imperatives, but it also gives us the chance to define a new vision of the future,” said Josef Ackermann, chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank.“A diverse team is a smarter team and one that makes better decisions than a homogenous group. The teams who were diverse did much better in the crisis,” he said.Siobhan Caragher, a conference visitor and a headhunter at Russell Reynolds, said the crisis has increased demand for female directors among her insurance industry clients. “Boards now understand the value of a senior woman. Women are prepared to ask questions and say: ‘I don’t understand that’,” she said.But Marilyn Spearing, global head of cash and trade at Deutsche Bank, warned women will need to abandon the easy strategy of being the good soldier and following established tracks.“There’s loads of opportunity still. The question is: how light on your feet are you? How ready are you to seize the opportunity,” she said. “It is understanding that you have an obstacle – and you are going to have to find a way around it.”Deutsche Bank and its predecessor companies have been targeting women in financial services for more than a decade. Its Women on Wall Street conference is 15 years old. A companion Women in European Business conference in Frankfurt held its 10th annual gathering this week.Despite the financial dislocation, the bank says it has not cut back on diversity programmes. “We believe that – in a time like this – it really benefits the franchise in the long term. It makes the whole commitment more credible,” said Eileen Taylor, Deutsche’s head of diversity.
175;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-04-28T20:43:41Z;Wall St slips despite bright data;;"US stocks slipped on Tuesday after a day of fluctuations as better-than-expected economic data mitigated fears over capital positions at Citigroup and Bank of America.The two banking groups fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve had told Citi and Bank of America they might need more capital after seeing early results of the banking stress tests.The Journal was the second newspaper to report that Citigroup might need more capital, based on the test results. The Financial Times said the same on Saturday.The company lost 5.9 per cent to $2.89, while Bank of America fell 8.6 per cent to $8.15.Losses in the financial sector were balanced by gains elsewhere after data showing consumer confidence jumped during April sparked buying of consumer stocks.Analysts had been expecting only a modest rise, and the surprise news led to Nikeadvancing 2.7 per cent to $55.59 and handbag and accessory retailer Coach gaining 6.1 per cent to $23.48.Office Depot reported a surprise profit for the first quarter and jumped 11.5 per cent to $2.82.Further support for the markets came from figures showing the fall in house prices slowed in February. On an annual basis, the figures showed the first improvement in the rate of change since December 2005.There was an extra boost for equities from the fact that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area during April contracted at a slower pace than last month, a
better performance than analysts expected.Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investments, said: “Over the course of the morning, we have nothing but phenomenal data. The market has taken all of those things and decided things are getting better.”The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 855.16 points and 1,673.81 points respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.1 per cent to 8,016.95 points.There was some good news for healthcare stocks, which have been one of the few beneficiaries of the spread of swine flu because of the potential for increased demand of drugs and medical care.Gilead Sciences continued to build on its gains of the previous session. The company, which developed the flu drug Tamiflu, rose 0.2 per cent to $47.60 as investors bet on high demand for the product with the number of people affected by swine flu continuing to rise.Waters Corp, the laboratory services company, led the healthcare sector higher after reporting rising profits in spite of falling revenues. Its shares jumped 16.3 per cent to $43.83. But the global drug giants Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb both struggled for momentum in spite of reporting better results than expected.Pfizer lost 0.7 per cent to $13.39 after its first-quarter revenues disappointed Wall Street, even though successful cost cuts allowed the company to beat expectations and reaffirm its full-year profit outlook.Bristol-Myers Squibb made a similar announcement as revenues fell short of forecasts, but cost-cutting efforts meant the company reported marginally better earnings than expected. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to $19.65.There was added strength from the health insurance sector after Coventry Health Care announced it beat analysts’ estimates with its earnings in spite of a drop in profits. The stock picked up 7.1 per cent to $15.22.But US Steel tumbled after reporting losses that were more than double what analysts had forecast and cut its dividend after steel prices plunged.The company said it would issue shares and notes to pay off debt, about $1.6bn of which was downgraded to junk by Moody’s. The company’s shares fell 5.6 per cent to $26.15.Other steel companies also suffered after the World Steel Association warned on Monday that global demand for was likely to fall 14.9 per cent this year.AK Steel lost 1.1 per cent to $11.72 while Nucor fell 3.7 per cent to $37.50.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the market could continue to rally in spite of Tuesday’s falls. “Everybody wants to see a pull back, but if everybody wants it to go down, it won’t go down. The markets tend to frustrate most people.”"
176;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
177;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-04-22T20:52:15Z;US stocks fall in volatile trading;;"US equities fell on Wednesday as a late sell-off in the financial sector erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street as investors digested another busy day of earnings.Morgan Stanley fell after bad debts and real estate writedowns wiped out trading gains during the first quarter. The stock lost 9 per cent to $22.44.Capital One exacerbated ongoing fears of rising bad debts in the financial sector after reporting heavier losses than expected and putting aside more money for future defaults.It raised its guidance for the amount of money it would lose from defaulted payments, saying there was “significant uncertainty” over the outlook, and its shares closed 4.5 per cent down at $14.38.The results kept the markets lower despite a rally during the day triggered
by comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that the government wanted to retreat from the banking sector as soon as possible.“What Mr Geithner knows that the market does not is the results of the bank stress tests,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams. “I would assume he thinks they are relatively positive or he wouldn’t be thinking we are out of the woods yet.”But neither Mr Geithner’s comments nor figures showing house prices unexpectedly rose during March were able to lift the gloom by the time the markets closed.Even Wells Fargo got caught in the late selling in spite of doubling its revenues to $21bn as more homeowners paid to refinance their mortgages.The bank sparked a steep rally earlier in the month by predicting record profits. But chief financial officer Howard Atkins sounded a more cautious note when he said he did not know what the government would say following their evaluation of lenders’ balance sheets. The company’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.18.The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.8 per cent to 843.55 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 7,886.57 points. The Nasdaq Composite index once more outperformed the other two, gaining 0.1 per cent to 1,646.12 points.“It seems we are stuck again,” said Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets. “We are trading in a range, and that is simply part of the bottoming process.”The Nasdaq was bolstered by Yahoo, the internet search company, which said it would cut 5 per cent of its worldwide staff after reporting earnings in line with expectations. The company’s shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.48.Telecoms was a top performer on the S&P after AT&T reported earnings considerably ahead of estimates with revenues bolstered by customers transferring data over wireless services, especially on Apple’s iPhone. That boosted AT&T’s shares 1.8 per cent to $25.74.Apple lost 0.2 per cent to $121.51 ahead of earnings due out after the bell.Several industrial companies gained as Mr Geithner said he saw some stabilisation of global demand, helping the sector perform better than any other on the S&P.General Electric’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to $11.80 as its top executives addressed a shareholder meeting, during which Jeff Immelt, chief executive, reiterated his prediction that the company’s finance arm would make a profit for 2009.Meanwhile, Caterpillar built on the previous session’s gains, which came on the back of better-than- expected results, after JPMorgan upgraded the company to “overweight”. Its shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.45.Boeing climbed, even though it made less profit than analysts predicted as the company kept its full-year earnings forecasts above analysts’ estimates. The stock gained 1.8 per cent to $37.30.Ingersoll-Rand, which makes refrigeration equipment, announced a narrower loss than expected and its shares rose 15.7 per cent to $19.35.Freeport McMoRan, the copper maker, bucked the trend, however, after reporting tumbling revenues and profits on weak demand and low metals prices.Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $40.45.Elsewhere, Gilead Sciences was one of the top gainers on the S&P, advancing 5.7 per cent to $46.22 after reporting rising revenues on the back of strong sales of its Aids drugs."
178;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-04-16T17:38:34Z;GSK and Pfizer to merge HIV portfolios;;Two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical groups on Thursday said they would spin out their entire portfolios of HIV medicines into a jointly controlled company, heralding a radical new approach to the sale and development of drugs.GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer will contribute 11 marketed medicines and a further six that are currently being tested in patients into the new company with initial gross assets of £250m, annual sales of £1.6bn and operating profits of £870m, and a 19 per cent market share.The move marks a way for the two companies to pool efforts in a therapeutic area with tough scientific challenges that has come under intense pricing pressure and in which they have been outstripped commercially by rivals led by Gilead, the US biotech company. Others such as Roche of Switzerland have pulled out of HIV research.The new structure may pave the way for further similar actions by the companies and other large pharmaceutical groups - to create more innovative, tightly focused spin-offs in a range of therapeutic areas, allowing them to share the high risks and costs of drug development.Andrew Witty, GSK’s chief executive, said: ”This reinvigorates GSK’s presence as one of the largest companies operating in the field [of HIV] …This is a new and unique way of incentivising research success and deciding how to allocate research and development capital.”Jeff Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive, said: ”We are creating a new global leader in HIV and reaffirming our ongoing commitment to the treatment of the disease.”In the complex deal, GSK will initially control 85 per cent and Pfizer the remaining 15 per cent of the equity, with GSK’s share rising as high as 91 per cent or falling to 69.5 per cent depending on the relative success of the two companies’ drugs in meeting mutually agreed ”milestones” for future development. Differential performance will also trigger payment of preferential dividends.The new company - which has yet to be named and is expected to be formally launched later this year - will have the rights to license in promising earlier stage HIV research still being conducted by GSK and Pfizer, as well as from third parties.It will allow cost savings by 2011 of £60m a year. GSK said the transaction would dilute earnings per share by 1-2 per cent in 2010, 1 per cent in 2011 and then reverse as the spin-off creates new sales. Pfizer said it would be neutral to earnings in 2009 and slightly accretive in 2010 and 2011.Gbola Amusa, pharmaceuticals analyst with UBS, the investment bank, in London, said the move could herald a wave of collaborative transactions leading to company break ups and sales: ”We’ll look back in a few years and highlight this deal as being industry-shifting.”
179;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-04-03T22:38:53Z;Late rally bucks grim US jobs data;;US stocks rallied late in the day on Friday to take the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 8,000 points and complete a fourth successive week of gains for the first time since the market peaked in October 2007.The gains came in spite of downbeat economic data as US unemployment hit 8.5 per cent, its highest level since 1983. This was in line with analysts’ estimates, and after an initial fall, the equities market remained resilient.Figures showing that activity in the services sector fell for the sixth consecutive month extended the losses, but stocks recovered in the last hour to find positive territory.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent up at 842.5 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 8,017.59. The Nasdaq Composite index was helped by strength from technology stocks, rising 1.2 per cent to 1,621.87 points. The three gained 3-5 per cent this week.Financial stocks took comfort from the fact that the data were not worse, and the sector rose 4.2 per cent.Healthcare stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as Wachovia said the government’s proposals to cut subsidies to health insurers as part of the healthcare reform package could cost those companies as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana and United Health, two of the biggest beneficiaries of such subsidies, lost 5.7 per cent to $25.46 and 2.5 per cent to $20.54 respectively.But other areas of the market held up well, with signs that consumer spending was strengthening.Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry mobile phone, stunned the market with its quarterly earnings, reporting a 26 per cent increase in net income as the company benefited from much better than expected consumer spending. The company’s shares jumped 20.8 per cent to $59.29 on the Nasdaq.The news fuelled hope that consumer spending might be rising in the technology sector overall and Apple gained 2.9 per cent to $115.99, while Dell rose 8.6 per cent to $10.32.The sector was boosted by reports that IBM’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems might be nearing completion, although for a lower price than at first thought.IBM’s shares rose 1.4 per cent to $102.22 and Sun gained 3.4 per cent to $8.49, moving towards the reported new offer of $9.55 per share.Google’s gains were limited, as Techcrunch, the website, reported the company might be in talks to buy Twitter, the microblogging service that has become the latest online craze. Google’s shares rose 2 per cent to $369.78.Micron Technology, the biggest US producer of computer memory chips, damped enthusiasm as it reported a quarterly loss with a lack of demand driving down prices. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $4.50.Qwest helped take the telecoms sector higher, as investors continued to respond to reports that it was considering selling its long-haul network. Its shares picked up 8.6 per cent to $3.91.Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 5.4 per cent to $20.17 after Sanford Bernstein said the drugmaker was less likely than others to be taken over in the industry’s latest bout of consolidation.Fellow drugmaker Gilead Sciences rose 5.1 per cent to $46.98 after it said trials of an experimental drug had shown it helped lower blood pressure.During the week a relaxation of mark-to-market accounting and global unity at the G20 helped stocks recover after suffering losses when the White House rejected GM’s restructuring plans, sparking fears the company might soon go into bankruptcy.But some commentators warned that the short-term rally was masking a deeper malaise. Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com, said: “This is a bear market rally. Mark-to-market is simply covering economic problems. Just because you rig the scale, doesn’t mean you have lost weight.”
180;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-16T23:56:56Z;Astellas drops hostile bid for CV Therapeutics;;Astellas, the Japanese drugmaker, capitulated on Monday and dropped its $1.1bn hostile takeover bid for biotechnology company CV Therapeutics rather than bidding against a higher, friendly offer from competitor Gilead Sciences.Astellas is in partnership with CV to market Lexiscan, one of CV’s top-selling cardiovascular drugs, and had been looking to take control of the entire company to fill out its product portfolio and its pipeline of drugs in development.But after repeatedly rejecting Astellas’s advances, CV announced last week that it had agreed to sell itself for $1.4bn to Gilead, a biotech company that develops drugs to treat cancer and a range of viral and infectious diseases.Astellas, which had offered $16 a share, said on Monday that was a “disciplined acquirer and does not see value for Astellas stockholders in CV Therapeutics at the price level of the sale” to Gilead, set at $20 a share.Tokyo-based Astellas said it plans to drop a lawsuit it had filed in Delaware against CV and its directors.Several massive mergers have been struck between global pharmaceuticals companies this year, including Pfizer’s $68bn deal to buy Wyeth and Merck’s $41bn deal to buy Schering-Plough.Recent transactions involving biotech companies, however, have been harder fought, due in part to richer valuations that are based on better prospects for biotech companies’ innovative drug platforms and pipelines.Global drug giants are eager to control biotech assets, but the tough equity markets have not knocked biotech sellers’ expectations down enough to make for easy takeovers.Roche had pressed Genentech over an unsolicited takeover offer since July before Genentech agreed last week to an offer worth $46.8bn, or $95 a share. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s effort last year to buy ImClone, its longstanding partner, failed after ImClone said it deserved a higher bid and eventually secured one from Eli Lilly.Astellas withdrew its offer the same day Canada’s Agrium, a fertiliser maker, launched a $3.3bn hostile exchange offer to buy key US rival CF Industries as part of another three-way takeover battle.But while CV Therapeutics was able to find a suitable “white knight” bidder to top Astellas’s unwanted offer, the affections between CF, Agrium and Terra remain unrequited so far.CF has rejected a bid of about $69 a share from Agrium, a top competitor in the North American crop nutrient business, and has instead raised its own unsolicited bid for smaller rival Terra Industries.
181;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-16T19:56:14Z;Wall St snaps four-day winning streak;;US stocks fell sharply in late trade, giving up previous gains to finish slightly below Friday’s close as American Express announced more people had trouble paying credit card bills in February.The news prompted a slump in the company’s shares, which finished 3.3 per cent down at $12.66. It also dragged down the financial sector, which had enjoyed an early banking-led rally.Shares in Citigroup surged back above $2, gaining 30.9 per cent to $2.33 as confidence in the banking sector continued to rise after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s leading banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.The sector was also given a boost when Barclays of the UK added its name to the big banks that have said they started the year well.Last week Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009.Bank of America rose 7.3 per cent to $6.18 but JPMorgan fell after American Express’ announcement, losing 2.8 per cent to $23.09.Financial companies were also helped by messages from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed changes to the mark-to-market accounting rule, which has been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.The board proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is “distressed” when measuring the value of an asset.Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 8.1 per cent to $19.17 and Prudential lifting 1.8 per cent to $19.10.Capital One provided some relief from American Express’ news after it announced reduced the numbers of auto loans it believes will never be repaid. Its shares gained 0.1 per cent to $12.57.But many investors still feel the recent rally by financial stocks is flimsy. Terry Morris, senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, said: “Citi’s rise is based on speculative buying that leads to short-covering. The company is not 40 per cent better than it was on Friday.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 753.89, having earlier been over 2 per cent higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 7,216.97.Weakness from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which lost 1.9 per cent to 1,404.02.Cisco announced on Monday it was to sell servers for data systems in partnership with smaller technology companies. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $15.45.Analysts said the deal might herald other large companies in the sector snapping up smaller rivals, but shares in many of those companies still fell as investors moved their money back into riskier sectors.Oracle, which was named specifically by Barron’s, the publication for investors, as a potential purchaser, was one of the biggest drags on the sector, losing 4.2 per cent to $14.90. Intel meanwhile fell 3.1 per cent to $14.25 and Dell dropped 5 per cent to $8.90.Investors had looked to the cash-rich technology sector as a defensive trade but as financials strengthened, it became the day’s biggest faller. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “People are coming back to the financial sector and seeing some recovery in healthcare stocks.”Industrial stocks were led higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected.Investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company and the company’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $9.66.Consol Energy rallied in spite of the falling price of oil, rising 5.5 per cent to $27.48 after Barron’s said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making it a bargain.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 5 per cent to $19.64 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead lost 2.7 per cent to $44.19.
182;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-16T14:27:15Z;Wall Street on course for fifth day of rises;;Financials led the way once more on Monday morning as US stocks headed towards their fifth day of rises for the first time since November.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave the equities markets an early boost after he appeared on national television on Sunday night and reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s major banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.His words helped further bolster confidence in the banking sector, which was given a jolt when the British bank Barclays added its name to the major banks which have recently said they had a good start to the year. Last week Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009. They rose further in early trade on Monday. Citi was 19.7 per cent up at $2.13, Bank of America rose 10.7 per cent to $6.39 and JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $24.50.Financial companies were also helped by messages from The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is ”distressed.” “There is likely to be a change which allows illiquid assets not to be marked and requires liquid assets to be marked,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global. Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 12 per cent to $19.87 and Prudential lifting 9.4 per cent to $20.53.Industrial stocks were dragged higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected. GE continued its gains of last week as investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company. This comes after S&P downgraded the company by only one notch last week, a less aggressive move than many had anticipated.Energy stocks managed to stay stable even after OPEC triggered a fall in the price of oil by saying it would not cut output. The price for a barrel of US crude fell $1.98 to $44.27, but investors seemed to take solace in the news that the cartel would crack down on member countries exceeding their quotas. Chevron gained 0.2 per cent to $63.04, while ExxonMobil also lifted 0.2 per cent to $67.32 after Citigroup put a “buy” rating on its stock in new coverage. Consol Energy outperformed the sector, rising 2.3 per cent to $26.86 after Barron’s the publication for investors, said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making its stock a bargain.All three major market measures were up, with the benchmark S&P 500 index 1.2 ahead on 765.57, the Dow Jones industrial Average picking up 1 per cent to 7,293.83 The Nasdaq Composite index was steady at 1,431.42.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 4.6 per cent to $19.71 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company.

Asian equity markets closed at their highest levels in a month, led by a 3.6 per cent rise in the Hang Seng to 12,976.71.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 3 basis points to 0.988 per cent and on the 10-year Treasury note by 6bp to 2.949 per cent.The dollar was down against major currencies early in New York, falling to $1.41 against the pound.Gold was trading $0.88 lower at $921.65 per troy ounce.
183;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-13T20:55:21Z;Health care sector provides Wall St tonic gains;;US stocks clung on to their gains on Friday during a choppy trading session as rises in healthcare stocks took equities to their best weekly performance since November.Merck, the pharmaceutical company, gained 12.7 per cent to $27.07 after Bernstein upgraded the company to “outperform”, saying it had agreed a “very fair price” for rival Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough also gained, rising 8.5 per cent to $24.21.Humana, the health insurer, also gained on speculation reported by Bloomberg that it was the subject of a takeover bid. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $24.83.But CV Therapeutics lost ground after Japan’s Astellas said it might not re-bid for the company after it accepted a rival bid from Gilead Sciences. CV lost 1.8 per cent to $20.67.The financial sector finished in positive territory as gains in the banking sector outweighed fears over bad debts in the credit card market. Banks received a boost after Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, said the bank would not need more capital injections from government, further allaying fears of nationalisation. Citi gained 6.6 per cent to $1.78, and JPMorgan picked up 2.4 per cent to $23.75.But credit card companies Discover Financial and Capital One both lost out, the latter after announcing a change to executives’ compensation schemes that will convert cash bonuses and equity incentives into salary and restricted stock. Discover fell 5.9 per cent to $6.23 and Capital One lost 5.6 per cent to $12.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained 0.8 per cent to 756.55 points and 7,223.98 points respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent at 1,431.5 points. The gains followed a surge on Thursday after Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, became the third leading bank boss to say his company had been profitable for the first two months of 2009.The market was given a boost late on Thursday when President Barack Obama said he would be willing to consider lowering the corporate tax rate if people within business helped him to close tax loopholes.The energy sector put pressure on the S&P after OPEC cut its forecast for oil demand, with Chevron losing 0.8 per cent to $62.91.Palm was one of the biggest gainers after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the cellphone manufacturer to outperform from sector perform, based on its plans to dominate the smartphone market. Its shares lifted 6.7 per cent to $8.39.It was not all good news for technology stocks, as National Semiconductor, the chipmaker, was downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency. The company lost 8.8 per cent to $10.05.Warren Buffett spent Monday talking up the stocks he holds, but his company remains too exposed to losses on its portfolio, says Fitch, which cut Berkshire Hathaway’s AAA rating. Shares then fell 3.2 per cent.
184;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-12T21:10:56Z;S&P 500 back above 750 level;;"US stocks surged on Thursday as a steady stream of positive messages helped financials drag the benchmark S&P 500 index above the psychologically important 750 level.Ken Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, became the third head of a leading bank to say it had been profitable in 2009. This followed a leaked memo from Citigroup’s Vikram Pandit on Monday and a speech by Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan on Wednesday saying similar things.Bank of America jumped 18.7 per cent to $5.85, while JPMorgan closed 13.7 per cent up at $23.20 and Citigroup gained 8.4 per cent to $1.67.Financial stocks led all three market measures sharply higher. The S&P 500 closed 4.1 per cent up at 750.74, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.5 per cent to 7,170.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 4 per cent to 1,416.10. The S&P has now gained more than 10 per cent in the past three sessions.The market was also helped by news from Washington, where members of Congress suggested they would put pressure on the Financial Accounting Standards Board to reform mark-to-market accounting rules, which have been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.“This is exactly what the market wanted to see”, said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Investors don’t want Congress to get involved too heavily with the FASB, but the mark-to-market rule is clearly the wrong instrument at this time for these assets.”Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners said: “The SEC is not going to change the rule but the market is looking for some kind of modification. If that were to happen, you could see some sort of explosive rally.”Even American Express was caught up in the buying, in spite of Citi cutting its price target on the stock from $14 to $9. Its shares rose 10.2 per cent to $13.15.General Electric was an unexpected winner, despite Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, cutting the company’s rating to AA-plus with a stable outlook.The company said it did not anticipate any significant operational or funding impacts from the downgrade. The upbeat message, coupled with the fact that bearish investors had already priced in worse news, helped GE bounce
12.7 per cent to $9.57.Healthcare stocks were a leading driver, having been boosted by Pfizer. The drug company said it had seen “significant benefit” from a new drug to treat pancreatic cancer. Its shares jumped 9.6 per cent to $14.02.Genentech also gained ground after it finally struck a deal for European drug manufacturer Roche to buy all its remaining shares for $46.8bn. Genentech’s stock rose 1.9 per cent to $93.92.Gilead Sciences joined the current trend for consolidation in the sector, agreeing a $1.4bn takeover deal for CV TherapeuticsShares in CV leapt 31.5 per cent on the news to $21.04 and Gilead gained 0.9 per cent to $44.43.Meanwhile, retail sales fell much less than expected during February, according to figures released on Thursday. The news helped Wal-Mart pick up 3.1 per cent to $48.94.Any gains from the positive data were limited, however, by the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits hit a new record.Energy stocks followed the price of oil higher. Chevron gained 3.6 per cent to $63.40 and Exxon Mobil picked up 2.1 per cent to $67.15.General Motors the embattled carmaker, managed to gain ground after it said it did not immediately need $2bn in government aid that it had previously requested.The company said its own cost-cutting exercise had allowed it to defer this payment. Its shares rose 17.2 per cent to $2.18.Steelmakers fared less well, however, as Steel Dynamics reported a worse- than-expected loss for the first quarter. JPMorgan cut its earnings estimate for the industry as a whole and said Steel Dynamics as well as AK Steeland US Steel could be at risk of violating their debt covenants.Steel Dynamics slumped 15.2 per cent to $7.25, while AK Steel fell 0.8 per cent to $6.49 and US Steel dropped 1.2 per cent to $19.10."
185;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2009-03-12T19:26:03Z;Pharmas try different routes to survive;;"Rarely in the field of pharmaceuticals have so many companies adopted such varied strategies in order to survive the intensifying structural pressures in their industry.With three large-scale deals unveiled in less than two months totalling about $150bn – casting into obscurity a series of smaller deals such as Gilead’s $1.4bn bid Thursday for CV Therapeutics -– the pace of consolidation is almost unprecedented. But each brings its nuances; and none guarantees long-term success.The structural problems for large pharmaceutical companies have been evident for several years. The pace of successful innovation has slowed, as basic science has proved slow to translate into new medicines, while increasingly risk-averse regulators have delayed decisions and sought larger, longer and more costly trials.Imminent patent expirations and ever more aggressive generic drug company challenges have threatened long-standing sources of revenue. Healthcare systems have aggressively negotiated prices and started to refuse reimbursement of newer and costlier medicines which do not demonstrate significant additional therapeutic benefit over older drugs.These pressures have accelerated sharply, with the economic downturn restricting credit and spurring fresh cost cuts.Not all companies have suffered equally. Squeezed by the evaporation of lending and low investor appetite, smaller biotech groups have come under particular pressure, and become far more vulnerable to takeover or licensing deals on unfavourable terms to survive.The larger pharmaceutical companies, with strong cash flows and little immediate decline in sales, have fared better. But almost without exception, their first response has been accelerated cost cutting,, intensifying rounds of job cuts and outsourcing of production.Pfizer’s purchase of Wyeth, and Merck’s of Schering-Plough, are part of this trend, emphasising large and rapid “synergies” after they are combined. Even Roche’s buy-out of minorities at Genentech stresses very swift and significant savings.Roche is better placed than its rivals because of its portfolio of speciality medicines such as for cancer. These drugs are high priced, require relatively small sales forces, and meet the criteria sought by reimbursement agencies: they are innovative and demonstrate clear value over existing products.Such product specialisation is a second strategy, adopted by companies such as Shire, and increasingly emulated by larger companies such as AstraZeneca which previously concentrated on “small molecules” offering often limited additional therapeutic benefit, and requiring high marketing costs in a domestic market now stagnant.Simon Friend, global pharma and life sciences leader at PwC, the accountancy and consultancy firm, says: “The opportunities for developing primary-care treatments with the potential to command premium prices are shrinking and many of the medicines launched recently failed to qualify as innovative.”Eli Lilly has acquired Imclone, expanding into cancer therapies. Through Schering-Plough, Merck has done the same. With Wyeth, Pfizer has boosted its access to vaccines, a fast-growing niche.A third approach is geographical diversification into new, fast-growing regions. Emerging markets are the new area of hope, and one that companies such as AstraZeneca and Sanofi-Aventis in China and GlaxoSmithKline in India have helped lead, using “bolt on” acquisitions of individual products in particular regions bought from rivals.Meanwhile, all companies have tried to boost innovation. Most have adopted similar tactics, creating small, more accountable “biotech-style” teams. Until recently, Roche’s distinction was to do so at arms-length through companies like Genentech. Thursday’s deal suggests even the success of that model is coming into question."
186;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
187;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;GSK in A$20m Relenza settlement;;GlaxoSmithKline has paid A$20m (£9.75m) in a final settlement to Biota, the Australian biotech business that sued the UK-based pharmaceuticals company for allegedly failing to make sufficient efforts to market Relenza, its flu drug.The payment will be a disappointment to shareholders in Biota, which began litigation in 2004 and sought up to A$430m in damages after claiming that GSK had not met the conditions in its licensing agreement to use “best endeavours” in selling the medicine.The decision to abandon legal proceedings also fails to establish a broader precedent for other biotech companies attempting to impose tougher licensing conditions.Relenza was at first heralded as a pioneering “designer drug” and Biota hoped that rising interest in pandemic flu would boost sales.However, GSK struggled to sell the medicine – which has to be inhaled – and suffered setbacks including a refusal by the UK government’s medicines advisory body to recommend reimbursement by the National Health Service. Sales last year were £262m.Rival drug Tamiflu, developed by Gilead of the US and licensed to Roche of Switzerland, turned into a blockbuster as governments purchased preventative pandemic flu stockpiles.
188;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2007-06-18T20:59:42Z;Wall St lower as bond yields steady;;US stocks lost steam in range-bound trade on Monday, with deal activity, bond yields and oil prices remaining the main talking points for investors.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,531.06. Among the S&P’s major industry groups, energy stocks were higher as crude oil prices hit their highest level in nine months, and technology also rallied. The rate-sensitive utility sector lead declines among the major groups.Late on Monday, the yield on the 10-year bond loitered above its low set in early trade.The Nasdaq Composite was a fraction lower at 2,626.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,612.98.After a strong rebound late last week that propelled the S&P and blue chips back towards record territory, the outlook for equities remains contingent in part on yields and oil prices, say analysts.Recent economic data that have suggested the economy is entering summer on an upswing have boosted the outlook for stocks. But analysts caution that two areas of concern are higher oil prices – potentially sparking higher inflation in the coming months – and the state of the housing market, should yields continue to rise.“Oil could see an upside move towards $80,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.The recent rise in bond yields has increased mortgage rates and $1,000bn floating rate home loans expire in the next 12 months and may refinance at higher rates.“Stronger growth could push the 10-year yield towards 5.50 per cent,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. For now, the recent strength in equities, led by cyclicals, small caps and commodity stocks, “tells you that interest rates are not high enough to slow down stocks”, he added.And the rise in bond yields could augur higher equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index. The Vix, which is looked to as a barometer of volatility in the S&P 500, fell 3.5 per cent on Monday, below its recent peak of 17.09.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “Several lead indicators, including equity risk premiums, bond yield curve steepness, and private sector credit growth, suggest that equity market volatility is likely to pick up further over the next 18-24 months.”In such an environment, Mr Levkovich said, “large-cap equity market leadership becomes more pronounced when volatility climbs”, while technology, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology sectors have experienced a stronger stock price performance when Vix has risen in the past two decades.One leader in the technology industry in recent years has been Apple, and it was up 3.8 per cent to $125.09. The new iPhone, due in the US on June 29, will contain a battery that has much stronger life than previously expected.Another tech stock on the rise was Yahoo. After a gain of 3 per cent to $28.12 in regular trade, the stock jumped 3.3 per cent to $29.05 in after-hours trade when the company announced that Jerry Yang, co-founder of the company had been appointed chief executive officer. He will replace Terry Semel in the position.Talk of a possible $40bn bid for Alcoa by BHP Billiton sparked a 0.7 per cent rise to $41.88 in the aluminium group. Alcoa’s stock set a 52-week high of $42.90 earlier on Monday and has risen 39.6 per cent this year. Alcan, facing a hostile bid from Alcoa, was 0.8 per cent higher at $83.55.The battle for Dow Jones, sought by News Corp in a $5bn bid, was in the spotlight as General Electric and Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times, contemplated a competing proposal. Dow Jones was a fraction higher at $59.03, News Corp fell 1.4 per cent to $23.62, while GE lost 0.1 per cent to $38.07.Shares in CBOT Holdings rose 1.2 per cent to $209.40, and earlier set an all-time high of $209.50, on a report that rival bidders for the exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the IntercontinentalExchange would both raise their price for derivatives exchange for a third time. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice cleared a merger between CBOT and CME and shareholders in both exchanges meet on July 9 to vote on approving the merger. Shares in ICE were 1.6 per cent lower at $154.43, and CME lost 1.2 per cent to close at $545.99.In another corporate battle, Finish Line said it had agreed to acquire footwear and accessories retailer Genesco for $1.46bn, or $54.50 a share. Finish Line’s bid topped a bid of $51 recently made by Foot Locker. Genesco had urged shareholders to reject the Foot Locker bid. Genesco rose 8.4 per cent to $53.75, Finish Line slid 8.7 per cent to $11.53, and Foot Locker rose 1.1 per cent to $21.37.Shares in Cadence Design fell 3 per cent to $22.60, however amid talk that a bid by two private equity firms for the maker of chip design software had stalled over price terms.Gilead Sciences was down 0.4 per cent at $80.51, as its drug for lung disease won approval from US health officials on Friday.Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $147.95. Merrill Lynch said it would delay selling $400m in assets seized from a hedge fund managed by Bear Stearns.Molex, the maker of electromechanical components lowered guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter - ending in June - and its share price declined 2.1 per cent to $30.86.Shares in Halliburton fell 1.2 per cent to $35.92. Goldman Sachs downgraded the engineering company to “neutral” from “buy” due to rising competition in the natural gas business.US Steel fell 1.8 per cent to $114.06. UBS downgraded the steelmaker and said a deal, that has helped drive the stock up 56.3 per cent this year, may not be imminent.Shares in Wendy’s fell 3.7 per cent to $38.26, after the hamburger chain lowered lowered its 2007 earnings forecast, and would consider a possible sale of the company.
189;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2007-02-02T21:35:23Z;Wall St boosted by strong data;;Sentiment on Wall Street was boosted further this week by data suggesting the economy was growing at a healthy rate and inflation had moderated.Analysts believe a firm economy should boost earnings prospects this year. As broad markets rallied over the week, harbingers of long-term strength – transport sector stocks and smaller companies – both entered record territory.The Dow Jones Transports Average rose 6.2 per cent, extending gains this year to over 9 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks topped 800 for the first time and was 2.7 per cent higher for the week at 809.7 by the close of trading. .“It’s been a big week for stocks,”said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. Referring to the January employment report, which showed steady growth in job creation yesterday, he said “the economy appears neither too cold or warm, in other words goldilocks.” The mixed performance of stocks yesterday reflected a “tired” Friday market, he said.At the close the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,448.39, a gain of 1.8 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial was 0.2 per cent lower at 12,653.49, a rally of 1.3 per cent for the week. The bluechip barometer set a new all-time high of 12,653.49 in early trade yesterday. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,475.88, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.Another factor considered positive for stocks is the strong pace of earnings growth, as highlighted in this week’s fourth-quarter results, compared with the low level of bond yields.“A 10 per cent earnings quarter in a sub 5 per cent world for bond yields still leaves stocks looking attractive,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Deal activity this week kicked off with Merrill Lynch’s $1.8bn purchase of First Republic Bank. The stock surged 40.5 per cent to $53.80, while Merrill rose 0.5 per cent to $95.01.In the newsprint industry, Abitibi-Consolidated and Bowater said they would merge, sending shares in Bowater up 24.6 per cent to $27.60, while Abitibi rose 19.3 per cent to $3.15.Equity Office Properties fell 0.3 per cent to $55.38 but is still up 14.9 per cent in 2007, as a battle for control of the company raged. A group led by Vornado Realty Trust raised its offer to $56 a share, above Blackstone’s increased bid of $54 that valued EOP at $38.3bn.“The all-cash Blackstone bid scheduled to close next week is superior to the Vornado bid, which could drag on for several months or not close at all,” analysts at CreditSights said. The EOP board said yesterday it supported the Blackstone bid, which shareholders will vote on next week.The bidding war kept real estate investment trusts in the spotlight, but analysts warned that yields on Reits compared poorly with 10-year Treasuries.Deal speculation boosted Bristol Myers Squibb this week, and its shares rose 9.3 per cent to $28.64.One deal that failed to take off was US Airways’ planned purchase of Delta, in bankruptcy protection. After opposition from Delta’s unsecured creditors, US Airways withdrew its $9.75bn offer.

191;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2006-05-10T16:45:25Z;Indians march on parliament over Aids drug patent;;Hundreds of people affected by HIV/Aids on Wednesday marched on the Indian parliament to support a legal challenge to a patent application on a key anti- retroviral drug made by US pharmaceutical group Gilead Sciences.The Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS and the Delhi Network of Positive People this week registered a pre-grant opposition to the patenting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), an important second-generation treatment.The challenge will test the Indian patent regime put in place last year, and comes after Roche announced in March that it had become the first drugs company since 1972 to receive a product patent in India.India’s importance goes far beyond drug access for its own population since it is a high-volume, low-cost centre for the production and export of drugs for much of the developing world, undercutting western branded medicines it has copied.India, dealing with a backlog of 7,000-9,000 applications in the patent “mailbox”, faces the prospect of years of intellectual property litigation pitting multinational drugs groups against Indian generic manufacturers and NGOs.“We have reached a critical stage because many patent applications are now under review or about to be granted, a process which will have a massive impact on people’s lives,” said Johannes van de Weerd, a director of Médecins Sans Frontières.Chanting “We want tenofovir” and wearing t-shirts blazoned with the words “HIV positive”, the New Delhi protesters drew stares from passersby. NGOs say India is still largely in denial about an epidemic affecting more than 5m people.Lawyers advising the NGOs say the patent office should reject Gilead’s application on the grounds that the Californian group is trying to patent a new form of a pre-existing drug without evidence of enhanced therapeutic efficacy.Indian pharmaceutical companies, such as Cipla, have developed a low-cost generic version of tenofovir, priced in India at a seventh of international levels, and would be likely to have to cease production or pay steep royalties if a patent was granted.Yusuf Hamied, chairman of Cipla, said the company had also filed a pre-grant opposition to the patent application, arguing that tenofovir was “known” prior to 1995, the cut-off date for patent protection under the new law.“At least 5,000 of the 7,000-9,000 applications filed in the mailbox over the years do not conform with the Indian patent law as passed in 2005,” he said in an interview. “I urge big pharma to withdraw them to avoid frivolous litigation.”In January the Indian patent office rejected a patent application filed by Novartis for its anti-cancer drug Gleevac in response to a pre-grant opposition filed by the Cancer Patient Aid Association.In a move designed to foster self-sufficiency in drug production, India in 1972 repealed colonial-era patent laws and only allowed patents on the manufacturing process used to produce pharmaceuticals, not on the products themselves. The NGOs claim a tenofovir patent would push up the cost of the treatment beyond the reach of national AIDS budgets and further delay the achievement of the World Health Organisation’s goal of bringing antiretroviral drugs to 3m people.In March, the WHO announced the programme had fallen short of its end-2005 target, with the number on HIV antiretroviral treatment in low- and middle-income countries reaching 1.3m, compared with 400,000 in December 2003.“It’s a matter of life and death,” said Loon Gangte, president of the Delhi Network of Positive People. “At any moment I’ll be developing resistance to my existing treatment and will be needing the next line of treatment in the form of tenofovir.”Gilead has been criticised for the slow implementation of its 2002 pledge to make the drug available cheaply in 97 least developed countries through its “access” programme. The drug has so far been approved for use in only 11 of the countries.MSF claims Gilead has not offered to sell tenofovir at the discounted price of $208 (€162, £111) per patient each year in fast-growing developing countries such as China, Brazil, Thailand and India. In developed countries, MSF says Gilead charges $5,718.Amy Flood, Gilead spokeswoman, said the group was studying ways to make tenofovir available in countries other than those classified as least developed and that the decision to supply at cost would be based on income level and disease incidence.Gilead had filed for registration in a further 50 countries and hoped to have filed in all 97 by the end of this year. It estimated cut-price tenofovir through its access programmes was treating about 20,000 patients worldwide at the end of 2005.
192;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2006-01-31T08:50:43Z;Tamiflu gets EU approval for use on children;;Tamiflu, the anti-influenza drug being stockpiled around the world as a potential defence against bird flu, has received approval to be used for children aged one to twelve in the European Union.Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, said on Tuesday that the approval for use by the European Union as a preventative measure for children is the same indication as the drug received in the US in December.“The influenza season is just starting in the northern hemisphere and Roche plans to make Tamiflu available to prevent influenza in very young children who are particularly vulnerable during an outbreak of the disease,” said William Burns, Roche Pharmaceuticals chief executive. “This is particularly helpful in the family setting when one member of the family catches influenza - using Tamiflu for prevention will stop the spread of the disease to other family members.”The company said that influenza is particularly dangerous for children under two who are twice as likely to be hospitalised as those over the age of 65. In addition, the company said children are three times as likely to get the disease as adults.The World Health Organisation maintains that stockpiling antiviral drugs is the only way of ensuring that there are sufficient supplies available in the event of a bird flu pandemic. Roche said it has already expanded its production capacity for the drug several times to cope with demand from countries around the world.European countries are aiming to stockpile enough of the drug to cover between 20 and 40 per cent of their population.Tamiflu was invented by Gilead Sciences and licensed to Roche. However, Gilead has waived rights to full royalty payments from sub-licences to countries with limited resources.Roche is scheduled to release its annual results on Wednesday which are likely to be bouyed by frantic stockpiling of Tamiflu.In early trading, Roche shares were up less than half a per cent at SFr199.20.
193;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2005-11-16T18:29:28Z;Roche to settle dispute over bird-flu drug;;Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, is to make a one-off $62.5m payment and raise the royalties it pays to Gilead, the US biotech group, to settle a dispute over Tamiflu, the antiviral drug whose sales have been boosted by fears of a flu pandemic.The move, which helped lift Gilead’s shares by nearly 5 per cent during trading, is likely to result in revenues this year to Gilead in excess of $200m from a drug that analysts project could generate $1bn in sales in 2005.The deal removes one uncertainty that has hindered Roche in its strategy for Tamiflu as it seeks to take advantage of a sharp uptake in demand for Tamiflu in recent months from governments stockpiling placing orders to stockpile the drug as a treatment and prophylactic for bird flu.The two companies said in a joint statement they were ending their arbitration, launched earlier this year, and would work together to boost production of Tamiflu “in the interest of working together to address public health needs”.Gilead, which has extensive experience in outsourcing manufacturing, said it would work with Roche on joint committees to oversee manufacturing, commercial and pandemic planning for Tamiflu, amid at a time of concerns that production capacity of Tamiflu is well below the global level of demand.Gilead, which first developed Tamiflu in 1996 and licensed it to Roche, will gain rights to co-promote the drug in the US “in specialised areas”, although it said it would not do so in 2006 and had yet to determine the option for 2007.Under the terms of the settlement, Roche will pay Gilead a “blended” royalty for Tamiflu at tiered between 14 and 22 per cent based on net annual sales, without deducting an adjustment for cost of goods as it had in the past.It will shortly make a one-off payment of $62.5m to reimburse cost of goods adjustments from previous years and the first nine months of this year, and waived its rights to a further $18.2m already paid but deferred pending the outcome of the dispute.Gilead said it expected to generate royalties of 15 to 18 per cent this year, based on the new method of calculation.Gilead threatened to end its deal with Roche in June, claiming the Swiss company had made insufficient efforts to market Tamiflu, which had generated disappointing sales as a treatment for seasonal flu, with little uptake outside Japan. It also questioned Roche’s calculations of cost of goods, which limited had the effect of reducing royalties.Roche has already donated 3m treatments of Tamiflu to the World Health Organisation, but has come under growing international pressure to step up production through licensing deals and make it more affordable than the current modest “tiered” pricing to developing countries.
194;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Brazil to break patent on Abbott Aids drug;;Brazil on Friday triggered a confrontation with western pharmaceutical companies when it threatened to break for the first time the patent on an Aids drugs.The government told Abbott Laboratories of the US that it had 10 days to agree to a 42 per cent price cut for Kaletra, an anti-retroviral, or it would allow local producers to start manufacturing.Abbott sells the drug at $1.17 a pill, the health ministry said. Farmanguinhos, a state-owned laboratory, could sell a generic copy for 68 cents.Humberto Costa, health minister, said: “This is the first time that the government of Brazil has broken a patent on a drug. The patent of the Kaletra medicine is of public interest.”Aids medicines from other drugmakers could also be threatened. Mr Costa said negotiations were continuing with Merck and Gilead Sciences, both US drugmakers, over a voluntary licence for Aids drugs, Mr Costa said.Global sales of Kaletra, developed as an Aids treatment that could fight resistant strains of the virus, were $896m last year. Brazil's government gives the drug therapy free to an estimated 170,000 Aids patients.Brazil's threat highlighted the continued pressure on pharmaceutical companies' patents in the developing world, even as some countries, including India, move to comply with World Trade Organisation agreements.The move was condemned as “troubling” by Ken Johnson, of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobby. Although WTO rules allow countries to break patents in certain circumstances involving national emergencies, he said Brazil was spending less money today on Aids drugs than it was five years ago.Abbott Laboratories also criticised the announcement but said it hoped to work out something that would be better for Brazilian patients.“We cannot overstate the potential negative impact granting compulsory licences could have on the global discovery and development of future treatments for all disease areas, not just HIV/Aids,” it said.“The discovery and development of innovative new treatments depends on the reasonable return on investment for existing treatments. Without innovation and new therapies, in the end it is patients who will lose.”India, where the drug industry blossomed by copying blockbuster drugs, adopted more stringent patent protections on pharmaceuticals this year to come more in line with WTO rules. The change alarmed health and poverty activists, who argued that it could close the supply of life-saving drugs to poor countries.Although the Brazilian government has repeatedly threatened to break patents as part of its annual price negotiations, yesterday's statement was seen as the most serious yet. “We don't expect a last-minute deal,” a health ministry official said. “Brazil is preparing to produce the anti-viral drug.”
195;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2005-04-27T20:33:21Z;Wall Street shrugs off disappointing data;;Wall Street stocks bounced off early lows on Wednesday as investors shrugged off a report showing an unexpected fall in durable goods orders last month and focused on the tumbling oil price instead.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 10,198.80 and the S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent to 1,156.38. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 1,930.43.A government report showing sagging demand for big purchases such as aircraft and appliances fuelled concerns that the economy might be entering a soft patch.However, investors opted to focus more on a 5 per cent decline in crude futures after weekly data showed reserves grew ahead of anticipated rising demand in the summer.The durable-goods data followed downbeat news the previous day that US consumer confidence had reached a five-month low.Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, said the decline in durable goods orders was mostly due to softness in the auto sector.Mr Yamarone noted that the sharp decline in capital goods outside the defence sector and excluding aircraft was “disconcerting” because the figure is a proxy for future business investment.Amazon’s shares, which have dropped sharply in the past 12 months, fell another 3 per cent to $31.72 by the close. Amazon said tax charges would put a dent in profits this year.Elsewhere, Verizon Communications, the country’s biggest telephone operator, rose 3.6 per cent to $35.22 after strong growth in the company’s wireless unit led to higher profits.Boeing, a Dow component, saw shares add 1.1 per cent to $59.66.This lift came even though the aerospace company reported declining profits and missed revenue forecasts the day its chief rival, Airbus, tested the world’s largest commercial jet.Infospace shares tumbled 27.3 per cent to $35.22 after the technology company issued guidance that disappointed analysts.Among pharmaceutical stocks, Gilead Sciences saw shares give up 6.2 per cent to $36.88 after it said its experimental treatment for Aids would need to be reformulated.Bristol-Myers Squibb, a joint partner in the project, saw shares inch up 0.3 per cent to $25.76.Among oil stocks, Baker-Hughes gave up 2.8 per cent to $43.88 after the oilfield services group reported a 19 per cent increase in quarterly revenues that could not assuage concerns about the sustainability of those gains.On a more upbeat note, WellPoint shares rose 5.4 per cent to $124.45 as the largest health insurer in the US reported rising profits.Shares in Corning rose 8 per cent to $13.57 following reports from the world’s largest maker of fibre-optic cable that quarterly earnings more than quadrupled from the prior year.Best Buy, a retailer of electronics and technology, was up 2.1 per cent to $50.22 after reporting earnings and a stock buyback.
196;GILD;Gilead Sciences Inc;2005-04-27T13:07:04Z;No respite for Wall Street;;Stock index futures pointed to a lower open for Wall Street stocks on Wednesday as mixed quarterly earnings and poor data fanned worries about the outlook for the world’s largest economy.About an hour and a half before the market open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were trading 19 points lower at 10,142, while contracts on the S&P 500 index were 2.10 points lower at 1,151.60, or 0.86 points below fair value. The Nasdaq 100 index contracts were 4.50 points lower at 1,424.50, or 1.35 points below fair value.On the economic news front, durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in March for their largest drop since September 2002. Orders of non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a key gauge of capital expenditure, fell 4.7 per cent.The data were likely to dent the bulls’ hopes for a respite following a broad sell-off in the previous session amid disappointing earnings reports from some prominent US companies.In corporate news, Boeing, a Dow component, saw share give up 1.9 per cent to $57.90 as the aerospace company reported declining profits and missed revenue forecasts the day its chief rival Airbus tested the world’s largest commercial jet and a potential threat to the US group.Shares in Amazon.com fell 6.5 per cent to $30.60 after the largest retailer on the internet reported lower profits due to increased costs.Best Buy, a traditional retailer of electronics and technology, was up 1.6 per cent to $50 after the company reported earnings and announced a stock buyback.Also reporting results was Verizon Communications, whose wireless unit helped it achieve $1.8bn profits in the latest quarter.Infospace shares tumbled 18.7 per cent to $36.58 after the technology company issued a guidance that disappointed analyst estimates.Among pharmaceutical stocks, Gilead Sciences saw shares give up 4.4 per cent to $37.56 after its experimental treatment for AIDS would need to be reformulated. Bristol-Myers Squibb was a joint partner in the project.On a more upbeat note, WellPoint shares rose 2.9 per cent to $121.50 as the largest health insurer in the US reported rising profits.Meanwhile shares in Corning rose 2.8 per cent to $12.91 following reports from the world’s largest maker of fibreoptic cable that quarterly earnings more than quadrupled from the prior year.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9 per cent to 10,151.13.
