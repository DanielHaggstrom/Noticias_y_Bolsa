0;LEG;Leggett & Platt Inc;2012-02-07T22:16:03Z;Regulatory fears weigh on money market managers;;Asset managers sold off Tuesday on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to issuing proposals for the regulation of the US money-market fund industry.Federated Investors, whose $250bn in money market fund assets generate approximately 50 per cent of company profits according to analysts, fell 3.3 per cent to $18.03.Charles Schwab Corp, which manages approximately $160bn in money market fund assets, fell 2.8 per cent to $12.34. Bank of New York Mellon, another large player in the industry, was off 1.2 per cent to $21.69.Money market funds, which invest in highly liquid securities such as US Treasuries, are used by institutional investors to park large amounts of cash not invested elsewhere. But their reputation as safe havens suffered during the financial crisis, when investors in one fund were hit by losses.According to reports, the SEC will propose scrapping the funds’ fixed $1 net asset value and require the funds to set aside capital against losses. Floating net asset values would reduce the funds’ appeal as a cash substitute, while capital charges could eat into already meagre returns.“The proposals as reported could decimate the industry,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, “but if the market thought the proposals would go through unaltered, we’d be seeing bigger share price falls. The expectation is that the SEC has aimed high but will compromise.”Elsewhere, US stocks followed European indices lower in early trading as Greek default worries continued to weigh on sentiment but reversed course after a positive job openings report.US employers ended the year needing to fill 3.38m jobs, 258,000 more than at the end of November.“The total level of unfilled vacancies matches the peak in September and indicates the willingness of private employers to step up the pace of recruiting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,347.05, within 16 points of its post-2008 high reached last year.UBS equity analysts argued the rally could have further to run, with risk appetite still well short of extreme levels and many investors yet to rotate out of defensive sectors into cyclical names.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,878.2, as shares in Coca Cola rose 0.8 per cent to $68.55 after earnings, and some adjustments, beat analyst expectations.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,904.08, as shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the index, hit an all-time high of $469.43, before paring gains slightly to $468.83, a gain of 1.1 per cent.Coal miners sold off after an Environmental Protection Agency official told Congress the agency’s rules were “underpinning” a transition from coal to gas among US power producers.Alpha Natural Resources fell 5.2 per cent to $22.31, and Peabody Energy was off 3.8 per cent to $37.41.Banks stocks traded slightly lower, with Citigroup falling 0.7 per cent to $33.07, as it faced pressure from a key shareholder to raise its dividend.MasterCard hit an all-time high of $394.48 in the afternoon session, after announcing a doubling of its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share. The shares closed up 0.4 per cent at $392.91.Harman International climbed 3.9 per cent to $46.23, as the audio equipment manufacturer increased profits for a second successive quarter.Yum! Brands rose 2.6 per cent to $64.85, as the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut delivered a 30 per cent growth in profits and said it would open more restaurants abroad in 2012.John Ivankoe at JPMorgan was impressed that earnings growth accelerated in China despite the impact of inflation, while Credit Suisse analysts said the company might be able to increase margins further as commodity price inflation eased.Oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum increased 5.2 per cent to $87.21 despite swinging to a fourth-quarter loss because of charges related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Adjusted earnings and revenue beat expectations.Shares in Leggett & Platt fell 5.9 per cent to $22.00 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, after fourth-quarter earnings declined on restructuring charges and weaker margins. The diversified manufacturer also guided below expectations for 2012 earnings.Groupon shares rallied 2.7 per cent to $24.19 ahead of the company’s first earnings report as a publicly traded company, which is scheduled for after the close of trading on Wednesday. The stock is down 1 per cent for the week, after gaining 22 per cent last week in a Facebook-fuelled social media rally.Despite generally positive numbers on Tuesday, analysts continued to fret about a relatively disappointing earnings season.“Year-over-year earnings per share growth for the index is undershooting expectations, tracking 8.5 per cent versus forecasts of 8.9 per cent,” noted Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.
1;LEG;Leggett & Platt Inc;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.

Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis.

The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
2;LEG;Leggett & Platt Inc;2008-04-17T20:47:45Z;Wall Street rebound lead by financials;;In a muted session of trading US stock markets went sideways on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of earnings reports and an unlikely rally in the downtrodden financial and consumer discretionary sectors offset losses in healthcare and industrials.Highlighting the ambivalence of much of the day’s earnings news were industrial conglomerates including United Technologies Corp, Danaher and Textron. The trio posted estimate-beating first-quarter profits but cautious outlook statements from UTC and Danaher dented the stocks.UTC fell 2.5 per cent to $70.79, Danaher lost 3.5 per cent to $74.16 and Textron dropped 2.8 per cent to $60.44, dragging the S&P industrials sector down 0.8 per cent.Pfizer also stumbled. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $20.40 after the drugmaker said first-quarter profits fell as generic medicines cut into its sales.The news hit competitors Eli Lilly and Merck, which fell 2.2 per cent to $51.39 and 2.7 per cent to $39.22 respectively, knocking 0.8 per cent off the healthcare sector.Meanwhile, a pessimistic outlook statement from Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone company, hurt US rival Motorola, whose shares slid 1.6 per cent to $9.05.By the close, however, a rally in financials helped markets limp into positive territory for a third day in a row. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,365.54.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,341.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat for the day at 12,620.16.Positive earnings news from IBM overnight and Google after the close on Thursday which both beat expectations, helped extend a rally in technology stocks that began on Wednesday when bellwether Intel released strong results and forecasts.IBM climbed 2.2 per cent to $123.08. Google said first-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent as expansion abroad more than compensated for a slowdown in advertising spending in the US. Google shares surged 11.8 per cent to $502.66 in after-hours trade.There were other bright spots on Thursday. Trading in the financial sector began in desultory fashion after Merrill Lynch reported its third quarterly loss in a row on $6.5bn of writedowns and said it would slash jobs to reduce costs.But that was broadly in-line with expectations and, by the close, investors had shrugged off the bad news sending Merrill shares, which have lost about half their value in the past year, up 4.1 per cent to $46.71.Its peers, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, rose 4.6 per cent to $43.64 and 2.2 per cent to $46.42 respectively, while the S&P Financials index gained 1.4 per cent.MGIC, the biggest US mortgage insurer, soared 19 per cent to $12.49 after it lost less money in the first quarter than expected. Be-leagured bond insurers Ambac and MBIA also made ground, adding 8.7 per cent to $5.76 and 9.1 per cent to $12.71 respectively.Supervalu, the second-biggest US supermarket chain, gained 5.3 per cent to $30.60 after it said fourth-quarter profit rose more than analysts had estimated.Leggett & Platt led the consumer discretionary sector 0.4 per cent higher. Shares in the maker of supports for car seats jumped 14.6 per cent to $16.45 on an analyst upgrade.So far this year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 7 per cent as investors worry that a slowing US economy will begin to dent corporate profits. Analysts predict that first-quarter earnings will drop 12.3 per cent in total – a number many see as still too optimistic.For the most part investors skipped past a series of economic reports released on Thursday morning that added depressing details – rising unemployment and a slump in manufacturing activity – to the picture, of stagnation in the US.Materials stocks were also in focus on Thursday. Citigroup cut US Steel from “buy” to “hold”, knocking the shares 0.4 per cent to $154.78.JPMorgan cut International Flavors & Fragrances from “neutral” to “underweight”, sending the shares down 3.2 per cent to $44.65.Wednesday’s biggest gainers also fell. Monsanto, the agricultural group, retreated from its record high, dropping 3.2 per cent to $127.34.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.5 per cent to $112.66.
