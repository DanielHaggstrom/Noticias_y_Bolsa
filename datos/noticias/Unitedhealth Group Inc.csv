David Wichmann, boss of UnitedHealth Group, an insurer with an enterprise value of $250bn, spent time assailing so-called “Medicare for All” in a recent earnings call.Revolutionary change to the American healthcare is not imminent. Still, as their cost burdens soar, Americans are dissatisfied with their employer-based insurance. Investors sense that the business models of health insurers are imperilled. UnitedHealth’s shares have fallen more than a tenth in the past six months.Mr Wichmann said in April that a government-based system would “surely jeopardise the relationship people have with their doctor”. Perhaps. Obamacare has helped lower the number of those uninsured, and insurers like UnitedHealth are increasingly pushing the burden of treatment on to policyholders. A study published this week showed that nearly half of American have plans with deductibles — how much they bear before insurance kicks in — at $1,500. While healthcare costs keep increasing faster than the economy, Americans are picking up more of the tab.Although UnitedHealth’s shares are under pressure, its immediate profits are not. The Wall Street consensus estimate for 2020 earnings is as high as ever. But the stock trades at a lower multiple to forward earnings because investors worry about what will happen several years from now. Its current forward price/earnings multiple of around 15 times is a quarter lower than at the beginning of 2018.The bulk of any stock’s value is from the stream of earnings and cash expected over several years down the road. The certainty of those for health insurers is suddenly in question, forcing chief executives to address politics, like it or not, in 2019.Fed needs to be more Zen in its approach to inflation / From Cathal Rabbitte, Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland
1;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2019-03-05T20:21:35Z;Insurer illegally denied mental health cover, court rules;Ruling against UnitedHealth could force industry to cover illnesses such depression and addiction;A subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, the largest healthcare insurer in the US, lost a landmark class-action case on Tuesday, when a federal court ruled that it unlawfully denied mental health and substance use treatment for its insured clients.The US court for the Northern District of California said that United Behavioral Health, which is owned by UnitedHealth, had denied claims to about 50,000 people based on guidelines that were more restrictive than generally accepted standards for mental healthcare.The closely watched ruling will have huge implications for people suffering from mental health conditions. Thousands of Americans have been systematically denied care by their insurers despite so-called US parity laws requiring them to cover illnesses such as depression or addiction no more restrictively than a heart attack or a broken leg.“The record is replete with evidence that UBH’s guidelines were viewed as an important tool for meeting utilisation management targets, ‘mitigating’ the impact of the 2008 Parity Act, and keeping ‘benex’ (benefit expense) down,” chief magistrate Judge Joseph Spero said in his ruling.UBH will now have to wait for another court ruling later this month to establish what remedies it needs to take. The overall costs of reprocessing claims could be in the tens of millions of dollars.The court’s ruling comes from two consolidated class-action lawsuits on behalf of people insured by UBH who were denied outpatient, intensive outpatient and residential treatment from 2011 to 2017.Insurers who have been trying to dodge the Parity Act are likely to face higher costs in the future, since Tuesday’s ruling will set a new benchmark for the industry, said Meiram Bendat, of the law firm Psych-Appeal, who uncovered the guideline flaws.“For far too long, patients and their families have been stretched to the breaking point, both financially and emotionally, as they battle with insurers for the mental health coverage promised by their health plans,” said Mr Bendat, who acted as co-counsel on the case with Zuckerman Spaeder. “Now a court has ruled that denying coverage based on defective medical necessity criteria is illegal.”Mental healthcare discrimination is having a human as well as financial toll across the world, according to the World Health Organisation. It said that lost productivity resulting from depression and anxiety, which affect more than 600m people globally, costs the world economy an estimated $1tn each year.
2;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2018-05-06T12:35:19Z;Pharma and healthcare companies braced for Trump shake-up;US president expected to outline plans in speech to lower drug prices;"Pharmaceutical and healthcare companies are bracing themselves for new regulations designed to lower drug prices in the US as President Donald Trump tries to fulfil his pledge to stop them “getting away with murder”.Mr Trump is expected to give a speech outlining his plans as early as this week, after charging his health secretary and advisers with devising policies to shield patients from soaring healthcare costs.The most radical proposal under consideration would effectively outlaw drug rebates, according to two people briefed on the speech, who cautioned that plans had not been finalised and were still subject to change.If enacted, such a policy threatens to plunge the industry into a protracted period of uncertainty and to scramble the business models of pharmacy benefits managers such as Express Scripts, CVS’s Caremark and UnitedHealth’s Optum, which act as middlemen during pricing negotiations.It could also hurt the bargaining power of some drugmakers that offer hefty rebates to ensure they are reimbursed for their products.In the US, pharma companies tend to set a high list price for their medicines before subsequently offering large discounts in the form of rebates to insurers, employers and government-sponsored schemes, commonly known as “the payers”.In exchange for giving the rebates, the drugmakers demand the payers guarantee to reimburse them for their medicines and allow them access to a broad swath of patients.However, rebating has come under growing scrutiny from policymakers amid claims it stokes drug price inflation: as payers have demanded larger rebates, pharma companies have protected margins by raising their list prices.PBMs and insurers have also been accused of hanging on to a portion of the rebates to boost their profitability rather than passing the savings through to patients.In a speech last week, Scott Gottlieb, the US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, raised the possibility that the practice could effectively be outlawed. Drug rebates are protected by federal law via an exemption that shields them from anti-kickback legislation, but he suggested that could change.“What if we took on this system directly, by having the federal government re-examine the current safe harbour for drug rebates under the anti-kickback statute?” he asked.Such a policy could be achieved through regulatory changes and would not require new legislation or an executive order from Mr Trump, according to one source briefed on the proposal, which means it could be implemented relatively quickly.One person familiar with the plans said Mr Trump had demanded his advisers come up with a high-profile policy that would make a splash and match his fiery rhetoric and tweets on high drug prices.The real negotiated price of a drug after it has been rebated is a fiercely kept secret, known only by the payer and drugmaker, which critics say makes it impossible for a free market to operate.“This is the single biggest legislative action that could make a difference in bringing down drug prices,” said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people cut the amount they spend on medicines.He added: “It helps remove the complexity and chaos that has fuelled unsustainable price increases and allows an actual free market to take hold.”Although the outlawing of rebates would prompt a big change in the way the system operates, pharma lobbyists say they are reasonably confident they have seen off the introduction of their nightmare scenario.The three measures most feared by the industry were caps on drug prices, allowing the government to negotiate prices on behalf of retirees in the Medicare scheme and a loosening of regulations that make it impossible to “re-import” cheaper medicines from countries such as Canada.In a statement last week, Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, said the plan would “take aim” at four problems: “high list prices for drugs; seniors and government programs overpaying due to lack of negotiating tools; burdensome out-of-pocket costs for consumers; and foreign governments freeloading off of American innovation”."
3;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2018-04-17T17:11:05Z;UnitedHealth shares jump on results beat, earnings upgrade;;Shares in UnitedHealth were at a two-and-a-half month high on Tuesday after the US’s largest health insurance company delivered a forecast-beating set of quarterly results and increased its earnings guidance for the full year.A big driver of revenue and earnings is the company’s health services business, Optum, which offers technological and operational solutions and services to players in the industry ranging from individuals and employers to governments.Group revenues rose 13.3 per cent from a year earlier to $55.2bn in the three months ended March 31, which was 0.6 per cent above the median estimate in an analysts’ survey by Thomson Reuters.Reported net income was up 30.5 per cent year-on-year to $2.84bn, and nearly 5 per cent higher than the median analysts’ forecast, while adjusted net earnings per share were up 28.3 per cent to $3.04.For the full year, UnitedHealth now expects to deliver adjusted net earnings of between $12.40 to $12.65 a share, up from a previous range of $12.30 to $12.60 a share.Revenues and earnings at Optum are a little more than half those of the traditional UnitedHealthcare insurance business, and each of its business segments delivered double-digit growth in operating earnings. Optum’s operating margin of 7 per cent in the first quarter is 1.3 percentage points above that for UnitedHealthcare.Shares were up 2.9 per cent on Tuesday at $237.05, the highest level since late January, but had been up as much as 4.9 per cent.
4;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2018-03-13T16:51:05Z;Former GSK chief Andrew Witty to lead UnitedHealth’s Optum unit;;Andrew Witty, former chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, is to join UnitedHealth Group, becoming chief executive of its Optum division, which offers services including pharmacy benefit management to hundreds of health plans and hospitals in the US.He will succeed Larry Renfro, vice-chair of UnitedHealth Group and chief executive of Optum, who will now lead UnitedHealth Group’s “enterprise growth efforts and Optum’s next-generation investment initiatives through an expanded Optum Ventures”, the company announced.Sir Andrew will start his new role in July, and will immediately relinquish the seat on the UnitedHealth Group board of directors that he has held since August last year.David Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group, described him as “the right person to extend Optum’s momentum and lead the business in its next phase of growth”. Mr Wichmann said the former GSK boss had “deep experience with how data and analytics and new technologies can be used to improve patient outcomes, better serve consumers, lower costs and drive value across the system”.Sir Andrew said Optum had “the unique opportunity to continue improving the healthcare experience, outcomes and value people receive in the US and globally . . . In many ways, even with all its accomplishments, Optum feels as though it is just getting started”, he added.Optum, which employs 140,000 people worldwide, says it “delivers intelligent, integrated solutions that help to modernise the health system and make it work better for everyone”.
5;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2018-01-30T18:17:09Z;Healthcare stocks lead fall in US benchmarks;Global bond sell-off pressures equity markets around the world;US equities took a sharp turn lower at the start of trading on Tuesday, driven by a fall in healthcare stocks after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan announced plans to create a company with the aim of cutting costs and improving services for their US employees.While the announcement is short on details, news of the partnership was enough to send health insurance stocks lower in morning trading on Wall Street.UnitedHealth moved down 3.2 per cent to $239.46, Aetna fell 2.2 per cent to $189.50 and Cigna lost 5.7 per cent to $211.54. UnitedHealth, the biggest US health insurer by market value, may also be facing a blow because it also runs a large health services unit called Optum. CVS Health, which agreed in December to acquire Aetna, traded down 4.4 per cent to $79.87.It came as the US stock market added to losses on Monday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.8 per cent to 2,829, alongside other big indices hit by a global bond market sell-off that has pressured equities markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 300 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 0.7 per cent to 7,414, with consumer tech giant Apple coming under selling pressure following concerns about demand for its iPhone X.The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 index was one of the worst performing for the day, down 1.6 per cent.Healthcare costs in the US have skyrocketed in recent years, something that has driven up the cost of subsidising employee health insurance. In fact, the premium for a single person rose 4 per cent in 2017 to $6,690, and is up about 50 per cent over the past decade, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average worker contribution towards the premium in 2017 was $1,213.“From the provider side you have this competitor lurking out there,” said Joanne Wuensch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “We are dealing with a new consortium of companies that are saying they are going to try and manage this better.”The fall for healthcare companies follows a positive start to 2018. The group of shares stood as the best performing of the year so far until Tuesday’s dip, when the consumer discretionary sector moved into top spot. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index moved down 1.1 per cent on Tuesday but remains almost 10 per cent higher for the year.“Medical technology has had a very good start to the year,” said Ms Wuensch. “You have had a number of companies announce stronger than expected fourth quarters. Really what drives these stocks is better than expected revenue.”
6;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T02:20:01+0000;Wall St reverses gains to ends lower as energy weighs;;Having set new records early on Tuesday, US stocks reversed their gains to finish lower as a decline in oil prices weighed on the energy sector.The S&P 500, which climbed above 2,800 for the first time on Tuesday, gave up those gains to end the day 0.4 per cent lower at 2,776.42 – with energy leading the decline, sliding 1.3 per cent and basic materials declining 1.2 per cent. Healthcare was the biggest gainer rising 0.4 per cent following upbeat results from UnitedHealth Group.Despite breaching the 26,000 level for the first time the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day little changed at 25,792.86, meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5 per cent to 7,223.69.The slide in energy stocks came as West Texas Intermediate, the US crude marker, fell 0.8 per cent to $63.78 a barrel, while Brent crude prices fell 1.5 per cent to $69.23 a barrel.US stocks have been buoyed by optimism on quarterly earnings and on the back of upbeat economic data that have signalled healthy economic growth. However, investors are also eyeing the upcoming January 19 deadline for Congress to pass a spending bill. Both Republicans and Democrats have tied an agreement on the spending plan to the passage of other measures. Democrats are calling for a decision on DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhoold Arrivals, while Republicans are seeking to increase military spending.The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against a basket of six peers, was down 0.06 per cent to 90.41. Yields on the US 10-year Treasury were little changed at 2.541 per cent. Yields move inversely to price.
7;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2018-01-16T18:13:14Z;Tax shake-up boosts UnitedHealth as Dow hits 26,000;US stocks climb, with Macau casino stocks rallying on analyst upgrade;UnitedHealth Group shares advanced after the company boosted its full-year profit outlook by more than 16 per cent, citing a benefit from tax rules pushed through by Republicans late last year.The shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $234.20, taking its year-to-date gains to more than 6 per cent, after UnitedHealth posted upbeat quarterly results.The health insurer said it now expected adjusted net earnings of between $12.30 and $12.60 a share, up from its previous outlook of between $10.55 and $10.85 a share.The New York-based company said it wanted to use a “significant portion” of the benefits to accelerate “investments in data analytics, technology and innovations to better serve consumers and care systems and to advancing new and existing business platforms”.In the three months ended in December, UnitedHealth’s profits doubled to $3.6bn, or $3.65 a share, compared with $1.68bn, or $1.74 a share, in the year-ago period.The earnings included a one-time tax benefit of $1.21 a share. Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of $2.59 a share, ahead of expectations for $2.51. Revenues jumped nearly 10 per cent to $52.06bn, exceeding analysts’ estimates.The advance in UnitedHealth shares came as US stocks pushed deeper into record territory with the Dow breaching 26,000 for the first time.The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,796.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 25,962.29, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 7,295.67.Macau casino stocks rallied as analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their outlook for 2018 gaming revenue, projecting a 16 per cent increase, compared with 11 per cent previously.That helped push shares in Wynn Resorts up 2.5 per cent to $169.67, while those in Crown Castle rose 2.6 per cent to $106.22 and Las Vegas Sands shares increased 2.4 per cent to $72.70.Meanwhile, MGM Resorts shares rose 2.7 per cent to $35.96 and US depositary receipts in Melco Resorts & Entertainment climbed 3.8 per cent to $28.04.The analysts argue that the Macau market “is in the early stages of a multiyear growth path” driven by China’s transition to a high-income country, “incoming infrastructure tailwinds for Macau specifically” and what they describe as a more sustainable mix of growth.They see the mass market contributing a higher portion of profits than in the previous cycle.“Following a stronger than expected fourth quarter, we have become increasingly confident in Macau’s ability to capitalise on the increasing penetration from lower-tier Chinese cities, and see visitation from lower tier cities increasing at a 10 per cent [compound annual growth rate] over the next five years and total visitation growing at a 7 per cent CAGR,” said Thomas Allen, analyst at Morgan Stanley.Meanwhile, Under Armour shares fell 6 per cent to $14.22 after analysts at Macquarie downgraded the athletic gear maker to “underperform” from “neutral” and lowered their price target on the stock to $8.

9;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Pharmacies are set for a big dose of Amazon;A complex, opaque and concentrated market could use a shake-up;One can only admire Amazon’s ambition. It expands into ever more distant parts of the retail landscape: industrial supply, streaming video, groceries, fashion. It provides supply-chain services to other retailers. It operates physical stores. It is the biggest cloud services company in the world. When an experiment fails — as its foray into mobile phones did — its appetite for future ventures is undiminished.It is surprising, then, that Amazon has not already dug into the US pharmacy market. It is a more highly regulated market than any of Amazon’s current markets. That aside, though, it has several features that put it right in Amazon’s sweet spot. It is heavy on both digital and physical logistics: getting the right drug in the right amount to the right person at the right time, with little room for error, is the essence of the industry. The business is dominated by a few companies that make very respectable returns, an invitation for Amazon’s characteristic undercutting strategy. And it is very, very big.Amazon has only gone as far as meeting with a few industry figures and hiring a few executives in the field. This alone has been enough to set the industry on edge.The US pharma value chain has four links. At the top are drugmakers themselves who (for the foreseeable future) have little to fear from Amazon. Then there are the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which have three roles: negotiating drug prices with manufacturers, processing pharmacy benefit claims, and operating home-delivery pharmacies. Next are the wholesalers, who physically distribute drugs to pharmacies and hospitals. Finally come the retail pharmacies.The PBM, wholesale and retail pharmacy industries are all highly concentrated, after decades of unchecked consolidation. Three PBMs, Express Scripts, Caremark and Optum Rx, control three-quarters of that market, according to Barclays’ research. The first is an independent company valued at $44bn. The latter two are owned by CVS Health, the largest US pharmacy chain, and UnitedHealth, the biggest health insurer, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the industry boasts strong returns. Express Scripts’ percentage return on invested capital is in the mid-teens, well above Amazon’s level, and it earns about $5 in operating profit for every prescription it processes.There are three dominant wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, with a total market value of $77bn. They distribute 90 per cent of the drugs sold in the US. The two largest retail pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have almost 18,000 outlets between them and control half of the market. At both the distributors and the pharmacies, returns on capital are, again, solidly ahead of Amazon’s.Join us on November 21 for a conversation about the lessons the global HIV epidemic has had for other areas of medicineIf Amazon shook up this cozy industry, competing profits away while improving service — as it has in other parts of retail — consumers would have reason to be thankful. All the middlemen say they are fighting to keep drug prices low, but drug price inflation continues to outstrip consumer price inflation more broadly.There is just one little question. At what point do we stop thanking Amazon for the invigorating competition it brings to one industry after another, and start worrying about a single company dominating so many industries? At its current rate of growth, Amazon will be selling more stuff than Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, in less than a decade. Today, as Amazon expands, it makes the economy more competitive, and consumers benefit. It would be naive to think that pattern would persist forever.This article has been amended since it was first published to correct the owners of Caremark and Optum Rx
10;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-10-26T23:35:56Z;CVS Health holds deal talks with Aetna;Shares in health insurance group rise on takeover reports sending valuation to $60bn;CVS Health, one of the largest US pharmacy retailers, has held high-level talks about a combination with health insurer Aetna which would create one of the most powerful forces in the prescription drugs industry.The talks come at a time of potentially tectonic shifts in the pharmacy industry, which is abuzz with rumours that Amazon plans to enter the sector. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged the retail giant had received wholesale licenses from at least 12 US state pharmacy boards.However, CVS and Aetna have been exploring a number of deals throughout the industry in recent months and there is no certainty anything will come of the discussions, after premature revelations. CVS is working with bankers at Evercore Partners and Barclays, while Aetna is working with Lazard.A CVS-Aetna deal would combine the third largest health insurer in the US with the two planks of CVS’s business: a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) that negotiates the prices of medicines with pharma groups, and the country’s biggest drugstore chain with almost 10,000 stores.Investors sold off shares in PBMs, drugstore chains and pharmaceuticals wholesalers on the speculation of a possible deal and the Amazon move, with Express Scripts, Walgreens, RiteAid and McKesson shedding between 3 and 6 per cent. Shares in Aetna jumped by 12 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost $60bn, while CVS lost around 3 per cent, putting its stock market value at $74.5bn.Some other insurers also have an integrated model that combines an insurer with a PBM, such as UnitedHealth, which cuts deals with drugmakers through its OptumRx division, and a consortium of Blue Cross Blue Shield state health plans, which negotiate via Prime Therapeutics. Anthem, the second largest health insurer, also entered the PBM sector recently by launching a new operator called IngenioRx. But a CVS-Aetna deal would stand out if consummated because it combines a large drugstore chain with an insurer for the first time, and also because it would put the pharmacy group rather than the insurer in pole position. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said they viewed the talks as a direct response to fears that Amazon plans to enter the pharmaceuticals industry by selling drugs online, setting up a PBM, or doing both. Although the licenses Amazon has applied for do not necessarily mean the company plans to sell prescription drugs, the company has hired several executives and managers from the healthcare industry in recent months. CVS and Aetna declined to comment on what they described as rumours and speculation. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.It is far from clear that the CVS-Aetna combination would be approved by regulators: the Department of Justice recently torpedoed a tie-up between Cigna and Anthem as well as Aetna’s takeover of Humana, warning that both transactions would harm consumers by reducing competition.However, CVS and Aetna could present a deal as consumer-friendly because the combined company would potentially be able to extract better deals from drugmakers and help to contain the soaring price of medicines, according to one person briefed on the companies’ plans.President Donald Trump has described the prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical groups as tantamount to “getting away with murder”.Drugmakers already say that PBMs, insurers and wholesalers are collaborating in ways that is hurting their margins, and generic drugmakers such as Teva and Mylan have blamed more powerful customers for price deflation that is roiling the industry.
11;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-10-20T09:36:13Z;Japan equity funds suffer record outflows ahead of election;Investors opt not to trust forecasts of Shinzo Abe victory after other polling snafus;Japan equity funds suffered record outflows in the past week as traders and investors turned defensive after a stirring run up for share prices ahead of the country’s snap elections on Sunday.According to EPFR Global, investors withdrew $4.4bn from funds focusing on Japanese equities in the week to Wednesday, the largest net outflow since the research group began tracking data in 2002.The withdrawals came as Japanese equity markets have rallied sharply since early September, with the Topix index sitting at its best level since 2007, while the Nikkei 225 price weighted average at 21,457 has returned to a level last seen in 1996.The rally in share prices reflects anticipation of a victory by prime minister Shinzo Abe. and a larger majority for his Liberal Democratic party and a personal mandate for reform.Many market participants, having been caught out by erroneous polling forecasts ahead of major elections in recent years, have opted for a defensive stance ahead of the vote.“We are thinking Abe will get what Theresa May wanted, but did not get,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “People are worried about elections because polls have often been incorrect.”Mr Gokhman added that the investment stakes are likely higher if Mr Abe loses than if he wins, given the sharp gains for Japanese equities.“If Abe does win, it is fully priced in. If he loses, you have a correction,” Mr Gokhman said. “If you are a tactical trader, it makes some sense to take a little bit out of your Japanese position and put it on the sidelines until after the election results.”Market participants also booked profits last week on South Korean equities, where net outflows totalled $630m, the largest amount since the week of April 20 2016, EPFR said. South Korea’s Kospi index is up more than 20 per cent this year.Overall, however, global investors poured a collective $8bn into equity funds with those dedicated to US equities accounting for the biggest share at $7.5bn, a 17-week high.“It is not surprising,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors. “On the back of all-time record highs, investors continue to plough into equity exposure, especially the US.”This week, US benchmarks touched fresh highs with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaching the 23,000 mark on positive US earnings reports led by IBM, UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson.
12;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-10-17T17:10:32Z;UnitedHealth buoys insurers after results, upbeat outlook;;UnitedHealth Group shares jumped to a fresh record high on Tuesday, giving insurers and managed healthcare companies a boost, after reporting strong third quarter earning despite a decision to exit from most Obamacare markets and issuing upbeat comments for the year ahead.Shares in the largest US health insurer jumped as much as 5.8 per cent to a new peak of $204.49 and leaving it on track for its biggest one-day gain in a year.The gains came after it said revenues climbed 9 per cent from a year ago to $50.3bn in the third quarter, broadly in line with estimates, as it boosted enrollment in employer-sponsored plans as well as through Medicare and Medicaid.Net earnings per share grew 24 per cent fro $2.51 a share, from $2.03 a share previously and handily topping estimates of $2.42 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Moreover, the company said it expects 2018 earnings growth of between 13 to 16 per cent, with the high end of the forecast in line with consensus estimates.“In 2017 we have been fortunate to serve the health care needs of more customers and consumers in increasingly diverse ways, and we expect the opportunities to do so will grow even further in 2018, 2019 and beyond,” said David S. Wichmann, chief executive.The outlook for earnings growth comes amid uncertainty surrounding insurers as President Donald Trump took steps last weak to being unwinding President Obama’s landmark 2010 health bill, including ending subsidies to healthcare providers that helped them insure lower-income individuals.The revenue growth and strong earnings outlook helped lift shares of other insurers that have suffered in recent days. Athem shares climbed 1.7 per cent to $186.84, Aetna shares gained 2.5 per cent to $155.31, Cigna shares rose 1.4 per cent to $186.67 and Humana shares climbed 1.7 per cent to $241.

The healthcare sector was the biggest laggard, as US lawmakers find themselves once again embroiled in Republican-led legislative efforts to repeal Obamacare.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.18 per cent to 22,371.8, boosted by a 2.5 per cent gain for telecom Verizon to offset losses greater than 1 per cent apiece for both insurer UnitedHealth Group and industrial conglomerate General Electric.The Nasdaq Composite closed out the day with a slight 0.07 per cent gain to 6,459. The dollar index — measuring the greenback against a basket of peer currencies — slumped 0.27 per cent to 91.79
14;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-08-29T12:50:06Z;Advisory Board Co sells health, education businesses for $2.6bn;;US-based consulting and research firm Advisory Board Company said Tuesday it will sell its education business to affiliates of investment firm Vista Equity Partners and its healthcare business to health-services company Optum, in deals valued at a collective $2.6bn.Advisory shareholders will get an estimated $54.29 per share, including a fixed price of $52.65 and an additional amount based on the value of Advisory’s 7.6 per cent stake in Evolent Health, a healthcare technology company. Advisory shares closed Monday at $49.85.Robert Musslewhite, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement:Our board of directors and executive leadership team conducted a thorough review of strategic alternatives for the Company. After careful consideration, we determined that transactions with Optum and Vista Equity Partners allow us to accelerate the success of our health care and education businesses while realizing immediate value for stockholders.The respective deals are expected to close late this year or early next, pending regulatory and other approvals. The Optum deal is valued at $1.3bn and the Vista side is worth $1.55bn.When completed, Advisory’s healthcare business, called Advisory Board, will merge with Optum, which is a subsidiary of the largest US health insurer, UnitedHealth. Advisory’s education business, EAB, meanwhile, is expected to be operated as a standalone business in Vista Equity Partner’s portfolio.Advisory shares jumped 6.4 per cent in pre-market trading after the announcement. Earlier this year, activist fund Elliott Management revealed an 8.3 per cent stake in Advisory. Advisory said Tuesday that Elliott had agreed to vote its shares in favour of the Optum deal, which requires shareholder approval.
15;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-08-16T11:10:09Z;UnitedHealth names David Wichmann as chief executive;;US health insurer UnitedHealth has shaken up its senior management, appointing the company’s president David Wichmann as chief executive and current boss Stephen Hemsley as executive chairman.Mr Wichmann joined the group in 1998, and served as chief financial officer from 2011 until mid-2016. He has overseen UnitedHealthcare, the company’s benefits business, since 2014. He will begin his role as chief executive on September 1.Stephen Hemsley, outgoing chief executive, said:This is the right time for this transition to take place, as the company is performing strongly and has a positive outlook for the forseeable future, and Dave Wichmann is the right choice to succeed as CEO for that future. With nearly 20 years of service to the company, Dave has the business and leadership skills, enterprise knowledge and support, broad health care experience, and deep expertise in areas that are critical to our future.
16;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2017-07-23T11:37:31Z;US health insurers shrug off chaos over Obamacare;Share prices outpace the market as groups focus on other areas of their businesses;"Shares in US health insurers have outpaced the broader stock market rally, shrugging off the chaotic debate over the future of Obama’s signature healthcare law.The sector’s big five companies, including Aetna and Humana, have enjoyed share price rises of more than 30 per cent since the election, having stepped away from participation in unprofitable parts of the Obamacare system and thanks to improvements in other areas of their business.While the long-term fate of Obamacare’s individual insurance markets and expanded government-backed Medicaid programme hang in the balance on Capitol Hill, the insurers are being rewarded by investors for having stabilised their profit margins.“The hit from regulatory changes is behind them,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Leerink Partners. The decline in margins, which resulted from the Obamacare rules and regulations on coverage has “levelled off”, she said.Investors have focused, in part, on growth from a different government-backed programme, Medicare, which is largely unaffected by Republican lawmakers’ back-and-forth over whether and how to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. Insurers have been adding customers to their Medicare Advantage plans for senior citizens.Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance to low-income Americans have also proved lucrative, as insurers add members to the managed care programmes they operate under state contracts — although the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare would be thrown into reverse under the Republican reform plans floated so far.But the companies still face profound uncertainty over the way US healthcare will change under Donald Trump. The administration could take steps to further affect regulations on health coverage in the near term.Yet even as the latest Republican reform bill collapsed in the Senate last week, UnitedHealth Group, considered an industry bellwether, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings report. The company, which also operates a medical services arm known as Optum, recorded net income of $2.28bn, or $2.32 per share, up 30 per cent from the same three months in 2016. UnitedHealth Group revenues were up nearly 8 per cent at $50.1bn, even after it forewent business by withdrawing from several Obamacare insurance marketplaces.Since inception, the Obamacare insurance exchanges, which enabled some 20m Americans to purchase cover, often with government subsidies, have proved to be more of a headache than a boon for business. More sick people than expected and too few young, healthy individuals signed up for plans, skewing the balance of risk in insurance pools.However, an analysis of insurers’ first-quarter earnings by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests these marketplaces are becoming more profitable, as higher premiums and slower growth in the rate of patients’ medical claims lift pressure on the margins.As signs of near-term reform grew less likely this year, Aetna and Humana, whose proposed tie-up was blocked by a federal judge in January, opted out of the exchanges for 2018. Mark Bertolini, Aetna’s chief executive, told Yahoo Finance last week that there would need to be a “stable and predictable market” for the insurer to return in future years.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthUnitedHealth filed 2018 plan rates in just two states after abandoning most of the exchanges in 2017. Connecticut-based Cigna filed to participate in six.Of the big five, Anthem is most exposed to the Obamacare exchanges; the insurer holds licences for the popular Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states. However, Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, told analysts in April that the company might be forced to reduce its service area or exit some markets if subsidies are cut by the Trump administration. Insurers have until the end of September to commit to state exchanges for 2018.Those who filed to remain were projected to ask state regulators to approve premium increases of between 28 and 40 per cent, in part to account for uncertainty in Washington as well as rising healthcare costs, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, told analysts last week that policy changes in Washington, including healthcare and tax reform, could have an effect on 2018 earnings. “Certainly at this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would just be that,” he said."
17;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;UnitedHealth leads Dow losses after US joins whistleblower case;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the red by lunchtime in New York, with UnitedHealth proving the biggest drag a day after a law firm announced that the US had joined a lawsuit alleging that the health insurer and others bilked the Medicare managed care programme out of millions of dollars.The health insurer’s shares were down 3.7 per cent in midday trading, dragging the index overall into losses of 0.3 per cent.The intervention was announced Thursday by the law firm Constantine Cannon, which represents the whistleblower, a former executive at a UnitedHealth subsidiary. It means that the US Justice Department will take a lead role in litigating the claims, which have been pending under seal since 2011 while prosecutors investigated the allegations.If the suit is successful, UnitedHealth and other defendants may be ordered to pay as much as three times the amount of any damages established under the False Claims Act, which prohibits government fraud.The gist of the allegations is that UnitedHealth overcharged the government’s Medicare programme, a health insurance scheme for the elderly, by receiving payments for claims that misstated or overstated beneficiaries’ diagnoses.A UnitedHealth spokesman said:“We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously. We are honored to serve millions of seniors through Medicare Advantage, proud of the access to quality health care we provided and confident we complied with the program rules.”
18;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Surgical Care shares soar on $2.3bn deal with UnitedHealth;;Surgical Care Affiliates shares jumped 16 per cent on Monday after US health insurer UnitedHealth said it was buying the outpatient surgical facility operator for $2.3bn.UnitedHealth’s Optum subsidiary said it would pay $57 a share to acquire Surgical Care Affiliates and combine it with OptumCare, its primary and urgent-care delivery services business. The tie-up will expand its reach and the network of ambulatory surgery centres – which offer outpatient facilities for surgical procedures – while building on partnerships with health systems, medical groups and healthy payers, according to a press release.SCA operates more than 200 surgical facilities in 30 states, reaching 1m patients, according to the company. The deal will be funded between 51 and 80 per cent by UnitedHealth common stock, and is expected to close in the first half of the year, the companies said. UnitedHealth said it expects the deal to be neutral to its outlook for adjusted net earnings per share in the coming year.While the news sent SCA shares up, investors took a slightly dimmer view of its impact on UnitedHealth, sending that company’s shares down 0.5 per cent.The acquisition shows how UnitedHealth is expanding its horizons, albeit in different ways from its competitors – it was the only one of the five largest US health insurers not to launch a proposed merger with a rival last year. As such, it is also the only one not tied up in court right now battling US antitrust regulators over its future plans. Rather, it has focused its expansion efforts on its Optum health-services arm, which has helped it shore up earnings and revenue in recent quarters.
19;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2016-11-30T20:33:02Z;Fitch predicts headwinds for major US health insurers in 2017;;"Prognosis: not so good.Concerns about a wave of mega-mergers and the profitability of plans sold on Obamacare exchanges could make the coming year a challenging one for major US health insurers, Fitch analysts said in a note on Wednesday.The ratings agency said that it had negative rating and sector outlooks for US health insurers, and that it expects “more health insurer rating downgrades than upgrades” over the next 12-24 months.“Leverage concerns tied to large mergers and concerns about the profitability of business sourced from health insurance exchanges are the key factors underlying Fitch’s negative outlooks,” said Fitch Ratings senior director Mark Rouck.It’s been a shaky year for many of the largest US health insurers, which have grappled with the implementation of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act – also known as Obamacare – and are now scrambling to figure out what will come next if Republicans follow through on their promises to repeal and replace portions of the law.While the law has expanded the number of Americans with health insurance, several of the largest insurers have already reported heavy losses as a result of plans sold on the exchanges set up under Obamacare, and had previously announced plans to pull back Obamacare offerings in all but a few markets.While a Republican repeal-and-replace could be a longer-term credit positive for the sector, Fitch said that “significant near-term uncertainty” exists about what shape those efforts could take.Another question mark that will linger over four of the five largest US health insurers until early next year are US antitrust officials’ lawsuits seeking to block to two mega-mergers. The first, Anthem’s $48bn bid for Cigna, is already on trial. The other, a proposed $37bn tie-up between Aetna and Humana, will go to trial later this month.But far from being a must-win for insurers, Fitch said that if the government wins and the deals are blocked, the resulting effect of acquirers “foregoing acquisition financing” would likely result in its removal of negatives watches on those companies’ ratings. “Given the size and significance of the companies involved this may be sufficient to contribute to a change in the sector’s rating outlook to stable,” Fitch said in the note.Compared to a year ago, Anthem’s shares are up 9 per cent; Aetna has risen 27 per cent, Humana has increased 25.1 per cent and UnitedHealth is up 40.5 per cent. Cigna is the only one of the big five insurers to be down, decreasing a modest 0.2 per cent from this time last year."
20;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Health insurance stocks rally with Obamacare’s future in doubt;;Shares of a number of large US health insurers rose on Wednesday, in the wake of the election of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has pledged to repeal his predecessor Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act legislation.By mid afternoon, shares of four of the five largest US health insurers were in positive territory. Humana and Aetna’s stocks each rose more than 4.5 per cent, and Cigna gained 4.8 per cent. Anthem was up 2.1 per cent, while the largest of the five, UnitedHealth Group had pared some of its earlier losses to trade down 0.4 per cent.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act has been dubbed, has been a mixed bag for these insurers. Since the law was enacted in 2010, 20m Americans have gained healthcare coverage, according to government estimates. But the influx of more people into the coverage pool has squeezed insurers, with several of them posting substantial losses as a result of plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges and eyeing an exit from some states’ markets. Recently, the US government said it expected insurance costs under Obamacare to jump by an average of 25 per cent next year.Republicans in Congress have attempted to repeal Obamacare numerous times, railing against its mandate that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. But with Mr Trump in the White House, and Republicans winning majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives on Tuesday night, the odds of a rollback could be improving. This was underscored by comments from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who told Politico on Wednesday that repealing Obamacare is “pretty high on our agenda”.The “extent to which the president-elect’s policies will coincide with traditional Republican policies, given the limited number of his detailed and articulated positions at this time, remains to be seen,” wrote Fitch analyst Megan Neuburger in a note. “Successful efforts to repeal or materially replace the ACA would be a credit negative for healthcare providers as it is contributing to higher volumes of insurance patients.”But, she added:“Over the longer-term, healthcare companies will continue to invest in growth opportunities, as the fundamental outlook for the US corporate healthcare industry remains positive despite the election outcome…A repeal of the ACA may slow the nascent evolution toward value-based reimbursement schemes, but Fitch believes the shift toward linking pricing to patient outcomes will continue as patients and health insurers grapple with the growing burden of healthcare costs over the longer term.”
21;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2016-10-18T20:30:24Z;UnitedHealth sparks sector rally after upbeat results;Healthcare bolsters market while telecoms and utilities are weaker;UnitedHealth Group shares rallied on Tuesday after the biggest private US health insurer disclosed upbeat quarterly results and lifted its full-year outlook.The company, which is considered an industry bellwether as the first major US health insurer to report earnings, reported third-quarter revenue of $46.3bn, up 11.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier and slightly above the $46.06bn forecast by analysts.Net profits rose to $2bn from $1.6bn in the same period in 2015.Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude certain items, were $2.17, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.08 a share.As in the second quarter, its revenues were boosted by strong growth in the Optum health services arm, whose activities include, billing services and data analysis for healthcare groups. Revenue at the unit is up 34 per cent since the beginning of 2016, compared with 12 per cent revenue growth during the year to date from its United Healthcare insurance business.UnitedHealth also nudged up its full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $8, from the previous range of $7.80 to $7.95. Wall Street analysts had expected profits of $7.90 a share.The group’s shares jumped 6.9 per cent to $143.39. Other insurers climbed as well, with Anthem rising 4.1 per cent to $123.15, Cigna advancing 4.2 per cent to $123.65 and Humana increasing 2 per cent to $173.27.Elsewhere, Domino’s Pizza saw its shares jump 4.9 per cent to a fresh all-time high of $159.45 after the company delivered a strong set of third-quarter results.Like-for-like sales in the US jumped 13 per cent in the three months to September 11 as lower fuel prices, popularity among millennials and improved menu offerings kept the company’s tills ringing.Together with the international division, which reported a 6.6 per cent increase in same-store sales, total group revenue clocked in a 17 per cent increase to $566.7m during the quarter. The figure easily exceeded market expectations for an increase to $543.4m.Net income, meanwhile, surged by nearly a quarter to $47.2m, or 96 cents per diluted share, ahead of the $44.4m, or 89 cents a share forecast by analysts.Domino’s has pushed into digital technology such as smartphone apps in the face of new online food delivery entrants such as UberEats. Investors have responded positively, driving up shares by nearly 40 per cent since the end of December.Netflix shares surged 19 per cent to $118.79 after the video streaming website posted third-quarter subscriber figures that topped expectations. The California-based group said it added 370,000 US customers and 3.2m international users in the three-month period, beating its previous guidance of 300,000 and 2m respectively.By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,139.60, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 18,161.94 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9 per cent to 5,243.84.
22;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2016-10-18T17:51:46Z;US health insurers lifted by UnitedHealth earnings;;The prognosis for the healthcare sector was looking up on Tuesday, as better-than-expected results from the largest US private health insurer UnitedHealth Group showed it had staunched the bleeding from Obamacare plans and gave a healthy boost to health insurance shares overall.The S&P 500 healthcare sector was trading 1.2 per cent higher on Tuesday thanks to a strong lift from UnitedHealth, which was up about 7 per cent after beating analysts’ expectations for growth in revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter. Shares of major competitors including Aetna, Humana, Anthem and Cigna also posted positive gains of several percentage points apiece on the back of UnitedHealth’s beat.UnitedHealth is seen as a barometer for its industry, as the first major US health insurer to report earnings this quarter. Investors saw some glimmers of hopes in UnitedHealth’s results, including news that it had corralled losses from plans it sold on exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to the $200m it had expected for the quarter. Last quarter, it exceeded expected losses on Obamacare plans by $200m.During the third quarter, “nothing’s really changed on the ACA front, and that’s a good thing,” UnitedHealth chief financial officer Dan Schumacher said during a conference call.UnitedHealth is planning to pull out of Obamacare exchanges in all but a handful of states by next year, after suffering heavier than expected losses due to the relatively small and high-risk market for those plans. Other insurers, however, will remain, including Cigna and Anthem, and UnitedHealth’s in-line losses over the last quarter could be a encouraging sign.UnitedHealth’s relatively positive outlook for 2017 also set an upbeat note to start earnings season for fellow insurers. During the earnings conference call, UnitedHealth executives sounded an optimistic note for 2017, saying they were “comfortable” with analysts’ expectations of a 14 per cent year-over-year growth in earnings. UnitedHealth also boosted its full-year 2016 adjusted profit outlook to $8 a share.The S&P 500′s healthcare sector has had a shaky year, zig-zagging as public debate heated up over drug prices and the economics of Obamacare. The tone of the debate could change after the US presidential election in November, depending on who wins the White House.And four of the five largest US insurers – Anthem, Cigna, Aetna and Humana – are also locked in litigation with the US Justice Department over merger bids, which could keep a cloud of uncertainty over those companies for the foreseeable future. For now, though, UnitedHealth’s quarterly check-up has yielded positive gains all around.
23;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2016-08-05T16:32:56Z;US health insurers: knock on wood;There is nothing to fear but mean reversion;A casual reader of headlines might conclude that the US health insurance industry was in a nasty fight with a government determined to foil it. The feds are suing to stop mergers that would join four of the five largest players (the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals). And UnitedHealth, biggest of all, has all but walked out on the individual insurance exchange business, a cornerstone of Obamacare.Any such impression would be wrong. The industry is on a multiyear run of rising profits and share prices. Government-sponsored programmes have been the main source of growth.Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, shares of the five biggest insurers have all outperformed the S&P 500. The two largest by market cap, UnitedHealth and Cigna, increased revenues and free cash flow at double-digit compound rates over the period.The key in this bonanza has been sedate US medical cost inflation, which protects underwriting returns. This trend has traditionally corresponded with economic growth, but the link seems to have weakened in the latest recovery. The market apparently expects this forgiving trend to continue. Aetna’s price/earnings ratio, for example, has risen from nine to 15.Another helpful trend was the surge in managed plan enrolment by beneficiaries of Medicare (the programme for the old) and Medicaid (for the poor). At UnitedHealth and Aetna, member growth has compounded at double digits in both plans. Obamacare significantly expanded Medicaid membership. Compared with these programmes, the healthcare exchange business is a footnote.Can the prosperity continue? Put aside the merger issue. Medicaid won’t expand again, but the growth in managed care by government plans seems set to continue. The cost trend is trickier. It did tick up a bit in 2014, the most recent year for which data are available. And when a trend break is hard to understand, the conservative approach is to bet on mean reversion.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
24;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2016-04-19T18:34:22Z;UnitedHealth quits most Obamacare exchanges;Group to exit many of the online sites set up to help consumers secure low-cost insurance;Barack Obama’s landmark healthcare reforms have been dealt a blow by UnitedHealth, the US’s biggest private insurer, which is abandoning most of the online shopping centres set up as pillars of the president’s system.UnitedHealth’s decision, which it made public on Tuesday, underlines doubts about the viability of the government-backed online sites — known as exchanges — which were set up to help consumers secure low-cost private health insurance.Some exchanges have a potentially unsustainable mix of too many sick people and too few affordable healthcare plans, meaning they are not working as they should for health insurers or customers, according to health industry practitioners and former policymakers.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday that by next year the company would be operating on exchanges in “only a handful” of states.“The smaller overall market size and shorter-term higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis,” he said.“We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for their care.” UnitedHealth had already told investors last November that it was debating whether to abandon the exchanges. The Obama administration’s Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees healthcare reform, sought to downplay UnitedHealth’s decision. A spokesman said its customers accounted for only 6 per cent of all exchange enrollees and that its plans were not competitively priced in Georgia, Arkansas and Michigan. “As with any new market, we expect changes and adjustments in the early years with issuers both entering and exiting states. The marketplace is a reliable source of coverage for millions of Americans with a robust number of plan choices. We have full confidence, based on data, that the marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead,” the spokesman said. “The marketplace should be judged by the choices it offers consumers, not the decisions of any one issuer. That data shows that the future of the marketplace remains strong.” Other insurers have increased premiums while complaining that clients are less healthy than expected. In another blow to hopes for more competition, 11 of the 23 new insurance start-ups fostered by Mr Obama’s 2010 Affordable Care Act have failed. The Obama administration has previously acknowledged concerns about the viability of the exchanges.Andy Slavitt, who oversees them as acting head of the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services, said in February that he was seeking to create more stable and balanced “risk pools”. He announced steps that included tightening enrolment rules and improving the redistribution of funds to insurers taking higher risks from those that were more cautious.

The news sent shares in the high-end jewellery company sliding.The retailer said sales in the two months through December 31 dropped 6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $961m. On a constant-currency basis, revenues slipped 3 per cent as a drop in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions offset growth in Japan and Europe.Frederic Cumenal, Tiffany’s chief executive, said the company “continued to feel pressure” from a strengthening US currency, which trimmed the value of sales earned abroad when they were converted back into dollars and also made US goods more expensive to foreign tourists.Mr Cumenal also said “challenging and uncertain global economic conditions” weighed on consumer spending in the period.The New York-based company said it expected earnings in the year through January 31 to have declined 10 per cent from the previous fiscal year, compared with an earlier outlook of a drop of 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Wall Street analysts were expecting a fall of 7.7 per cent.Tiffany’s shares slid 4.7 per cent on Tuesday to $64.50, making the company the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 index. Its shares have plunged almost 30 per cent in the past 12 months.Meanwhile, UnitedHealth shares climbed after the big US health insurer revealed better than expected quarterly profits.Net income fell to $1.25bn in the fourth quarter, from $1.51bn in the same three-month period in 2014. However, adjusted earnings per share of $1.40 beat Wall Street forecasts of $1.38.Profits in the company’s Optum health services group jumped to $1.5bn in the fourth quarter from $1bn in the final three months of 2014. The growth there helped offset a $245m charge the company took in recognition of expected losses due to its Affordable Care Act exchange business this year, which it previously said would weigh on its results.Its shares rose 3 per cent to $112.58 on Tuesday, and are up 6.4 per cent over the past 12 months.Morgan Stanley shares climbed after the company posted better than expected quarterly profits. The New York-based investment bank is betting that a focus on wealth management instead of trading will allow it to prosper in the post-crisis era. New regulations in recent years have made trading bonds, currencies and commodities a weaker source of revenues than it was before the financial crisis.Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $26.46, helping cut a 12-month loss to 24 per cent.Johnson & Johnson, the large US pharmaceutical company, revealed a restructuring in its medical devices business, which it forecast would result in annualised pre-tax cost savings of $800m to $1bn, “the majority of which is expected to be realised by the end of 2018”.Johnson & Johnson plans on slicing 4-6 per cent off its medical devices workforce over the next two years, the company said. It will take a charge of $2bn-$2.4bn due to the restructuring.Its shares increased 0.6 per cent to $97.60. They have dropped 6.2 per cent over the past year.In early afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,881.60, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 16,032.87 and the Nasdaq Composite had dipped 0.1 per cent to 4,481.30.

27;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;WebMD eyes sale to potential pharma or media buyers;Digital health publisher could attract interest from pharma or media groups;WebMD, the internet’s best known consumer health publisher, is exploring a sale that may attract interest from the pharmaceuticals and media industries, people familiar with the matter said.The digital company, which was founded in 1996 to provide data and advice about illnesses, has held talks with a number of potential buyers. Some of these people said bidders might include retail pharmacy chain Walgreens and insurance provider United Health.WebMD said it was “not currently in any negotiations to be acquired” after the Financial Times reported the company was exploring a sale.Shares in WebMD initially jumped as much as 9.5 per cent, but were down more than 8 per cent to $48.5 after the company released a statement during late-morning New York trading.WebMD and Walgreens already collaborate on a number of initiatives, including a virtual wellness-coaching programme that can be downloaded as an application on smartphones. Other companies that may be interested include CVS, a US rival to Walgreens, and health insurer Aetna.A deal would value WebMD at more than its $2bn market capitalisation. The company could also opt to form partnerships instead of an outright sale, people close to the situation said. They added WebMD last year hired bankers to explore a sale but later chose to remain independent.WebMD now averages 201m unique users per month. The company ranks as the 104th most visited site in the US, according to data from Alexa, the web analytics provider.Analysts said traditional media companies looking for a big digital audience could also target the site. The company’s dominant footprint in the consumer and physician web market gave it “scarcity and strategic value”, analysts at RBC said.“We believe the company could command a value significantly greater than its current enterprise value based on the strong profitability and cash flow dynamics of the business,” RBC said, adding that it could receive more than $65 a share in a sale.The news of deal talks comes as the healthcare industry is gathered in San Francisco for the annual JPMorgan conference.At the gathering, WebMD told investors that online traffic during the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 6 per cent year on year. WebMD’s smaller rival Healthline Networks signed a partnership with private equity group Summit Partners to develop its own offerings further.
28;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;UnitedHealth warns it may quit Obamacare;Insurer struggles to make a profit on the plans it offers through online exchanges;UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, on Thursday dealt a significant blow to President Barack Obama’s signature policy by threatening to withdraw from insurance exchanges that have helped sharply reduce the number of Americans without healthcare cover.The introduction in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, helped establish a network of online exchanges that allowed uninsured Americans to purchase individual healthcare plans.As a consequence, the percentage of people without cover has fallen to a record low of 9 per cent, compared with 16 per cent five years ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.However, UnitedHealth said it was struggling to make a profit on the plans it offered through the exchanges, prompting it to scale back marketing of the products and to start a review of whether it should abandon the scheme altogether. It said it would make a final decision on whether to withdraw in the first half of next year.Shares in UnitedHealth fell 5.6 per cent by close of trading in New York.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, suggested the entire health insurance industry was struggling to make money from plans sold through the exchanges.Customers who buy the plans — many of whom have been without cover for years — are visiting the doctor and using medical services more than previously expected, analysts said.Many of UnitedHealth’s rivals have embarked on a round of big-ticket dealmaking to better prepare for a future under the Affordable Healthcare Act, although the company has been left on the sidelines of industry consolidation.Although UnitedHealth is the largest health insurer, it offers fewer plans through the insurance exchange than rivals such at Anthem, with about 550,000 people enrolled.Analysts said UnitedHealth’s withdrawal from the system could have a knock-on effect because the exchanges rely on a critical mass of insurers: if one insurer walks away, it pushes up the risks for other companies, who could react by raising prices for consumers. That, in turn, could stop people from signing up.Mr Obama has hailed the Affordable Care Act as a success and this month used a radio address to announce that 17.6m Americans have been covered with health insurance since the law took effect, although it has been politically divisive.In the summer, the US Supreme Court handed Mr Obama a victory, upholding a core component of his still-controversial overhaul of the nation’s healthcare system and safeguarding insurance coverage for more than 6m Americans.However, several cases related to the law are still working their way through the US legal system, including one regarding mandatory contraceptive coverage.The exchanges, many of which are run by states, also got off to a rocky start, with technical glitches causing some consumer headaches.UnitedHealth cut its 2015 earnings outlook amid pressure “driven by projected losses on individual exchange-compliant products related to the 2015 and 2016 policy years”. It now sees profits at $6 a share, down from an October estimate of $6.25-$6.35.
29;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Dash for debt ahead of US rate rise;US corporate issuance hits record high as groups seek to lock in financing deals;A spate of jumbo corporate debt offerings has lifted US issuance to a record high as companies seek to lock in financing to fund multibillion-dollar acquisitions before the Federal Reserve lifts rates for the first time since the financial crisis.US multinationals have raised more than $132bn in so-called jumbo-deals — debt offerings above $10bn in size — in 2015, more than a fourfold increase from a year earlier as companies including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and UnitedHealth take advantage of low interest rates, according to data from Dealogic.The offerings have buoyed overall corporate debt deal values in the US to a record of $815bn, with more than a month and a half to go before year end. The figure surpasses the previous high set in 2014 of $746bn.There has been strong investor appetite for the debt offerings, which have been used to fund acquisitions, buy back stock and pay for dividends, leading bond funds to balloon in size.“It’s two years of incredible issuance flows,” says Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management. “It’s driven by a desire to get financing done ahead of lift-off and a lot of this is going into M&A . . . The issuance just continues and continues.”After a slow summer, with companies braced for a rise in interest rates that never came as they struggled with the global oil price rout, issuance has picked up. Close to $30bn of debt has been raised in each of the past two weeks. It has been a particularly big year for highly rated debt, with issuance at a record $633bn. The $182bn worth of junk bond sales trail the 2012 peak of $246bn.Investors are already looking forward to the completion of several megadeals, including AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller, Dell’s purchase of EMC and Visa’s buyout of its former European arm, all of which are said to include mammoth debt offerings. Visa expects to raise as much as $16bn to fund the transaction and repurchase stock.But the colossal supply is taking its toll as investors begin to show signs of indigestion, causing yields on popular indices to rise.The average yield of companies rated Baa by Moody’s — among the lower rungs of investment grade territory — has neared its highest level of the year at 5.44 per cent, while total returns on the Barclays US corporate aggregate index have slid back into negative territory for the year-to-date.Rating agencies have also warned of the increasing amount of leverage companies have used to fund acquisitions, with investors getting skittish about the rising levels of debt groups are burdened with during a lacklustre growth environment.“It warrants some concern,” said Andreas Michalitsianos, a portfolio manager with JPMorgan Asset Management. “It’s all well and good when growth is good and bails you out of high debt but you need a perfect environment for that kind of leverage.”While the pace of global issuance has yet to surpass the $2.24tn raised in 2014, underwriters expect the flow to quicken in November as earnings season draws to a close and companies get through blackout periods.The next few weeks may also prove opportune for companies seeking to raise cash before the Fed meets in December, when traders are expecting the first rate rise for nine years.“A fair amount of the activity we’ve seen, particularly of late among opportunistic issuers, has been a rate call,” Peter Aherne, head of North American capital markets, syndicate and new products, at Citi, said. “In the absence of exogenous events and if current conditions persist, given maturities in 2016 it is likely to be active as well.”
30;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-10-30T22:02:35Z;Valeant severs ties with pharmacy group;Drugmaker ends relationship with Philidor as it fights to restore investor confidence;Valeant Pharmaceuticals is severing ties to a pharmacy group at the centre of allegations that have helped wipe roughly $50bn from its market value, as the Canadian drugmaker tries to arrest a crisis of confidence among its investors.Michael Pearson, chief executive, said on Friday that he had lost faith in Philidor, a pharmacy group that Valeant has controlled since late last year, when it purchased an option to buy the group.Philidor, a “speciality pharmacy” which used aggressive sales techniques to boost sales of some of Valeant’s top-selling medicines, said the move would force it out of business and that it had started winding down its operationsPhilidor’s fate was sealed late on Thursday evening when three of the biggest forces in US healthcare said they would refuse to do business with the pharmacy group.Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and UnitedHealth’s Optum said they would not reimburse prescriptions dispensed by Philidor. Together, the three pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, serve 215m US patients, meaning Philidor could not have continued to operate without their support.In a statement early on Friday, Mr Pearson said: “We understand that patients, doctors and business partners have been disturbed by the reports of improper behaviour at Philidor, just as we have been.”Valeant’s shares fell 15.9 per cent on Friday, as investors fretted about the affect of Philidor’s demise on its revenues: sales through the pharmacy have helped drive the drugmaker’s growth and accounted for 6 per cent of revenues in the first nine months of the year.Sales through Philidor are even more important for Valeant’s second best-seller, the toenail fungus cream Jublia, which derives 44 per cent of sales through the Philidor channel.The links between Philidor and Valeant came to the fore last week following research notes from a short seller that alleged the pharmacy was part of an accounting fraud constructed to inflate the drugmaker’s sales.Valeant shielded its relationship with Philidor and its option to buy the pharmacy from investors until earlier this month, when short sellers started asking questions about the arrangement.The Canadian company’s management has dismissed the short sellers’ allegations as “completely untrue”, although it has failed to address questions over the strength of its ties to Philidor and its liability should the pharmacy turn out to have broken the law.Valeant’s rejection of Philidor on Friday was part of a co-ordinated effort to arrest the precipitous decline in its share price, which has been buffeted by fears the company is too reliant on an unsustainable mix of aggressive sales techniques, sharp price increases and persistent dealmaking that has pushed net debt to $30bn.On Friday evening, Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, downgraded Valeant’s debt, lowering its rating on the group’s secured and unsecured bond by one notch to B+ and B-, respectively, with a negative outlook.“Given the multitude of legal, regulatory, and reputational issues that Valeant faces, we are revising our assessment of management and governance to ‘weak’ from ‘fair,’ which is the primary driver of the ratings downgrade,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst David Kaplan.Reports of wrongdoing at Philidor “further [harm] the company’s already tarnished reputation” and could affect its ability to market its products to doctors, S&P added.Valeant also announced it had hired a former US deputy attorney-general, Mark Filip, to advise a committee set up by the company’s board to investigate the drugmaker’s relationship with Philidor.In a synchronised show of support, Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager who is one of Valeant’s biggest investors, launched a staunch defence of its business model.However, he sharply criticised the way the drugmaker had handled the crisis, saying it had made a “costly mistake” by underinvesting in media and government relations, and that it had not adequately disclosed its ties to Philidor.As the company has recently found, investors’ perceptions can change fast in this environmentRead moreHe singled out Laurie Little, Valeant’s head of investor relations, as one employee who was overstretched.In an interview with the FT earlier this year, Mr Pearson touted the company’s low-cost structure and said this about Ms Little: “She is in charge of government affairs, investor relations, meeting the press, and probably a couple of other jobs. There would be 25 of her somewhere else.”Mr Ackman spent $200m acquiring shares in Valeant last week and on Friday he said he would have bought even more if he could: “My only disappointment is we didn’t have a lot of money — we had to scrape it together.”Mr Ackman bought a 5.7 per cent stake in Valeant earlier this year when shares were trading between $160 and $200, making him the company’s third-largest shareholder. The stock’s 40 per cent fall in the past two weeks has wiped $1.4bn from the value of that stake.The Philidor scandal is the latest and most serious setback for Valeant, which has been contending with investigations from various US authorities. It is also among the pharmaceutical companies that have drawn the sharpest criticism from US politicians about how much it charges for drugs.
31;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-09-22T08:29:42Z;How US biotech valuations got stretched;Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerable;After a stunning rise, US biotechnology shares have had the air taken out of them.After suffering its second biggest decline of the year on Monday, the Nasdaq biotech index slid a further 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, promised to take on “outrageous” price-gouging in the industry.The comment, sparked after a report highlighted how privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals had raised the price of a 62-year-old drug by more than 5,000 per cent, unnerved investors who had sent the combined market valuation of companies within the Nasdaq biotech index to more than $1tn for the first time earlier this year.Of the 144 companies on the Nasdaq biotech index, shares of 137 groups have fallen over the past two days, including drops of more than 15 per cent by Bluebird Bio, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Horizon Pharma, ImmunoGen and Retrophin.The index’s valuation has sunk more than $150bn from its peak as investors shift out of US stocks and the Federal Reserve readies to raise interest rates. That has added acute pressure to the Russell 2000 biotech index — home to younger, less-established small-cap biotech groups — whose valuations are dependent on future cash flows and a continued wave of merger and acquisition activity.Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, said valuations had become “aggressive, particularly in the small-cap space” after a sustained six-year rally.“Whenever you have aggressive valuations, any sniff that [the sector] may not be able to deliver — and today we had concerns about pricing power — you’ll have an outsize reaction,” he said.Valuations have been a concern for investors in US equities this year, who have broadly preferred European and Japanese stocks as central banks there continue to ease.The Nasdaq biotech index trades at 41.86 times forward earnings, down from a peak of 55.76 earlier this year but a substantial premium to other parts of the US stock market, according to FactSet. In contrast, S&P 500 healthcare companies — including blue-chips such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth — trade at 16.75 times expected earnings over the next 12 months.“While healthcare in general is reasonably priced, biotech valuations are stretched,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “It’s hard to put a p/e on a dream.”Those valuations have been supported by an expanding drug pipeline and a surge in deals. Some 747 mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries worth nearly $300bn since the year began, up 46 per cent from the same point in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Analysts with Citi warned that political rhetoric would intensify, which they argued could “impact the assessment of potential acquisition targets” by blue-chip pharmaceutical groups seeking growth through M&A.Against a backdrop of slow economic expansion, boards of US companies have often decided to buy faster growing companies instead of investing in research and development. The prospect of strong earnings and sales growth, often linked to successful medical trials, has appealed to investors after two consecutive quarters of sales declines by the S&P 500.Earnings for healthcare companies within the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 13 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, faster than any other sector, according to S&P Capital IQ.The potential for blockbuster new drugs has also enticed investors. Analysts with Barclays note that roughly a dozen biotechs have key catalysts before year end, including data from trials undertaken by Gilead, Biogen Idec, Neurocrine Biosciences and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Gilead has epitomised how a novel medical treatment can catapult a company’s share price and valuation. Sales at the company, known for its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, have more than tripled over the past four years, while its market valuation has soared from $29bn to $155bn.Despite the recent declines, the Nasdaq biotech index remains 10.4 per cent above where it started the year, outpacing the 0.4 per cent advance by the overall Nasdaq Composite. Shares of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Exelixis and Prothena Corp have all climbed more than 100 per cent.Biotechs have also seen strong demand for new issuance. Some 94 companies have come to market, raising a total of $8.5bn year-to-date, Dealogic data shows. The figure is tracking ahead of the record $11.6bn raised in 2010, when 77 companies floated. Of the 39 debuts in the US, share prices have advanced 24 per cent on average.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
32;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-06-25T17:44:48Z;Obamacare ruling ignites health stocks;Sector surges as US Supreme Court backs healthcare reform;US hospital operators surged amid frenzied investor demand on Thursday after the US Supreme Court backed a key component of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform.Shares in HCA Holdings, the sector leader, jumped 9 per cent to a new record high of $90.72 on the back of the ruling. The climb added more than $3bn to HCA’s market value, bringing it to $34.5bn.Universal Health Services, another large operator, also saw its shares hit a new high of $140.78 following an 8 per cent gain. Rivals Tenet Healthcare advanced 12 per cent to $56.21 while Community Health Systems added 13 per cent to $62.45.Hospital groups have been significant beneficiaries of Obamacare, which has expanded health insurance in the US. A ruling against the administration had been expected to put coverage at risk for more than 6m Americans and ripple across the healthcare industry in the form of reduced revenues and higher unpaid hospital bills.UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna — the five largest for-profit health insurers in the country — all also rose on the news, booking in gains of between 1 per cent and 7 per cent. The ruling has fuelled speculation of further takeover talks in the sector.UnitedHealth has reportedly approached Aetna about a takeover while Cigna recently rebuffed a $53bn offer from Anthem. Meanwhile Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn.Elsewhere, Eli Lilly jumped after the US drugmaker won a patent case that bars rival Actavis from selling a generic form of its blockbuster Alimta cancer drug in the UK before the patent expires in 2021.Alimta is Eli’s single biggest selling producer. It generated $2.8bn in revenues last year — or 14 per cent of total group revenue. The verdict, which reverses a 2014 decision by the English High Court, will also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations, according to Eli.Shares in the company rose 3 per cent to $84.80, extending the stock’s gain this year to 23 per cent.Another dismal quarter of sales declines and losses pushed Barnes & Noble shares 1 per cent lower to $25.94. The struggling bookstore chain saw revenue for the three months to May 2 fall more than 10 per cent to $1.18bn as sales declined across all three of its businesses. Nook, its ereader business, registered the biggest drop, with sales down nearly 39 per cent compared to a year ago. Sales at its bookshops were down 9 per cent.The broader US equity market on Thursday continued the previous day’s losses.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 2,102.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 17,890.36. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite decreased 0.2 per cent to 5,112.19.
33;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-06-22T16:05:52Z;M&A activity kicks off week driving S&P 500 towards record;Energy and healthcare sectors buoyed by M&A;Merger and acquisition activity dominated the start of the week for US equities, with the prospect of deals propelling the S&P 500 index within sight of a record high.Shares of US oil and gas storage companies were in focus after pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity confirmed that it had made a $48bn unsolicited offer for rival Williams Companies.Williams, which operates large-scale natural gas infrastructure in the US, rejected the $64-a-share, all-stock offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company. But investors appeared to think a deal could get done, with shares in Williams surging 26 per cent to an all-time high of $60.90.Speculation that a possible deal between ETE and Williams could spark a wave of consolidation in the oil and gas pipeline industry, boosted share prices for other companies in the sector.Spectra Energy, a large pipeline operator, gained 1 per cent to $33.05, giving the company a valuation of more than $22bn. Oneok, a company that owns one of the country’s premier natural gas liquids systems, jumped 4 per cent to $40.79.Merger and acquisition activities were not limited to the energy sector.Health insurer Cigna climbed 5 per cent to $162.60 on hopes that rival Anthem could sweeten its $184-a-share bid for the company. Although Cigna has rejected the offer, which values the business at roughly $53bn, the company said it was open to a deal “under the right circumstances”.Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn, fell 6 per cent to $189.98 on reports that Aetna, the industry’s number three player, has made an approach.Aetna shares were up 3 per cent at $128.07 while UnitedHealth Group, the market leader, remained unchanged at $120.25.Fitbit continued to muscle its way higher. The maker of wearable fitness tracking devices extended its gains on its third day of trading, jumping 14 per cent to $37.06 after surging more than 50 per cent on its market debut last Thursday. The San Francisco-based company, along with selling stockholders, sold 36.6m shares in an initial public offering at $20 apiece last week.Netflix, this year’s best performing stock on the S&P 500, was poised to close at a fresh high after analysts at BTIG raised its price target on the stock. Analyst Richard Greenfield boosted his price target on the stock from $600 to $950, the highest among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock rose 3 per cent to $675, putting it on track for its best close ever.Elsewhere, the broader US equity market extended its bullish run from last week.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 2,122.85, putting the benchmark US index closer to the record intraday high of 2,134.72 reached in May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.6 per cent higher at 18,119.78, while the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite hit another all-time high after advancing 0.7 per cent to 5,153.97.

35;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Anthem makes $45bn offer for rival Cigna;Health insurance industry consolidation spurred by Obama reforms;Anthem has started a complex takeover war in the US health insurance industry by making a $45bn approach for Cigna as the sector prepares for a wave of consolidation spurred by the introduction of “ Obamacare”.Anthem has tentatively offered $175 a share for Cigna, a premium of 27 per cent over the company’s closing price on Friday, valuing the fourth largest health insurer at almost $45bn excluding debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Cigna rebuffed the offer, one person said.A deal would torpedo a possible tie-up between Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn. Aetna, the industry’s number three player, is also said to be interested in Humana, while UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options.The flurry of takeover talks comes as analysts predict the US health insurance industry will shrink from five large groups to three, as companies try to position themselves for changes being ushered in by the Affordable Healthcare Act, the signature reforms of President Barack Obama.If consummated, a takeover of Cigna by Anthem would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, trumping the $26bn that CVS paid for Caremark in 2006. Anthem’s offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Insurers have shied away from big-ticket mergers and acquisitions since Mr Obama outlined his healthcare reforms in 2009, preferring to wait and see how the new legislation would affect their prospects.Since then, investors and analysts have said the enrolment of more than 16m uninsured Americans into health insurance plans has created opportunities and challenges. Shares in Anthem have increased 55 per cent in the past twelve months, while Cigna’s stock was up about 51 per cent before news of the offer emerged.Investors have largely shrugged off the spectre of a Supreme Court decision that could invalidate government subsidies for Americans who signed up through a federal insurance exchange, prompting millions to lose their health cover.However, the second aim of Obamacare — to reduce inexorably rising healthcare costs — could prove trickier for insurers to navigate. Faced with the prospect of lower reimbursements, hospitals and other healthcare providers have been consolidating, prompting health insurers to explore bulking up too.Health insurers are also contending with a new class of customer: the 16m individuals who are insured through the exchanges are more price conscious than those who get cover via their employers, prompting them to look for better deals.The health insurance industry has not traditionally had to deal with a large number of individual shoppers looking for the best value, and some executives fear they will not be able to protect profits unless the industry shrinks from a “big five” to a “big three”.Rampant inflation in the cost of medicines is also spurring consolidation among pharmacists and the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of health insurers and other “payers” such as employers and trade unions.On Monday, CVS Caremark said it would buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, helping it extract a better deal from pharmaceuticals groups. In March, UnitedHealth said it would pay $13bn for Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager.

Interserve declined to comment.The £687m 10-year deal to outsource cancer care is half of a £1.2bn contract to provide services for the four clinical commissioning groups in the area.The deal has been split into two lots: £687m for cancer services and £535m to provide care for the terminally ill.It could see the private sector delivering all cancer and end-of-life treatment for children and adults across Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, including diagnosis and treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, nursing and surgery for patients in hospitals, hospices and at home.The contracts involve the biggest and most wide-ranging outsourcing of NHS services so far, and would see the private sector take over some of the most important and sensitive medical care provided.The cancer contract is expected to be awarded in December.Vernon Baxter, head of the research magazine Health Investor, said: “The tendering process for contracts of this size is lengthy and ultimately very complex — and it’s not unusual for organisations to pull out at a relatively advanced stage.Ultimately, if an independent company cannot make the business case work then they have little choice but to walk away“Many private sector organisations believe they can help the NHS find savings — and in doing so make a margin — but ultimately, if an independent company cannot make the business case work then they have little choice but to walk away.“As we’ve seen elsewhere in the health service, the risk of reputational damage is huge once difficulties arise.”The four Staffordshire clinical commissioning groups involved, and NHS England, said in a statement that the outsourcing programme had been “borne out of a need to significantly improve the outcomes and experience of patients with cancer or approaching end of life in Staffordshire as well as the people who care for them”.The bidding consortium would bring together “a wide range of skills and expertise” to implement this new approach to the commissioning of cancer care.The deal will be closely watched by other NHS trusts, which are seeking to redesign hospital services.Faced with a £30bn shortfall in the NHS budget by the end of the decade, more trusts may look to work with the private sector to help the service adopt new technology, improve staff productivity and use economies of scale to lower costs.NHS England is seeking to implement a five-year plan laid out by Simon Stevens, its chief executive, which involves moving more care out of hospitals and into the community in pursuit of £22bn of savings by 2020.Additional reporting by Sarah Neville

A total of $854.2bn worth of transactions was announced in the first three months of this year, an increase of 25 per cent from a year ago, writes Arash Massoudi in London.The pharma sector accounted for 13 per cent of all mergers and acquisitions, or four of the 10 biggest deals, in the first quarter. That included the $12.8bn all-cash takeover of US prescription manager Catamaran by healthcare provider UnitedHealth Group on Monday.The US has by far been the most active region with nearly half of all deal volumes.The week’s other big takeover came as US cable group Charter agreed to acquire Bright House Networks for $10.4bn in the latest round of consolidation among cable TV and broadband groups.The prevalence of large deals, such as ketchup maker Heinz’s deal to acquire US foods group Kraft, has masked the declining number of overall transactions.Deals in Europe, however, have lagged behind despite the positive effects of monetary stimulus from the ECB. A merger this week between Italy’s Yoox and Net-A-Porter of the UK to create an online luxury fashion group with annual sales of €1.3bn provided only a measure of comfort to dealmakers.Two large deals from Asia’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, helped the value of deals reached in the Asia-Pacific region to reach its highest levels since Thomson Reuters began tracking the data in 1980.● Related Lex note: UnitedHealth — changing the channelWave of deals as Charter makes $10.4bn Bright moveThe consolidation wave sweeping across the US cable industry is far from over. When Charter Communications, the cable company controlled by John Malone, announced its $10.4bn proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks this week, executives said further deals were possible as the sector braces for a digital future, writes Shannon Bond in New York.If the purchase goes through, Charter will become the US’s second-largest participant in cable and broadband provision “with even more firepower” for dealmaking, said Amy Yong, a media analyst at Macquarie.“There’s now more wriggle room for consolidation for Charter to triple in size.”Pay-TV operators have been bulking up to meet rising content costs.Now they face pressure from a fast-growing crop of internet video services that are attracting consumers.Deal with Net-a-Porter confirms Yoox chief as a tech visionaryContinue readingThe future for companies such as Charter and market leader Comcast, which is in the midst of its own $45bn mega-merger with Time Warner Cable, will lie in the provision of broadband services.Buying Bright House from privately owned Advance/Newhouse will reduce Charter’s leverage, freeing $6bn for it to borrow, the company said.Ms Yong said likely targets include smaller operators such as Suddenlink, which has 1.2m subscribers, MediaCom, with 1m, and Cable One, with 600,000.But the deal comes with a significant caveat: it is contingent not just on regulatory approval, but on completion of the Comcast-TWC transaction, which involves the sale of subscribers to Charter.● Related Lex note: Charter/ Bright House: harmonic convergenceHalve my pay? Laudable, says China bank chairmanThe chairman of China Construction Bank, the country’s second-largest lender, lauded a 50 per cent pay cut for him and his colleagues as “extremely correct”, seeking to downplay tension between unleashing market forces at state-owned groups and addressing public anger over excessive pay and privilege, writes Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai.In August the Communist party’s politburo approved a plan that reportedly capped pay at state-owned financial groups at $97,000 a year. At the same time, China’s top leaders have pledged to improve management of state-owned groups — whose return on assets trails that of privately owned counterparts — in part by freeing them from political constraints.Senior executives at large state-owned enterprises are appointed by the Communist party’s powerful central organisation department and carry ranks equivalent to cabinet ministers.Even before the pay curbs, executives at Chinese state groups earned much less than global peers. Wang Hongzhang, CCB chairman, earned pre-tax pay of $185,000 in 2014. That compares with $20m for JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon.Chinese bank analysts expect the curbs on cash payouts will ultimately be paired with reforms to allow them to offer stock options that link executive pay to company performance. Stock options are not allowed at state firms, but several publicly owned banks have said they may gain permission to experiment with equity-based incentive plans.● Related Lex note: China banks — a national serviceQuindell omits sale details on Slater & Gordon dealFor Quindell, it never rains, it pours — even when it should be sunny, writes Henry Mance in London.The law firm that once referred to itself as an insurance claims processor announced on Monday that it was selling most of its business for at least £637m to Slater & Gordon, the Australian legal group.That looked like good news for Quindell’s investors, who have had to contend with short-sellers’ claims that the company is running out of cash. Its shares have lost three-quarters of their value in the past year.But by Wednesday, Quindell was battling another communications disaster. The company had omitted to mention that the sale to Slater & Gordon also included two of its technology units, whose software is used to process insurance claims. That meant the deal was less advantageous to Quindell than first thought.Quindell — whose market capitalisation was once more than £2bn, and which aimed to join the FTSE 100 — will now be a different type of company. It will consist of a small number of software businesses, whose adjusted pre-tax profits were about £8.5m in the first half of last year. It will also share in any profits from industrial deafness cases that are being taken on by Slater & Gordon.Quindell still has two pieces of housekeeping to do: restating its accounts after PwC, the professional services firm, found that some practices were unacceptable; and changing its name.By Thursday, the stock market capitalisation was less than the initial cash it will get from S & G; a sign that investors are still cautious.● Related FT Alphaville post: Quindell corrects

But it seems no one told anyone at Morgan Stanley. That might explain why chief executive James Gorman has “room for continued progress” but could soon need room for a new $22.5m yacht.● Energy company shareholders and agricultural commodity traders are bracing themselves for further volatility, following a decision by Guardian Media Group, the newspaper and website publisher, to sell £800m of investments in oil and gas companies. Outgoing editor and keen pedestrian Alan Rusbridger said that the move reflected reader anxiety over climate change. Prices of quinoa and lentil futures are expected to soar.● When they warned of the threat that artificial intelligence posed to mankind, Stephen Hawking, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and entrepreneur Elon Musk could not say how imminent the rise of the machines might be.

38;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-03-30T17:20:32Z;UnitedHealth: changing the channel;The drug supply chain is becoming even trickier;There may be no more complicated supply chain than US healthcare delivery. And that complexity is becoming trickier to manage as the industry consolidates. On Monday, UnitedHealth, best known as an insurer, bought the pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran for $12.8bn. PBMs run prescription drug plans for insurers and companies. They have been actively sought as acquisition targets. But the buyers come from a variety of health subsectors, leading to the question of which companies are the most appropriate owners.PBMs once belonged to drugmakers. Medco, for example, used to be part of Merck. But because Medco might have been perceived to favour Merck treatments, it was spun off. That type of “channel conflict” has become a recurring theme.With an enterprise value of $70bn, the largest PBM today is Express Scripts, which bought Medco for $34bn in 2011. Express Scripts is a pure-play PBM. However, its chief rival CVS Health employs a more controversial business model — it owns a retail pharmacy chain and a PBM, Caremark. As a result, CVS once had difficulty reaching a PBM agreement with Walgreens, which is the arch-rival of the CVS pharmacy chain.For now, there is little concern about conflict questions in the UnitedHealth/Catamaran deal. UnitedHealth shares rose 2 per cent, as the all-cash deal will immediately boost earnings. UnitedHealth’s existing PBM combined with Catamaran will process 1bn prescriptions, just behind the 1.3bn that Express Scripts has now. That scale is becoming important to hold down the costs of expensive speciality drugs.Catamaran, however, generates a third of its revenue from Cigna, an insurance rival of UnitedHealth, which may not be thrilled about sending money to a competitor. The Cigna contracts runs until 2023. It may take that long to disentangle and resolve who is aligned with whom.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
39;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2015-03-30T16:03:50Z;Pharma dealmaking helps lift US stocks;Energy sector powers ahead in spite of slide in crude;The seemingly insatiable appetite for dealmaking in the pharmaceuticals sector helped push US stocks higher.A raft of deals lifted the S&P 500 healthcare sector 1 per cent higher to 853.09, taking the index’s gains since the year began to 7.7 per cent and making it the best performing sector this year.Catamaran was among the day’s big winners, jumping nearly 24 per cent to $59.79 after the fourth-biggest pharmacy benefit manager in the US struck a deal to be acquired by rival UnitedHealth for $12.8bn in cash.UnitedHealth, which is offering $61.50 a share, is planning to merge Catamaran with its Optum Rx unit, the sector’s number three.UnitedHealth expected the combined companies to increase annual revenues from $100bn a year to $400bn a year by 2020. Shares in UnitedHealth were up 3 per cent at $121.Elsewhere, Horizon Pharma agreed to buy Hyperion Therapeutics for nearly $1bn in cash. The deal, which will boost Horizon’s drug portfolio, helped shares in the Dublin-based company gain more than 14 per cent to $24.89. Hyperion rose 8 per cent to $46.Auspex Pharmaceutical surged more than 41 per cent to $100.32 after Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries agreed to buy the central nervous system drug specialist for $3.2bn, including debt.Worldwide, M&A in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical sectors has reached $89.3bn this year, following a record 2014, according to data provider Dealogic.Encouraging reports on US consumer spending and home sales helped lift the wider US stock market indices.February’s cold weather did not appear to have inflicted as much damage as feared on activity in the US housing market. An index of pending home sales jumped 3.1 per cent to 106.9 last month, according to National Association of Realtors figures.The broader S&P 500 index advanced 1.2 per cent to 2,086.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.5 per cent to 17,976.31, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 4,947.44.The rally, coming after last week’s loss, was accompanied by an easing in market tensions. The CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, fell 4.6 per cent to 14.37.Chipmaker Altera dropped 4 per cent to $42.82 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equal-weight” from “overweight”. Shares had surged more than 28 per cent on Friday following reports that it might be acquired by larger rival Intel.A transaction would be Intel’s largest acquisition to date and among the biggest the technology industry has seen in recent years. Intel shares fell 2 per cent to $31.46 after rising 6.4 per cent on Friday.Energy stocks powered ahead in spite of the continued slide in crude prices. The S&P 500 energy index, up 2 per cent, was the biggest sector mover.

The $12.8bn offer represents a 27 per cent premium to Catamaran’s closing price on Friday.Pharmacy benefit managers act as intermediaries between drug companies and health insurers, a role that has become increasingly important as the US healthcare system tries to cope with rampant inflation in the price of drugs.Together, Optum and Catamaran would control about 1bn prescriptions a year, which they hope will give them the clout to extract big discounts from pharmaceutical companies in exchange for access to their patientsDrug costs account for about 10 per cent of the US healthcare bill, but prices are growing quickly. Prices for branded prescription drugs increased 15.4 per cent last year, according to Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy-benefits manager, compared with a 5.6 per cent jump in overall US healthcare costs, partly because a new generation of expensive “specialty” medicines is hitting the market.UnitedHealth and Catamaran said their combination would “help customers manage the complex costs and outcomes as this portion of the pharmaceutical market expands from an estimated $100bn in revenues in 2014 to potentially $400bn annually by 2020”.Teva added to Monday’s deal rush with a $3.2bn all-cash takeover of Auspex Pharmaceuticals, a California-based developer of treatments for disorders of the central nervous system, including Huntington’s disease.The Israeli company has been searching for fresh assets to prepare for looming generic competition for its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which accounts for a fifth of sales and half of profits.The drug supply chain is becoming even trickierContinue readingErez Vigodman, Teva chief executive, described the deal as “a first major step” towards boosting growth, suggesting there could be more acquisitions to come.The $101-a-share offer was 42 per cent above Auspex’s closing price on Friday, highlighting the hefty premiums big pharmaceuticals groups are agreeing to pay as the industry’s year-long scramble for growth assets continues.Separately, Horizon Pharmaceuticals, an Ireland-based company, said it had agreed to pay $1.1bn in cash to buy Hyperion Therapeutics, a California-based biotech group that specialises in “orphan” diseases — rare conditions that are often neglected by big pharma groups because the patient populations are so small.The $46-a-share offer for Hyperion represents a 35 per cent premium to the volume-weighted average price for its shares in the past 60 days and a 7.6 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday.Research and development carried out in closed corporate labs is giving way to a more open approach that looks outside the company for ideas and leadsContinue readingIn another deal, Novartis of Switzerland announced a partnership with Aduro Biotech worth up to $750m to the Californian company. The pair will work together in immuno-oncology, which involves employing the body’s immune system to fight cancer.The Novartis tie-up is the latest in a series of cancer immunotherapy alliances across the industry as big pharma groups hunt for assets that could provide an advantage in what analysts expect to be a highly lucrative but fiercely competitive field.Novartis will make an upfront payment of $225m to Aduro as well as potential payouts of up to $525m that will depend on how successful the collaboration is.
41;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2014-07-17T16:57:40Z;UnitedHealth climbs on surging sales;;US health insurance providers continued a year’s long ascent on Thursday as the country’s largest health insurer reported better than expected results, buoyed by healthcare reform.UnitedHealth, the Minnesota-based insurer, said sales jumped 7 per cent from a year earlier to $32.6bn, lifted by a surge in Medicaid enrolment linked to the Affordable Care Act.Profits at the company fell 2 per cent from the same period a year earlier to $1.4bn, or $1.42 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.26 a share on sales of $32bn.The results are the latest to show the impact President Barack Obama’s signature law has had on the healthcare sector, lifting sales at hospitals and insurers as more consumers enrol in Medicaid or private health insurance purchased through an online exchange.Over the past year, 730,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid services offered by UnitedHealth, including 380,000 people in the second quarter.“We plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many as two dozen state exchanges,” chief executive Stephen Hemsley said on a call with analysts. “This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position, and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016.”Analysts with Deutsche Bank called the results “solid”, particularly the “earnings beat from UnitedHealth’s Health Benefits business”.The industry broadly advanced following the company’s results. UnitedHealth shares climbed to all-time high by midday trading before paring back to $85.11 by close, a 2 per cent jump. Shares in WellPoint rose 1 per cent to $113.44, Humana jumped 3 per cent to $131.17 and Aetna increased 2 per cent to $83.68.SanDisk shares led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after the flash-memory producer forecast third quarter sales shy of Wall Street expectations.The company said it expected net revenues in the third quarter to range between $1.68bn and $1.73bn due to supply constraints in the second half of the year.Shares in the company sunk 14 per cent to $93.21, wiping nearly $3bn off the company’s market capitalisation.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early February, said the company would cut up to 18,000 jobs over the next year.In a memo to employees, Mr Nadella insisted the reductions, which will primarily impact the Nokia handset business, were “the first step to building the right organisation”.The shrinkage of Microsoft’s workforce is the single largest cull in the company’s history.“The headcount reduction related to the Nokia business indicates that Microsoft is not going to let Nokia become a potential ‘black hole’ of spend,” Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore, said.Shares of Microsoft rose 1 per cent to $44.53, its highest level since 2000.Yum shares tumbled 7 per cent to $77.01 after the company said its US business remained weak despite recent investments.The company behind the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, has ceded ground to rivals including Chipotle and Domino’s.Global sales rose 10 per cent from a year earlier to $3.2bn while profits increased 19 per cent to $334m, or 73 cents a share. Both figures matched analysts’ forecasts.“We are obviously disappointed with second-quarter results, particularly with the very poor performance in our US division,” chief executive David Novak said of Pizza Hut.Mr Novak said he now expected the unit’s full-year operating profits to fall “well short of our expectations”.Analysts with brokerage Jefferies said the domestic KFC business would also “continue to struggle” and commodity cost inflation would weigh on Yum’s margins.Mattel, which is best-known for its Fisher-Price and Barbie brands, reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits on Thursday, with net income down 61 per cent from a year earlier to to $28.3m.With the exception of American Girl, Mattel’s key brands all sank in the quarter. Barbie sales were down 15 per cent, Fisher-Price fell 17 per cent and Hot Wheels slipped 2 per cent.The toy maker’s shares declined 7 per cent to $36.46.Overall, US equity markets declined after a Malaysian Airlines passenger flight crashed in Ukraine.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,958.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 16,976.81.

42;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2014-02-24T22:12:30Z;Humana surges as health insurers avoid worst of government cuts;;Humana shares surged to a record high on Monday after the health insurance provider said US government funding cuts to the Medicare programme through the private market would be less than had been expected.US government payments into the Medicare Advantage plan would fall 3.5 to 4 per cent in 2015, the company said in a filing with US securities regulators. Executives had previously warned analysts and investors the drop could be as high as 7 per cent.The change in tone follows new payment guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services issued last Friday, stating that proposed changes would be “ smaller than those implemented in 2014”.The advance notice from the government estimates a 1.9 per cent drop in healthcare spending for Medicare Advantage policy holders.The Medicare Advantage programme generated nearly two-thirds of Humana’s $41.3bn of sales in 2013. The company expects to add between 370,000 and 410,000 subscribers to the programme over the current year.“The company is continuing to evaluate the changes detailed in the Advance Notice and the related impact company-wide and by geography,” Humana said.Shares in Humana rose 10.6 per cent to $113.69, while rivals UnitedHealth Group advanced 2.9 per cent to $76.01, Aetna added 1.9 per cent to $71.80, WellPoint climbed 2.7 per cent to $90.93, and Tenet Healthcare rose 3.1 per cent to $48.33.Verizon was having trouble finding its feet on its first trading day since it completed the purchase of Vodafone’s minority stake in its US wireless venture.Shares in the largest US wireless operator fell 2.2 per cent on Monday, following a trading update in which management said it expected consolidated revenues to grow 4 per cent in 2014 to about $125bn.This was a little slower than the 4.1 per cent advance a year earlier but in line with Wall Street forecasts.Verizon management also said it was targeting an increase in margins for both its wireless and wireline businesses as they continued to add subscribers.Lowell McAdam, chief executive, said the completed merger marked a “major milestone” for Verizon.Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski noted that volatility in Verizon shares would probably continue over the next three months as index buyers absorb shares.BlackBerry shares rose 7.5 per cent to $9.83 after the mobile device maker said it would make its messaging service, BBM, available to Microsoft’s Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms.Deal activity saw shares in RF Micro Devices, a manufacturer of radio frequency equipment, surge 21 per cent to $7.03. It agreed to merge with TriQuint Semiconductor in an all-stock deal that will create a new company with $2bn in annual revenues. TriQuint shares jumped 26.1 per cent to $11.64.Shareholders in RF Micro and TriQuint, a parts supplier in the radio frequency sector, will receive an equal stake in the combined venture. Under the terms of the deal, TriQuint shareholders will receive 1.675 shares of the new company and RF Micro shareholders will receive one share, for each TriQuint or RF Micro share held.“The world’s demand for mobile data is growing exponentially,” RF chief executive Bob Bruggeworth said. “The combination of TriQuint and RFMD creates a new leader in RF solutions with expertise in mobile devices and complex infrastructure and global defence applications.Mr Bruggeworth will lead the combined company as chief executive, while TriQuint’s current chief executive Ralph Quinsey will serve as non-executive chairman.The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index broke into record territory, up 21.4 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,857.66, earlier in the day. It closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,847.61.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 103.84 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 16,207.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 29.56 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 4,292.97.
43;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2014-02-20T20:49:32Z;The digitised employee – can wearable technology help create a healthier, more productive workforce?;;"This year may be the year of wearable devices, judging from the buzz at the International Consumer Electronics Symposium (CES) last month and next week at Mobile World Congress. With the ability to place microsensors virtually anywhere, technology is more wearable than ever, and individuals are embracing technology that moves with them through their daily lives.Taken together the global market for smart glasses, activity monitors, and smart watches could reach $3bn in 2014. While the cases for smart glasses aren’t yet developed enough to outweigh the aesthetic concerns for the average consumer, innovators are rapidly working on apps to make them more useful, if not irreplaceable.They have enterprise potential in heavy industries such as manufacturing and oil and gas where a worker in the field might benefit from hands-free access to instructions, maintenance guides, videos or live interaction with a remote trainer or team. Yet, in the near term, the rationale for widespread adoption of smart glasses in the enterprise doesn’t exist yet.If the eyes are the windows to your soul, the array of wearable tech devices suggests the wrist may prove to be the door to your health. The increasing number of fitness bands and activity monitors are becoming more sophisticated, with the ability to measure the intensity of activity and even distinguish the type of activity and provide feedback on not just level of activity, but form and efficiency.Other devices now monitor blood pressure and blood oxygenation among other indicators. All of these technologies can communicate with apps on the most sophisticated “wearable” most people use – the smartphone.How can the enterprise benefit from this pervasive consumer technology?As we consider the possibilities gained through the digitisation of the physical world, we can’t overlook the potential benefits from digitisation of the employee. And while a more specialised application of the technology of fitness bands has some value for timework studies and better understanding employee interaction patterns, the best near-term opportunity for companies to use these consumer devices might be to improve employee health and wellness by using wearables in concert with the social media and other technologies the workforce already uses.The large presence companies like United Healthcare Group had at this year’s CES supports the potential for integrating consumer technologies to impact population health and healthcare costs.Companies will benefit from digitisation of the employee. Those that provide health insurance, as in the US, can negotiate lower premiums for a healthier employee population. Others will pay less as a share of employee health expenditures. All companies will benefit from reduced employee absenteeism and lost productivity associated with poor health.Of course, neither healthcare technology nor employee wellness programs are new. Traditional wellness programs have often been less effective than expected or haven’t yielded sufficient return on investment. What is different now is the convergence of factors – cheap, unobtrusive sensors, mass adoption of sophisticated mobile devices, ubiquitous wireless broadband access, an ageing population, and reforms that are addressing costs and shifting more financial responsibility to individuals. All of this is creating a unique opportunity to integrate wearable devices and other technologies to improve wellness and manage illness.What might this look like?In 2011, Progressive Insurance, a US-based insurance company, launched a program whereby a consumer could receive a personalised, often lower, rate on their auto insurance if they installed a small device, the Snapshot, to monitor their driving behaviour. While self-selection may be part of the answer, these drivers also had the benefit of greater awareness and information about how their driving affected their safety and the price they paid. Many modified their behaviour as a result.Imagine if employees could get a lower health-insurance rate by demonstrating a healthful lifestyle. Unlike the Progressive example, many individuals are already using these devices. Companies can experiment with these workers to develop programs and tools that provide greater transparency into how individual choices affect health and incentives and support for individuals to improve their own health.Predicting an individual’s health over time, and understanding how to improve it, requires creating a profile that reflects a person’s behaviours throughout the day, their movement and physical activity, their eating patterns, their socialising, etc.The data that really predict long-term health, and give indicators about how to affect it, do not reside in the electronic health record (EHR). A more predictive program would draw data from employees’ activity monitors, credit card or grocery club records and social media. Where we go, what we do, what we buy – these all change our health profile.One lesson from the fitness industry relevant to companies seeking to improve wellness (or productivity or effectiveness) is that accuracy doesn’t matter; changing behaviour matters. So it is less a question of finding a device/application combination that can capture every movement and every bite and accurately translate them into calories out and calories in, than it is to find a combination of device and data and social platform and incentives that spur employees to move around more, to eat more healthfully and to build connections with each other.Many grocery stores, airlines, hotel chains and other vendors have demonstrated that people will share information to get better service or save money. A trusted third party – not the employer and not the insurer or other payer – would have to handle the aggregation and analysis of data. But this is already the norm for most employee-wellness programs. The key difference being that, in the case of a comprehensive health-profile program, this third party would be aggregating a much higher volume of personal data than the typical employee self-assessments – possibly vital signs, activity patterns, physical location, schedule, detailed buying habits – thus requiring an incontrovertible policy of data privacy and security.Of course, it’s not about the technology. Time and again, from the first attempts to introduce telemedicine back in the 1920s to the EHR, the healthcare industry has found that technology itself is not the answer, or at least not the limiting factor. Many innovations that should have driven down costs didn’t, either because of structural issues in reimbursement or poor execution or lack of alignment with incentives – healthcare technology companies continue to build better mousetraps without necessarily understanding the mice.Ultimately, the opportunity for companies to improve employee health and wellness has to revolve around the individual deciding to make changes to his or her own lifestyle and then actually doing it. The difference now is that mobile technology and analytics provide the tools to engage and enable the individual, and rising individual responsibility for healthcare costs provide more financial incentive than ever before for individuals to understand and improve their complete health profile.Eric Openshaw is a vice-chairman and the US Technology, Media & Telecommunications leader for Deloitte, and Harry Greenspun is the Senior Advisor for Healthcare Transformation & Technology at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions."
44;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;CES 2014: Digital healthcare opportunities for tech start-ups;;The sick, the old and the stressed are the unlikely new target market for a growing corner of the technology industry, which is salivating over the opportunities offered by healthcare reform in the US.From start-ups to large health insurance providers, the digital health industry exhibits at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show expanded by 40 per cent this year as companies showed off products promising to save money by keeping patients at home.Dr Samir Damani, a cardiologist who now runs MD Revolution, said using internet-connected devices to monitor health from afar and develop predictive intelligence would change disease management forever.“A doctor’s life is going to change dramatically, now they are going to be a maestro, orchestrating care,” he said. “They won’t just get paid for seeing someone, they’ll get paid for delivering an outcome.”The US Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s flagship healthcare policy, puts pressure on providers to prove they are delivering the most cost-effective care. For the technology industry, this means encouraging more remote care and preventive monitoring to eliminate unnecessary doctors’ visits and hospital stays.Even for those not affected by the Affordable Care Act, the rising cost of healthcare in the US and around the world is also providing an opportunity for companies as MD Revolution, a subscription-based online health monitoring platform.“The economics are finally aligning. Physicians co-pays are going up, there are higher deductibles and people are more concerned about prevention because of that,” Dr Damani said.Attitudes are changing too, with few worried about threats to the security and privacy of information about their health – despite past cyber attacks on internet-connected medical devices.Some 84 per cent of people are willing to share personal healthcare information to lower costs to the system, and 72 per cent are willing to see a doctor by video conference for a non-urgent appointment, according to a survey of 12,000 patients across eight countries by Intel.While other stalls at the industry’s largest trade show used flashing lights and loud music to promote the latest curved screens, MD Live showed how to order a doctor’s appointment from a television set. Chuck Hector, chief sales officer for the Miami-based company showed passers-by the “living room of the medical house of tomorrow”.For just $40, cheaper than the average co-pay, patients with minor ailments can see one of 3,000 doctors working for the service who can then send prescriptions to their local pharmacy. “We’re definitely very Affordable Care Act friendly,” he said, adding the service was contracted to work for the Nevada Exchange as well as 400 companies including Yahoo, AOL and Qualcomm.The rush to make products for the sick is not restricted to US companies. Qardio, a London-based start-up, is launching two new medical devices designed for those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This spring it will launch a blood pressure monitor and an ECG monitor, a simple white plastic cross with an Apple-like aesthetic, which send information over the internet to a doctor.For those struggling to get excited about scattering sensors all over their home, new companies are trying to prove the “internet of things” is not indulgent gadgetry but a vital way to keep older relatives safe.Continue readingAlexis Zervoglos, a director at Qardio, said it was “completely focused” on the cost-saving drives by the National Health Service in the UK and the Affordable Care Act. The ECG monitor costs $449 and can be used indefinitely, compared with the current option which costs $2,000 for a single day, he said.“We’re trying to reduce the number of unnecessary doctors’ visits when you go in and take time and the doctor tells you you’re well, as well as focusing on stopping the condition progressing to acute illness when expenses increase exponentially,” he said.Young companies such as Qardio are bubbling up everywhere, excited to work in an area previously neglected by the technology industry. But Harry Wang, an analyst at Parks Associates, said larger companies such as United Healthcare, a US health insurer, would be ready to “scoop up” the successful start-ups.“The next two years are an entrepreneurs story but in 2016 and 2017 we’ll see a lot of acquisition and consolidation in the space,” he said.United Healthcare, whose large stand loomed over the others at the show, has already partnered with several health technology companies such as CareSpeak Communications, a disease management software maker and Fitbit, a fitness wristband manufacturer.At CES, it displayed a new booking system for patients to negotiate cheaper prices with physicians who have open appointments. A pilot of the “easy book” system – much like a flight booker with fluctuating rates – reduced the cost of services by an average of 30 per cent.Thomas Paul, chief consumer officer for United Healthcare, said the Affordable Care Act was part of a broader push for patients to take more responsibility for their care.“The consumer is being asked to do more and needs help doing it,” he said. “So most consumers turn to devices.”
45;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;AT&T to roll out sponsored content to subscribers;;AT&T plans to become the first major US mobile operator to allow companies to offer sponsored content and other free services to its subscribers – a move that some believe could pose a challenge to wireless “net neutrality” rules.Ralph de la Vega, AT&T Mobility’s president, announced the initiative during his keynote speech at AT&T’s developers conference in Las Vegas, timed to coincide with the annual Consumer Electronics Show.Mr de la Vega and other senior AT&T executives said the move would benefit both consumers and the companies expected to sign up for its “sponsored data” plan, which will enable businesses to pay for a customer’s wireless data associated with the delivery of sponsored content or apps, much like a company covers the cost of a long-distance call using a freephone or 1-800 number.AT&T said a handful of companies including UnitedHealth, Boston-based advertising start-up Aquto and Kony Solutions, a Florida-based mobile software developer, have been testing the service which is expected to be rolled out on a commercial basis beginning this quarter.However, the move has already caused concern among consumer advocates and some lawmakers including Anna Eshoo, a member of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee.“The announcement of a sponsored data programme by AT&T puts it in the business of picking winners and losers on the internet, threatening the open internet, competition and consumer choice,” said Ms Eshoo. “It’s exactly why net neutrality rules came to exist in the first place and why these rules should apply equally to all forms of broadband internet service.”AT&T insisted, however, that the plan was simply a different billing model and did not involve preferential treatment for sponsors or prioritisation of data traffic which might fall foul of net neutrality rules.Meanwhile, as smartphone sales slow and the US mobile market becomes more competitive, Mr de la Vega outlined AT&T’s plans to expand its mobile business in the face of a scramble among operators for customers.Last week, AT&T, the second-largest US mobile operator by subscriber numbers, stepped up its battle for new customers by offering a package of incentives worth up to $450 to T-Mobile US subscribers who switch to AT&T. T-Mobile US has helped shake up the US mobile sector over the past nine months, launching a package of price cuts and other initiatives under its “un-carrier” marketing initiative.While Mr de la Vega insisted in an interview that the US mobile market had always been competitive, he also highlighted AT&T’s initiatives in new growth areas such as connected cars, which he dubbed “smartphones on wheels”.He said AT&T was determined to become a leader in areas such as connected cars and home security and automation systems, which he described as major growth opportunities and which analysts believe could help AT&T offset margin pressures in its core mobile business.
46;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2014-01-05T15:52:10Z;CES welcomes arrival of other industries to tech sector carnival;;The annual carnival of the consumer technology sector that starts this week is being taken over by other industries from healthcare to cars, showing how integral technology has become to products across the board.No longer simply the home of ever bigger TVs and ever smaller smartphones, this year’s International Consumer Electronics Show is showcasing 40 per cent more exhibitors in digital healthcare and 25 per cent more car stands than last year.For the first time, on-trend wearable technology will be featured in a fashion showcase and the film, TV and music industry will be celebrated at a red carpet awards ceremony.The Las Vegas show will also feature keynote speeches from MillerCoors, the brewer, and Audi, the carmaker.Stuart Sikes, president of Park Associates, a market research firm, said the show’s expansion into other industries showed few executives could now ignore the impact of technology.“Consumer electronics used to mean TVs and computers but now it means watches, toys, eyeglasses, cars, pill dispensers and running shoes,” he said.“If you are a leading consumer products brand, you better be using technology to differentiate your product – which means you will likely be exhibiting at CES – if not now, then in the near future.”Mr Sikes said that companies in the auto industry and healthcare sector needed to partner with technology companies.“The speed by which technology companies operate is so much faster than traditional non-technology companies,” he said. “Fortunately both traditional and technology companies, with a few exceptions such as Tesla Motors, understand that partnerships are the path to success.”United Healthcare, a health insurance company exhibiting at the show, has partnerships with smaller health technology companies from CareSpeak Communications, disease management software maker, to Fitbit, the fitness wristband manufacturer.BMW has worked with Apple on in-car entertainment and integrating Siri, Apple’s voice controlled personal assistant. Google is rumoured to be announcing a similar partnership using its Android mobile operating system in cars made by Audi at the show this week.As marketing moves online, technology and particularly the data it can collect are affecting how companies communicate with their customers.MillerCoors and Ford, as well as social networks Facebook and Twitter, will be discussing the future of digital advertising at the event.Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm, said a whole range of consumer brands were now learning to use technology behind blogs and tweets to reach their customers, wherever they are.“The web is certainly a place where brands have reached their customers, but today that means reaching them on their mobile devices, on alternative platforms such as games consoles, wearable computers, in their cars and when out exploring their worlds,” he said.But he said that while other industries presence had grown at the Consumer Electronics Show, some of the biggest names in technology now stayed away.“There has been a pullback from some technology companies at CES, for example, Apple and Google are not exhibiting,” he said. “Many of these companies have their own showcase events or they are participating at any of the many technology specific trade shows.”
47;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2013-12-10T20:59:47Z;The numbers stack up for better, cheaper treatment;Complex data provides a new type of knowledge that could translate to better healthcare;Using digital clinical records and text mining to search for words or phrases, medical professionals at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre (UPMC) can assess the likelihood of certain patients needing emergency care.When “wheeled walker” (a walking frame) occurs in clinical notes, for example, the likelihood rises. When the word “mother” appears, it falls.Of course, it is not that everyone with a walking frame will end up in emergency care or that everyone with a mother will not, explains Pamela Peele, chief analytics officer for UPMC’s insurance services division. But when included in clinical notes and compared with vast numbers of electronic records, certain words provide strong signals of what may happen to a patient.“You could never do that if all you had at your disposal were millions of pages of clinical notes,” says Professor Peele, who is also a University of Pittsburgh faculty member. “But when we’ve got it in electronic format, this is the kind of new knowledge we can drive – that’s the promise of big data.”Clinical notes are just one source of the big data (complex information produced in vast amounts) that many believe could transform healthcare. Others include insurance claims, which can highlight, for example, where and when use of certain procedures is spiking.Meanwhile, rich data streams are generated by personal health technology – from the mobile devices people use to monitor their conditions to the wristbands a growing number of consumers are using to track their fitness.GPS-enabled asthma inhalers, which record the date, time and location of each inhalation, not only track an individual’s condition but also generate data that can be analysed to assess how asthma affects certain segments of the population.Cost control is another potential use of data analytics. “There are significant pricing differentials across regions and procedures,” says Steven Van Kuiken, a McKinsey director and head of the firm’s work on healthcare information technology. “One thing big data can do is highlight those variances and allow patients or payers to act on that.”Fraud detection is facilitated by data analytics. In the US, LexisNexis, the information provider, has helped public sector clients identify abuse of Medicaid, the government insurance programme for the poor. In one state, data analytics uncovered fraudulent Medicaid claims being made by a group of people living in a million-dollar condominium.Big data can also improve consumer choices on healthcare, says Paul Bleicher, chief executive of Optum Labs, a research centre that is part of UnitedHealth Group, the US healthcare company. He points to an app developed by the group’s insurance company, UnitedHealthcare.The app, he explains, allows users to identify doctors in their area, see how much they charge for certain procedures, assess them based on objective quality measures and work out what the procedure will cost, given the benefits in their insurance plan.“Being able to bring together data from disparate sources to drive specific actions is the big data vision,” says Dr Bleicher.But while the benefits of big data are starting to emerge, the fragmented nature of the healthcare industry, combined with privacy concerns about electronic health records, mean that choice and efficiency may take longer to spread than in other industries.“What’s standing in the way is that the current clinical data systems are not interoperable,” says Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School professor known for her research in healthcare. She points out that someone with congestive heart failure may have at least 34 related disorders.“So it’s likely that 34 or more providers have dealt with them,” she says. “And they have systems that don’t talk to each other.”In a January report, the Rand Corporation, think-tank, found that sluggish adoption of health information technology, lack of connectivity and the fact that the technology was not easy to use all prevented health IT systems from generating widespread cost savings.Yet, given the financial pressures on healthcare providers, some believe the adoption of data analytics will accelerate. Part of this is being driven by demographics. As populations age rapidly, individuals may live for many years with several conditions and so need greater care co-ordination, which can be expensive.Here, predictive modelling can play a role. “The ability to target scarce resources around care co-ordination to the people most likely to need them is an extremely good example of the efficiencies of big data,” says Prof Peele.Meanwhile, to cut costs and improve care for everyone, healthcare systems are shifting their focus from individual procedures to end-to-end care, also requiring greater co-ordination between different medical professionals.“The economics are too compelling,” says Mr Van Kuiken at McKinsey. Using predictive analytics, he says, health systems can deliver “much better care at a lower cost than anyone can operating in the old world of fragmented decision making and indirect incentives”.
48;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2013-10-23T21:34:21Z;Blair health adviser to run NHS England;;An architect of Tony Blair’s health reforms, which introduced private sector competition into the NHS, has been appointed to run the English health service.Simon Stevens, who leaves a lucrative post as president of the Global Health division at UnitedHealth Group in the US, takes on one of the most politically charged roles in British public life. Jeremy Hunt, health secretary, hailed his “extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator”.Mr Stevens’ predecessor as NHS England chief executive, Sir David Nicholson, came under pressure over healthcare scandals and his penchant for first-class rail travel. Sir David admitted when he announced his resignation in June that he had “become the story”.The new chief seemed consciously to draw a line under that era by announcing that “in the light of NHS spending pressures” he would give up 10 per cent of a potential salary of £211,000.Mr Hunt praised his “admirable determination to lead from the front on the issue of high pay” which came as NHS Employers, the negotiating arm of the health department, warned that a planned 1 per cent pay increase for health staff may be unaffordable next year.Health department insiders presented Mr Stevens – who served as adviser to Mr Blair and to Alan Milburn when he was health secretary – as a non-partisan choice who offered clear continuity with the reforming New Labour years.Mr Stevens, who takes the helm in April, said the next five years would be “extremely challenging for the NHS” but it would be a privilege to lead NHS England “at a time when the stakes have never been higher”.One person who worked closely with Mr Stevens in government described him as “very, very clever with real political nous”. Mr Stevens demonstrated his political skills when he negotiated in Washington with the Obama administration over US health reforms.Andrew Lansley, Mr Hunt’s predecessor as health secretary, has described NHS reforms implemented in April as an evolution from the changes introduced in the Blair years.Mr Stevens was instrumental in devising the NHS Plan in 2000 which focused on reorganising services and introducing surgical centres run by the private sector to reduce waiting times and put pressure on NHS providers to improve.However, Conservative insiders suggested that the appointment could prove difficult for Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary, who distanced himself from his predecessors’ willingness to use the private sector to provide NHS-funded care during his own time as health secretary.Mr Hunt emphasised Mr Stevens’ ability to draw on “international expertise” as he tackled “the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now: how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable”.The health secretary said Mr Stevens’ “passion for our universal health service, free at the point of use goes back many years.”
49;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Obamacare’s online market put to test;Healthcare exchanges offering insurance plans prepare for launch;A pillar of US President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act faces a crucial test in the coming months when new healthcare exchanges that are supposed to insure 25m Americans start operating.By early October, every state in the nation is supposed to go “live” with an online marketplace that will provide a single venue to buy insurance plans. Just as the Expedia travel website provides competing prices for air tickets, the healthcare exchanges will provide easily comparable plans for the uninsured and small businesses.But the big question facing the White House is whether this experiment will take off or crash.One of the big issues facing the exchanges is whether the massive information technology undertaking will function seamlessly even though many of the systems are yet to be tested.A second is whether years of intense opposition to the healthcare law by Republican governors and lawmakers will affect consumers, creating a red state/blue state divide. Democrat states that have supported the reform have invested far more resources in trying to make the exchanges work.“This is absolutely a Herculean task for both the federal government and the states, unprecedented in terms of co-ordination and systems building. That said, this is not the federal government’s first rodeo,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University.Ms Corlette and others say there were concerns about possible technology glitches when the government launched a prescription drug programme for the elderly in 2005, but today it is very popular and works well.States run by Republican governors, including Texas and Florida, which have some of the highest rates of uninsured, opted not to create their own exchanges, leaving the task to the federal government, which is struggling under budget constraints.But to date, there is little public information available about whether the federal-run exchanges, 27 in all, are on target.California, Oregon, and Washington are further along than many in identifying insurers and choosing technology for their exchanges.“Those three states in particular have partisan support,” said Lauren Fifield, senior policy adviser for Practice Fusion, an electronic medical records start-up in San Francisco. “More important than anything, they have payer support – aggressive plans that are willing to lead the way.”California took an active approach in negotiating with insurers to take lower reimbursement rates and charge lower premiums.The state released a list of 13 insurers in mid May. The typical medium-priced plan cost $276 per month, a rate much lower than the $450 federal officials estimated in 2009.UnitedHealth, Cigna and Aetna, three leading employer health plans, chose not to participate in California’s exchange but together they only account for 7 per cent of the state’s market for individual plans, according to Citigroup.Because there are so many potential customers in the state that do not currently have health coverage – approximately 5m – many insurers were willing to lower rates in an effort to gain a lead in market share.California followed the federal tiered system, demarcated by Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze plans, and made sure the participating insurers offered plans that conformed to the standards of each category so consumers could easily compare plans and know what they get for what price.It is the execution of these features that will ultimately differentiate the early adopter states from the laggards, Ms Fifield said. Because people in the US have very little experience shopping around for healthcare or paying attention to costs, the usability of the exchange websites and the presentation of the plans for sale will be key to consumer satisfaction.“Until now, individuals haven’t been forced to be consumers,” she said. “It remains to be seen what will be compelling, in terms of marketing tools.”By October, if all goes to plan, Americans will be able to log on to their state’s healthcare portal and input basic identifying information.A new “federal hub” that combines data from the Department of Homeland Security (to verify immigration status), the Internal Revenue Service (to verify income) and other bureaucracies will determine whether a person is eligible for tax subsidies, and how much.The person can then choose between competing insurance plans. If eligible for subsidies, the federal government will make monthly payments to an insurance provider while monitoring income levels on a monthly basis to ensure the person is not receiving too few or too many subsidies.

It is also plausible that traders anticipated such an outcome and bet accordingly.Humana shares rose 5.4 per cent to $79.11 amid high volumes.Shares in UnitedHealth Group, which were upgraded by analysts at Raymond James to “strong buy”, also rallied, adding 4.7 per cent to $61.74. Aetna and Cigna Corporation rose 3.7 per cent to $54.30 and 2.9 per cent to $64.75 respectively.The wider US stock market moved higher and the S&P 500 surpassed its previous record closing high reached last week, with sentiment boosted by better than expected factory orders data.The benchmark index advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,570.25 on Tuesday, hitting a new record high and only 6 points shy of the all-time intraday high reached in October 2007. Seven of ten main sectors were in positive territory, with gains led by healthcare stocks.“The way the stock markets treated today’s poor eurozone economic data indicates that they were pricing in a much worse outcome,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.“It is slightly worrying that markets are not more concerned, given the importance of the region to trade,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, added 0.6 per cent to 14,662.01.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Urban Outfitters jumped 3.8 per cent to $39.87 after the company revealed in a 10-K filing that first-quarter comparable net sales were up in the high single-digits.Shares in Garmin, manufacturer of GPS devices, rose 5.1 per cent to $34.25 after it announced it would provide in-dash navigation for future Mercedes-Benz models.Housebuilders initially attracted buyers, with the S&P 500 homebuilder index up as much as 1 per cent in early trading. As the housing market has been slowly returning to health, boosted by record-low borrowing rates, homebuilders benefited, with the subgroup more than tripling since October 2011.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, is optimistic about further growth in the housing market, saying the turn in housing is being misperceived as almost over. “Given protracted stagnation in housing starts at historically low levels of activity, it would seem as if the recovery could last several years and gain strength,” he wrote in a research note.PulteGroup erased gains and was 1.3 per cent lower at $19.86, while DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $23.41.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite paired some of the earlier gains and closed up 0.5 per cent at 3,254.86, as its largest member Apple retreated from earlier advances to finish 0.2 per cent higher at $429.90.Shares in the iPhone maker sold off during the previous session as it bowed to Chinese pressure and issued a formal apology to consumers in its second-largest market. The stock has been declining since peaking at $702 in September 2012 and has lost more than 17 per cent since the start of the year.Nasdaq OMX shares tumbled 12.8 per cent to $27.91 as Moody’s put the exchange operator on review for downgrade. Nasdaq’s current credit rating is one notch above junk. The decision by Moody’s followed the announcement that Nasdaq OMX agreed to buy a US Treasury trading platform from BGC Partners in a $1.2bn cash and deferred stock deal.BGC Partners shares soared 48.6 per cent to $5.72.Hewlett-Packard shares suffered after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to “sell”, saying that “consensus is attributing unreasonably high probability to HP turnround success and incorrectly assuming fundamentals have already bottomed”.

51;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2013-01-17T23:16:28Z;UnitedHealth faces uncertain times;Insurer’s stock to remain cheap until impact of US healthcare act is known;"Cheap, but no bargain. UnitedHealth lifted earnings per share 12 per cent last year. As good insurance companies do, it generates more cash flow than earnings. Membership is growing. Cost trends are benign. And you can have the stock for a hypnotic 9 times forward earnings.There is no mystery here. The reason for the discount is uncertainty about what happens in 2014, when the US Affordable Care Act is implemented fully. Two main areas will be affected. First is the small business and individual market, where ACA rules put tight limits on underwriting and mandate the creation of insurance “exchanges”, which will offer standardised insurance products from both for- profit and non-profit insurers. What will the margins on exchange products be? Will they lure members away from traditional health plans? It simply is not known. In its earnings call on Thursday, UnitedHealth said a tenth of its earnings come from individuals and small businesses. So, in the worst case, all of that is at risk (WellPoint, for example, could suffer more; Goldman Sachs estimates that up to a third of its earnings comes from this market).Then there is Medicare Advantage, through which private insurers manage the care of those enrolled in the federal healthcare scheme for the elderly. This accounts for as much as a quarter of UnitedHealth’s profits, reckons Goldman. The ACA targets payments to MA contractors as a source of savings; the Congressional Budget Office estimates the cuts at $150bn, spread over the next 10 years (Medicare Advantage benefit payments totalled about $120bn in 2012). Actual impact? By all accounts: somewhere between bad and not so bad. UnitedHealth calls the rules “manageable”, but forgoes forecasts. That single-digit multiple, be it too low or too high, is likely to stick around until 2014 reveals its secrets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
52;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2013-01-17T23:08:43Z;UnitedHealth eyes higher earnings in 2014;;UnitedHealth, the biggest US health insurer by revenues, said on Thursday that it expects to increase earnings next year in spite of changes associated with President Barack Obama’s healthcare law.Health insurers have been anxious about the rollout of the law, which will be fully in place by 2014, due to increased taxes, uncertainty associated with state insurance exchanges and regulations on how sharply they can increase prices.Stephen Hemsley, chief executive of UnitedHealth, said on a conference call with analysts that at this point there have been few problems associated with the law, which was passed in the face of fierce opposition in 2010, and that the new regulations might not be as bad as some have feared.“There is certainly a great deal more to work through and significant unknowns but so far, it has been manageable,” Mr Hemsley said. “In the end, the ACA [Affordable Care Act] expands an enormous national healthcare market that will be served by the private sector.”Mr Hemsley would not say to what extent UnitedHealth plans to participate in the healthcare exchanges, which will be online marketplaces for consumers to shop for insurance plans. The exchanges are expected to be operational in all 50 states by next year and the company will probably participate in 10 to 25 initially.“We advocate that exchanges be a level playing field and fairly deregulated,” he said. “The more complex exchanges become, the greater the potential for unintended market distortions and therefore, the greater reluctance to use them.”Mr Hemsley’s comments came as UnitedHealth reported fourth-quarter earnings which revealed a decline in profits due to higher medical costs.Net earnings declined by 0.8 per cent year-on-year to $1.24bn, or $1.20 a share, as revenues rose 10.6 per cent to $25.8bn. Shares of UnitedHealth closed up 1.4 per cent to $54.40 on Thursday.Medical costs picked up as patients have increased use of health services and procedures that they had put off during the worst of the economic downturn. UnitedHealth said it also faced additional costs in the fourth quarter associated with an unusually bad flu outbreak and due to Hurricane Sandy, which inflicted damage and injuries on people in several US states last year.Matthew Borsch, healthcare analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that although UnitedHealth appears to be fundamentally “solid,” investors are remaining on the sidelines because of uncertainty over how healthcare reform will be implemented.In spite of UnitedHealth’s optimism, others in the industry have warned about unintended consequences of the law.Health insurance lobbyists warned earlier this month that health insurance premiums for young people could go up because the penalties used to “mandate” consumers to purchase insurance are too weak.In December, Mark Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, warned that people who earn too much money to be eligible for government subsidies could face “premium rate shock”, with the price of their insurance potentially doubling.

Revenues were up 6.5 per cent to $17bn.“Our third-quarter results reflected continued sales momentum driven by strong growth of key products, successful new product launches and the addition of Synthes to our family of companies,” Alex Gorsky, chief executive, said.Mr Gorsky, who took over as chief executive earlier this year, is under pressure to revive J&J’s fortunes after an embarrassing stretch of product recalls during the past few years. The company, which continues to face litigation across the US, is attempting to rehabilitate its image and correct problems in its consumer business.During the third quarter, sluggish consumer sales were offset by growth in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device businesses.J&J raised its earnings outlook for the year and the shares rose 0.96 per cent to $69.26 in pre-market trading.Separately on Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group, the largest US health insurer, increased its earnings outlook as it reported rises in net earnings and revenues as medical costs stabilised. The company’s net income rose 23 per cent to $1.55bn, or $1.50 a share, on $27.3bn in revenues.Last week UnitedHealth announced that it would take a 90 per cent stake in Amil Participacoes, a Brazilian insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9bn as part of plans to increase its emerging markets presence.

55;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-10-08T21:41:33Z;Global expansion plan lifts UnitedHealth;;UnitedHealth Group’s shares rose after the US health insurer said it would expand its international business by acquiring a 90 per cent stake in Amil Participacoes, a leading Brazilian health insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9bn.The planned takeover, announced on Monday, comes as companies in the US health industry have looked to consolidate or to expand their business outside the country as new regulations from President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law take hold.UnitedHealth, the largest US insurer by revenues, already operates in Portugal, India and the Middle East through joint ventures. Amil provided health coverage to 5.8m customers in Brazil and had sales of $9.81bn in 2011.Shares in UnitedHealth rose as much as 2 per cent in the morning session before paring early gains to close 0.8 per cent higher at $57.60.Last month, the company replaced Kraft on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to become the only health insurer on the Big Board.Aetna, a rival health insurer, purchased Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn in August, uniting the US providers. Aetna shares gained 1 per cent to $42.08.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 14 per cent to $92.30 in after-market trading as the maker of cardiovascular equipment said sales for the third quarter would fall short of market expectations.During market hours, the S&P 500 healthcare sector dropped 0.1 per cent as Wall Street braced for the start of what is expected to be the poorest US quarterly earnings period since late 2009.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.35 per cent to 1,455.88, coming off a week that saw equities rise to their best intraday level for the year.Alcoa shares closed 0.3 per cent higher to $9.12 as the economic bellwether prepared to start the third-quarter reporting season with its results on Tuesday. Its results will be followed by two of the nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, later in the week.Wells Fargo lost 0.1 per cent to $35.81, while JPMorgan Chase fell 0.1 per cent to $41.66. The S&P 500 financial sector declined 0.1 per cent.Analysts have forecast that company earnings for the three-month period to September will register their first negative result in 11 quarters. On Monday, some investors wondered whether the situation could worsen after the third-quarter results have been reported.Sam Stovall, equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said: “The primary focus of participants on company conference calls, in our opinion, will be finding out if third-quarter results will indeed be the trough in this earnings cycle and if forward quarters will exhibit a gradual acceleration in growth.”He added: “The strong performances of the S&P 500 and its sectors since June, in which the [index] gained more than 11 per cent in price, led by the cyclical sectors at the expense of the defensive ones, may be a preamble to the coming turn in the earnings tide.”Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 0.2 per cent to 5,057.055. Two of its constituents, FedEx and UPS, have already warned that their results for the full year will be worse than initially expected. FedEx shares dropped 0.1 per cent to $86.37, while UPS rose 0.9 per cent to $73.76.In what many consider a sign of the macroeconomic difficulties challenging many US companies, the Dow Transports have gained just 0.7 per cent since the start of the year. That compares with a 15.8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 in the same period.The S&P 500’s gains have been bolstered by constituents such as Apple, which is up more than 58 per cent since the start of the year.Apple shares, however, were 2.2 per cent lower at $638.16 as information technology stocks were among the day’s worst performing sector groups and lost 1.1 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.8 per cent to 3,112.35, but Netflix shares continued to gain momentum. It rose 10.5 per cent to $73.52 as analysts at Morgan Stanley said that its shares were undervalued.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,583.65.American Express shares rose 0.4 per cent to $58.82. The payment services company said on Monday it would team with Walmart to provide lower-income customers who may not have a bank account with a prepaid debit card. Walmart shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $75.25.
56;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-10-08T17:27:07Z;UnitedHealth to take 90% stake in Brazil’s Amil;US insurer seeks to increase presence in emerging markets;UnitedHealth Group has agreed to acquire control of Amil Participacoes, a Brazilian insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9bn as part of plans to increase the emerging markets presence of the biggest US health insurer by revenues.In a cash deal announced on Monday, UnitedHealth will acquire 60 per cent of Amil’s outstanding shares from controlling shareholders and management during the fourth quarter of 2012. Then during the first half of 2013 it will make a tender offer to acquire 30 per cent from public shareholders.“Brazil has emerged as a consistently growing and evolving market for private sector health benefits and services,” said Stephen Hemsley, chief executive of UnitedHealth. “Its growing economy, emerging middle class and progressive policies toward managed care make it a high potential growth market.”The Financial Times reported that the two companies were in talks last week.Dr Edson Bueno, Amil’s founder, and his partner Dulce Pugliese hold 70 per cent of the company’s shares, and Dr Bueno will remain chief executive after the deal closes. As part of the agreement, they will retain 10 per cent of the company’s shares for at least five years.Amil had about $5bn in annual revenues this year, up 15 per cent from 2011.US health insurers have been looking for international opportunities as the industry faces greater regulation at home as part of the Obama administration’s healthcare reform law. UnitedHealth, which operates in Portugal, India and the Middle East through joint ventures, has been looking to become more of a global force in the healthcare industry.“It’s a good move for UnitedHealth,” said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager and analyst at Poliwogg. “Brazil is an interesting opportunity because it is more amenable to the kinds of services they provide than a single payer system like in Britain.”Mr Hemsley said on a conference call with analysts that Brazil’s rapid economic growth and political stability made it an attractive place to seek international growth. However, he said that UnitedHealth was not turning its back on the US market.“It doesn’t really say anything at all negative about the domestic marketplace,” Mr Hemsley said. “This gives us an opportunity to pursue a new growth channel and growth platform in a new marketplace and really not create any conflict in terms of the domestic marketplace.”Rival insurers have been consolidating recently, attempting to take advantage of the growing market for government-backed insurance for the elderly.UnitedHealth is no stranger to acquisitions, having bought PacifiCare for $9.2bn in 2005 and Sierra Health Services for $2.6bn in 2007.According to S&P Capital IQ data, UnitedHealth’s $4.9bn investment in Amil is the largest US acquisition in Brazil to date.UnitedHealth said its net earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were expected to be a least $1.45 per share as medical enrolment exceeded 650,000 people in the quarter.Shares of UnitedHealth rose 0.81 per cent to $57.59 in early trading on Monday.
57;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-10-05T17:33:20Z;UnitedHealth in talks to buy Brazil’s Amil;;UnitedHealth Group, the biggest US health insurer by revenues, is in talks to buy all or part of Amil Participacoes, a Brazilian insurance group and hospital operator, said people familiar with the matter.A deal for Amil, which has a market capitalisation of about $4.5bn, would be the latest big move by a US group in the wake of the Supreme Court’s upholding of the Affordable Care Act, which is reshaping medical services in the world’s largest economy. In August, Aetna bought Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn, uniting two big insurers.A deal with Amil would give United­Health access to one of the world’s most populous countries and fastest-growing economies at a time when the US health insurance market is facing sweeping changes.US health insurers have been looking for international opportunities as the industry faces greater regulation at home. As part of the Obama administration’s healthcare reform law, insurers will be required to take on customers with pre-existing medical conditions and use most of their revenue to pay for medical care.UnitedHealth already has some operating experience overseas, running joint ventures with healthcare groups in Portugal and Abu Dhabi. It also manages benefits for more than 3,000 insurers, hospitals and employers in India and offers services to doctors in the UK.UnitedHealth declined to comment and Amil did not immediately return a request for comment.Amil is one of Brazil’s biggest providers of health plans to business and individuals, with 5.8m customers at the end of last year across the country.The company, which also has its own network of hospitals, is expected to generate sales of $10.24bn this year, according to Reuters data, up slightly from $9.81bn in 2011. The company’s shares were up 2.2 per cent at R$25.53 per share.The company has benefited from rapid growth in Brazil’s middle class and formal employment but with the economy slowing, growth is expected to be weaker this year in the healthcare industry.UnitedHealth, with a market value of $59bn, has grown through acquisitions before. In 2005 it took over PacifiCare for $9.2bn, and two years later it bought Sierra Health Services for $2.6bn.UnitedHealth shares were down 2 per cent in midday trading on Friday.Last year Cigna, another US health insurer that has been focused on international growth, struck a deal with Gama Saúde, a Brazilian network of hospitals and doctors, to broaden its expatriate benefits offerings to employees working in Latin America.Last month UnitedHealth replaced Kraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, becoming the first health insurer in the index of 30 major stocks.
58;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-09-14T20:38:06Z;Fed action lifts US equities;;Financial sector stocks leapt to their highest levels in a year-and-a-half during a week that saw equity investors delighted by the Federal Reserve’s decision to bolster the US economy with fresh stimulus measures.The S&P 500 financials index climbed 3.8 per cent over the week after the US central bank said it would expand its bond-buying operations.Bank stocks were among the most receptive to the Fed decision, which came on Thursday, to buy an additional $40bn worth of mortgage-backed securities a month.Analysts said the impact of the move would be to lower mortgage rates, provide a boost to the recovering housing market and in turn help bank revenues and credit quality.Shares in Bank of America gained 8.5 per cent to $9.55 as it ranked among the week’s top performing bank stocks. Citigroup climbed 8.5 per cent to $34.79 and JPMorgan Chase rose 5.8 per cent to $41.57.Bank of America Merrill Lynch researchers said the Fed’s announcement went beyond the dovish expectations of most investors.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 index reached its highest level in nearly five years. The index was 1.9 per cent higher to 1,465.77 for the week, and has gained 16.6 per cent since the start of the year.Much of that advance has come in recent weeks – with the index up 4.2 per cent since the start of September – on the back of monetary action from both the European Central Bank last week and the Federal Reserve this week.Analysts at Barclays said: “With the global growth party threatening to dissolve prematurely, policymakers have refilled the punchbowl and investors are boogying once more.”But others cautioned that the Fed’s action may have only a temporary influence on the overall health of stocks.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “It is not so much that the Fed announcement will hurt the economy in the future as it is the Fed missed a great opportunity to treat what really needs some medicine – economic confidence.”He added: “Rather than bring another shock and awe to a recovery no longer in crisis, the Fed would have been more helpful by simply looking and sounding confident in the future and standing down.”The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.5 per cent over the week to 3,183.95.Shares in Apple touched a record high as the iPhone and iPad maker continued to add to its gains for the year after unveiling the latest versions of some of its popular consumer gadgets.Analysts said that although the additions and changes to its new iPhone5 did not have the usual ‘surprise’ factor, the company should expand its market share of the smartphone business and see large volumes of orders.Apple was 1.6 per cent higher at $691.28, just outpacing the broader S&P 500 information technology sector for the week.Shares in Facebook, the social networking company, rose 15.9 per cent to $22. The shares recorded their best week as a public company, but remain 42.4 per cent below their debut price of $38.Materials stocks saw strong gains as investors piled into riskier, more cyclical sectors after the Fed’s announcement. The S&P 500 materials index rose 3.8 per cent.Among the top performers in the sector, Alpha Natural Resources climbed 23.9 per cent to $8.55. Close behind was Cliffs Natural Resources, which rose 14.1 per cent to $45.55.The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a weekly rise of 2.2 per cent to 13,593.37. Shares in UnitedHealth Group fell 1.4 per cent to $54.25. The healthcare provider is set to replace Kraft, the food company, in the Dow Jones Industrial Average later this month.Kraft, which plans to split its company in two, fell 0.2 per cent to $39.93.Ahead of its quarterly earnings report next week, shares in Nike slid 2.7 per cent to $96.64. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said that the company’s revenues in the quarter most likely benefited from the London Olympics and the European football championships. But they warned that the sportswear group might see some overhang due to a slowdown in China and Europe.The broader equity gains this week took place despite disappointing data releases. An employment report released midweek showed that new claims for unemployment benefits came in higher than expected.Meanwhile, economic data released on Friday showed that industrial production in the US contracted by 1.2 per cent in August, the most since March 2009. Separately, consumer inflation data showed that household prices increased by the most in three years last month.
59;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-07-09T21:55:54Z;Bid news boosts US healthcare groups;;Shares in Amerigroup Corporation surged after WellPoint confirmed that it was buying the US health insurer for $4.9bn.WellPoint will pay $92 a share for Amerigroup, which jumped 38 per cent to $88.79 on Monday after it closed at $64.34 on Friday, down 2.4 per cent last week.The deal was completed after the Supreme Court upheld the Obama administration’s healthcare law in June.The acquisition was expected to expand WellPoint’s presence for its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Shares in WellPoint reversed last Friday’s loss and rose 3.4 per cent to $61.95.“WellPoint is paying a very full price in this deal, giving Amerigroup credit for much of its anticipated growth over the next few years,” said Carl McDonald, analyst at Citigroup.Philip Seligman, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, also said WellPoint would benefit from the acquisition.“We believe the deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, would position WellPoint as the largest Medicaid managed care insurer,” he said.“We particularly think the combination would strengthen WellPoint’s ability to serve the Medicare and Medicaid population, enabling it to win what we view as potentially lucrative contracts as states seek to shift these high-cost populations to managed healthcare [platforms].”The merger will bring about 4.5m clients across 19 states for WellPoint, according to a JPMorgan report.Other healthcare stocks moved up. United Healthcare Corp gained 0.5 per cent to $56.09 and Aetna increased 1.1 per cent to $38.04.Among the 10 S&P 500 sectors, only the healthcare and telecom indices traded in positive territory, rising 0.6 and 0.4 per cent, respectively.US equities pointed lower as the impact of the slowing global economy on corporate earnings caught the attention of investors.The S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent lower to 1,352.48. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 12,736.29. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index went down 0.2 per cent to 2,931.77.Aluminium manufacturer Alcoa closed 0.4 per cent higher to $8.76 before the company posted second-quarter earnings that just beat analysts’ estimates. The stock was up a further 0.8 per cent in after-hours trading. Other materials stocks remained weak. DuPont, the US chemical company, fell 2.9 per cent to $47.47. Dow Chemical dropped 1 per cent to $31.19.Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said: “Wall Street analysts project a 1 per cent decline in the second quarter S&P 500 operating earnings. On the surface, one could argue that this is just another example of a slowdown in global economic growth. On the other hand, one could say ‘new quarter, old trick’, meaning that this is merely a continuation of management’s efforts to guide earnings per share growth estimates to unrealistically low levels.”Steven Wieting, analyst at Citigroup, was more optimistic. “In the forthcoming second-quarter results, we do not expect a repeat of the first quarter’s much stronger than expected earnings per share beats for the quarter,” he said. “However, earnings per share estimates for the second quarter appear to have been cut sufficiently to generate moderate positive surprises.”The energy sector, which was the forerunner among the 10 sectors at some points last week, was one of the worst performers. The index lost 0.6 per cent.ExxonMobil decreased 1.4 per cent to $83.65. Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal supplier, dropped 7.5 per cent to $8.02 and Valero Energy moved down 3.1 per cent to $23.81.Boeing added 0.5 per cent to $74.03. The world’s second-largest aircraft maker by revenues said that it had secured a $7.2bn order from Air Lease Corp for 75 aircraft. Air Lease edged down 0.4 per cent to $19.14.PepsiCo lost 0.3 per cent to $69.99 after the company said it would form a joint venture with the Germany-based Theo Muller Group to tap the US yoghurt market.Shares in MasterCard fell 2.4 per cent to $431.27. Visa declined 1.3 per cent to $123.65. UBS cut the ratings of both stocks to “sell”, saying that the companies’ growth was turning slow.Google dropped fractionally to $586.01. Brian Nowak, analyst at Nomura, said that “Google sentiment remains cautious”, as the stock has been a laggard in 2012 and has underperformed the S&P 500.But Apple increased 1.3 per cent to $613.89. Facebook gained 1.4 per cent to $32.17.
60;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-06-28T21:36:33Z;US healthcare ruling lifts hospital owners;;Leading healthcare stocks pared most of their losses after the Supreme Court upheld Barack Obama’s landmark healthcare law as constitutional.The S&P healthcare sector, which has outperformed the broader index this year, was 0.3 per cent lower as investors considered the implication of the ruling on corporate profits.However, the court ruling benefited hospitals as well as insurers that administer Medicaid for the states. The overall sector was dragged down by commercial healthcare insurance providers, which were sold off.Steven Silver, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the ruling was positive for private sector hospital groups.“We see the promise of more than 30m new patients gaining insurance in 2014 remaining intact, boosting hospital earnings through reduction of uncompensated care expense,” he said.Hospital owners were the biggest winners on Thursday. HCA Holdings rose 10.7 per cent to $29.44 while Community Health Systems rallied 9 per cent to $27.42.Molina Healthcare and WellCare Health, insurance companies that administer Medicaid and Medicare programmes, also benefited after the court decision. Molina rose 8.6 per cent to $22.90, while WellCare rallied 8.9 per cent to $54.07.Charles Boorady, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “While all eyes are focused on this event [in the] near term, after the ruling, we expect fundamentals, including medical cost trends, 2012 elections and debt ceiling negotiations to dictate direction for the group.“In the long term, we believe funds will flow into the healthcare sector as the major uncertainty is now lifted.”Big health insurance companies suffered sharp losses immediately after the court ruling, but some managed to recoup those losses. Aetna fell 2.7 per cent to $39.85 and Cigna lost 2.7 per cent to $44.18, while the biggest loser was WellPoint, falling 5.2 per cent to $65.90.United Health Group as well as Humana recouped losses to trade higher. United Health rose 0.5 per cent to $59.60 and Humana traded virtually unchanged by the close at $79.56.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “We expect selling pressure on managed care given our belief that investors would have seen an overturn of reform as a better outcome for the sector. However, we think any selling pressure will be modest since this ruling is the outcome most investors had anticipated before the oral arguments in late March.”US equities were dragged down by financials and technology, with economic data also weighing on sentiment. Weekly jobless figures showed that the US labour market is still struggling and estimates of gross domestic product growth for the first quarter of 2012 were left unchanged at a 1.9 per cent annualised rate, confirming a slowing economy.After a late rally on Wall Street the S&P 500 index pared most of the losses to close 0.2 per cent lower at 1,329.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also recouped most of the losses to end 0.2 per cent lower at 12,601.58. However, the Nasdaq Composite index finished down 0.9 per cent at 2,849.49.The S&P financials sector, which fell as much as 1.5 per cent earlier in the session, stood 0.3 per cent lower at the close. Banking stocks initially sold off after reports that JPMorgan Chase’s losses from derivatives trading may be as high as $9bn while investors considered broader implications for major banks in light of a $450m fine imposed on Barclays after regulators found the UK bank attempted to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. JPMorgan shares fell 2.3 per cent to $35.87.Citigroup also suffered, falling 2.7 per cent to $26.38 after George Osborne, UK chancellor, said the bank was being probed by the Financial Services Authority along with HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS.Goldman Sachs recouped all of its earlier losses to close 0.2 higher at $92.49.News Corp fell after the media group confirmed plans to split the company into two, separating its entertainment and publishing assets. The company’s shares were 1.4 per cent lower at $21.99.Among technology stocks, Cisco Systems took a hit, falling 1.5 per cent to $16.48 after analysts at Lazard said in a note that the company may be seeing weaker-than-expected demand trends.Microsoft was another laggard, falling 0.9 per cent to $29.91, while Apple fell 1 per cent to $569.05.Nike shares fell 10 per cent in after-market trade as the sporting-goods company’s fourth-quarter earnings trailed analysts’ estimates as increased costs narrowed profit margins.Research In Motion US-traded shares were halted ahead of earnings results at $9.20, as the BlackBerry maker reported a 99 cents per share loss, which was far more than analysts expected. The smartphone maker also disappointed investors by pushing back the expected launch of BlackBerry 10 to early next year. The shares dropped 16 per cent to $7.65 in after-market trading.Accenture‘s share jumped 3.4 per cent to 58.55 after earnings beat analysts' expectations.Ford Motor, the second-largest US carmaker, fell 3.7 per cent to $9.72 in after-market trade after the company said its pre-tax operating profit would be “substantially lower” in the second quarter. The company said it expected good results from its North American operations, but cited increasing losses in Europe, South America and Asia.
61;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-06-26T19:07:53Z;US healthcare: mixed diagnosis;Behind the Supreme Court hullabaloo are stark realities;"Only one industry can look forward to the US Supreme Court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act, expected on Thursday, with unambiguous delight. Whatever the ruling, commentators such as analysts, manufacturers of outrage and partisan triumphalists will be in great demand. Healthcare companies have more at risk.Take hospitals. The seven biggest publicly traded hospital companies by market capitalisation generated $77bn in revenues in the past fiscal year. About $7.4bn of that was written off as bad debt. To put that into context, the companies reported about $5.5bn in pre-tax income. They would benefit significantly from a law that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would more than halve the numbers of the uninsured to about 26m by 2016. Credit Suisse estimates that complete implementation of the law could raise earnings per share at these companies by a quarter, compared with its full repeal.The other industry with most at stake – managed care – is in an even trickier spot. The individual mandate clause, which penalises those who do not buy insurance, would increase the customer base for companies such as UnitedHealth and WellPoint, but the law also includes profit ceilings, constrains pricing and underwriting, and creates competition-increasing insurance exchanges. Bernstein Research estimates that total repeal could have a net 15 per cent positive impact on earnings; but a repeal of just the individual mandate while retaining the rest would push earnings in the other direction.The hard question for investors is what, after months of chatter, has already been priced into the shares.

62;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Insurers to keep key ObamaCare provisions;;The US’s leading health insurers are likely to maintain key parts of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law even if the Supreme Court strikes down the legislation later this month, analysts say, following decisions by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana to institutionalise some of the provisions already in place.The court is expected to rule this month on whether to uphold the controversial law, derided by Republicans as “ObamaCare” but officially known as the Affordable Care Act, or to overturn it in part or in full.But rather than waiting for the decision, UnitedHealthcare, the largest American healthcare insurer with 38m members, said on Monday that it would continue some key benefits regardless of how the court rules.These include covering preventive healthcare services, such as immunisations and screening for high-blood pressure and diabetes, with no out-of-pocket charges, and allow dependants to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan until the age of 26.Other provisions that will be maintained include a ban on lifetime dollar maximums on most benefits and a more streamlined process to appeal claims decisions.“The protections we are voluntarily extending are good for people’s health, promote broader access to quality care and contribute to helping control rising healthcare costs,” said Stephen Hemsley, president and chief executive.Aetna, another big US insurer, quickly followed suit, saying that a number of provisions in the health reform law “have been woven into the fabric of our healthcare system, bring value to customers and consumers and should be maintained”.“We intend to keep provisions such as coverage for dependants to age 26, 100 per cent coverage for certain preventive care and access to appeals through independent third parties in our benefit plans, regardless of how the Supreme Court rules,” said Matthew Wiggin, an Aetna spokesman.Humana also tried to get ahead of the decision with its own promise to keep popular parts of the law.“Regardless of how the US Supreme Court rules on the federal healthcare reform law, Humana is committed to keeping in place important patient protections contained in the law,” the company said.Analysts said the moves made sense.“This is a case where the Affordable Care Act has dragged the horse to water and the horse has decided to drink,” said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan health policy group.“I think some others are likely to follow suit because it probably adds to their competitive advantage in the market place, and these provisions are relatively inexpensive and very popular,” he said.Edward Miller, dean of the Johns Hopkins University school of medicine, agreed that “the train has already left the station”.“So many people have moved past this [question of whether the healthcare law should stand] already and we’ve started to see insurance companies bundling payments and employers looking at new innovations,” Dr Miller said.Other leading insurers including WellPoint and Blue Cross Blue Shield did not comment on Monday.Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research, said that UnitedHealthcare was showing leadership and also currying favour with the US government and its customers by keeping the provisions. She suggested that the costs of rolling back features that have been put in place might be higher than retaining them.Mr Obama’s signature healthcare law, passed by Congress with the narrowest of margins two years ago, has been controversial, with Republicans criticising it as an over-reach of government power.The 2010 law introduced the “individual mandate,” a requirement for everyone but the very poor or those with religious objections to buy some kind of health insurance. It also banned insurers from declining coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.The Supreme Court could repeal the whole law or just part of it – most likely the mandate – or let the entire act stand.The move by UnitedHealthcare presupposes the court overturning the entire law.However, insurers are bracing for the possibility that the mandate is struck down but the rest of the law is upheld, forcing them to offer coverage to sick people without the additional healthy customers to help defray the costs.“If that happens, the bill in the long term is not workable,” Mike McCallister, chief executive of Humana, told the FT last week. “Without the mandate, guaranteed issuance falls apart. You have to eliminate gaming of the system where people buy coverage after they get sick.”UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana signalled they would stop offering coverage to children under the age of 20 with pre-existing medical conditions, with the former explaining that “one company acting alone” cannot shoulder this burden.Nor did they address another key component of the law that is already in effect: the requirement that health insurers spend at least 80 per cent of premium dollars on health-related costs, not on administration.Mr Altman of Kaiser said that the companies could hardly be blamed for this. “I don't expect them to voluntarily do things which are painful for them or would hurt their bottom line without regulatory relief,” he said.
63;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-04-19T04:37:28Z;Pressure builds on Goldman director;;A New York institutional investor is urging shareholders of Goldman Sachs to vote against the re-election of James Johnson, the company’s longest-serving director.Ruane, Cunniff and Goldfarb, a fund manager with about $15bn under management, released a letter on Wednesday urging other Goldman investors to vote against Mr Johnson, citing among its reasons his role in the 1990s as chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae.The letter focuses renewed attention on corporate governance at Goldman, most recently under public scrutiny after a former mid-level executive complained about the company mistreating clients, while a union pension fund has sought the split of the roles of chairman and chief executive held by Lloyd Blankfein.Mr Johnson has “deep insight into governmental affairs and the regulatory process”, Goldman said in its latest proxy filing. In 2008, the former Fannie Mae chairman led Barack Obama’s search for a vice-presidential nominee before resigning during the presidential election campaign.Mr Johnson chairs the Goldman compensation committee and has served on the investment bank’s board since 1999. The company paid Mr Johnson about $523,000 last year.A Goldman spokesman said: “The board has recommended shareholders re-elect Mr Johnson. He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to do so.”Ruane, Cunniff manages the $5.7bn Sequoia Fund. As of December 31, it held more than 1.4m shares in Goldman through the Sequoia Fund and on behalf of its other clients, according to David Poppe, the firm’s president and co-manager of the fund.The investment firm alleges that at Fannie Mae Mr Johnson failed to protect taxpayers who at the time implicitly backed the now state-controlled mortgage group, led a company that suffered poor internal controls and created a management culture that saw numerous executives depart.“As a comment on the management culture [Mr] Johnson created, we can’t think of a stronger indictment than this,” Ruane, Cunniff said.Ruane, Cunniff also pointed to Mr Johnson’s service as a director on the boards of UnitedHealth and KB Home. At UnitedHealth, former chief executive William McGuire settled a case which claimed wrongdoing over the backdating of stock options.KB Home also faced claims over the backdating of stock options issued to executives, which required it to restate several years of earnings. Mr Johnson served as chair of the company’s compensation committee for some of that time.Ruane, Cunniff said: “Mr Johnson’s history should disqualify him from service on the board of any public company.”
64;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Best Buy pushes ahead with inquiry;;Best Buy‘s board has vowed to push ahead with an investigation into the “personal conduct” of Brian Dunn, its former chief executive, and said “appropriate action will be taken if warranted”.Mr Dunn resigned suddenly on Tuesday after the board of the US’s biggest electronics retailer by sales launched an investigation into his personal conduct that it said was “unrelated to the company’s operations or financial controls”.A spokesman for the retailer’s board on Thursday said: “As we have said, the investigation is ongoing … The board’s findings will be made public and appropriate action will be taken if warranted.”The investigation is expected to be completed within a few weeks. The board has hired an outside law firm, Wilmer Hale, to assist it, according to a person familiar with the matter.The board spokesman declined to comment on the details of the investigation. Mr Dunn could not be reached for comment.The board also said it expected its search for a new chief executive to take six to nine months.Best Buy has been forced to find a new leader less than two weeks after Mr Dunn announced the latest part of his plan to “transform” the retailer and tackle its loss of market share to online rivals led by Amazon. It included 50 store closures and $800m in cost cuts.Best Buy remains committed to implementing the plans Mr Dunn unveiled, according to Kate McShane, a Citigroup analyst who met company managers to tour stores the day after his resignation.The company has named Mike Mikan, a Best Buy director and former executive vice-president of UnitedHealth, as its interim chief executive.In its statement on Tuesday the board said: “Certain issues were brought to the board’s attention regarding Mr Dunn’s personal conduct, unrelated to the company’s operations or financial controls, and an audit committee investigation was initiated. Prior to the completion of the investigation, Mr Dunn chose to resign.”Best Buy shares closed up 1.3 per cent at $22.24 on Thursday but remained 1.8 per cent below where they stood before news of Mr Dunn’s resignation. Best Buy shares have fallen more than 50 per cent in the past two years.Mr Dunn joined Best Buy as a store assistant 28 years ago and had begun reforms to tackle its faltering sales and profit growth, but struggled to convince investors over the long-term outlook for the company.His plans included a better Best Buy online store and smaller, sleeker outlets focused on mobile devices and an engaging customer experienceDuring Mr Dunn’s time, Best Buy became a prime victim of “showrooming” shoppers who use bricks-and-mortar stores to research products then buy them online. His record was tarnished by operational problems, including gloomy stores and a failure to meet some orders placed on its website last Christmas.
65;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-04-11T00:17:16Z;Best Buy chief quits amid board inquiry;;Best Buy’s chief executive has resigned suddenly after the company’s board launched an investigation into his “personal conduct”, ending a tenure in which investor confidence in the US electronics retailer’s ability to compete against online rivals plummeted.A spokeswoman for the board said: “Certain issues were brought to the board’s attention regarding Mr Dunn’s personal conduct, unrelated to the company’s operations or financial controls, and an audit committee investigation was initiated. Prior to the completion of the investigation, Mr Dunn chose to resign.”Mr Dunn could not be reached for comment. He joined Best Buy as a store assistant 28 years ago and had begun reforms to tackle its faltering sales and profit growth but still struggled to convince investors over the long-term outlook for the company, despite its $51bn revenues last year.Best Buy did not disclose the inquiry in its initial announcement of his resignation on Tuesday, when it said: “There was mutual agreement that it was time for new leadership to address the challenges that face the company.”The company said it was looking for a successor and named Mike Mikan, a Best Buy director and former executive vice-president of UnitedHealth, as interim chief executive.During Mr Dunn’s time, Best Buy became a prime victim of “showrooming” shoppers who use bricks-and-mortar stores to research products then buy them online. His record was tarnished by operational problems, including gloomy stores and a failure to meet some orders on its website last Christmas.Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors said of Mr Dunn: “He grew up in the store. His speciality is the stores. Was he the right guy for the chief executive? In this environment he was probably not the ideal candidate.”Following Wall Street criticism of its international expansion, Mr Dunn last year pulled the plug on Best Buy’s big-box store partnership with Carphone Warehouse in the UK and closed nine own-branded stores in China.Last month, as he reported a 2.2 per cent fall in holiday season sales, Mr Dunn said: “I’m not satisfied with the pace or degree of improvement in our performance and transformation.”He unveiled plans to close 50 US big box stores and cut 400 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $800m while also broadening an initiative to sell more online while making its stores smaller and more focused on mobile communications and devices.But Best Buy shares slid 2.2 per cent in the seven trading sessions between then and his resignation. The company’s shares initially rose as much as 3.8 per cent on news of Mr Dunn’s resignation, but then fell sharply and closed down 5.9 per cent at $21.32.Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, said: “We doubt that any one man or woman is at fault or can single-handedly turn [it] around. Best Buy …is yoked to a business model whose time may have come and gone.”She added, however, that it was still profitable and had a strong balance sheet, cash flow and brand.Mr Dunn was promoted to chief executive soon after the liquidation of Circuit City, which left Best Buy as the US’s only national electronics chain. But rather than winning market share from it, Best Buy lost business to increasingly competitive online retailers with better prices and a widening selection.
66;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-03-29T22:54:35Z;Obamacare: an unhealthy focus;Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate;If Congress required every American to own a garden gnome, you would not expect the kitsch industry to rally if the Supreme Court expressed hostility to that law. But on Thursday, following arguments in which judges hit defenders of the Affordable Care Act with pointed questions, the biggest US health insurers got a boost: UnitedHealth, Aetna, Cigna, and Humana were all up between 3 per cent and 6 per cent.That is because from the point of the insurers, the law is double-edged. The requirement that everyone buys insurance (the so-called individual mandate) is accompanied by consumer-protection rules, most notably that insurers neither reject customers, nor charge them differently, depending on their health – only according to age, family size, location and tobacco use. The market was celebrating the judges’ apparent disinclination to toss the individual mandate but not the rules. That would have killed the potential for new customers while retaining a threat to margins.But take a step back. According to the Census Bureau, 56 per cent of non-elderly Americans – those not covered by Medicare – have employer-provided insurance. They are already protected by rules like the ones the Act would apply to everyone. Another 19 per cent have Medicaid (government insurance for the poor) or other government insurance. It is only the remaining quarter of the population, individual buyers of insurance and the uninsured, who are the primary targets of the law. And many of those would be covered by the law’s expansion of Medicaid, not by private plans. The reality is that insurance profits come mostly from employer-provided insurance (and managing government plans), and this will continue regardless.Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
67;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2012-03-18T22:22:11Z;NHS ‘host’ role raises legal concerns;;The use of taxpayers’ money to establish healthcare consultancies that the government plans to turn into private businesses risks falling foul of EU competition laws, legal advisers have warned.Concern focuses on the Department of Health’s creation of about 30 “commissioning support service” organisations, which it says will by 2016 be “outsourced” as independent organisations, competing with companies such as United Health, Bupa, Aetna and Capita.The new organisations are being honed from the staff of the 151 NHS primary care trusts, which are scheduled for abolition next year under the health and social care bill, expected to be passed this week. The idea is for them to sell their expertise to groups of GPs, which the bill establishes in their place to manage the spending of up to £65bn of NHS care in England.In a document sent to senior NHS managers late last year the health department said it planned to “host” the support organisations under its new commissioning board for two to three years. Their “business readiness” would be developed in preparation for “successful outsourcing” to become “freestanding” organisations competing in the marketplace.The move has angered private healthcare consultancies, which say it amounts to the health department “favouring its own” with up to £1.3bn a year of public sector contracts and the opportunity to develop skills and commercial relationships while sheltered from competition.Roger Hymas, a healthcare commissioning consultant whose management consultancy works with the NHS, said: “There is a carve-up going on.”Raising the spectre of Qinetiq, the controversially privatised defence industry group, Mr Hymas added: “The government is going to award these contracts to government employees, who will then go off and become a Qinetiq and privatise themselves.”Peter Edwards, senior partner at Capsticks, a healthcare law firm, said the move could fall foul of EU state aid rules that forbid government subsidies for private businesses.Plans for the biggest structural upheaval in health provision for decades are coming under intense criticism“State aid could come into play if NHS commissioning support services are given a three-year period to become business-ready, during which time they are funded by public contracts that have not been subject to competition and receive other state-funded support,” Mr Edwards said.Ross Clark, partner at healthcare legal specialists Hempsons, said a more significant concern was the potential breach of EU procurement laws if the NHS commissioning board did not launch a transparent and open tender process for the commissioning of support services.Although the government’s move has angered the private sector, a number of companies have told the Financial Times they consider themselves well placed to buy up the organisations on or before the 2016 date for privatisation, or to enter joint ventures.Private providers say they can make substantial profits by developing systems and then “white labelling” them for sale to multiple clients. Mr Hymas said the market was also of interest to some because it offered “a huge continuous cash flow [with] £5 or £25 a [patient] head a year for ever. There is no reason why you couldn’t go and securitise that,” he said.
68;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Results mixed for US healthcare companies;Companies beginning to see uptick in services;Shares of WellPoint fell by nearly 5 per cent after the US health insurer reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and a 2012 outlook that was weaker than analysts expected.The California-based insurer, which is the second-largest in the US by market capitalisation, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net income fell by 39 per cent from a year ago to $335.3m, or 96 cents a share, while operating revenue rose 5.5 per cent to $15.1bn.The company, which has been looking to gain more Medicare Advantage customers to capitalise on the ageing US population, was hit by surprisingly high medical costs of customers in its home state. Wellpoint’s consumer business lost $4.6m during the final three months of last year.“Clearly, our consumer segment underperformed, and it was almost entirely due to the senior business,” Angela Braly, Wellpoint’s chief executive, told analysts.Health insurers, which faced harsh criticism during the debate over US healthcare reform legislation, have performed well in the last year as patients tried to avoid medical procedures amid a weak economy.However, as the US economy has shown signs of life recently, healthcare companies are starting to see an increase in the use of medical services.On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson said that its medical device business was approaching a “trough”, as patients were choosing to move forward with knee and hip replacements that they had delayed.Last week, United Health, the largest US insurer, offered a cautious outlook for 2012, noting that it expected medical claims costs to rise as usage rates increase.WellPoint said it expects to earn net income of $7.60 a share this year.“The company’s track record of execution over the last several years has been spotty, so delivering strong 2012 performance is important to see performance upside,” said Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research.Separately on Wednesday, Abbott, the US drug maker, reported a strong fourth quarter, with net earnings rising by 12.3 per cent to $1.6bn, or $1.02 a share. But the company’s share price slipped 1.34 per cent as its revenues and 2012 outlook were softer than Wall Street analysts projected.Scott Stoffel, an Abbott spokesman, said that the company cut 700 jobs and would eliminate several hundred more this year. Most of the jobs are in manufacturing, he said, and some are related to the expiration of Abbott’s contract to supply stents to Boston Scientific.The stronger US dollar meant that foreign exchange provided less of a benefit to Abbott than it previously thought. The US pharmaceutical sector is bracing for the currency shift to become a headwind this year.Abbott said that its plan to split the company into separate research-based pharmaceuticals and diversified medical products businesses is on track to be completed by the end of 2012.
69;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-12-22T20:19:19Z;Thomson Reuters suspends healthcare arm sale;;Thomson Reuters has suspended the auction of its healthcare business, capping a tumultuous year for the information company. The end of the six-month process came three weeks after the unexpected news that Tom Glocer would hand over as chief executive to Jim Smith on January 1.The Canadian-controlled company said global economic conditions had become “more challenging” since it appointed Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co in June to sell the business, and were “not conducive to concluding a transaction that reflects the fair value of the healthcare business at this time”.The deal, which analysts had expected could yield $1bn or more, is the latest to fall foul of volatile markets. Data from Thomson Reuters showed this week that Europe’s debt crisis had contributed to a 32 per cent drop in global dealmaking volumes between the third and fourth quarters of this year.Thomson Reuters made clear that it still intended to sell the business at a later date, saying that it would report its results under the non-core “other businesses” line in its financial statements. However, it added that it would continue to invest in its healthcare assets “until improved market conditions allow the company to complete a divestiture at attractive terms”.The business “continues to perform well with strong revenue growth and expanding margins”, the group said in a regulatory filing.Mr Smith, who had run the professional information division under which the healthcare business sat before becoming chief operating officer this year, had hoped to use the sale proceeds to reinvest in faster-growing international markets such as Latin America and Asia.Analysts had estimated that a sale might fetch $850m to $1.2bn for a business with revenues of $450m and operating margins of about 19 per cent. They had expected interest from groups including Aetna, Reed Elsevier, TPG and United Healthcare, but had cautioned that no single buyer looked likely to show interest in all of its diverse assets.Shares in Thomson Reuters were up 1 per cent in early afternoon trading at $26.65, after touching a 52-week low. Dissatisfaction with the shares’ performance within the Thomson family, which controls about 55 per cent of the company, is said to have been a factor in Mr Glocer’s early departure.Mr Smith faces the challenge of reviving growth in Thomson Reuters’ markets division, the product of the 2008 Reuters acquisition, which has lost ground to Bloomberg and struggled with the introduction of a central new product, Eikon.The group has yet to disclose the scale of the “one-time charges” it expects to report from the three restructuring announcements made since the summer, which led to the exit of several senior executives in Thomson Reuters Markets and the merging of the markets and professional divisions.
70;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-08-01T21:01:42Z;Wall Street erases gains after weak data;;US stocks closed slightly lower after a turbulent session that saw the session open with shares sharply higher on the US debt agreement and then tumble after weak manufacturing figures damped sentiment.Leading defence companies came under pressure on worries that fiscal retrenchment in the wake of the debt deal will hit the Pentagon’s defence budget.Lockheed Martinlost 1.7 per cent to $74.46, Boeingfell 2 per cent to $70.33 and Northrop Grummanwas down 1.5 per cent to $59.60.The broader aerospace and defence sector, which is still undervalued according to Citigroup analysts, was lower.About $350bn of cuts over 10 years are expected in the Pentagon’s defence budget. Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
71;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;US health insurers boosted by weak economy;;Weakness in the US economy is helping to pad the profits of health insurers, allaying investor concerns that last year’s sweeping healthcare legislation would stifle their businesses.Aetna and WellPoint, two of the biggest insurers, raised their earnings outlooks on Tuesday as they reported better than expected second-quarter profits. Both pointed to fewer patients utilising healthcare services, which insurers end up making payments for, because they are putting off expensive procedures.Those results confirmed the strong performance in the sector that was foreshadowed last week when UnitedHealth, the largest insurer by market value, lifted its outlook, thanks to a pick-up in enrolment in its plans and customers avoiding visits to the doctor’s office.“Utilisation has remained lower than we anticipated,” said Angela Braly, WellPoint’s chief executive.Net income at WellPoint increased 2.9 per cent to $701.6m, or $1.89 a share, from the same period a year ago, and total revenues rose 4.6 per cent to $15.1bn.However, WellPoint’s shares fell nearly 4 per cent in midday trading as the company had unexpectedly high payouts to senior citizens through its Medicare plans. The company, which said it is “refining” its strategy, has been looking to grow its presence among ageing “baby boomers,” but took on too many sick customers during the quarter.Such issues were avoided by Aetna, which lifted second quarter profits 9.3 per cent to $536.7m, or $1.39 a share. Mark Bertolini, the company’s chief executive, also pointed to lower than expected medical utilisation rates as a key driver of its profits, but warned that these may start to pick up again later in the year or next year as the economy improves.“Patients are putting off elective procedures like hips and knees,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager and healthcare analyst at Miller Tabak. “Healthcare has become more economically sensitive as co-pays and deductibles and the availability of insurance have changed. Should the economy improve, you will see a bump up.”The diverging fortunes of insurers and other healthcare providers was highlighted earlier this week by the poor performance of HCA, one of the biggest US hospital chains.“While the company had favourable admissions growth during the quarter, we experienced a shift in service mix from more complex surgical cases to less acute medical cases,” said Richard Bracken, HCA’s chief executive. “This resulted in lower than anticipated revenue growth and earnings.”
72;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Express Scripts / Medco;The wave of blockbuster drugs losing patent protection peaks this year;Express Scripts’ $29bn offer for Medco will forge a grand alliance in the war against US medical costs. Either that, or it is just a defensive merger between the leaders of an industry where profit growth is under pressure.The grand interpretation (favoured by the companies’ leaders) has a certain logic. One of the primary functions of pharmacy benefit managers is negotiating drug prices with manufacturers and retailers. Greater scale will help there.The more mundane interpretation hinges on the companies’ recent performance, and changes to the industry landscape. PBMs make money by managing more prescriptions and taking more profit on each one. Volumes were down slightly at Express, and barely up at Medco, in the first half of this year. Growing volumes organically has been a challenge for some time. In dollar terms, the US prescription drug market grew just 2 per cent in 2010, according to IMS Health. On profit per prescription, which runs at about $3, Express saw a 12 per cent rise in the first half. Medco was barely up.Express’ continued success expanding profits may stem from harvesting of efficiencies from its last big acquisition two years ago. Consolidation of smaller competitors has been a profit driver for both companies. But there are very few independent PBMs of any size left to buy (other than Medco). News that the insurer UnitedHealth will not renew its contract with Medco, and is likely to manage its clients’ pharmacy benefits in-house, highlights another threat to future expansion. And a crucial source of PBM profitability – switching consumers from branded to generic drugs – is set to diminish soon. The wave of blockbuster drugs losing patent protection peaks this year and next. The mundane interpretation has a lot going for it.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-07-21T17:27:23Z;Express Scripts to buy rival for $29bn;;Express Scripts has agreed to buy Medco Health Solutions in a $29.1bn deal that will create the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US, fuelling the debate around competition and costs in the country’s healthcare industry.Medco stockholders will receive $28.80 in cash and 0.81 of an Express Scripts share for each Medco share, the companies said on Thursday. The $71.36-a-share offer represents a 28 per cent premium to Medco’s Wednesday closing price.The combination is expected to face rigorous antitrust scrutiny because it brings two of the industry’s “Big Three” together. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, process and pay prescription drug claims for health insurers and employer programmes.Medco shares were up only 12 per cent in morning trading at $62.52, a sizeable discount to the offer price.George Paz, chief executive of Express Scripts, said on a call with investors: “We are going to work very hard to show the government the value this brings to patients and members as we drive those costs out of the [healthcare] system,” adding that companies believed the deal had a “very good chance” of getting approved by the Federal Trade Commission.People familiar with the matter suggested that while the national market was consolidated, large PBMs faced strong competition from a range of smaller operators at the state and regional level.Medco said separately on Tuesday that it will lose its pharmacy benefit agreement with insurer United Healthcare from 2013. With United expected to take its PBM business in-house, that raises the prospect the combined company could also face competition from the biggest healthcare insurers.The healthcare industry is under pressure following reform in the US, with more patients expected to leave the employer-sponsored health plans served by the PBMs and purchase insurance through government-run exchanges.“The cost and quality of healthcare is a great concern to all Americans,” said Mr Paz. “Companies like ours have a responsibility to provide the leadership and resources required to drive out waste in healthcare and provide the best care in the world.” The companies believe they can save $1bn in costs through combining.The deal comes four years after Express Scripts failed in its $26bn attempt to buy Caremark, a large rival. Caremark instead opted for an offer from pharmacy chain CVS – in part because of fears that antitrust issues would stymie an Express-Caremark combination.Antitrust experts said that the industry was extremely complicated to analyse. PBMs negotiate favourable deals with pharmaceuticals companies and retailers for their clients – leading to concerns over buyer power – as well as competing with them through mail order. The companies also act on behalf of a wide variety of state and government entities keen to see healthcare costs pushed down.PBMs expect to see a boost in profits in the next two years as some of the most widely used prescription drugs face patent expirations, allowing them to switch patients to generic alternatives.David Maris, analyst at CLSA, notes there is a looming drought of new generics coming in 2014 after the next wave of expirations passes. When that is combined with the potential of greater government price controls on drugs, PBMs are wise to seek greater scale.The takeover is the second-largest deal in the US this year after AT&T’s planned acquisition of T-Mobile USA.Shares of Express Scripts rose about 3.8 per cent to $54.50 in midday trading on Thursday.Credit Suisse and Citigroup Global Markets advised Express Scripts. JPMorgan and Lazard advised Medco.
74;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-07-19T20:02:26Z;UnitedHealth;Impressive rebound from lows of some two years ago;"Perhaps Obamacare did not happen at all. Looking over the latest results from UnitedHealth, one might be forgiven for thinking so. Earnings per share at the US health insurer were up 17 per cent from a year ago and profit guidance was raised. Even more impressive is the stock’s rebound from the lows of two and a half years ago. Shares trade around $50 now, near their pre-Obama and pre-crisis range of 2006-2007, having fallen as low as $16. United’s peers show a similar pattern. The recovery has far surpassed the broader US equity market.All agree that Obama’s health law was less harsh than feared for the insurance industry, but the related fact that very little has yet been done to contain medical cost inflation begs a question. Are the healthcare debate and associated risks for health insurance stocks any clearer?The inflation issue is visible in United’s results. Management said that medical cost trend, its internal rate of medical cost inflation, was about 6.5 per cent. In the context of United’s business model, this number is benign and in line with expectations. In the context of a deficit-saddled country where health spending is approaching a world-leading fifth of output already, it is unacceptable (and the overall US rate of health inflation is surely higher than United’s). Something must be done.Health insurer stocks are not expensive, at roughly 10 times forward earnings; Americans have proved touchy about changes to the system, and insurers have experience with cost-containment that could be leveraged profitably if the nation gets serious about the inflation problem. This is all bullish, but the time to invest might not be after an epic share recovery and during a (probably temporary) lull in the national argument over healthcare.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
75;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
76;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-03-23T17:31:45Z;US insurers start to feel better about healthcare;;Investors fled the US health insurance sector last year as the Obama administration sparred with insurers over soaring premiums, and debate about a government-run system raised fears the companies could be put out of business.But a year since the passage of healthcare reform, the outlook for the big US insurers has brightened, with rising stock prices, profits and dividends suggesting that those that resisted the law the most had little to worry about.“Investors are cheered that healthcare reform has turned out to be better than expected,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Sanford Bernstein.Share prices have risen this year. The iShares Dow Jones US Health Care exchange-traded fund is up almost 10 per cent since the beginning of January, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which has advanced by almost 3 per cent.“They [insurers] were the target of a lot of rhetoric,” said Les Funtleyder, fund manager and healthcare strategist at Miller Tabak. “What you had is depressed valuations on reform fears, combined with improving business conditions, which is a recipe for share price appreciation.”Earnings have also been robust. According to an analysis by Health Care for America Now, which backed reform, profits at five of the biggest US health insurers – United Health, WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and Humana – rose by 17 per cent from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010, reaching a total of almost $12bn.Insurers say they have been helped by a weak economy that deterred people from seeking non-essential medical care and an unusually impotent flu season. New consumer protections that have been rolled out have so far not been as costly as some predicted.Aetna signalled its brighter outlook last month when it raised its quarterly dividend from a penny to 15 cents a share. And Joseph Zubretsky, Aetna’s chief financial officer, confirmed that sentiment in early March when he said “As reform became clear, as the economy at least settled, we became increasingly confident in our financial profile and our strategy”.Wayne DeVeydt, chief financial officer at WellPoint, said at a health care conference last week that a recovering economy and normal flu patterns could raise costs, but he acknowledged that “health care reform really plays into our sweet spot”. He said that the company would look to capitalise on ageing baby boomers and new customers entering the insurance system.According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, insurers’ longer-term view is also bright. In a note to clients, they projected earnings per share growth of 10-12 per cent until 2020, as more people become insured and fears about reform subside. Cooling political rhetoric towards the sector should also provide support.“We think the political currency for criticism of the industry is waning along with a broader recognition that the cost of health coverage is about a lot more than industry profit margins, which are quite low relative to other healthcare and non-health care sectors,” said Matthew Borsch, analyst at Goldman Sachs.But despite signs of optimism, clouds continue to hang over the health insurance sector because large portions of the reform have yet to be enacted.Ms Gupte notes that rules looming in 2014 to create state health insurance exchanges and prevent insurers from denying coverage to people who are already sick will create significant shifts in the market, with unexpected consequences. “There are some long-term headwinds that they still have to contend with,” she said.
77;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2011-02-01T03:04:22Z;Judge declares US healthcare law ‘void’;;A federal judge in Florida has ruled that the primary mechanism used by President Barack Obama’s health reform legislation to achieve universal insurance coverage is unconstitutional.Roger Vinson, a US district judge in Pensacola, ruled on Monday that the “individual mandate” requirement that nearly all US citizens buy health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty exceeded Congress’ authority.“Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire act must be declared void,” wrote Judge Vinson, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan. “This has been a difficult decision to reach, and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications.”Judge Vinson sided with governors and attorneys-general from 26 US states, almost all of whom are Republicans. Since the plaintiffs represent more than half of US states, the Florida case has more prominence than some two dozen similar lawsuits filed in federal courts.The Obama administration defended the constitutionality of the health law and plans to appeal the ruling. Two other judges have rejected challenges to the individual mandate but a judge in Virginia struck down a central provision of the law in December.“We strongly disagree with the court’s ruling today and continue to believe – as other federal courts have found – that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional,” said Tracy Schmaler, justice department spokeswoman.A White House official said the administration planned to continue with implementation of the law.“We’ll continue to operate as we have previously and suspect that the states will do the same,” said the senior administration official, who asked not to be named.“Obviously this case will be appealed …and so implementation would proceed apace …This is not the last word by any means,” the official said.But the fact that the judge did not issue a stay of his ruling pending appeal by the government could threaten the application of many of the provisions of the healthcare law.Many observers expect that the US Supreme Court will make the final decision on whether the healthcare reform bill stands.The healthcare overhaul enacted last year, a contentious cornerstone of Mr Obama’s presidency, aims to expand health insurance to cover millions of uninsured Americans while also curbing costs. Administration officials insist it is needed to stem huge projected increases in healthcare costs.Judge Vinson’s ruling drew immediate strong reaction.“Healthcare reform is the law of the land and, now that Americans see its benefits, a majority of them oppose Republicans’ dangerous plans to repeal a law that put patients in control of their own healthcare,” said Harry Reid, Senate Democratic leader.Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an influential national advocacy group that pushed for the healthcare overhaul, called Judge Vinson’s decision an example of “radical judicial activism run amok”.John Boehner, Republican House speaker, was among those who applauded Judge Vinson’s ruling. “Today’s decision affirms the view, held by most of the states and a majority of the American people, that the federal government should not be in the business of forcing you to buy health insurance and punishing you if you don’t,” he said.The National Federation of Independent Business, which claims to represent small businesses across the US and was a plaintiff in the lawsuit, also welcomed the ruling.The individual mandate is key to the law’s mission of covering more than 30m uninsured. Officials argue it is only by requiring healthy people to purchase policies that they can help pay for reforms, including a provision that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be refused coverage.Judge Vinson’s ruling comes after the US House of Representatives, with a new Republican majority, voted earlier this month to repeal the healthcare reform law. The repeal measure is unlikely to go any further since the Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to drop it.Shares of US health insurers were little changed immediately after the ruling, with UnitedHealth Group and Aetna roughly flat and WellPoint down 0.8 per cent.“This just adds to the conflicting nature of the rulings that we’ve seen so far,” said Matthew Coffina, an analyst at Morningstar. “I think everyone watching the industry at this point has been expecting the Supreme Court to ultimately decide this situation.”States involved in the lawsuit were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Maine, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
78;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;CVS to buy Universal’s Medicare unit;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and pharmacy-benefits company, on Friday agreed to buy the Medicare ‘Part D’ prescription drug business of Universal American for about $1.25bn in a deal that will more than double its share of the programme.Universal American serves about 1.9m Medicare recipients, while CVS already provides prescription drug plans for 1.2m Medicare members.Medicare Part D, introduced in 2006, provides the elderly with subsidised access to prescription drugs. The various programmes are managed by private companies and have proved a lucrative segment of the market.Analysts predict that the ageing US population will become dependent on Medicare coverage while the recent healthcare reform legislation is expected to speed up a shift of retirees from employer to government-based health programmes.The social security and Medicare boards of trustees expect the cost of Medicare part D coverage to grow at an average rate of 9.4 per cent each year over the next decade.In early trading, CVS shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $34.89 while Universal American shares soared 40 per cent to $20.39. Under the terms of the deal, Universal shareholders will get about $12.80 to $13 a share in cash.Pitching the deal to shareholders, Per Lofberg, President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, said the transaction would boost CVS position in “one of the nation’s fastest growing segments of the Pharmacy Benefit Management industry”.The deal will position CVS to compete with health insurance companies such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group who already have a strong presence in the Medicare sector.CVS has had a tough year, coming under pressure from weak consumer spending and the loss of major contracts. At the same time, it faces ongoing scrutiny, including several state investigations, of its hybrid model of managing prescriptions and selling drugs through own pharmacies.“The Medicare Part D program is integral to CVS Caremark’s long-term growth strategy,” Mr Lofberg said, adding that the combination would allow the company to provide members with a wider range of products and services at lower costs.Under the complex terms of the deal, CVS Caremark will buy all of the outstanding stock of Universal and then give Universal shareholders all the shares in a new company, which will own all of Universal’s other operations including its Medicare Advantage business.The new company is expected to have about $640m of cash and statutory capital and no debt. Richard Barasch, chief executive of Universal, said the move would allow the company to “focus its energies” on and building its Medicare Advantage business.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2011 and is dependent on shareholder and regulatory approvals.
79;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Mozilo agrees to pay $67.5m to settle SEC charges;;Angelo Mozilo, former Countrywide Financial chief executive, on Friday agreed to pay $67.5m to settle civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in one of the biggest cases arising from the US mortgage meltdown.Mr Mozilo, who built Countrywide into the leading mortgage lender in the US, will pay a fine of $22.5m, the largest levied on a corporate executive by the SEC, and disgorge $45m in gains. He has also agreed to a lifetime ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company.Bank of America, which bought Countrywide in 2008, will pay Mr Mozilo’s $45m disgorgement, a bank spokeswoman said. She said BofA would give the money to Mr Mozilo under an indemnification agreement provided to him as part of the acquisition.Robert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, said that the commission had challenged such indemnification agreements in court but had never succeeded. “Mozilo will pay the largest penalty for deliberately misleading investors during the credit crisis,” Mr Khuzami said. “This is a fitting outcome.”Some lawyers say that BofA could have challenged the indemnification agreement requiring it to cover Mr Mozilo’s disgorgement. The bank spokeswoman declined to comment on why it was going ahead with the payment.Last year, the SEC accused Mr Mozilo and two lieutenants of misleading investors about Countrywide’s financial health.The SEC also accused Mr Mozilo of insider trading. The SEC alleged that his sales of Countrywide stock in 2006 and 2007, at a time when Countrywide executives presumably knew that the real estate bubble was bursting – but before the collapse became widely known among investors – were based on material inside information. Mr Mozilo’s stock sales exceeded $140m.Mr Mozilo’s lawyers have argued that his stock sales were part of a regular automated programme of selling and therefore legal.Mr Mozilo and Countrywide’s former president, David Sambol, and former chief financial officer, Eric Sieracki, were scheduled to go to trial next week.Mr Sambol and Mr Sieracki agreed to pay $5.5m and $130,000, respectively, to resolve their cases. Mr Mozilo, Mr Sambol and Mr Sieracki neither admitted nor denied the claims.The largest financial settlement ever struck by the SEC with a corporate executive was an agreement by William McGuire, former chief executive of UnitedHealth, to pay $468m in 2008 related to the backdating of stock options.
80;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Half a million denied health coverage;;The four largest health insurance companies in the US denied coverage to more than half a million individuals because of their pre-existing conditions from 2007 to 2009, according to a congressional investigation.On average, the four companies – Aetna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint – denied one out of seven applicants’ coverage based on conditions such as pregnancy, angina, diabetes and heart disease.The investigation found that the number of people who were denied coverage increased about 49 per cent from 2007 to 2009. In that period, the groups refused to pay 212,800 claims for individuals who were already insured based on their previous medical conditions.New revelations about the extent of denials based on pre-existing conditions comes at a crucial time for Democratic lawmakers. Many of them have come under pressure in the lead up to the November mid-term elections because of their support for President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, which was passed by Democrats in Congress in March.Polls show that roughly 50 per cent of voters disapprove of the wide-ranging new law. But one of the most universally popular provisions – which will not take effect until 2014 – makes it illegal for insurance groups to deny an individual coverage based on a person’s health status or pre-existing condition. Democrats have argued that the provision is economically feasible because the new law also includes a mandate forcing every individual to be covered, one of the least popular aspects of the bill.Republican candidates for Congress have vowed to “repeal and replace” the healthcare law, but keep the new provision on pre-existing conditions. They have not, however, explained how they would extend coverage to those individuals without a broader mandate.The congressional investigation by Democrats on the House energy and commerce committee was initiated shortly before the landmark vote on healthcare reform, when Congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the committee, asked each of the companies for extensive information about their denial policies. Each of the companies complied with the request.The congressional probe found that each company saw its policy on pre-existing conditions as a key area of growth. For example, internal documents by a company that was not identified by the committee showed that executives were considering practices such as denying payments for drugs related to pre-existing conditions and linking additional claims to pre-existing condition exclusions as ways to limit the amount of money the company had to pay for claims.Although the committee found that a total of 651,000 individuals were denied insurance coverage in the individual market between 2007 and 2009, investigators said the number was likely “significantly higher” because the figure did not include individuals who were discouraged from applying for coverage by insurance agents. The four companies covered about 2.8m people in the individual market in 2009.In some cases, the denials were issued without review. A memo circulated by one unidentified company in 2006 listed 14 medical categories that did not require review, including: any woman who was pregnant or had been treated for infertility within five years.
81;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2010-08-25T21:23:46Z;Healthcare and consumer sectors lead late Wall Street rebound;;US stocks ended a day of choppy trading in positive territory as gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors outweighed disappointing data on durable goods orders and new-home sales.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,055.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to close at 10,060.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent to close at 2,141.54.Healthcare stocks led the rebound, rising 1 per cent with Coventry Health adding 4.5 per cent to $20.27 and United Health advancing 3 per cent to $31.96.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index also advanced 1 per cent buoyed by homebuilders which have been touted by some analysts this week as a bargain buy. Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, beat expectations and swung into profit for the first time in three years. Its shares rose 5.8 per cent to $17.13.Credit card companies rose after VeriFone Systems, the provider of electronic payment technology, raised its full-year forecast. Verifone jumped 8.5 per cent to $24.32. MasterCard was up 1.8 per cent to $206.11. Visa climbed 0.3 per cent to $70.86.Also among the risers, Google pushed up 0.7 per cent to $454.62 after it said it was launching a voice call service, which could rival Skype.Apple fell 0.4 per cent to $17.12 after it was reported that it was close to agreeing deals to offer TV shows for 99 cents and a separate report suggested it may update the Ipod.But earlier in the day all sectors suffered after orders for durable goods fell short of economists’ estimates, increasing 0.3 per cent in July compared with the average forecast of a 3 per cent rise.Excluding transportation, orders fell 3.8 per cent, the biggest drop since January 2009. The indicator pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing and added to fears about the pace of the economic recovery, which sent the S&P 500 down to seven-week lows on Tuesday.New-home sales, meanwhile, unexpectedly fell 12.4 per cent to an annualised figure of 276,000 in July compared with economists’ estimates of 330,000.The figure for June was revised down to 315,000.But investors, who were disappointed by existing home-sales data on Tuesday, had already pencilled in a weak figure.Mounting signs of a slowdown in the economic recovery has prompted some analysts to expect further quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve.“Our expectation would be that the Fed will likely add chapters to QE2 [quantitative easing, round two],” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “I don’t think it’s a sole requirement but it’s part and parcel of what the market needs to see it regain its earlier confidence.”He added that he would like to see tax incentives and training programmes to encourage business leaders to start hiring.But the S&P 500 energy index suffered, falling 0.3 per cent, as coal miners fell on the back of concerns that the declining price of natural gas may prompt power stations to switch from coal to natural gas. Arch Coal lost 1.9 per cent to $21.99 and US-listed shares of MacArthur Coal dropped 7.5 per cent to $20.03.In deal news, both 3Par and PotashCorp, targets of recent bids, fell. 3Par said it would start talks with Hewlett-Packard, which bid $1.6bn for the data storage company. 3Par lost 1 per cent to $26.76, Hewlett-Packard was down 0.4 per cent to $38.24 and Dell, which had entered a lower bid for the company and was reported to be considering beating HP’s offer, nudged up 1.7 per cent to $11.79.US-listed shares in PotashCorp fell 2.4 per cent to $145.50 after Marius Kloppers, chief executive of bidder BHP Billiton, said there was only a “small universe” of interest in the fertiliser producer. US-listed shares in BHP Billiton, which also reported pre-tax profits that surged nearly 70 per cent, nudged up 0.1 per cent to $65.51.In contrast, Genzyme rose 0.3 per cent to $67.58 after French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi-Aventis, which has offered up to $70 a share for the maker of drugs for genetic conditions, said that it would not raise its bid beyond $70. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis added 0.3 per cent to $28.38.
82;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Cheer over earnings props up shares;But the euro retreats and 2-year Treasuries yields hit new low;"Tuesday 22:10 BST. Traders hold steady as investors are steeled by mostly positive earnings, though still veered away from taking on substantial risk by the fallout from European fiscal difficulties.The FTSE All-World equity index reversed its losses and was up 0.5 per cent, but the dollar bounced off near 10-week lows as its haven attraction trumps concerns about the US economy. The euro was also in retreat and US 2-year Treasury yields hit a new low.Gains appear likely to continue: After the close there was an anticipated agreement by BP to sell $7bn in assets to Apache; that will give backbone to those cheering a potential return of the bid premium to shares. And Apple, which has been going through a rare spell as a laggard, reported stronger-than-expected earnings on the back of brisk sales of iPads and iPhone 4 devices.But the trigger for the session’s early slide appeared to be news highlighting how the stretched budgets of many European nations, and the austerity drives designed to combat them, will place strains on financial systems and negatively affect the corporate sector.The UK’s fiscal situation came into focus following a profit warning from UK-listed telecoms group Cable & Wireless Worldwide. That brought home to investors how the slashing of government spending can hurt company earnings. News that the UK government’s borrowing in June was the highest on record for that month only serves to highlight the extent of cuts to come.In the US, the first substantially negative earnings report, from Goldman Sachs, knocked back sentiment early, as the S&P 500 opened nearly 1.5 per cent lower. However, growing revenues and earnings at IBM and Texas Instruments, plus earnings-forecast beating perormances by PepsiCo and UnitedHealth Group, attracted bargain seekers.Even Goldman Sachs, still the leading trading franchise on Wall Street, was higher later in the session as bargain hunters swooped in. The S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent.“The company reports we’ve had so far are inconsistent with the double dip concerns that the markets have been pricing in,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.Yet many of the earnings reports contained notes of caution – notably forecast cuts by Johnson & Johnson and Tupperware, plus below-expectation business sales growth at IBM – that did little to dispel fears that the economy was slowing. Such is the worry about the US and global economy potentially slipping backwards, that some analysts see the Federal Reserve needing to consider further monetary stimuli.Indeed, Mr Schweitzer cautioned: “The strength of corporate profits is what leads me to expect that business hiring and capital spending will improve in the coming months, but it’s not going to be an overnight recovery. There are just too many negatives out there.”In addition, a poorly-received auction of three-month bills by Hungary showed investors are getting increasingly nervous about the stand-off between Budapest and the IMF/EU over the extent of the austerity package relating to the receipt of a €20bn loan. That has hurt the region’s banking stocks, which are seen having significant exposures to eastern european debt.Sales today of debt by Ireland, Spain and Greece have gone fairly well, but then the ECB stands as a backstop for such “peripheral” sovereigns. A six-year UK gilt auction was more of a struggle. US Treasury bonds saw buying in spite of shares rallying after housing starts were said to slow 5 per cent in June (though permits for future potential building did offer some hope).This only highlights the difficulties investors – and governments– know they face in trying to assess a patchwork global economy and thus the markets’ prospects in the medium term.Just north of the border, the Canadian central bank raised interest rates for the second time in six weeks – from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent – as it seeks to normalise policy as activity rebounds.The move shows that areas of strength persist, a point highlighted today by the Asian Development Bank which, while acknowledging that issues such as the sovereign debt crisis had made the environment more uncertain, raised growth forecasts for most economies in the region.At the same time, Australia and Brazil are struggling over whether to slow their growth or keep their foot on the accelerator. The Australian dollar was higher on speculation of another rate hike, while Brazil’s real was lower (and its stocks higher) after a report showing a more moderate pace of inflation growth led traders to conclude that another rate hike was not necessarily imminent.New US housing data were also received with confusion. New construction was down 5 per cent June, leading homebuilding shares to initially tumble. But shares later rallied as markets focussed on a sub-data point showing permits for future building to be on the rise.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index added 0.2 per cent, shrugging off worries about US growth and the poorly-received results overnight from IBM and TI. S&P 500 futures had fallen nearly 1 per cent after the bell in New York following those results, but by the time the Asian session drew to a close the contract had pared losses as investors in the region took a more phlegmatic view of corporate prospects.Shanghai sported its second consecutive good advance, rising 2.2 per cent as traders welcomed signs of currency liberalisation by Beijing. Hong Kong climbed 0.9 per cent, though Tokyo fell 1.2 per cent as Japan played catch-up after being closed for a holiday on Monday.● Europe. Bourses initially responded to Wall Street’s rebound overnight and saw decent gains from the off. However, the austerity worries took their toll as the session progressed and falls accelerated after the Goldman earnings hit the wires.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was only fractionally higher even though miners did well. Banks, which were modestly higher as investors reasoned that the outcome of the eurozone stress tests due on Friday will restore confidence to the sector, faltered later on.The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.2 per cent, led lower by telecoms.● Forex. The dollar rebounded as equities slid. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, was up 0.3 per cent.The euro had earlier reclaimed the $1.30 mark, but the renewed fiscal worries, profit taking and haven trades left the single currency down 0.4 per cent at $1.2891.Notably, the euro seemed to ignore early rumours, based on reports in Spanish media, that all of Spain’s caja savings banks passed the stress tests. That news, if true, could go either way with traders. Either it means that Spain’s troubled lenders are healthier than expected, or that the stress tests were not stressful enough.● Debt. The market faced a deluge of sales, with Spain, Ireland, Greece and the UK auctioning debt of various duration. Eurozone auctions had been considered pretty successful of late, so any disappointing sale could have hit sentiment.Spain, for example, sold €4.3bn of 12-month bills and €1.7bn of 18-month bills, and though the bid-to-cover ratios were slightly lower than seen for an auction last month, so were the yields demanded, a sign of easing investor stress. Spanish 10-year benchmark yields are down 7 basis points at 4.33 per cent.US Treasuries enjoyed demand as traders seek havens. The 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 2.95 per cent, while the 2-year note earlier hit a new all-time low of 0.5764 per cent. In late trading it had flattened out to 0.5845 per cent.● Commodities. The complex managed a stoic performance given the bond market’s flight from risk. This may partly be the result of the complex’s correlation to sentiment emerging from China, where stocks had another good day. Copper was up 2.7 per cent at $3.01 a pound in New York trading. Oil reversed an early slide, rising 1.2 per cent to $77.44 a barrel, helping to push the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index up 0.1 per cent.Gold was up 0.8 per cent at $1,191 an ounce, having hit a fresh two-month intra-day low of $1,175."
83;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2010-06-15T21:19:07Z;Healthcare software opens to a new generation;;After a lost decade, the UK healthcare software market is opening up to a new generation of companies.Government spending and media attention for much of the past 10 years has centred on the flagship £12.7bn ($18.8bn) National Programme for IT, an all-encompassing plan to modernise and connect large parts of the IT system of the NHS in England and Wales.But the scale and complexity of the project led to long delays and contractors had their fingers burnt. Isoft, once valued at £1bn, nearly collapsed while BT’s Global Services division attributed a significant part of its £1.3bn writedown in 2008-09 to contract delays within the project.This year has seen officials responsible for its implementation admitting that the National Programme will not deliver all that it intended, most notably in the critical area of patient care records.Its breakdown, and government plans for the NHS to make at least £20bn in efficiency cuts, has allowed emerging companies such as Emis, System C Healthcare, Iris Software and INPS to make rapid inroads into the market.“The opportunity is there. It could be a platform for growth of the UK software market for new companies and be a regeneration for the UK software industry,” said Matthew Swindells, managing director for health at Tribal Group, the outsourcing company.He should know. Mr Swindells is a former chief information officer of the NHS and is chairman of the British Computer Society’s Health division. But he cautions it will be a selective market. “The real issue is that the only game in town is quality and productivity. Interesting new software isn’t going to get a look in until it drives productivity,” he said.Healthcare industry executives are betting that budgetary constraints will force the NHS to turn to technology to provide more cost savings, mainly in the form of efficiencies in administration. Kable, the public sector consultancy, has forecast that software investment will rise from £86.4m in 2007-08 to £364.6m in 2013-14, a compound annual growth rate of 27.1 per cent, the highest area for technology spending in the UK public sector.To little fanfare, the past year has seen companies large and small positioning themselves to take on more work for the NHS.Capita, one of the largest outsourcing specialists, recently bought Premier Medical Group for £60m, while Advanced Computer Software, the acquisitive consolidation group, bought COA Solutions from Alchemy Partners for £100m. And last year United Health, the US health insurance group valued at $8bn (£5.4bn), bought Scriptswitch, the drug comparison software provider, for £50m.Emis, which provides software for GP surgeries, has been among the few technology companies to brave a stock market flotation this year.All such providers have promised that their product will streamline administration in the NHS, which in effect means fewer jobs.“The reality is that you could deliver just as good frontline services to the community at large, you could take billions of pounds out of the health budget just by being administratively more efficient,” says Paul Pindar, chief executive of Capita.Much of the past decade has seen large companies such as CSC and Cerner dominate but as the market breaks down, investors and analysts expect the smaller home-grown operators to come to the fore.But Ian Spence, an analyst at IS Research, pointed out that healthcare software stocks have outperformed other government-related public sector software companies in the past year. “It seems to us investors are focusing on the potential opportunities resulting from the likely restructuring of Connecting for Health and ignoring the potential pitfalls,” he said.Chief among those will be the pace of change. For all the industry’s optimism, it is dealing with the most politically sensitive part of the public sector.Furthermore, the record of IT projects, such as the National Programme, for making savings in the health service is relatively poor. “The opportunity is enormous – but the potential for nothing to happen is also quite high,” Mr Swindells said.Such pessimism is challenged by others in the industry. Vin Murria, chief executive of ACS argues that smaller systems have worked in the NHS. ACS provides software for virtually all of the NHS’s out of hours service.There is agreement that the software industry is likely to see consolidation and new partnerships.“Consolidation is inevitable as companies starved of new business for nearly a decade struggle to cope with volume demands over a short timescale,” said a private company executive who declined to be named.Liz Jones, head of healthcare at Isis Equity Partners, the private equity firm that sold Scriptswitch, said in all sectors, companies will want to act local but have a national presence. “Businesses with £500,000-£1m profit become attractive targets,” she said.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

The average analyst estimate was $4.14 per share.AIG, the troubled insurer that lost $2bn insuring collateralised debt obligations, including $6bn worth of Goldman’s, is considering pursuing Goldman to recoup some of those losses.The rest of the financials sector was higher as investors appeared to shrug off worries that the action against the bank would impact the wider sector.JPMorgan rose 1.1 per to $45.88 and Bank of America climbed 1.2 per cent to $18.61.Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $4.97 as the bank’s target price was raised at UBS to $5 from $3.75.IBM, the world’s largest technology services provider, lost 1.9 per cent to $129.69 in spite of the company raising its full-year earnings guidance and reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by an 18 per cent rise in consulting-

Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37. Earnings per share were 64 cents, compared to average analyst estimates of 71 cents per share.Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson was one of the top risers in the S&P 500 index as the company jumped 7.3 per cent to $35.17 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter results."

However, much of this impact has already been priced into the sector.”More broadly, he said, the healthcare bill may turn out to be a catalyst for a potential 5-10 per cent stock market decline due to the impact of higher taxation. “The potential negative outcome for the broader market stems from the tax and deficit impacts of the legislation.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,165.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.4 per cent at 10,785.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.9 per cent at 2,395.40.Standard & Poor’s healthcare sector index outperformed the broader market, climbing 9.2 per cent.

Lobbyists on Tuesday said the timing of Mr Waxman’s hearing showed that he was seeking to focus attention on an extremely popular provision of proposed healthcare reform, which would guarantee coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions, just days before a potentially contentious vote.Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of forcing insurance companies to cover people who have previously been ill, according to analysts at Pew Research. According to a survey conducted in October, 82 per cent of respondents supported measures guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, even though the majority of voters disapproved of healthcare legislation in its entirety.Mr Waxman has also asked the companies to provide his committee with documents dating back to 2005 that detail their policies on insurance claims or coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions.The requests includes all internal communications and e-mails between senior corporate management, presentations to management and government agencies, training materials for insurance brokers and agents, and documents showing the total number of denials related to pre-existing conditions during the past five years.The insurance industry’s chief lobby group on Tuesday said the House probe was part of a consistent effort by Democrats to shift the focus to the insurance industry in the lead-up to a potential vote by the House on a reform bill that it staunchly opposes.A spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans said the industry would support legislation that forced the insurance industry to cover individuals with preexisting conditions if it also contained a mandate to force individuals to buy insurance, which current proposals do not.WellPoint, one of the companies Mr Waxman is targeting, has already come under fire over its attempt to increase premiums by as much as 39 per cent, even as it has made billions of dollars in profits and taken executives out on lavish retreats.The rate increases, which were publicised last month, could not have come at a better time for the Obama administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who seized on the issue as a prime example of why the insurance industry requires reform.WellPoint and Humana said they were reviewing Mr Waxman’s request. United Health and Aetna did not return calls.

Shares in the software company – considered the sector’s bellwether – rose 1.8 per cent to $134.14. Last week, Intel reported revenues and profits sharply above analysts’ expectations and gave an optimistic forecast for the first quarter, citing improving demand for electronic goods in the recovery. The shares were up 1.2 per cent at $21.05.However, shares in Google initially fell after the group announced it had postponed the launch of two mobile phones in China. Last week, the company threatened to quit China following suspected cyberattacks, raising fears of a deterioration in the country’s trade relations with the US. However, the shares ended 1.3 per cent up at $587.62 in anticipation of good results from the search engine this week.Elsewhere, Alcatel-Lucent, the world’s largest supplier of fixed-line phone networks, fell 3 per cent to $3.61 after Unicredit cut the stock to “sell” from “hold”. Analysts said the group could suffer from increased competition from China’s Huawei, the country’s largest telecoms provider.After climbing steadily higher, the S&P 500 closed at the highest level since October last year, having risen 1.25 per cent to 1,150.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,725.43 and the Nasdaq was 1.4 per cent higher at 2,320.40.Wall Street had initially opened lower after results from Citigroup unsettled the market.Citigroup reported a fourth-quarter loss of $7.6bn after its decision to repay government bail-out funds put an end to its run of three consecutive profitable quarters. The results were broadly in line with expectations but the shares, which lost more than 50 per cent last year, dipped in and out of the red as investors picked through the details. The stock was later up 3.5 per cent at $3.54.Last Friday, JPMorgan reported higher profits than Wall Street had been expecting but the shares fell sharply because of to concerns over rising loan losses. JPMorgan was down again on Tuesday, falling 0.9 per cent to $43.28.Shares in Kraft Foods fell 0.6 per cent to $29.41 after the consumer group finally agreed to a revised deal to buy Cadbury for about $19.6bn.The agreement follows months of hostile relations after Kraft made an unsolicited bid for the British confectioner last August.Fast-food chains were also in focus after Credit Suisse adjusted its ratings on the sector. McDonald’s rose 1.9 per cent to $63.48 after analysts raised the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.However, Burger King was cut to “neutral” from “outperform”, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent
to $18.00."

But the Nasdaq Composite managed to close 0.1 per cent higher at 2,291.28.The dollar climbed to a three-month high against the yen as investors anticipated tighter monetary policy next year, reducing the appeal of equities.“After a great six-month run, there’s also probably a little bit of profit-taking and window-dressing going on,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.Volumes were very light, even compared with the holiday period last year, since many investors have already settled their positions following a volatile year on Wall Street.The number of shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange on Christmas eve this year was 20 per cent lower than last year while the lead-up to the new year has proved quieter so far.Aetna, the health insurer, weighed on the market on Wednesday, falling 2.2 per cent to $32.15.The group said it would have to absorb up to $65m in fourth-quarter expenses due to job cuts and building closures. Last month, Aetna said it would lay off about 1,250 workers by April next year in response to both poor economic conditions and the potential impact of healthcare reform.However, since President Obama’s healthcare speech in September, the stock has gained about 10 per cent.UnitedHealth Group, one of the sector’s largest operators, is up 8 per cent over the same period.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, announced that it had halted trials of a new treatment for lung cancer.The drugmaker said it had stopped enrolling patients for the study after an “apparent imbalance” between the number of deaths and complications among patients taking the medicine and those in control groups. Its shares were down 0.3 per cent to $18.50.However, chipmakers helped to lift the technology sector and pushed the Nasdaq ahead of other indices.Nvidia rose 3.6 per cent to $18.67 after analysts at Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”.Elsewhere in the sector, the brokerage also raised Marvell Technology Group to “buy” from “hold”, citing improving demand for computers in the recovery.Analyst Suji De Silva added that Marvell’s efforts to diversify beyond its core storage business would soon pay off, which helped push the shares 2.8 per cent higher to $20.83.Broadcom, another chipmaker, agreed to pay $160.5m to investors in order to settle lawsuits over the way it had reported stock options. Its shares were up 1.8 per cent to $31.85.Apple buoyed the sector after Kaufman Bros lifted its price target on the stock to $253 from $235, saying the company would be likely to beat estimates. Its shares were up 1.2 per cent to $211.64. Several equipment makers also continued to benefit from discussions over airport security following the botched attempt to blow up a US-bound aircraft on Christmas Day.L-3 Communications climbed 1.5 per cent to $88.50 after the Netherlands said it would start using full-body scanners for flights to the US.The company, which has already provided body scanners to the main airport in Amsterdam, was trading at a 14-month high on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Gander Mountain, which sells camping, fishing and hunting gear, rose 0.2 per cent to $5.11 after the board agreed to delist the retailer from the Nasdaq.Two of the company‘s largest shareholders have said they intend to buy out the remaining shares, taking the company private.Gander, which reported this month that its third-quarter profit had quadrupled, said regulation costs outweighed the advantages of remaining publicly listed.Among the market’s other gainers, Oshkosh, the Wisconsin-based company that makes military trucks, added 0.9 per cent to $37.85 after the company won a $258m contract from the US government.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,545.41 and the Nasdaq was down 0.1 per cent at 2,288.40.“This recovery rally appears to have run out of steam and we may be entering an extended consolidation period,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.Since the market’s lows in March, the S&P is up more than 65 per cent.Mining companies also pushed the market higher in early trading after copper rose to a 15-month high following a strike at the world’s second-largest mine. Workers at the Chuquicamata mine in Chile are protesting over pay. Xstrata has cut output at the facility for nearly a month to finish maintenance work. However, the stronger dollar weighed on commodity-based stocks later in the day and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 0.9 per cent to $81.09.Housebuilders suffered after data showed that US home prices were broadly flat in October following five months of solid gains.Some analysts suggested house prices could be heading for a “double-dip”.

The drugmaker said it expected to meet the US Food and Drug Administration in January.UnitedHealth, the leading US healthcare operator, was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Standpoint Research, who cited low growth prospects and the lack of a dividend. The shares dropped 1.7 per cent to $30.85.Sterling Bancshares the Houston-based lender, abandoned its plans to buy
First Banks’ branches in Texas before the end of the year because it had taken too long to gain regulatory approval.

Intel rose 2.3 per cent to $20.09.Deal news in the construction and pharmaceutical sectors also helped to revived overall confidence in the market.Bucyrus International, the construction company, announced that it had bought Terex’s mining business for $1.3bn.In October, Terex posted its fourth straight quarterly loss after demand for construction equipment continued to fall during the recession.Shares in Terex jumped 9 per cent to $20.94 while Bucyrus climbed 9.8 per cent to $55.84.Athersys, the pharmaceutical company, sold the rights of its stem cell treatment for inflammatory bowel disease to Pfizer for up to $111m.Athersys shares more than doubled to $2.40 while Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, was up 1.7 per cent to $18.61.Incyte also sold the rights to its experimental pill to treat inflammatory conditions to Eli Lilly & Co.Incyte, which could receive as much as $665m in additional payments, rose 2.8 per cent to $8.73.

96;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-11-17T22:35:09Z;Isis drug stake set for solid returns;;ScriptSwitch, the provider of drug comparison software to doctors’ surgeries, has been acquired by UnitedHealth, the leading US healthcare operator, generating a four-fold return for the Coventry-based company’s private equity backers.The sale of ScriptSwitch – founded by two students and a pharmacist at the University of Warwick in 2001 – illustrates how start-up technology companies can still earn big profits for their private equity backers.Isis Equity Partners, the specialist in small- to mid-market private equity deals, acquired a one-third stake in ScriptSwitch through Baronsmead, its Aim-listed venture capital trust, in May 2007.The ScriptSwitch sale, due to be announced on Wednesday, would value it at about £50m ($84m). It has about £10m of revenue and increased staff from 18 to 45 in the past year.ScriptSwitch supplies more than six out of 10 of the UK’s primary care trusts, which use its software to provide doctors with information about cheaper generic drug alternatives, as well as data on patient safety and dosage levels.Wol Kolade, managing partner of Isis, said recently that he had taken a cautious approach to new investments in the past two years. Its last new deal was Traveljigsaw, an online car hire company, in June 2008.“People don’t do anything when they are frightened,” said Mr Kolade. “But since the summer people have come out and said this is the new reality, so let’s adapt to it.”
97;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-11-04T21:37:16Z;US stocks give up gains after late sell-off;;"Wall Street gave up early gains on Wednesday in a late sell-off after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its intention to keep rates low for an extended period.Freddie Mac dropped 1.6 per cent to $1.22 and Fannie Mae lost 5.2 per cent to $1.09 after the Fed said it would buy less debt issued by government-backed mortgage finance agencies than it had originally planned.Financial stocks led the sharp pull-back in the final 30 minutes of trading, which left indices to close nears the lows of the day.Wall Street had initially risen on rising commodity prices, strength in the healthcare sector and a series of positive corporate results.While stocks fluctuated throughout the day, the healthcare sector remained strong after Republicans captured two state governorships on Tuesday.Investors bet that the opposition victories would bolster opposition to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform package, lifting shares of UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, 3.6 per cent to $27.87.After gaining up to 1.5 per cent during the day, the S&P 500 finally closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,046.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 9,802.14 and the Nasdaq lost 0.1 per cent to 2,055.52.Investor confidence had initially remained high in spite of disappointing economic data earlier in the session. The ADP employment report, released during pre-market trading, showed that 203,000 private sector jobs were lost in October.Although this was just above the 198,000 consensus estimate, investors welcomed the fact that it represented the smallest number of job losses for the survey since July 2008.The Institute for Supply Management’s October reading of the services sector was also worse than expected. Economists had been expecting a reading of 51.5 but the ISM recorded a level of 50.6. However, a reading above 50 still indicates growth. “The basic flow of the statistics suggests that, in fact, the economic recovery is continuing to roll along,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“The other dynamic that is still important is that, because of the scepticism about the recovery and about the rally, a lot of people would like to be more heavily invested in equities. And some just give in and plough their money into the market.”Corporate news had also helped to lift the mood throughout the day on Wall Street. Walt Disney gained 1.5 per cent to $28.03 after announcing late on Tuesday its breakthrough deal to build a theme park in Shanghai.Time Warner raised its profit outlook for 2009 due to better results than expected at its cable and films division. But after sharp gains in early trading, the shares closed 0.2 per cent lower at $30.10.Comcast also made strong gains in early trading after the cable operator reported quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates. It said profit had risen 22 per cent, mainly due to subscriber gains and lower capital expenditure. But, by the closing bell, the shares had slid 3.1 per cent to $14.06.Radian, the mortgage insurer, was another to surprise analysts by reporting a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. The group said fewer homeowners had claimed mortgage insurance and it also lowered its estimate of the value of claims to be paid out in 2009 by 15 per cent. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $6.09.Ambac Financial Group, the world’s second-largest bond insurer, surged by
35.2 per cent to $1.50. The group posted net income of $2.2bn, reversing last year’s loss, mainly due to accounting gains.Devon Energy, the third-largest US independent oil and gas company by market value, released quarterly results above expectations, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $67.07.Higher oil output and cost-cutting helped the company cushion the impact of falling prices.Elsewhere in the sector, Baker Hughes, the oilfield-services provider, fell 5.9 per cent to $40.89. The group reported a sharp drop in third-quarter profit due to plunging energy prices and reduced customer spending."
98;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-09-16T20:48:58Z;Energy sector lifts US stocks;;A major oil discovery off the coast of Africa and positive economic data helped US stocks rally to fresh highs for the year on Wednesday.The energy sector propelled the market upward from the opening bell after a consortium of oil companies led by Anadarko Petroleum said it had made an oil find near Sierra Leone. The discovery potentially opens up a new, 1,100 km-wide, multi-billion-barrel oil frontier in west Africa.Shares in the Texas-based company rose 9.6 per cent to $64.85. ConocoPhillips also gained 1 per cent to $46.79 and Chevron rose 1.1 per cent to $72.45 after optimism seeped across the rest of the sector.Higher petrol costs pushed up the consumer price index and US industrial production in August for the second consecutive month, adding to investor hopes that a recovery was under way.While the consumer price index was higher than expected, the core CPI was in line with forecasts and helped to calm investor concerns over inflation. Following an afternoon rally, all of the leading indices closed up more than 1 per cent, notching up three straight days of gains. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,068.76, closing at its highest level since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,791.71, while the Nasdaq rose 1.5 per cent to 2,133.15.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said the market had also broken through significant levels. “Now there’s really no resistance,” he said. “Overseas markets were all up across the board and it just continued over here. Economic news this morning was also better, from the CPI to the industrial production numbers.”Financial stocks added to the gains from the energy sector. Citigroup rebounded after falling nearly 9 per cent on Tuesday. After reports that the government might offload its 34 per cent stake in the bank, it emerged late on Tuesday that Citi had also raised $5bn in government-guaranteed bonds. The move to tap the emergency facility just before it expires could complicate attempts to persuade the government to reduce its stake. The shares rose 1.9 per cent to $4.20. Genworth Financial also pushed the sector higher, gaining 9.1 per cent to $13.14 a day after it priced a common share offering.Other stocks in the sector also climbed on optimism about economic recovery. Wednesday’s positive data added to comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, on Tuesday that the US recession was “very likely over”. Bank of America was up 2.7 per cent at $17.25 and JPMorgan rose 3.4 per cent to $44.65.The materials sector also contributed to the market advance as commodity prices gained momentum and gold approached an 18-month high. Alcoa rose 3.4 per cent to $14.47, after closing 8.1 per cent higher at $13.99 on Tuesday.Deal news lifted sentiment. Adobe Systems said on Tuesday it was buying Omniture, the ad-measurement company, for $1.8bn in an effort to diversify as its core software business declines. The all-cash deal will allow Adobe to embed Omniture’s measurement services into the web content that designers create with its software. Adobe fell 6.4 per cent to $33.35 while Omniture soared 26.3 per cent to $21.88.Bank of America analysts upgraded Amazon.com to “buy” from “neutral”, who said the world’s biggest online retailer would be able to maintain its position ahead of rivals. The shares rose 8.6 per cent to $90.70.Verizon Communications dragged the telecoms services index into negative territory after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $30.41.Healthcare stocks also came under scrutiny after Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, unveiled the long-awaited bill on healthcare reform. Wellpoint rose 3.2 per cent to $54.86 and UnitedHealth gained 5.7 per cent to $29.29.In other news, Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, agreed to sell a 64 per cent stake to Brazilian meat producer JBS for $800m.

General Electric climbed 4.2 per cent to $16, while Alcoa rose 8.1 per cent to $13.99. Rising commodity prices have helped power Wall Street’s rally over the past two weeks.The S&P closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,052.63. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 per cent to 2,102.64, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 9,683.41.Retail sales had initially given investors confidence. In August, sales rose by the most in more than three years, boosted by the cash-for-clunkers car buying programme and signs of extra spending by consumers.In other data, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that its “Empire State” manufacturing activity index rose in September to 18.88 from 12.08 in August.Technology stocks also pushed the market higher from the opening bell. Ebay was up 1.3 per cent at $24.14 after Piper Jaffray upgraded the shares of the online auctioneer. Also on the upgrade list was Yahoo, which was raised to “outperform” from “market perform” by Sanford C. Bernstein. The stock was up 5.4 per cent at $16.41.But consumer stocks dragged the indices into the red for brief periods during the day and continued to limit gains.Kroger, the supermarket chain, was one of the worst casualties in the consumer sector. The shares fell 7.5 per cent to $20.46 after the group posted second-quarter profit below estimates and reduced its full-year outlook. The company, which also operates Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores, has come under pressure to slash its prices in the recession to compete with low-price competitors such as Wal-Mart.Shares of rival Safeway also fell 3.6 per cent to $19.48 after the results
from Kroger, while Supervalu slipped 3.6 per cent to $15.73.Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, also hit confidence in the sector after the retailer said second-quarter profit fell 22 per cent to $158m. The shares fell 5.2 per cent to $38.32.Johnson & Johnson said it would reduce by $115m to $885m the amount it would pay for an 18.4 per cent stake in Elan. The revised terms of the deal are designed to appease a dispute between Elan and Biogen, its US partner. Shares in Johnson & Johnson were down 0.3 per cent at $60.15.Financial stocks also led the market lower initially. It emerged that Citigroup was exploring options to facilitate a sale of the government’s 34 per cent stake in the troubled financial giant. Citi fell 8.9 per cent to $4.12. Shares in Citi closed at $4.52 on Monday, up from a low of $2.31 in March.The US authorities received more than 7bn shares in the troubled financial group at $3.25 each, after converting $25bn of preferred stock into common equity at the end of July. The share exchange boosted Citi’s ratio of tangible common equity to assets, providing it with a greater buffer of loss-absorbing capital.Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $16.79 and JPMorgan slipped 1.3 per cent to $43.19. After reporting increases in credit-card write-offs, Discover Financial Services fell in early trading but closed up 0.8 per cent to $15.14.Healthcare stocks took another battering as President Barack Obama reiterated his plans to curb medical expenses through sector reform. UnitedHealth fell 3.7 per cent to $27.70 and WellPoint dropped 1.8 per cent to $53.16.Kraft also came back into focus after its recent take-over bid for Cadbury. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent following early gains after the company announced plans to hold talks with the British chocolate maker. It also said it did not need to sell any of its other operations or brands in order to afford its $16bn bid."
100;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-09-11T20:34:16Z;Declining oil prices a drag on Wall Street;;"US stocks broke their five-day winning streak on Friday, after declining oil prices sapped the energy out of the rally and left investors worried about the long-mooted September pull-back.Dollar weakness combined with rising oil and gold prices this week helped the market to its highest closing levels since last October. But light trading volume suggested investors were reluctant to commit themselves after analysts had predicted equities would fall after the summer’s rally.“After a huge run over the last couple of days, the market is a bit overbought so everybody is waiting for a pull-back,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.After the oil price sunk back below the psychologically significant $70 level, stocks erased their early gains. The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,042.73 points after gaining 2.6 per cent this week.The Nasdaq fell 0.2 per cent to 2,080.90 points but it has still outperformed the other indices in recent sessions and was up 3.1 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to end the session at 9,605.41 and was up this week by 1.7 per cent.After leading the market higher this week, technology stocks deteriorated throughout the day. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lost 1.3 per cent to $19.51 even after an upgrade from Roth Capital.In spite of posting better first-quarter results than had been expected, National Semiconductor fell 5.9 per cent to $15.03. The chipmaker’s shares have risen 30 per cent since the beginning of July after investors bet on a sector recovery.Garmin, the maker of GPS products, rose 0.3 per cent to $36.18 after a recommendation from Bank of America.But Cree, a maker of light-emitting diodes, weighed on the sector after it announced on Thursday that it would place 11m shares in a common stock offering. Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.83.After strong performances in the week, the energy and materials sector also dragged the market down but industrial stocks stayed strong. During the week, General Electric powered the sector after JPMorgan upgraded the stock and Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the company the day after.Its shares fell back 0.9 per cent to $14.67 but were up 5.8 per cent for the week.Fedex delivered a further boost to the sector on Friday. The second-largest US package-shipping group, considered a gauge of economic activity, rallied 6.4 per cent to $77.32 after announcing earnings would exceed its forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Quidel gained 1.7 per cent to $16.99 after the maker of tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases forecast strong profit in its third quarter due
to higher demand for flu products.Healthcare stocks also fell back after a week of volatile trading.Uncertainty lingered over President Barack Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system. After clawing back some losses on Thursday, Wellpoint fell 0.3 per cent to $54.03 and Unitedhealth Group also slipped 0.1 per cent to $29.07.The financial sector, however, was in negative territory from the outset.American International Group was downgraded by Wells Fargo Securities, which said the company had no tangible book value.Its shares, which have lost 7.5 per cent this week in spite of the market’s rally, fell 0.8 per cent to $37.55. Morgan Stanley was one of the few gainers in the sector. The shares rose 0.6 per cent to $28.82 after it said John Mack, chief executive, would step down and be replaced by James Gorman, head of retail
brokerage."
101;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-09-10T20:44:04Z;Wall Street rallies on jobs data;;Wall Street stocks hit fresh highs for the year following a shaky start on Thursday, after encouraging data on jobs and a successful Treasury bond auction reassured investors.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed 550,000 Americans had filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was down from 570,000 in the previous week and better than economists’ forecasts of 560,000.A strong Treasury auction also relieved concerns about the US deficit.Uncertainty lingered over President Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system, but health insurance stocks reacted well.After recent losses, WellPoint rose 2.5 per cent to $54.18, while Unitedhealth Group also gained 2.5 per cent to $29.11.The US president said that under his plan, it would be illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or cancel coverage due to sickness, and that they would also be required to cover routine check-ups and preventive care.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up at its high for the day of 1,044.14, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,627.48.After five straight days of gains, the market hit fresh highs since last October. The S&P also hit its high for the year on Wednesday.The technology-focused Nasdaq, which has outperformed the other indices every day this week, climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,084.02.Shuffle Master added to the gains in the tech sector after the company posted second-quarter earnings above expectations. Shares in the company, which makes automatic card shufflers for casinos, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.40.Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, said it was expecting stronger revenue than it had forecast in July for the third quarter. The shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $25 after early gains.Yahoo rose 4.5 per cent to $15.45 after Bank of America changed its recommendation to “buy” from “neutral”, saying growth in the company’s user traffic continued to outpace growth in the internet as a whole. Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Time Warner, boosting its shares by 3.7 per cent to $29.51.“The run that we’ve seen in stocks still continues to impress,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage. “The stocks are overbought here but I’ve been saying that for a long time . . . the biggest issue in the end will be about revenue. You can say, well, we beat earnings expectations but are you making money? That’s going to be the big question.”Airlines also lifted the market after an analyst from JPMorgan said demand was “not as bad as feared” and bankruptcies in the sector were unlikely. United Airlines parent UAL led the sector, rising 17.8 per cent to $7.6, while US Airways also climbed 12.3 per cent to $4.02. The market’s early gains, however, were led by the consumer staples index.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, rose 4.2 per cent to $56.04 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 above analyst expectations.General Mills, which owns brand such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, said easing commodity inflation meant its fiscal first-quarter earnings were also running ahead of its target. Its shares fell back 0.6 per cent to $60.90 after early gains.But the materials sector continued to weigh on market sentiment, after pushing the indices into negative territory in early trading. Shares in Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, slid 5 per cent to $79.30 after the company forecast earnings below estimates. It said trading in its herbicide business had suffered due to oversupply in the market.The utilities index also pushed the market lower, after spending most of the past three weeks in negative territory.Ameren fell 2.8 per cent to $25.35 after the power company said it planned to offer 19m common shares to raise cash for investment in its subsidiaries.
102;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-09-09T21:21:04Z;US health insurance reform;;The more muddled Barack Obama’s crusade to remake US healthcare has become, the higher share prices of big insurers such as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana have risen. They faltered this week as plans emerged from the Senate to directly tax the industry to help pay for coverage to nearly 50m uninsured Americans.The main distinction between soaking insurers directly and eliminating the tax-free nature of employer health benefits is that the latter proved wildly unpopular, particularly among Democrats’ union allies, while the former is palatable to all but insurers’ shareholders. But the distinction would rob Peter to pay Paul as both would result in higher customer outlays or more limited coverage for those already insured.Healthcare companies, including drugmakers, would pay a direct levy and people with high-priced health insurance would also pay. Taxing what politicians dub “Cadillac” health plans has other flaws though. It would not distinguish between typical private sector employees who pay nearly a third of premiums out of pocket and those of civil servants who often pay next to nothing. It would also disproportionately hit policies in high-cost states that bar insurers from denying coverage to riskier customers, thus discouraging a key goal of healthcare reform.As passing Obamacare has grown from a policy initiative into a litmus test of the new administration’s power, political expediency has overshadowed many of its original goals. Chief among these is controlling costs without affecting quality of care. Incentivising a better match between medical cost and benefit is key to this. Without such changes in medical decision-making or a workable public plan, insurance reform simply becomes an exercise in redistributing unacceptably high costs. Creating the illusion that the healthcare industry itself will foot the bill is a convenient fiction.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
103;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-09-08T20:32:49Z;Wall Street bolstered by commodities prices;;"US stocks climbed higher for the third day on Tuesday after rising commodity prices and renewed merger and acquisition activity bolstered investor confidence.“While recent momentum has been positive, the continuing theme of the last few sessions has been one of regaining recent losses and ongoing consolidation rather than the start of a new bull trend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC markets.The S&P 500 ended the day 0.9 per cent higher at 1,025.39 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq also rose 0.9 per cent to 2,037.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,497.34.From the opening bell, the materials and energy sectors led the market after oil prices rose and the gold price crept above the psychologically significant $1,000 level.United States Steel gained 2.2 per cent to $43.28 while ExxonMobil rose 2.1 per cent to $70.65.The industrials index was buoyed by General Electric. Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $14.5 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock.EOG Resources, the oil and gas producer, also climbed 4.5 per cent to $73.64 after Barron’s, the influential investor magazine, said the company may benefit as it shifts from natural gas to potentially more lucrative oil production.Investor confidence was further boosted by a flurry of M&A activity, which has slumped during the recession.Shares in Intellon, the semiconductor company, surged 42.4 per cent to $7.12 after Atheros Communications agreed to buy the company for $244m in cash and stock. Atheros, which makes wireless communications chips for Hewlett-Packard computers, fell 2 per cent to $27.43.Kraft Foods, the biggest food group in the US, fell 5.9 per cent to $26.45 after its £10.2bn ($16.7bn) takeover bid for Cadbury was rejected on Monday.Hershey rose 1.3 per cent to $39.13 on speculation that it could also put itself forward in the bidding war for Cadbury, which produces chocolate bars such as Flake and Wispa as well as chewing gum.The British company has vowed to mount a staunch defence against the unsolicited takeover offer, which comes in the middle of rapid consolidation in the confectionery industry.Elsewhere in the consumer industry, Smithfield Foods, the pork processor, reported a first-quarter loss of $107.7m compared with a loss of $13.2m last year.The company blamed its deteriorating performance on concerns over swine flu and weaker demand for pork. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $12.75.Costco Wholesale, the biggest warehouse club chain in the US, added 2.3 per cent to $56.73 after two broker upgrades.Its membership-only stores, which sell branded food, household and electronic products, have been picking up business as
middle-class Americans seek to save money by buying groceries and other essentials in bulk.The tech sector was buoyed by a report from Morgan Stanley, which raised the US systems and PC hardware sector to “attractive” from “in line”.Apple rose 1.6 per cent to $172.93 after the company raised its price target from $195 to $200.Although Dell was one of the companies that was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, it benefited from the sector’s momentum,
rising 1.7 per cent to $15.96.IBM was also downgraded and lost 0.3 per cent to $117.16, even though the group said it was “well ahead” of its plan of achieving earnings per share of $10 to $11 for 2010.The healthcare sector was the only S&P 500 index group in the red.Health insurance stocks continued to suffer ahead of President Barack Obama’s address to Congress today, when he is expected to
outline his proposed reforms of the healthcare system.WellPoint, one of the largest US health insurers, fell 4.3 per cent to $51.84. UnitedHealth Group fell 3.6 per cent to $27.84.A report late in the day showing US consumer credit had dropped by more than forecast did little damage to the day’s rally. According to the Federal Reserve, consumer credit fell by $21.6bn in July, compared to a revised decline of $15.5bn in June."
104;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
105;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-08-11T20:33:26Z;Wall Street sell-off led by financials;;Financial stocks led US equities to their worst day in more than a month on Tuesday amid signs that the effects of the financial crisis are still being felt.Banks suffered after the Congressional Oversight Panel, the body that runs the Troubled Asset Relief Program, warned the US Treasury had not done enough to relieve them of toxic assets.JPMorgan fell 3.4 per cent to $41.24 while Citigroup snapped a seven-session winning streak, giving up 6.4 per cent to $3.69.Meanwhile two of the companies worst affected by the crisis also fell sharply on fresh worries about their finances.CIT, the commercial lender that narrowly staved off bankruptcy last month, sank 18.9 per cent to $1.20 after the company delayed its second-quarter report, warning it might still go bankrupt if it cannot complete its debt tender or raise money in another way.Struggling bond insurer MBIA suffered a downgrade from JPMorgan, which said the company may be overwhelmed by losses from risky mortgage securities, leaving little value for shareholders. The stock fell 12.6 per cent to $5.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 994.35, on a day when trading in certain shares, including those in Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway, was halted for almost four hours after a computer problem,.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 9.241.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,969.73.“After a near-50 per cent rally off the lows this pull back is both normal and expected,” said Jordan Smyth, managing director of Edgemoor Investment Advisors. “It is not necessarily the start of a steep decline.”The falls came in spite of figures showing productivity among non-farm workers in the second quarter rose more than economists had expected while the costs of that labour fell.But experts warned such savings may not inflate profit margins.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Are companies really going to put these cost savings into margins? My conclusion would be that they are going to use them instead as a tool to cut prices.”There was further pessimism from data showing companies cut inventories much more sharply than expected last month, apparently holding out little hope for a bounce in demand.Wall Street was also waiting for the statement from the Federal Reserve, whose Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to discuss interest rates and the future of quantitative easing.With many on Wall Street predicting little change in policy, investors were waiting to see what tone the committee would strike on the health of the economy.Meanwhile companies sensitive to the US consumer suffered on a second bearish day for cyclicals.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone operator, lost 4.3 per cent to $3.55 after Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock, warning of continued loss of customers.That came after Sprint announced on Monday night that it would increase a current debt offer to $1.3bn, which would take its debt load to $21bn.Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, also saw its shares downgraded, with UBS warning about sluggish sales in the US. The stock fell 3.8 per cent to $35.13.But investors were happier about signs that the battle over Target, the value retailer, may be cooling after Pershing Square, whose manager Bill Ackman lost a proxy contest to elect new directors earlier this year, cut its stake to 4.4 per cent. Target picked up 0.5 per cent to $42.20.The ongoing delays to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms meant health insurers, which stand to see government subsidies cut under the proposals, were one of the few sectors to show strength.UnitedHealth rose 2.8 per cent to $27.82 while Coventry Health Care climbed 1.6 per cent to $22.52.Shares in Fluor, the engineering company, fell after it announced lower revenues than expected. Even though it made better profits than forecast and maintained its outlook, the stock lost 6.1 per cent to $53.96.
106;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:27+0000;‘Clawback’ marks tougher SEC stance;;The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s attempt to use – for the first time – a “clawback” law against an executive who is not accused of any wrongdoing marks a new hard-hitting approach at an agency under pressure to restore its reputation.Until now, the SEC used the provision in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law to go only after individuals it had accused of being involved in fraud and, even then, made its first settlement invoking that law some five years after it was adopted.Last week’s novel move has also highlighted corporate accountability at a time when companies are facing tougher scrutiny on pay policies. The outcome of the case, which will test the SEC’s aggressiveness, could have widespread implications.“They are taking this tool and interpreting it aggressively. If they are successful, I expect to see them using it often and I bet it would change the way CEOs and CFOs behave when it comes to restatements, though it may also make people even more reluctant to take those jobs,” said Nader Salehi, a partner at Bingham, the law firm.The clawback provision in Sarbanes-Oxley, passed in the wake of massive accounting frauds at Enron, Worldcom and other companies, requires executives to return performance-based pay and bonuses as well as stock sale profits if a company is forced to issue an accounting restatement “as a result of misconduct”.Last week, the regulator asked a court to order the return of $4m (€2.82m, £2.43m) paid to Maynard Jenkins, former chief executive of CSK Auto, whose profits were allegedly inflated by accounting fraud committed by others: Mr Jenkins was not involved.Mr Jenkins’ lawyer, John Spiegel, of Munger Tolles & Olson, said: “We look forward to demonstrating to the court that the law does not permit such overreaching against an admittedly innocent person.”But Robert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, said costs of misconduct “need not be borne by shareholders alone”, adding that the personal compensation received by chief executives while the companies they serve engage in wrongdoing can be clawed back.“That was the intent of this provision of Sarbanes-Oxley, and the SEC needs to enforce it …The SEC needs to demonstrate real toughness in cases where restatements are required,” said Harvey Pitt, SEC chairman from 2001 to 2003.Yet it is far from clear whether the agency will be successful. The structure and language of the provision, known as Section 304, are ambiguous and have already prompted debate among lawyers.Some questions, such as whether the provision could be used by private litigants, were partly resolved when courts ruled that only the SEC could enforce it. Private lawsuits invoking the provision have continued to be filed nonetheless.“It has always been an open question whether the SEC would use this weapon against a CEO or CFO who did not personally engage in misconduct, and whether such an aggressive claim would be sustained in litigation,” wrote Wachtell, Lipton, the big Wall Street law firm, in a memo criticising the SEC action.“They are basically going for the strict liability standard,” said Mr Salehi. The SEC has interpreted every ambiguity in the law in the “most aggressive way possible and saying this is the way the ambiguities are going to be resolved”.Whatever the court’s decision, the SEC move serves as a warning to executives, said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance centre at the University of Delaware. “Even the threat to do it may have an effect because it will make individuals at companies more vigilant.”
107;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-07-27T21:33:07Z;Aetna;;"Already walking on eggshells as debate rages in Washington over Obamacare, investors in US health insurers are getting plenty of lessons in risk and reward. Less than a week after industry leader UnitedHealth reported a doubling in earnings and higher guidance after shedding customers, Aetna on Monday slashed its outlook in spite of winning more business.The main drag on Aetna’s bottom line was an unexpected surge in patient reimbursement. Its medical benefit ratio, the percentage of premiums eaten up by costs, rose amid a rise in elective procedures by people afraid of losing employer-provided insurance. Aetna’s bad quarter should be instructive for politicians who boast of supposed cost savings that can be redirected to cover 46m citizens who lack coverage. Even for a sophisticated, commercially driven insurer such as Aetna, adding marginal customers is risky and unpredictable while cost savings are elusive.At 17 per cent of output, up from 5 per cent back in 1965, US healthcare spending leads the world. There have been plenty of scientific advances in the ensuing 44 years, but these are available in developed economies such as Canada and France that spend less than two-thirds as much per capita. Average employee premiums have risen 120 per cent so far this decade and out-of-pocket expenses are up a similar amount. With such high upfront costs, patients expect tests or treatments with even marginal medical benefit. Doctors comply, fearful of appearing negligent later in a medical malpractice suit.The only recent period of moderate US healthcare inflation came when managed care companies such as Aetna grew in the mid-1990s, but this was a temporary impact from restrained reimbursement. Whatever revenue or savings are identified in evolving healthcare legislation, Obamacare will fall short unless these perverse incentives are changed.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

108;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-07-21T20:49:08Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;A late rally for US stocks saw the markets build on Monday’s impressive gains on Tuesday and set new highs for the year, spurred on by signs of growth in global demand from Caterpillar.The machinery maker led the markets throughout the day after it beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings, and said it saw signs of stabilisation.The shares closed 7.7 per cent higher at $39.46 after a dip from even higher opening levels following a warning during the morning conference call that the company might make a loss in the third quarter.Rival equipment maker Deere & Co also rose, climbing 1.9 per cent to $40.54.“Caterpillar is talking about global stimulus looking as if it is beginning to have an effect on demand,” said Quincy Krosby, the market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors are starting to look beyond the US consumer for sources of growth.” Late buying saw equities follow Caterpillar upwards, despite earlier caution triggered by concerns over the timing of the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing and renewed worries over the future of CIT Group.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was addressing Congress in his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers, but he did not say when the Fed would start to reverse its extraordinary measures used to stimulate the economy.This led to uncertainty and early selling pressure on Wall Street.“Investors are cautious, and I’m not sure that people want to take a position during the Bernanke testimony,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.That nervousness added to fresh concerns for CITafter the struggling commercial lender warned the $3bn finance package it secured over the weekend might not save it from bankruptcy. Its shares fell 21.6 per cent to 98 cents.The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw the sharpest rise, supported by encouraging earnings from several of its component companies.Drugmaker Merck was a strong performer after it beat expectations, helped by a lower effective tax rate and tight cost controls. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $29.65.Shares in Schering-Plough, the smaller rival Merck has agreed to buy, gained 3.8 per cent to $26.53 after net income jumped 45 per cent on strong sales of an anti-allergy inhaler and arthritis treatment, helping it to beat expectations.DuPont, the chemical maker, also saw cost controls help negate weaker revenues but the shares slipped a fraction to $28.32.The company’s corn and soybean sales improved in its agricultural unit, and that was enough to give a jolt to shares in Monsanto, the market leader in that field, which picked up 4.6 per cent to $80.08.The Dow closed 0.8 per cent up at 8,915.94, while the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index both rose 0.4 per cent to 954.58 and 1,916.20, respectively.Both the S&P and Nasdaq were at new closing highs for the year.Not every Dow component impressed with its earnings, however. Coca-Cola lost 1.3 per cent to $50.35 even after beating estimates as investors focused on disappointing revenues.United Technologies fell sharply after the company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, with demand for its building and aircraft equipment remaining low. The shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $53.97.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, as Regions Financial reported a wider loss than expected, with mounting losses on commercial and real estate taking their toll on the bank. The shares lost 15.4 per cent to $3.42.BlackRock, the asset manager poised to buy Barclays Global Investors, also fell, dropping 0.4 per cent to $184.14 even after it saw profits beat expectations.Meanwhile, profits at UnitedHealth jumped after higher unemployment led more customers to sign up for its government-backed Medicare insurance plans. Its shares were 3 per cent higher at $25.59.Elsewhere, NRG suddenly jumped during the morning after shareholders in effect ended a $7.7bn hostile bid from rival Exelon by rejecting its nominations for NRG’s board. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $24.82.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
110;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-07-07T21:07:12Z;Wall St slides ahead of earnings season;;"US stocks fell to their lowest levels in two months on Tuesday as investors sold shares ahead of the start of the second-quarter earnings season.Confidence in the economic recovery was knocked by talk of a potential second government stimulus plan after Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to president Barack Obama, and House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer both suggested there could be merits to such a package.Economic fears and a strong dollar took its toll on commodities, with the price of oil falling for a fifth consecutive session.Energy producers followed, and Schlumberger dropped 4.4 per cent to $49.20 while Exxon Mobil lost 2.3 per cent to $66.56.Industrial stocks also suffered, and General Electric gave up 4.1 per cent to $11.01.But Alcoa, the aluminium producer, was buoyant after Klaus Kleinfield, its chief executive, said he was ”very optimistic” about sales ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. The shares gained 1.6 per cent to $9.41.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 2 per cent at 881.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9 per cent to 8,163.60 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 2.3 per cent to 1,746.17.That came after sharp selling in the afternoon as the S&P fell below its 200-day moving average, which is seen as a key support level.“The ten-year Treasury bond has taken off and the dollar is strengthening, which is bad news for stocks,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams. “We got way too positive too soon.”Analysts predicted that the market would remain subdued at least until Thursday, after Alcoa has reported its results.“Everyone is taking a deep breath before earnings,” said Andy Corn, chief investment officer, equities, at Beacon Trust.The pressure from energy and materials stocks was counteracted by strength from health insurers after president Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stressed that a public health insurance plan would help keep the private sector competitive.Health insurers, which have suffered on concerns about the effects of the president’s reforms, bounced on Tuesday.UnitedHealth gained 4.5 per cent to $25.17 and Aetna rose 6.3 per cent to $25.94.“It shows how sensitive those stocks are that some words from the White House last night have given those stocks a pop,” said
Mr Corn.Certain microchip manufacturers performed well after Bank of America raised its ratings for several companies in the sector.The bank said it saw a “definitive turn in end demand” and recommended that investors buy stocks in Intel, the market leader.But Intel lost its early gains amid a wider sell-off in the technology sector and finished 1.8 per cent down at $16.25.BofA also upgraded Marvell Technology, which gained 0.9 per cent to $11.50 and LSI, which climbed
2.2 per cent to $4.65.Banking stocks were mixed as banks continued to raise capital to bolster their balance sheets.KeyCorp was one of the sector’s strongest stocks after KBW upgraded the shares, saying the bank’s balance sheet was stronger than the Treasury required after it raised fresh capital. Keycorp’s shares climbed 4.1 per cent to $5.29.But shares in Discover Financial, the credit card group, dropped 10.8 per cent to $9.37 after the company announced it would issue $500m of stock.Discover, which only made a profit last quarter after successful litigation against rivals Visa and MasterCard, forecast a default rate of up to 9 per cent in the third quarter.Goldman Sachs gave an initial boost to Kohl’s after it upgraded the shares, saying it is the best positioned department store to show positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter. But Kohl’s could not resist the selling and its stock closed 0.9 per cent down at $42.30.Goldman downgraded BJs Wholesale Club, however, the warehouse club that has prospered as shoppers look for bargains.The bank said consumers would soon begin returning to more discretionary retailers, and BJ’s shares fell 2 per cent to $31.46."
111;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-06-11T20:37:57Z;Wall St adds to gains as oil prices surge;;US stocks closed at their highest level of the year on Thursday as the surging price of oil boosted energy stocks, which added to the impetus created by fresh data suggesting that the recession is abating.The figures showed that, since January, the fewest number of people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, well below what analysts had forecast.Meanwhile, the climbing price of oil drove energy companies higher. Chevron gained 2.4 per cent to $71.90 while Schlumberger rose 4.9 per cent to $62.18.This helped markets open higher, and they extended the gains after an auction of 30-year Treasury notes was well received, easing fears that rising interest rates could start to hurt the US consumer.They dipped shortly before the close, but the benchmark S&P 500 index was still able to finish 0.6 per cent higher at 944.89, the highest closing price since November last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 8,770.92 and the Nasdaq Composite index also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,862.37.“Jobless claims are moving in the right direction, although we don’t know if we’ve seen the effect of the automotive plant shutdowns yet,” said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.Consumer staples received a boost from indications that retail sales rebounded in May following April’s surprise fall.Defensive stocks in household name consumer companies did well. Philip Morris gained 0.8 per cent to $43.88, while Coca-Cola climbed 1.2 per cent to $48.58.But economists warned the numbers were not as good as the headline figures suggested, with much of the rise coming on the back of escalating fuel prices.“Given the government’s large fiscal stimulus we would have hoped that maybe sales would have been even higher,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “But they have been kept lower by the sharp rise in the price of gasoline.” Retail stocks remained suppressed on the back of similar analysis from a number of experts. Target fell 2 per cent to $39.55 while Kohl’s declined 1.9 per cent to $45.92.Bank of America was one of the strongest performers in the financial sector after it was upgraded by analysts at KBW, who said the bank’s balance sheet was much stronger after its recent capital raising.Shares in the bank, whose chief executive Ken Lewis addressed Congress on Thursday morning on the details of the takeover of Merrill Lynch last year, advanced 8.3 per cent to $12.97.Two of the country’s largest regional banks also did well after being upgraded by Goldman Sachs, which saw relative value in the shares of Regions Financial and Fifth Third. Regions jumped 9.3 per cent to $4.37, while Fifth Third gained 5.9 per cent to $7.77.Elsewhere in the financial sector, BlackRock confirmed its $13bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest money manager. Early reports of the deal have sent BlackRock’s shares up nearly 10 per cent this week, and they rose 2.3 per cent on Thursday to $182.60.Homebuilders suffered after news that the number of foreclosures in May was the third highest on record, dousing hopes that the housing market could be set for a swift recovery.Three of the largest US homebuilders fell sharply. Centex lost 5.4 per cent to $8.52, KB Home dropped 2.9 per cent to $14.45 and Pulte Homes gave up 5.7 per cent to $8.87.But steelmakers built on the week’s stellar gains as the price of steel continued to rise and the dollar continued to fall. US Steel picked up 4.2 per cent to $41.83 and AK Steel rose 5.2 per cent to $21.14.The battle for supremacy in the smartphone market took a new turn as Palm, which launched its Pre phone last weekend, appointed Jim Rubinstein, who helped develop the iMac and iPod at Apple, as chief executive. Palm’s shares climbed 12 per cent to $13.43 on the news.UnitedHealth was one of the S&P’s heaviest fallers, however, after Oppenheimer warned that the health insurer’s aggressive bids for Medicare contracts could hurt profit margins in 2010. Its shares lost 6.5 per cent to $24.05.
112;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-04-06T20:41:54Z;Bank stocks drag Wall Street lower;;"Sun Microsystems tumbled on Monday, as its planned takeover bid by IBM ran into trouble.IBM withdrew its offer for Sun, leaving the talks suspended, but insiders say it remains to be determined whether the talks have fully collapsed or whether they’ll restart. This triggered a 22.7 per cent fall in Sun’s shares to $6.56.Banking stocks also suffered after Mike Mayo, an analyst at Calyon Securities, began coverage on 11 leading banks, giving them all an “underperform” or “sell” rating. Mr Mayo, one of the earliest analysts to turn bearish on banks, warned loan losses might exceed those seen during the great depression.Billionaire investor George Soros added his doubts about banks’ health later in the day, saying: “The banking system as a whole is basically insolvent.”Wells Fargo fell 6.7 per cent to $15.25, while Citigrouplost 4.6 per cent to $2.72 and JPMorgan dropped 3.7 per cent to $28.20.Investors are relying on banks to pull markets out of their slump more than any time in the past 60 years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg, and worries over their profitability weighed heavily on the markets as a whole.After a very late rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent down at 835.48 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 7,975.85 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,606.71 points.“This was a dramatic run up and as we approach earnings season investors are being cautious and taking profits off the table at any opportunity,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford,But George Feiger, chief executive of Contango Capital Advisers warned the slide is a sign of more fundamental problems. “The big problems with the economy are still there,” he said. “We are still only at the beginning of this problem.”Commodities companies also declined on the back of falling materials prices. Steel makers suffered particularly badly after Deutsche Bank warned demand for steel in North America could fall 25 per cent this year. US Steel fell 2.7 per cent to $25.16 and AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $8.82.The defence sector received a late shot in the arm as Robert Gates,
the defence secretary, announced an overhaul of government spending. Lockheed Martin gained 8.9 per cent to $73.28 after Mr Gates said the government would double the budget for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter plane.Northrop Grumman also stood to benefit from increased spending, and its shares lifted 9 per cent to $47.94.Lockheed was also involved in another of the day’s big stories, as speculation mounted that it might look at acquiring Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft. Textron’s share rose 11.3 to a two-month high of $8.26.Cisco added to the pressure already weighing on the technology sector because of the withdrawal of IBM’s offer for Sun. Cisco was downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “conviction buy” right back to “neutral”, with the bank saying recent gains in the company’s stock meant future growth was now priced in. The technology company fell 3.5 per cent to $17.53.Credit Suisse meanwhile said: “We believe Cisco has seen further incremental weakness in its enterprise business, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of total revenues.”General Motors was one of the session’s few risers, lifting 8.1 per cent to $2.27 after Fritz Henderson, its new chief executive, said bankruptcy was not inevitable for the company.Ford also gained ground after it was able to reduce its debt by $9.9bn after swapping much of it for cash and equity. Shares in the carmaker advanced 16 per cent to $3.77.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, performed well after it renegotiated a licensing agreement with Japan’s Otsuka Pharmaceutical to sell the Abilify schizophrenia drug for an extra 29 months. It s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $20.51. The healthcare sector was also bolstered by insurers, which rebounded after falling on Wachovia’s prediction that government proposals to cut their subsidies could cost them as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana gained 3.3 per cent to $26.31 and UnitedHealth picked up 6.8 per cent to $21.93."
113;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-04-03T22:38:53Z;Late rally bucks grim US jobs data;;US stocks rallied late in the day on Friday to take the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 8,000 points and complete a fourth successive week of gains for the first time since the market peaked in October 2007.The gains came in spite of downbeat economic data as US unemployment hit 8.5 per cent, its highest level since 1983. This was in line with analysts’ estimates, and after an initial fall, the equities market remained resilient.Figures showing that activity in the services sector fell for the sixth consecutive month extended the losses, but stocks recovered in the last hour to find positive territory.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent up at 842.5 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 8,017.59. The Nasdaq Composite index was helped by strength from technology stocks, rising 1.2 per cent to 1,621.87 points. The three gained 3-5 per cent this week.Financial stocks took comfort from the fact that the data were not worse, and the sector rose 4.2 per cent.Healthcare stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as Wachovia said the government’s proposals to cut subsidies to health insurers as part of the healthcare reform package could cost those companies as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana and United Health, two of the biggest beneficiaries of such subsidies, lost 5.7 per cent to $25.46 and 2.5 per cent to $20.54 respectively.But other areas of the market held up well, with signs that consumer spending was strengthening.Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry mobile phone, stunned the market with its quarterly earnings, reporting a 26 per cent increase in net income as the company benefited from much better than expected consumer spending. The company’s shares jumped 20.8 per cent to $59.29 on the Nasdaq.The news fuelled hope that consumer spending might be rising in the technology sector overall and Apple gained 2.9 per cent to $115.99, while Dell rose 8.6 per cent to $10.32.The sector was boosted by reports that IBM’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems might be nearing completion, although for a lower price than at first thought.IBM’s shares rose 1.4 per cent to $102.22 and Sun gained 3.4 per cent to $8.49, moving towards the reported new offer of $9.55 per share.Google’s gains were limited, as Techcrunch, the website, reported the company might be in talks to buy Twitter, the microblogging service that has become the latest online craze. Google’s shares rose 2 per cent to $369.78.Micron Technology, the biggest US producer of computer memory chips, damped enthusiasm as it reported a quarterly loss with a lack of demand driving down prices. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $4.50.Qwest helped take the telecoms sector higher, as investors continued to respond to reports that it was considering selling its long-haul network. Its shares picked up 8.6 per cent to $3.91.Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 5.4 per cent to $20.17 after Sanford Bernstein said the drugmaker was less likely than others to be taken over in the industry’s latest bout of consolidation.Fellow drugmaker Gilead Sciences rose 5.1 per cent to $46.98 after it said trials of an experimental drug had shown it helped lower blood pressure.During the week a relaxation of mark-to-market accounting and global unity at the G20 helped stocks recover after suffering losses when the White House rejected GM’s restructuring plans, sparking fears the company might soon go into bankruptcy.But some commentators warned that the short-term rally was masking a deeper malaise. Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com, said: “This is a bear market rally. Mark-to-market is simply covering economic problems. Just because you rig the scale, doesn’t mean you have lost weight.”
114;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-03-05T01:20:02Z;WellPoint’s benefits business up for auction;;WellPoint, the second-largest US health insurer by revenue, has put its pharmacy benefits management business up for auction, say ­people familiar with the ­matter.A sale of WellPoint’s PBM business could be worth anywhere from less than $1bn to five times that amount, depending on the extent to which WellPoint and other insurers are willing to sign long-term customer contracts with any potential buyer, said one person close to the process.WellPoint, which has 35m medical members and provides insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand, says its PBM business, which includes ­NextRx, is the fourth-largest in the US.NextRx is a third-party administrator that processes prescription drug claims and helps establish drug prices and availability for more than 32m people who are insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield or other corporate and government employee health plans.The three dominant companies in prescription healthcare services – ExpressScripts, Medco and CVS Caremark – are independent, free-standing companies.Several others are embedded within managed care providers such as WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer.WellPoint paid 67.5m ­prescriptions in the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 5.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Its PBM business is likely to attract interest from CVS Caremark, Medco and ExpressScripts, and the sale process has been under way for months, according to people close to the matter.WellPoint did not have any immediate comment.Expectations have risen that insurers with in-house PBMs might consider selling them or spinning them off as the political and economic environment surrounding the healthcare industry grows more challenging.Shares of companies ranging from ceuticals groups to insurers were hit hard last week after the US government issued proposals to update Medicare payment rates and expand health coverage.The US administration’s plan to insure more Americans could reduce private insurers’ profits and spark new competition.The argument over whether insurers or big ceuticals companies should own PBM businesses, which administer their own products alongside their competitors’, raises questions about potential conflicts of interest.In the 1990s, drug companies such as Eli Lilly, which owned PCS Health, and Merck, which owned Medco, were scrutinised over whether their captive PBM businesses would be pressured to use their parent companies’ drugs.Eli Lilly sold PCS to Rite Aid in 1999 for $1.5bn, and Merck spun off Medco in 2003.WellPoint’s medical insurance enrolment dropped by 288,000 members, or 0.8 per cent, in the fourth quarter because of nationwide job losses.Even with a further increase in unemployment, WellPoint projected last week that adjusted earnings per share should increase 1-3 per cent in 2009 compared with 2008.A Wellpoint spokeswoman said the company does not comment on merger speculation, but noted the company expects further consolidation in the industry.
115;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-03-02T21:47:51Z;Dow falls below 6,800 as Wall Street tumbles;;US stocks nosedived in another grim Monday as shares were hit by bad news that brought equities to historic lows.The S&P and the Dow Jones both fell more than 4 per cent, bringing their losses for the year to more than 20 per cent, the measure for a bear market.The Dow traded below 6,800 points for the first time since October 1996 at 6,763.29, a fall of 4.2 per cent. The S&P briefly fell below 700 points and finished down 4.7 per cent at 700.82.Investors reacted to more bad news from some of the world’s biggest financial companies, with financial stocks and industrials leading the selling.AIG announced the biggest corporate loss in US history, while HSBC tapped the markets for the UK’s biggest corporate rights issue.AIG was one of the day’s best performing stocks, initially surging, but then falling back to finish unchanged at $0.42 after its results triggered a third government rescue plan in as many months. But the losses themselves stoked fears about the health of the financial system and the ongoing availability of liquidity.Joshua Raymond, market strategist at IG Index, said: “The stench of liquidity concerns remain entrenched in banking systems.”Fears about liquidity weighed heavily on Citigroup, which became one of the day’s biggest losers, down 20 per cent to $1.20.JPMorgan, which is underwriting HSBC’s cash call, fell 7.4 per cent to $21.16. Bank of America dropped 8.1 per cent to $3.63, while Wells Fargo lost 10.4 per cent to $10.84.Industrial stocks were significantly lower, hit by three rounds of bad news. New data showed construction had contracted by more than double analysts’ expectations for January. Consol Energy, one of the US’s biggest metallurgical coal producers, then announced it was to shut its Buchanan mine temporarily.Added to this, the oil price continued to slide, standing 10.6 per cent down at $40 a barrel by the close of the stock markets.Consol lost 4.7 per cent to $22.58, while Caterpillar fell 9.9 per cent to $22.17, and Deere & Co, the machinery maker, fell 9.7 per cent to $24.83.“The closure of the Buchanan mine is bad news for the entire industrials sector,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.GE, which last week cut its dividend for the first time since 1938, continued to drop. It finished 10.7 per cent down at $7.60, the first time the stock has been below $8 since 1994.Healthcare stocks fared little better as the market continued to react to President Obama’s healthcare policies, unveiled last week.The sector was down 4.2 per cent. Johnson & Johnson lost 4.2 per cent to $47.92. Humana and Unitedhealth, the two companies to benefit most from private involvement in Medicare, continued to lose ground, down 15.5 per cent to $20 and 11 per cent to $17.48 respectively. Humana has now lost nearly half its value since news of the budget began to leak last weekend.Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said: “The market continues to worry that there are going to be policies taken that will be even worse for healthcare stocks.”Further bad news came from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway group turned in the worst performance in its history, underlining the battered state of nearly all equities.In a letter to investors, Mr Buffett sounded a gloomy note for the economy in general, saying that it would be “in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond”.He added that “that does not tell us whether the stock market will rise or fall”.Dell initially rose after Thursday’s results were followed by an upgrade of the stock by Argus research. Shares in the company eventually closed down 1.2 per cent at $8.43, although that still made it a relatively good performer.The outperforming technology sector has helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the other two leading indices, and it closed 4 per cent lower at 1,371.91 points.
116;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-02-27T13:52:38Z;Wall Street anxious after Citi deal;;US stocks fell steeply to 13-year lows in early morning trade on Friday led by the banking sector after details were announced of a government plan to convert its preferred shares in the banking giant Citigroup and take its overall stake to 36 per cent.The market was also reacting to unexpectedly bad figures for the growth in US gross domestic product for the fourth quarter. GDP fell by 6.2 per cent on an annualised basis compared to estimates of 5.4 per cent.“Finally the GDP data have caught up to the severity of the recession and, unfortunately, we expect the first quarter report to show similar weakness to the fourth quarter. Alas, we are looking at what is almost certain to be the longest, and quite likely to be the deepest, recession of the post-war era,” wrote John Ryding of RDQ Economics.The S&P 500 index fell 2.2 per cent immediately after the opening bell to 735.69, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,058.55 and the Nasdaq was down 0.8 per cent at 1,380.23. This meanth the S&P was on course for its lowest close since 1996.Citigroup saw a third of its share price wiped out in the early morning, falling to $1.69. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 15.4 percent to $4.53 and JPMorgan, which lost 5.3 per cent to $22.28. The financial sector overall lost 6 per cent.Healthcare stocks regained some of their losses from the previous session based on the news that President Barack Obama’s budget would look to cut subsidies to health insurers and drug makers. Humana recovered to gain 2.7 per cent at $24.19, while Unitedhealth picked up 1.4 per cent on $19.89.Dell was one of Friday’s winners after it announced earnings that beat analysts predictions once certain costs had been stripped out. The company also announced it would look to make an extra billion dollars of savings as part of an ongoing cost cutting program. Its shares were up 1 per cent to $8.32.This falls looked like capping a turbulent week on Wall Street, where different sectors were pulled in opposite directions by announcements coming from Washington.Early in the week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise the country’s failing banks. His message was given an extra boost when President Barack Obama announced that as part of his budget he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bailouts.Their words had helped financial stocks pick up 10.1 per cent over the week, but those gains were likely to be pared on Friday following Citi’s announcement.But healthcare was the other major element of Mr Obama’s speech, and his plan to cut subsidies to the health insurance and drugmaking sectors triggered a sharp downturn in those stocks on Thursday.European stocks were down ahead of the open on Wall Street as the news from President Barack Obama’s budget that the government would cut subsidies to drugmakers filtered through to take its toll on pharmaceutical stocks. The FTSE Eurofirst 100 index was 3.2 per cent down at 1,526.66. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 1.5 per cent rise in the Nikkei 225 as the yen’s weakness benefited shares.Bond yields were down.

117;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2009-02-26T21:48:41Z;Wall Street pulled lower by healthcare sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after a bright start was wiped out by the news that President Barack Obama intends to cut subsidies in the healthcare sector as part of his reform plan.Health stocks promptly dropped, losing 5.1 per cent overall.Humana, a big beneficiary of government support in making healthcare plans for the elderly, fell 19.5 per cent to $23.64.UnitedHealth, which Mr Obama plans to make bid for a new style of insurance plan along with Humana and WellPoint, fell 12.9 per cent to $20.07. Coventry Health also lost out, tumbling 14.4 per cent to $11.88.“Traders realise that the changes may begin to squeeze healthcare companies either through lowered premiums or decreased subsidies from the government,” wrote Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The Obama administration’s plans also spelt bad news for the defence sector, as it vowed to end overspending and schedule delays in the US weapons program.Shares in Boeing fell 3.5 per cent to $32.71 while Northrop lost 2.9 per cent to $39.42 and General Dynamics was off 1.9 per cent to $45.68.The major falls from these sectors cancelled out the gains made by banks, which rallied as the administration also announced plans to set aside an additional $250bn for future bail-out funds.Bank of America was a winner, up 3.1 per cent to $5.32 and was helped by news that it was looking to sell First Republic Bank, a private bank inherited from Merrill Lynch.The rally included JPMorgan, which climbed 6.1 per cent to $23.05 on the day of its investor conference. The bank expected to open 120 new retail branches and projected a total of 12,000 job cuts resulting from the merger with Washington Mutual.Wells Fargo was another strong performer, rising 7.1 per cent to $14.40. Among several regional banks to enjoy strong gains, Fifth Third also did well, up 18 per cent at $2.29.The S&P financial index reflected the advances made by banks and was the strongest performing sector, up 2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 752.83 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2 per cent at 7,182.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.4 per cent at 1,391.47 points.“There is a strong belief among the financial community that the centre of power has moved from New York to Washington,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equities strategist at Citigroup. “That is why the market moves on what the president says.”Stocks had rallied earlier in the day in spite of worse-than-expected economic data that showed continuing unemployment benefits passed the landmark 5m mark to a hit a fresh record..“The data is only going to get worse, and the figures on job losses are going to be very severe later this week,” said Mr Levkovich.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets wrote that the data would “do nothing to support serious follow through in better risk appetite today, even though the focus for the moment is very much on banks”.Consumer staples also performed badly, dragged down by Safeway, the grocery chain. Safeway shed 13 per cent to $18.37 after sales came in $400m less than analyst estimates. The sector as a whole fell 2.3 per cent.Several department stores rallied initially after Sears reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would be closing an additional 24 stores to cut costs.But the stocks fell again towards the close. Sears eased 0.8 per cent to $35.54. Kohl’s lost 1.6 per cent to $34.70 and JC Penney dropped 1.7 per cent to $15.43.Energy stocks fared well early in the day as crude oil continued to rise, hitting $45 at one point during early trade. The sector climbed in early trade but succumbed late in the day to finish just below the previous session’s level.Elsewhere, IBM bucked the general downward trend in the technology sector when it reaffirmed its full-year proft outlook and forecast a profit in its business services division.This came just a week after peer Hewlett-Packard cut its full-year outlook. IBM’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $88.97 in afternoon trade, while HP also saw some benefit, rising 0.4 per cent to $30.24.
118;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;MediScare;;"What one president giveth, the other taketh away, but health insurers didn’t expect the Obama administration to ruin their financial bonanza quite so soon. Private involvement in Medicare, the health insurance programme for the elderly and disabled, flourished under a Bush White House but was expected to be politically vulnerable under Mr Obama. Investors thought this was priced in, but a surprisingly paltry 0.5 per cent increase in proposed government payments next fiscal year hit the sector on Monday. Shares of Humana, the insurer most exposed to private Medicare coverage, lost a quarter of their value; UnitedHealth, the largest provider, fell 15 per cent.Politically unable to revoke private coverage, its opponents in Washington may seek to starve the business model and save money in the process. One potent criticism of private coverage is that, while patients can receive better value for money, the government’s overall cost per patient is higher. This comes at a time when the future solvency of Medicare is in doubt. Federal Medicare spending was 13 per cent of the overall $3,000bn budget last year and, as a wave of baby boomers enters the system, is expected to almost double by 2030.Still, the market seems to have overreacted as insurer valuations now assume flat or falling earnings. They can compensate partially for measly reimbursements by raising private premiums and trimming payments. Costs and a weak economy will force some elderly people back to traditional Medicare, but the services are popular. Enrolment in private plans grew to over 10m people last year, from about 5m in 2003, and demographic trends remain favourable as the baby boomers become eligible in 2011. There are also 35m Medicare recipients still not in private plans. While the Democrats have fired a frightening first shot against insurers, the industry has a foothold that will be difficult to dislodge.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

119;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-10-30T20:55:02Z;Unhealthy insurers;;US health insurers, already feeling unwell at the prospect of a Barack Obama presidency, had their condition further downgraded this past week as the financial crisis hit earnings. While the patient has suffered a bit of a shock, the prognosis is better than the average 61 per cent drop over the past year in the shares of six leading managed-care companies would suggest.The average prospective earnings multiple of Aetna, Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Coventry Health Care of 5.4 times is pricing in an iron-fisted approach to healthcare reform under a Democratic White House and possibly a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But the reality may be closer to a velvet glove – or perhaps a latex one.Take both Mr Obama and John McCain’s proposals to push for more widespread generic drug usage, or Mr Obama’s more substantial plan that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceuticals companies. These are bad for drug manufacturers, but on balance good for insurers, who are sensitive to such costs. Or how about Mr Obama’s plan to fine employers not offering health insurance and another that would force people to insure their children? These could add more than 30m new customers.Of course, some of Mr Obama’s proposals are clearly negative for insurers’ earnings, while some of Mr McCain’s would be a boon. Mr Obama might force insurers to cover those with pre-existing ailments, while Mr McCain would let people shop for coverage in any state, undercutting expensive local mandates. In the event of a McCain victory, the sector would rally, and it has amply priced in a likely Democratic administration.As in past campaigns, lobbying will likely water down sweeping proposals. Some is already happening, as Democrats reportedly received twice the donations from the industry as Republicans, reversing the trend in recent presidential contests. Consider it a dose of preventive medicine.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

120;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-07-25T20:44:54Z;Data help US blue chips stay positive;;Wall Street stocks bounced back modestly on Friday as data on housing and manufacturing and consumer sentiment came in stronger than expected and investors focused on the positive in another mixed bag of earnings reports.According to the Commerce Department, new orders for durable goods rose unexpectedly in June and the data boosted industrial stocks.Terex and Northrop Grumman climbed 5.2 per cent to $49.17 and 2.7 per cent to $68.63, respectively, and the sector added 0.3 per cent. Still, gains were trimmed slightly by results from Burlington Northern Santa Fe. The railway company said second-quarter profit had fallen 19 per cent to $350m due to higher fuel costs and flooding in the Midwest, and the shares fell 0.7 per cent to $98.05.The housing market also offered a pleasant surprise, as sales of newly-constructed single-family homes fell only 0.6 per cent to a 530,000 annual pace – a smaller decline than expected.Homebuilders rose 2.2 per cent with a 4 per cent gain to $11.51 for Lennar helping to lead the way.Consumer-facing sectors rose as oil continued to pull back and a survey showed a surprise rebound in consumer confidence. Technology stocks were the strongest gainers, benefiting from some decent earnings news as well. Google added 3.4 per cent to $491.98, while Ebay gained 4.1 per cent to $25.40 and the sector advanced 1.6 per cent.Juniper Networks was the biggest winner in the sector after its second-quarter profits jumped 40 per cent and it lifted third-quarter forecasts. Juniper shares surged 17.7 per cent to $26.57.Energy also fared well thanks to Arch Coal which said second-quarter profit had tripled and the company raised its full-year forecast. Arch Coal rose 9.2 per cent to $55.64 while the sector added 1 per cent. Over the week, energy was the biggest loser, however, dipping 2.7 per cent as oil fell back. The benchmark S&P 500 pared early gains but was still ahead 0.4 per cent at 1,257.77 points at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 11,370.69 points and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,310.53 points.In recent days equity markets have been roiled by earnings news and other ructions in the financials. The sector jumped 6.6 per cent on Tuesday only to see fragile confidence crumble and suffer its biggest fall in eight years two days later.Those moves largely cancelled out each other, however, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent over the week. The index has now fallen for seven of the past eight weeks. The Dow dipped 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq added 1.2 per cent over the week. Financials edged down 0.1 per cent.Linda Duessel, an equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Last week we rallied sharply as investors sold energy stocks to cover shorts in financials. So the question is, now what are we going to do? Trading could be sloppy as we search for new leadership.”Friday produced some more bad news from the financials. Early gains were wiped out after data showed rising foreclosures, and S&P said it might cut certain of the ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The pair fell 3.9 per cent to $11.55 and 6.1 per cent to $8.27, respectively. The financial sector as a whole lost 0.6 per cent.Although somewhat obscured by the travails of the financials, earnings season kicked into high gear this week. After 226 company reports, earnings for the S&P 500 are down 24.6 per cent on average. Excluding financials, though, earnings grew by 9.3 per cent.Industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers over the week, adding 1.4 per cent. The healthcare sector gained ground, climbing 1.3 per cent over the week thanks to some solid results from the likes of Coventry Health Care and Unitedhealth Group.The pair added 10.7 per cent to $33.46 and 14.7 per cent to $27.45 over the week, respectively.
121;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;UnitedHealth cuts its forecast again;;"UnitedHealth, the US health insurer, on Wednesday slashed its earnings forecast for a second time this year, blaming “an intensely competitive commercial business environment”, as the company announced it had settled a class-action suit for more than $900m.The company said it had settled the suit, brought by two different pension funds – Calpers, the California public employees pension fund; and the Alaska Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry Pension Trust. The suits concerned UnitedHealth’s stock options practices, and the settlements will cost the company $912m.“This is a significant agreement that resolves a major issue before our company in a way that is in the best interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders,” said Thomas Strickland, UnitedHealth’s chief legal officer.“The settlement provides UnitedHealth Group with certainty and closure on this lawsuit, avoids potentially costly and protracted litigation and allows us to continue to focus on providing Americans with high-quality, affordable health care solutions.”The insurer said that full-year earnings per share for 2008 would now be between $2.95 and $3.05 per share, 15 per cent lower than it had forecast in April. It said company revenues for 2008 would be approximately $81bn. The profit forecast that UnitedHealth made in April was itself a downgrade of predictions it made at the start of the year. The company has now reduced its earnings forecast by approximately 25 per cent since the start of the year.“During the second quarter, our risk-based businesses produced a lower level of gross margin than expected,” said Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth’s chief executive.Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at CRT Capital Group, said she believed further earnings cuts may be on the way as the company struggles to cope with costs. “I’m very concerned,” she said.“I don’t think the steps they have taken or what they have announced today goes far enough to convince me that their turnround has traction,” she added.Ms Skolnick believes UnitedHealth has to slim down its membership by reducing the number of its members who are in poor health until the company has reached a more profitable core membership.Shares in UnitedHealth initially climbed by more than 6 per cent on the news, but lost most of their gains by midday in New York. The shares have lost more than half their value so far this year. UnitedHealth’s rivals, Humana, Aetna and Wellpoint, have faced similar difficulties, falling by between 30 and 50 per cent since January."
122;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-06-20T20:45:47Z;US stocks slide as oil prices rebound;;Wall Street stock markets slumped to three-month lows on Friday as oil prices rebounded, knocking consumer-facing stocks, while analyst and ratings downgrades for financials stoked fears that the credit crisis has further to play out.Oil moved as much as $4 higher on Friday, cutting short a rally in consumer-facing stocks. Dillards and Starbucks gave up 4.7 per cent to $13.10 and 4.2 per cent to $17.23.But carmakers were the biggest fallers after S&P, the credit rating agency, said it may cut auto makers ratings. Ford lost 8.1 per cent to $5.81, GM slid 6.8 per cent to $13.79 and the discretionary sector plunged 4 per cent.Technology shares also came under heavy selling pressure, with large caps leading the sector to a 2.5 per cent loss. Microsoft dropped 2.4 per cent to $28.25.In the background, the financials cut away at investor confidence. Moody’s became the last of the three major rating agencies to downgrade Ambac and MBIA, the embattled bond insurers, citing their limited ability to raise new capital and write new business.Ambac swung to a gain of 1 per cent at $2.05 in late trading but MBIA lost 13.3 per cent to $5.59.Banks were also in focus after analysts downgraded or cut their price targets for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wachovia among others, arguing that writedowns, volatile capital markets and mediocre fixed-income performance would damage earnings. Citigroup shares fell 4.8 per cent to $19.21, while Goldman Sachs and Wachovia dropped 1.7 per cent to $183.77 and 1.9 per cent to $17.43. The S&P 500 financials index dropped 2.6 per cent to its lowest level in five years.The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent lower at 1,317.85 on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 per cent at 11,841.95. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.3 per cent to 2,406.09.On Thursday, equity markets ended higher after a jittery session of trading, as oil prices dropped sharply, helping exporters, such as technology stocks, and consumer-facing stocks to advance.That strong run was the exception in a week marked by bad news from the financials, another batch of data showing considerable weakness in the US economy and elevated fears of inflation.The S&P 500 fell for a third straight week, losing 3.1 per cent as all 10 leading industrial sectors retreated. The S&P 500 is now down 5.9 per cent so far in June after making gains in April and May.As if to underline the bearish sentiment on Wall Street, short interest on the New York Stock Exchange jumped to an all-time high during the week. Financial stocks came under pressure from short-sellers.William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “We got decent earnings out of Goldman Sachs this week and that seemed to raise people’s spirits a bit. But we can’t seem to get out of the way of bad news . . . every day another bank needs to raise more capital.”On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets. Fifth was among the week’s biggest losers, dropping 23.2 per cent to $10.11. It was followed down by other regional banks as analysts questioned whether smaller, less capitalised institutions could withstand the credit crisis.Healthcare stocks were another weak point after Coventry Health Care cut its second-quarter and full-year forecasts. Coventry was the biggest faller on the S&P 500 dropping 26.4 per cent to $31.05 over the week, while peers UnitedHealth Group and Humana slumped 11.8 per cent to $27.12 and 10.7 per cent to $41.97.
123;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-03-27T09:34:17Z;Pay package polls;;Had shareholders been able to vote on compensation plans at UnitedHealth, Home Depot or Gillette, would those companies’ former chief executives be living in smaller mansions? Perhaps. Support is growing for “say-on-pay” rules to give US shareholders a non-binding vote on the propriety of executive pay schemes.Video rental chain Blockbuster, whose chief executive stepped down last year after a pay-related struggle with Carl Icahn, has just adopted a say-on-pay provision. Aflac and Verizon adopted similar plans last year. It is likely many US companies will agree to similar provisions unless Congress, which is already debating the issue, beats them to it by making such votes mandatory.Boardrooms worry it will give rabble-rousing activists too much power, emasculate compensation committees and make it tougher to hire and retain top executives. But the provision’s bark will probably be worse than its bite. That is the point.The mere existence of an advisory vote should serve as a deterrent to boards thinking of approving exorbitant compensation packages. For boards that adequately tie pay to performance, say-on-pay provisions should unearth minimal opposition. In the UK, where non-binding votes are largely required, proxy services have advised shareholders to oppose compensation plans at roughly one-tenth of all listed companies, according to Yale’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance.That may seem high to boards that have seen shareholders muscle their way into the corporate decision-making process in recent years. But how big a step would these provisions really represent? Activists have not exactly held their tongues over pay packages they feel are egregious. The issue may provide political fodder. But these provisions should prove problematic only for the very companies that really need to be hampered by them.Post and read comments on this Lex
124;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-02-21T21:14:55Z;LA launches action against health insurer;;The Los Angeles city attorney launched a wide-ranging legal action on Thursday against one of California’s biggest health insurance providers, accusing it of illegally selling policies to customers and then denying them coverage when they fell ill.The action is being launched as health insurers face closer scrutiny from US regulators and legislators. Health insurance has become one of the dominant themes of the presidential election, with Democratic challengers Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama promising to reform what they contend is a broken system.Rocky Delgadillo, the Los Angeles city attorney, accused Health Net of defrauding customers by setting illegal policy cancellation targets for its sales agents, who rarely possessed any medical training.Mr Delgadillo said 1,600 Health Net customers had policies cancelled illegally. Damages of $2,500 (€1,700, £1,275) per customer are being sought. But the final damages tally could be much higher if Health Net is also held responsible for illegally advertising its products to thousands more customers.The company is accused of “unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business acts and practices and deceptive advertising”. In addition, Mr Delgadillo said the company created a “secret unit” responsible for cancelling policies.More than $35m of claims for medical treatment had been denied, he said, adding that customers were often in a vulnerable position when they discovered they were not covered. “Just imagine …you’re in a hospital bed awaiting treatment and you find that Health Net will not provide the coverage you have paid for,” he said.Health Net said Mr Delgadillo had “drawn conclusions that aren’t supported by the facts”. Health Net paid out $200m in claims on individual policies that serve more than 135,000 consumers, he said. “We have substantive disagreements with the city attorney.”The legal action comes as Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, prepares to sue UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, over its billing procedures. “We believe there was an industry-wide scheme perpetuated by some of the nation’s largest health insurers to deceive and defraud consumers,’’ he said this week. UnitedHealth denies any wrongdoing.Mr Delgadillo said the Los Angeles investigation was unrelated to the New York probe. “They are separate investigations. However, my office is in contact with the New York attorney-general and we look forward to co-operating with each other.”
125;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2008-02-14T02:59:08Z;UnitedHealth faces fraud lawsuit;;Shares in UnitedHealth Group, the leading US healthcare operator, fell sharply on Wednesday after Andrew Cuomo, the New York state attorney-general, said he would sue the company for allegedly defrauding consumers by manipulating reimbursement rates.Following a six-month investigation, Mr Cuomo issued 16 subpoenas to the country’s largest health insurance companies and said he planned to sue United­Health and a clutch of its subsidiaries centred on Ingenix, the US’s largest provider of healthcare billing information.He alleged that Ingenix deliberately under-estimated the costs to customers of visits to doctors who were not part of their insurers’ networks, leaving them to pay a higher-than-reasonable share of the bill.The move marks a fresh blow for UnitedHealth, following a $468m settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of last year by William McGuire, chief executive, after allegations he had back-dated stock options.It signals the latest escalation in efforts by Mr Cuomo to probe the healthcare industry, including an investigation he opened last month into allegations that the pharmaceuticals companies Merck and Schering-Plough deliberately concealed disappointing clinical trial data on their jointly developed drug Vytorin.The latest announcement comes at a time when the rising costs of healthcare, and concerns over the lack of universal coverage, have become central issues in the US presidential campaign.“When insurers like United create convoluted and dishonest systems for determining the rate of reimbursement, real people get stuck with excessive bills and are less likely to seek the care they need,” said Mr Cuomo. He accused Ingenix of operating “a defective and manipulated database” used by most of the major health insurance companies to determine reimbursement on medical expenses outside their own networks.Mr Cuomo has issued subpoenas in the latest probe against insurers including Aetna, Cigna and Empire BlueCross BlueShield, and said he would file suit against UnitedHealth Group as well as its subsidiaries United HealthCare Insurance Company of New York, United Healthcare of New York, United Healthcare Services and Ingenix.UHC said in a statement: “We are in the midst of on-going discussions with the attorney-general’s office and we will continue to co-operate fully.”
126;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;NHS gives American chief ‘eye-watering deal’;;The Department of Health is paying more than £100,000 a year towards housing the American who heads its commercial directorate – on top of a salary of at least £185,000, a civil service pension, two business class flights a year to the US, a relocation package of up to £35,000 and eligibility for a bonus.The package was yesterday described as “an eye-watering deal” by Stephen O’Brien, Conservative health spokesman, who asked whether it offered value for money for the taxpayer.Chan Wheeler, the health department’s commercial director, is a former senior executive with UnitedHealth Group who earned an average of almost $1.4m (£700,000) in his last three years as the head of its Uniprise division, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.He also made $8m from the sale of stock options, according to the filings. He has been named in a civil action in the US by public sector unions seeking $5.5m in damages over backdated stock options that he received from UnitedHealth.His ultimate boss at UnitedHealth, William McGuire, then chairman, recently paid $600m to settle an action by the SEC over backdated options similar to those that, according to court documents, Mr Wheeler received.Mr Wheeler has said that he has “never been the subject or target of any investigation” by the SEC.Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary, whose parliamentary questions revealed Mr Wheeler’s remuneration, described it as “a bit much when everybody else in the health service is being subjected to pay restraint”.He hit out at the £8,400-a-month housing allowance – understood to be spent on a three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, central London. Many people were finding house prices out of reach, Mr Dobson said, and “we seem to be helping that by making accommodation for the American commercial director of the NHS free.”The health department declined to justify the deal in detail, but said Mr Wheeler had extensive expertise in commissioning healthcare in the US and had “been doing an excellent job improving healthcare for the people of Britain.“He has been willing to take tough decisions, including recently paring down the number of independent treatment centres where they didn’t provide the NHS with value for money.”Mr O’Brien, however, took a different view. He said Mr Wheeler was being paid such sums despite having played a significant part in policy changes that have reduced the amount of care the NHS is to buy from the private sector from an original £6bn-£7bn over five years to £2bn or less – meaning that his empire was shrinking.Mr Wheeler told the Financial Times recently that his 200-strong staff was likely to be reduced to a core of 50 as primary care trusts took over the responsibility for commissioning private care for NHS patients.Mr O’Brien said: “He is being paid an ex-pat’s package but getting the advantage of a civil service pension. And the £100,000-a-year in accommodation costs would cover the salaries of four nurses. It looks like the worst of both worlds for the taxpayer.”
127;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:06:37+0000;Wall St down despite rally in financials;;US stocks rebounded from their worst levels on Tuesday, but a Federal Reserve’ rate cut, just a week before its official January meeting starts, failed to arrest pessimism about the US economy and corporate earnings.About an hour before the opening, policymakers announced a rate cut of 75 basis points, slicing the Fed funds rate to 3.5 per cent. Initially, the move caused S&P stock futures to jump, but the market opened sharply lower.“The Fed did what they had to do, but it is only part of the solution and more rate cuts are likely,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading.After being closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday, stocks extended their big losses from last week and have now fallen for the past five days.Traders said an avalanche of sell orders had overwhelmed the stimulus of the Fed’s rate cut.After the S&P 500 initially fell 3.8 per cent, it then pared losses in choppy trade, led by a strong rally in financials, but the benchmark could not turn positive.At the close of trade the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent at 1,310.50 and has now fallen nearly 11 per cent this month.Equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, surged 38 per cent to 37.57 and eclipsed the peak set in August when credit and mortgage problems took their toll on the banking sector and the broad market. The Vix closed up 14.2 per cent at 31.04.The rate cuts and the prospect of more to come sparked a rebound in financial shares, with the S&P sector up 2.2 per cent, although it remains lower by about 11 per cent since the start of the year.Apart from financials and consumer discretionary, up 1.3 per cent, the rest of the big sectors in the S&P were lower, led by a 3.4 per cent fall in utilities and a 3.2 per cent slide in healthcare stocks, which had been a refuge from selling pressure in recent weeks.The S&P technology sector fell 3.1 per cent and is down more than 20 per cent from its high of October, meeting the definition of a bear market.The Nasdaq Composite closed 2 per cent lower at 2,292.27, and has fallen nearly 20 per cent from its high of last year.Shares in Ebay fell 4.2 per cent to $27.13 after a report said Meg Whitman, the auctioneer’s chief executive, was preparing to retire.The mood in tech was hurt further after the closing bell when Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but lowered its outlook. The stock fell more than 10 per cent in post-market trade.In spite of the sharp falls, some analysts said the time for the strategic buying of selected stocks loomed.“It makes sense for investors to consider increasing their exposure to equities into the sell-off, gingerly or aggressively, depending on their investment horizon,” said Thomas McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The question is recession and people are using the term loosely.” He added: “Bond yields have been low for some time, while rate cuts and fiscal stimulus from the government will probably propel a strong rebound in the economy during the second half of 2008.” Mr Pado said large-cap and growth stocks with exposure to the global economy should be favoured by investors at this time.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.1 per cent at 11,971.19. Several blue chips announce their fourth-quarter results this week, led by Microsoft, AT&T, Caterpillar and Honeywell. Investors hope that positive results will help arrest the selling pressure on stocks.Among the financials in the news was Bank of America after it said fourth-quarter net income fell to $268m as it reported trading losses of $5.44bn due in part to writedowns of collateralised debt obligations. After an early fall to $33.12, the stock rose 4 per cent to $37.41.Wachovia reported a 98 per cent fall in earnings as it wrote down $1.7bn and set aside $1.5bn to cover bad loans. The stock also re-bounded from negative territory and gained 3.9 per cent to $31.99.Ambac reported a loss of $3.26bn after taking a $5.21bn writedown.Fitch Ratings cut the bond insurer to AA last week, a move that has sparked concerns that other financial institutions, which have used the insurer to cover positions, will mark down their portfolios. The stock rallied 27.1 per cent amid hopes it will receive a capital injection.Shares in Dupont were up 0.4 per cent lower at $42.85, after the chemicals maker posted a quarerlly earings fall of 37 per cent from a year ago, when one-time items boosted results. Excluding those items, profit rose sharply buoyed by international sales.UnitedHealth said quarterly earnings rose 3 per cent and it was 5.9 per cent lower at $51.22.In other earnings, Johnson and Johnson said quarterly profits had risen 10 per cent, as the weak dollar boosted sales by 11 per cent. The stock fell 1.5 per cent to $65.27.
128;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-12-07T21:19:16Z;UnitedHealth payback;;William McGuire was one of the best-paid executives in the US. He now has the dubious honour of being the first to surrender part of his huge compensation under Sarbanes-Oxley’s “clawback” provision – which allows for the recovery of allegedly ill-gotten compensation gains.Dr McGuire will pay back an eye-popping $600m to settle claims that he defrauded UnitedHealth’s shareholders by secretly backdating stock options while chief executive. UnitedHealth’s current chief executive, former general counsel and other executives will pay back $305m.More than 100 other companies have faced scrutiny over options backdating. But because of its sheer magnitude, the UnitedHealth settlement is a supernova event for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other clawback wins of this size are unlikely. But, by shifting options backdating claims out of the realm of “Monopoly money” and into real life, the deal sets an important precedent.UnitedHealth’s revenue grew from $400m to more than $71bn during Dr McGuire’s tenure, and the company’s share price vastly outperformed the S&P 500. He was handsomely compensated for that success. And in contrast to the former Comverse Technology chief who fled the country, Dr McGuire faced his critics. After giving back more than he allegedly gained through backdating, he will still keep options valued at more than $800m. Dr McGuire will not, in other words, be suffering in retirement.By in effect activating Sarbox’s clawback provision, the settlements may spur other shareholder committees to extend their talons in search of reimbursement for backdated options. Companies have long whinged about the onerous requirements imposed on them after the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. But here, at least, is an instance where Sarbox seems to have done exactly what it is meant to in protecting shareholders. For once, executives will find it tough to complain and expect any sympathy.
129;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-12-07T03:16:57Z;Ex-UnitedHealth CEO gives back $600m;;Dr William McGuire, former chief executive of insurer UnitedHealth Group, will pay back more than $600m in compensation in the first individual “clawback” settlement under the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-fraud law.The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, said on Thursday that Dr McGuire had agreed to settle allegations that he backdated options to boost his compensation from 1994-2005.Under a settlement with the SEC, Dr McGuire is to pay a $7m fine and return approximately $461m to UnitedHealth.His settlement with the company means that he will return stock options and other compensation with a total value of more than $600m. Dr McGuire is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. He did not admit or deny wrongdoing.“The magnitude of the amount speaks for itself,” said Joseph Grundfest, professor of law and business at Stanford, who described the settlement as a landmark. “With regard to the precedent, it is very important to note that the commission is here for the first time using the claw-back provision under Sarbanes-Oxley to recover a very significant amount from a former executive,” he said.Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of SEC enforcement, said: “The $468m settlement in this case, including the largest penalty assessed against an individual in an options backdating case, reflects the magnitude and scope of Dr McGuire’s misconduct.”The scandal at UnitedHealth led to his ousting in October last year, after a company-commissioned investigation. Dr McGuire had amassed almost $2bn in compensation, while building UnitedHealth into a dominant health insurer.According to allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Dr McGuire “picked grant dates for UnitedHealth options that coincided with dates of historically low” stock prices in the quarter.It said he “signed and approved backdated documents falsely indicating that the options had actually been granted on these earlier dates.”It added that the company submitted SEC filings that “McGuire knew, or was reckless in not knowing, contained false and misleading statements”.A spokesman for Dr McGuire said the settlement ends civil derivative litigation and company claims against him. However, there is still a federal criminal investigation and another plaintiffs lawsuit pending.UnitedHealth also settled with two other former officers, including $30m relinquished by David Lubben, ex-general counsel.
130;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-10-04T22:07:46Z;Backing for private sector’s NHS role;;"The private sector has a role in the National Health Service, Alan Johnson, the health secretary, said on Thursday as the government offered the clearest indication yet that it remained committed to at least a degree of choice and competition to improve care.After months of mixed signals to both the private sector and the NHS itself, the health secretary said the independent sector would have a role in providing 150 new health centres and 100 new GP practices that were announced on Thursday.Their introduction, along with a pledge that all patients needing non-emergency operations would be screened for the MRSA superbug next year, followed recommendations by Lord Darzi in his interim report on his “next stage” NHS review.With his report launched by the prime minister, Lord Darzi called for the introduction of new providers to help develop more flexible GP opening hours, while adding that “patient choice should be embedded within the full spectrum of NHS funded care”, covering primary care and long-term conditions as well as elective operations.Asked if he was committed to that, Mr Johnson said: “Yes, there is a role for the private sector here, and there is a role for it in the rest of the NHS. But it is about patient care first.”Evidence of that will come today when the Department of Health finally announces the winners of a framework contract intended to make it easier for primary care trusts to buy in private sector help with the commissioning of care.The 14 contractors include four big US health insurers and care managers, Aetna, Humana, Health Dialog Services and UnitedHealth, as well as UK health specialists such as Bupa, Axa PPP and Tribal and the consulting firms KPMG and McKinsey.The department is also to advertise for additional private suppliers for NHS operations and diagnostics ahead of the introduction of “free choice” for waiting list operations from April.Under that patients will be able to choose any approved hospital in the country prepared to treat them at NHS prices.How big a role all that will mean for the private sector will depend on patient choice; on how far primary care trusts take advantage of the new commissioning contract; and on how energetically they seek out private providers to challenge existing GP services. But after months of uncertainty there appears to be at least greater clarity on the independent sector’s role, even if Gordon Brown and Mr Johnson avoided any public reference to it in their launch of Lord Darzi’s report.The costing of initiatives to tackle healthcare infections and to create the new health centres, along with 100 new practices in under-doctored areas – likely to add up to tens of millions of pounds a year – would have to await the announcement of the comprehensive spending review next week, Mr Johnson said.The Conservatives claimed the real aim of Lord Darzi’s report was to downgrade local services, arguing that he was “a trusted clinician who is being used by Gordon Brown”."
131;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-08-21T22:40:52Z;Delta names Anderson as new chief;;Delta Air Lines named Richard Anderson, a former head of rival Northwest Airlines, as its new chief executive.Mr Anderson is currently an executive vice-president at UnitedHealth and joined the Delta board in March, just before the carrier emerged from 17 months of bankruptcy protection.Gerald Grinstein announced his intention to stand down as Delta’s chairman and chief executive after restructuring the third-largest US carrier through labour concessions and a strategy that saw it focus on more international flying.Mr Anderson fought off competition from Jim Whitehurst, Delta’s chief operating officer, and Ed Bastian, chief financial officer. Mr Bastian now also assumes the post of president.His choice over two internal candidates and background at Northwest, which has one of the most troubled labour relations records in the industry, is expected to raise questions over Delta’s ability to retain the confidence of employees at a time when industrial relations across the sector are at a low ebb.Mr Anderson, a former Texas prosecutor, arrived at Northwest and was chief for three and a half years before departing for UnitedHealth in October 2004, a decision driven in part by the carrier’s poor outlook and the financial rewards outside the sector.Some US carriers remain beset by employee aggravation over executive compensation but Delta, Northwest and others have seen managers leave the sector in search of better compensation.Mr Anderson is one of the few – Tom Horton, American Airlines chief financial officer, being another notable example – to return to the industry.His tenure as Northwest’s chief was viewed as mixed, though his departure was still seen as a surprise after focusing on cost-cutting and protecting Northwest’s core business in its US heartland.However, his restructuring efforts did not prevent the airline filing for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta in September 2005.The two airlines flirted with a possible merger during their bankruptcy reorganisation and, while Mr Anderson’s arrival is likely to spark further speculation, most observers do not expect any of the leading carriers to combine during the current cycle, in part because of antitrust concerns.Delta has returned to profitability after running up $10bn in losses during the preceding five years but its restructuring has seen it emerge with one of the lowest cost structures in the industry.The decision to appoint an external candidate will also trigger speculation about the future of Mr Whitehurst, who has been linked by some observers with the soon-to-be vacant chief position at Virgin America.
132;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-08-06T20:57:27Z;US investors scoop up financials;;Wall Street rebounded strongly on Monday, and in volatile trade the financials sector staged a stunning turnaround ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday.The S&P 500 index rose 2.4 per cent to close at 1,467.67. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.4 per cent to 2,547.33 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2 per cent to close at 13,468.78.As stocks rallied, equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, retreated from a new high for the year. The Vix closed nearly 9 per cent lower at 22.93, but had earlier traded at a peak of 26.47, its highest reading since April 2003. The index has risen from a reading of below 10 earlier this year.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies pared early weakness and rose 1.5 per cent to 766.35. Earlier in the day, the benchmark fell to its lowest level since October 2006. The prospect of less deal activity and tighter credit conditions has hurt small stocks and the Russell 2000 remains 2.7 per cent lower so far this year.Financials were lower in early trade on Monday, and then rallied strongly, led by mortgage giants Fannie Mae up 10.4 per cent at $62.50, and Freddie Mac, up 7.7 per cent at $60.Talk that the government sponsored enterprises might be allowed to expand their mortgage balance sheets boosted their stock prices.Analysts also said the sharp decline in the price of mortgage securities in recent weeks should entail higher profits for the GSE’s as their cost of funding has not risen sharply.The rebound in financials was reflected in the S&P Investment Bank Index surging 5 per cent. That trimmed its decline for 2007 to 13.1 per cent. The broader S&P financials index rallied 4.7 per cent, but is still down 8.7 per cent for the year.A debate over whether tightening conditions in the credit market and weak financials would harm the broad economy remained the main topic for investors.“Many investors believe that the weakness in financials is signalling the beginning of a bear market,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “The capital markets-sensitive diversified financials industry group is a coincident indicator, not a lead indicator,” Mr Levkovich added.In recent weeks, cyclical stocks have also fallen in line with the general retreat in financials. This suggests worries that the economy may suffer from tighter credit conditions are building, analysts warned.Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged.Some economists say the Fed may acknowledge the recent turmoil in financial markets, but also maintain a tough stand on inflation.It is a stance that lessens the chance of any near-term easing in policy, but amid the present credit market turmoil, the odds of a quarter percentage point easing at the FOMC’s meeting in October have risen to around 80 per cent.“The consensus is for a less hawkish stance on inflation pressures with an acknowledgment of the recent turmoil in the financial markets,” said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The wildcard is how the FOMC skews the balance of risks and if they highlight any downside risks to growth from the credit/mortgage situation.”Other financial stocks sharply higher on Monday included Wells Fargo, which rose 5.9 per cent to close at $34.76, as the bank announced it would buy back an additional 50m shares. Merrill Lynch gained 6.4 per cent to $74.55 after an analyst upgrade.Also in the spotlight was Bear Stearns, which closed up 5 per cent at $113.81. The stock recovered from a 7.9 per cent decline to $99.75 earlier on Monday. Warren Spector resigned as co-president of Bear Stearns on Sunday, after S&P placed the brokerage on negative rating watch late last week.Other financials that reversed early declines on Monday included Lehman Brothers, which closed up 4.5 per cent at $58.27, after setting a low of $52.63. Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, rallied 7 per cent to $26.75.Monday’s rebound in the S&P leaves the benchmark around 5.5 per cent below its record close of 1,553.08, set in mid-July. Traders say a fall in the region of 10 per cent has in the past helped clear speculative excesses from a bull market and sowed the seeds for a renewed rally that ultimately propels the market to new highs.The jitters over credit and financials have overshadowed second-quarter earnings that have so far beaten estimates.“Equity markets have been unable to shake off the liquidity fears that are now prevalent and dominant,” said Mr Levkovich.According to Thomson Financial, 409 of the S&P 500 companies have reported results so far and 66 per cent of them have exceeded estimates. The annual growth in earnings for the second quarter is 7 per cent, above a 4.1 per cent estimate at the start of July.Among other stocks in the news on Monday, UnitedHealth was up 2.1 per cent at $48.50 after the health insurer raised its earnings forecast for 2007.Cooper Tire & Rubber rose 5.1 per cent to $22.25, after the tyre maker swung to a second-quarter profit, beating expectations.
133;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
134;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-04-29T21:05:38Z;US health executive offered top NHS role;;An American executive with a lifetime’s experience of paying for care in the US health system has been offered the job of commercial director at the Department of Health, overseeing the purchase of care for NHS patients.But the appointment of R. Channing Wheeler, who is in the final stage of negotiations ahead of an expected announcement this week, is likely to be controversial as he has been caught up in the scandal of backdated stock options in the US.The appointment of a US big-hitter with extensive healthcare purchasing experience is seen within the department as a clear signal of its continued commitment to market-based reforms and to the use of the private sector to treat and commission care for NHS patients.His selection has been approved by Tony Blair, the prime minister, from a short list that included other experienced US candidates.The department has been encouraged by their apparent belief that there is a job worth doing in the NHS.Mr Wheeler, 55, was an executive vice-president of UnitedHealth Group, which is still being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged granting of backdated share options.The scandal has brought down William McGuire, the former longstanding chairman and chief executive of UnitedHealth, one of the largest US managed-care providers.Mr McGuire resigned after it was discovered that he and other executives had repeatedly received stock options, meant to incentivise future performance, that were granted at or near the lowest point of the share price in each year they received them.Mr Wheeler, who until 2004 was chief executive of Uniprise, the UnitedHealth subsidiary that deals with some of the biggest US companies, is alleged to have received grants of more than 409,000 options on similar dates to Mr McGuire between 1998 and 2002, according to court papers filed in the US.A civil action has been filed by public sector union shareholders in UnitedHealth seeking $5.5m in damages from him over the share options.The UK’s health department is understood to have done due diligence on the appointment and accepted that Mr Wheeler was unaware at the time that the way the options were granted was questionable.Mr Wheeler held executive positions with US health plans, while running UnitedHealth’s north-east region, before becoming chief executive of Uniprise in 1998. and 2004.Karen Jennings, head of health for Unison, said: “The American health system is riddled with fraud and we must protect our NHS from that sort of corruption.“UnitedHealth is trying to infiltrate the NHS, and it is worrying that someone from that organisation is being favoured over an NHS or civil service appointee.”Mr Wheeler did not return calls to his listed home address.
135;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-04-13T18:11:33Z;Cantor Fitzgerald appoints ethics chief;;Cantor Fitzgerald, the brokerage firm, has appointed a chief ethics officer in what the firm said was an effort to reaffirm its “strong commitment to business ethics and integrity”.The move follows recent criticism by activist shareholders of the group’s governance and the upholding of a court ruling in which a judge said Cantor had made deceptive statements.While compliance officers have a high profile on Wall Street, ethics officers are less prominent. In the corporate world at large, recent appointments at US companies have tended to follow apparent lapses. For example, UnitedHealth upgraded its chief ethics officer position in the wake of its options backdating problems.Cantor said it had appointed Paul Pion, a senior managing director who joined the firm in 2002, to the new post. Mr Pion will report directly to Howard Lutnick, chief executive of both Cantor and its electronic broking affiliate eSpeed, and Lee Amaitis, co-chief executive of BGC Partners, the voice brokerage operation that Cantor is planning to float on Nasdaq.Roy Snell, chief executive of the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics, said the role of an ethics officer was less clear-cut than that of a compliance chief, but that the intention was to make it easier for ethical problems to be addressed. “It’s not often we don’t know right from wrong,” he said. “It is that we are unable to step up – we don’t have the guts or someone is preventing us.”The world of inter-dealer broking is known for its rough-and-tumble rivalry. One example was a patent infringement case eSpeed brought against rival inter-dealer broker Icap.The US Court of Appeals recently upheld a ruling last year from the Federal Circuit in Washington that threw out the case. In the ruling, circuit judge Kimberley Moore said Cantor had made materially false statements and these had been “submitted with an intent to deceive”.Meanwhile, two activist hedge funds have built up stakes in eSpeed and demanded changes in its share structure. Last month WC Capital joined Chapman Capitalin demanding eSpeed convert its class B shares to class A.
136;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-03-15T00:02:54Z;HP shareholders deal blow to proxy campaign;;Efforts to increase shareholder control over US company boards were dealt a setback on Wednesday after Hewlett-Packard shareholders rejected a proposal that would have allowed stockholders to nominate directors directly through the company’s proxy documents.Just 39 per cent of HP shareholders voted for the measure, far short of the two-thirds of votes required for it to pass.The rejection of the stockholder proposal marks a setback for some of the biggest US pension plans, including the California Public Employees Retirement System, which had supported the measure.The HP vote was an early test case in what promises to be a lively season for stockholder meetings, as shareholders throughout the US weigh other proxy access proposals at companies such as UnitedHealth and Reliant Energy.Ahead of the vote, Mark Hurd, HP’s chairman and chief executive, urged stockholders to reject the proposal, arguing that it could lead to the appointment of directors who represented the interests of only a narrow cross-section of investors.HP had also argued that the plan could lead to expensive proxy fights over board nominees, and that it would discourage people from serving on the company’s board.HP said it was “pleased” that the proxy access proposal had failed. “The board believe this proposal was not in the best interests of HP stockholders,” the company said.Proxies are documents sent to shareholders by companies each year that contain proposals to be voted on at annual meetings. While some shareholders choose to cast their votes in person at shareholder meetings, most, including nearly all big institutional investors, cast their votes by proxy.The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities regulator, had long blocked shareholder access to proxy documents. That policy was reversed last year after a US appeals court supported a challenge to the rule by the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, a big institutional shareholder.Scott Adams of AFSCME, who spoke at the HP meeting in favour of giving shareholders proxy access, said the fact that 39 per cent of shareholders had voted for the measure had sent a “tremendous message”.“For 39 per cent of shareholders to say we want access to the ballot is a very strong message,” he said. “It is now in the SEC’s court to standardize the rules to give shareholders access to proxy ballots.”HP emerged as a target for governance reform last year after the company revealed that operatives working on behalf of the HP board had spied on board members, HP employees, journalists and their families to uncover the source of a boardroom leak.The scandal forced the resignation of Patricia Dunn, HP’s former chairman, and several other top officials. Ms Dunn and three others yesterday had felony charges over the scandal dismissed.Although HP managed to fend off the proxy access proposal, shareholders applauded the approval of two other measures that HP had opposed.One, a proposal to submit any future poison pill anti-takeover measure to a vote of shareholders, was approved by 72 per cent of stockholders who cast votes.An initiative to more tightly link executive pay to company performance passed by a vote of 53 per cent in favour to 45 per cent against, reflecting investor frustration at the large pay packages awarded to Mr Hurd when he joined HP, as well as the multi-million dollar severance package handed to his predecessor, Carly Fiorina, when she left the company two years ago.HP said it was disappointed the two measures had passed, but agreed to review its policies.Shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced the company to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. Mr Hurd assumed the role of chairman in addition to his CEO duties after Ms Dunn resigned in September.HP’s shares have nearly doubled in value since Mr Hurd took over as chief executive in 2005. They rose 0.6 per cent on Wednesday to $39.79 ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting.
137;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2007-03-12T21:48:46Z;US stocks up on M&A activity;;Wall Street rallied on Monday as a burst of merger and acquisition activity offset anxiety about a stronger yen and the suspension of trading in shares of a big subprime mortgage lender.Fears about the implications of New Century Financial’s slide towards bankruptcy dragged down other mortgage lenders and homebuilders.But investment banking and brokerage groups staged a sharp recovery in the afternoon to recoup their early losses and help lift the big market indices into positive territory. Shares in Goldman Sachs, which releases its results on Tuesday, recovered from a low of $198.86 to close 0.5 per cent up at $202.60.Intel helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.3 per cent to 12,318.62 by mid-afternoon, and the Nasdaq Composite gain 0.6 per cent to 2,402.72. Intel stock was 2.4 per cent higher at $19.48 on signs of better demand for computer-chips.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,406.60.Trading in New Century stock was suspended after the troubled lender said it could not meet its creditors’ demands to repurchase defaulting mortgages. Its shares plunged 48 per cent to $1.66 in electronic trading ahead of Monday’s opening, and were no longer quoted by the time the market opened. New Century stock was trading at more than $30 a month ago. Shares in rival lender NovaStar fell 19 per cent to $4.50.“The subprime sector alone is not the issue,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The concern is that this problem spreads – and that is a big if.”Countrywide admitted on Monday that its earnings may be more volatile this year because of problems in the subprime market. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $35.14.The mortgage worries also hit shares in homebuilders, with DR Horton down 5.1 per cent to $23.17.In deal news, Schering-Plough fell 0.4 per cent to $23.95 after it said it would buy Organon BioSciences, the medicines business of Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, for $14.4bn.Shares in Dollar General jumped 25.6 per cent to $21.07 after the retailer said it had agreed to be bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, for about $7.3bn.Meanwhile, Dow Chemical rose 2.1 per cent to $43.89 on persistent rumours that KKR may make the chemical group its next target.United Health, the US health insurance company, said that it was to buy Sierra Health Services for $2.6bn. Shares in Sierra rose 15.8 per cent to $41.57.Express Scripts said it would not raise its offer for Caremark unless the rival US drug benefits manager allowed Express to examine its books. Shareholders vote this week on an alternative bid agreed between Caremark and CVS, the pharmacy group. Shares in Caremark slipped 1.9 per cent to $60.70 while Express rose 4.6 per cent to $80.59.
138;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-12-21T01:44:29Z;Juniper hit with $900m backdating charge;;The cost of the options backdating scandal came into sharper focus on Wednesday after Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment, said it expected to take a $900m charge to account for improperly dated options grants.The company’s expected restatement would be one of the biggest at a Silicon Valley company since news of the scandal broke in March. Broadcom, a semiconductor equipment maker, has said it expects to record costs of $1.5bn as a result of the scandal. The news came a day after UnitedHealth, a healthcare provider, said it expected to take a non-cash charge of up to $600m related to backdating – an apparently widespread and potentially fraudulent practice in which the value of an options grant is artificially inflated by changing the grant date to coincide with a low point in the value of a company’s shares.Juniper said on Wednesday that an internal probe into options grants found that the dates were chosen “with the benefit of hindsight…so as to give favourable prices” to grantees. It said its investigation had uncovered “serious concerns regarding certain former management” at the company.More than 160 companies are under investigation by US authorities or have launched their own internal probes into suspected options backdating. Several dozen companies have announced that they may be forced to restate their financial results. Dozens of top executives have been sacked, while former executives at two companies have been charged with securities fraud for their roles in alleged options abuse.Scott Kriens, Juniper’s chief executive, expressed regret over the scandal. “In prior years, we should have had better stock option granting processes, controls and oversight in place, and we did not,” he said. Juniper said on Wednesday that its board remained confident in Mr Kriens and his management team.Juniper’s shares fell 0.8 per cent to $19.05 in after-hours trading following the announcement. The shares had risen from $15.49 in May, when it revealed it was under investigation for suspected backdating.
139;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Miller light as index-beater has bad year;;"Bill Miller, one of the most successful stock market investors in recent history, was this year one of the worst.The head of Legg Mason said on Monday that Morningstar, the market tracker, had revealed that his fund “was the worst in the entire category for the year”.His $20bn Value Trust, which until now had an unrivalled record in beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 index for 15 years in a row, has returned just 4.6 per cent in the year to date, compared with a 15 per cent rise in the S&P. According to Morningstar, 99 per cent of his peers beat him for the year.Mr Miller’s portfolio is highly concentrated – the fund owns huge chunks of Kodak, the film and camera maker, and Amazon, the online retailer – and hardly ever trades, so the big miss was a risk.However, no other funds have come close to achieving Miller’s index-beating record. Of more than 500 US diversified equity funds, the Quaker Strategic Growth fund, the next best performer, beat the S&P index for eight years to 2005, but it too ended its streak this year, according to Morningstar. Several hundred funds have managed to beat the index over six or seven years, but these are mostly small cap funds benefiting from the six-year small cap rally.Michael Mauboussin, Legg Mason’s chief investment strategist, said the chance of any fund beating the S&P for 15 consecutive years to 2005 was one in 2.3m. The average annual return of the Value Trust over the 15 years was 16.44 per cent, compared with 11.5 per cent for the S&P.Mr Miller, who is heavily bullish on the US stock market next year, appears undeterred by his fund’s recent slump, which he attributed to “bad stock-picking” rather than bad luck.Some of his biggest holdings fell sharply, such as United Healthcare, which was hit by a stock options scandal; Aetna, whose shares fell on concerns over plan pricings; and Amazon, which fell by 18 per cent.“After two years of contraction we will have price/earnings expansion in 2007,” said Mr Miller. “P/e ratios will rise in the next 12 months. There will be 7 to 8 per cent earnings growth, and if you are a European investor, you can look at a 30 per cent return from the US stockmarket next year.”Unlike most others, Mr Miller believes the US dollar will rise next year, and this will lift US stock market returns for offshore investors.“US large cap stocks, one of the worst performing asset classes, will be one of the best asset classes in the next few years”, he said."
140;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-11-10T21:30:54Z;Wall St edges higher helped by deals, earnings;;US stocks were caught in several cross-currents during the week as earnings, deals and likely repercussions from the mid-term Congressional elections were digested by investors.The main indices rose modestly, led by the Nasdaq Composite, which was helped by a surge in earnings from technology giant Cisco, up 12.5 per cent over the week at $26.74.With the Democrats claiming control of the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994 and narrowly gaining a majority in the Senate, equity investors focused on the likely winners and losers under a new Congress.“It’s uncertain just how much specific regulation or actions will be imposed by the Democrats,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “While investor concern is well founded, congressional gridlock will likely hold sweeping changes at bay.”Early indications were that losers could include companies in the pharmaceutical and defence sectors, while labour conditions at Wal-Mart, down 2.2 per cent at $46.47, and a rise in the minimum wage are also likely to attract the attention of lawmakers.The winners are expected to include alternative energy and stem cell research companies along with the Government housing agencies that made gains over the week. Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results. The index was down 2.1 per cent for the week at 6,742.80.“There is some concern for healthcare, with the Democrats talking about Medicare and [with] an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices,” said Mr Ablin.Big pharmaceutical groups Merck and Pfizer fell 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent to $43.12 and $25.71 respectively during the week. Johnson & Johnson was off 2.2 per cent at $66.29.Among managed health care providers, Humana fell 8.4 per cent to $52, in spite of reiterating its 2006 and 2007 earnings targets earlier in the week. UnitedHealth was down 3.6 per cent at $46.11, and WellCare fell 5.2 per cent to $56.WellPoint and Aetna were lower by 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent at $72.89 and $40.24 respectively. Watson-Pharma slid 5.2 per cent to $24.84 after disappointing earnings and legal woes. Bausch & Lomb fell 6.6 per cent for the week to $49.50 after it lowered 2006 and 2007 forecasts following the recall of its ReNu contact lens solution.Defence shares pared some of their post-election losses but on Friday were still down on the week. Lockheed Martin was 1.4 per cent lower at $85.75, Northrop Grumman was down 1.9 per cent at $64.70 and Raytheon had eased 0.2 per cent to $48.90.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 index had gained 1.2 per cent to 1,364.30 for the week and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,389.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent firmer at 12,108.43 after making a record close of 12,176.54 on Wednesday.The small-cap Russell 2000 index was up 2 per cent for the week at 768.07.Dominating earnings releases this week was Cisco, which has risen by about 60 per cent this year. Juniper, rose 15.8 per cent to $19.48. Among S&P 500 companies, 438 have reported third-quarter earnings with growth averaging 19 per cent, according to Thomson Financial – 73 per cent beat consensus forecastsA $3.7bn private bid for Four Seasons, the luxury hotel chain up 28.4 per cent to $82, was chief among a number of deals announced during the week.Swift Transportation, the US long-haul truck company that received a $2.2bn buyout offer, rose 15.2 per cent at $27.70 over the week.OSI Restaurant Partners, which runs the Outback Steakhouse chain, agreed to a $3bn private acquisition and rose 21.4 per cent to $39.37.The faltering housing market bruised homebuilders this week, with Toll Brothers down 2.9 per cent to $27.41. Merrill Lynch downgraded builder DR Horton, and it fell 1.1 per cent to $22.47. Pulte Homes was down 3.2 per cent at $29.15.
141;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-10-16T22:17:23Z;HP extends tender offer for Mercury;;Hewlett-Packard, the world’s second-biggest computer maker, on Monday announced a further extension of its tender offer for Mercury Interactive, a business software group that was forced to de-list its shares earlier this year because of stock options backdating.The move marked the third time HP has extended its tender offer, which values the software maker at $4.5bn. It came in spite of news that HP had locked up more than 90 per cent of Mercury’s oustanding shares - far more than the amount needed to complete the company’s biggest acquisition since its $19bn takeover of Compaq, a rival computer maker, in 2002.One person familiar with the matter said Mercury’s de-lisitng had complicated efforts to receive anti-trust approvals from regulators. The person said the delays were procedural and nature and were not expected to infuence the outcome of the tender offer.HP declined to comment.Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jeffries & Co, said she was confident the deal was still on track. “I don’t think anyone thinks it’s at risk,” she said. “HP want to compete more with IBM, and what they’re missing is a substantial software business.”HP’s tender offer values Mercury at $4.5bn, or $52 a share - a 33 per cent premium over the comapny’s share price the day before the deal was announced in July.Mercury’s shares have traded on the over-the-counter market since January, when they were delisted from the Nasdaq stock market for non-compliance with filing requirements. Mercury has offered to pay $35m to settle backdating claims with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.More than 100 companies are under investigation in the widening scandal over stock options backdating, which has recently claimed the jobs of several top executives, including William McGuire, the chief executive of UnitedHealth, one of the biggest US health insurers. Amnon Landan, Mercury’s former chief executive, and two other top managers were forced out in November 2005 because of the scandal.

Shares were down 2.48 per cent at $47.54 at the close.Shares in the Intercontinental Exchange fell 6.8 per cent, or $5.67, to $77.30 after reports the exchange was being looked at by authorities in relation to the recent steep trading losses at hedge fund Amaranth.
143;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Options/UnitedHealth;;The options backdating scandal has claimed another scalp: William McGuire, the veteran chief executive of UnitedHealth Group. But will his looming departure be enough to avoid further troubles at United?Investors certainly hope so, limiting the impact on the company's shares. Dr McGuire remains widely respected for transforming United into one of the largest US health insurance providers - and delivering pretty spectacular returns to shareholders. However, the appointment of his longtime right-hand man Steve Hemsley has eased fears of more sweeping management changes.This may prove premature. It has always been clear that Dr McGuire and fellow employees were not doing too badly but the extent to which United picked favourable grant dates for options awarded remains eye-catching. According to an independent review for its board, it was a matter of standard procedure to retroactively time grants to new hires and employees being promoted to obtain a favourable strike price. Before 2002, that on occasion resulted in option grant dates before new hires started working at United.Mr Hemsley's direct involvement may have been as limited as United's own review suggests. Both he and Dr McGuire, moreover, have voluntarily agreed to reprice dubious options awarded to them, forfeiting chunks of their compensation. But others looking into the matter, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, may take a different view.With earnings restatements looming, the fact that United has been a serial acquirer, which frequently paid with its own stock, further increases the risks of shareholder lawsuits. Business relations, notably with the senior lobbying group AARP, could suffer. Perhaps the biggest risk, though, is United looking like a poster child of corporate greed in the politically sensitive area of healthcare. For Democrats railing against any further privatisation of Medicare, the timing just before the elections is fortuitous.
144;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-10-16T17:38:00Z;Uncertainty hangs over UnitedHealth;;UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest US health insurers, embarked on a transition towards a new chief executive on Monday after the man who led the company for 15 years resigned when an external probe implicated him in manipulating stock options.The departure of William McGuire, regarded as one of the most successful company heads by Wall Street, marks another shock since a stock options backdating scandal broke in March.The scandal has ensnared more than 100 companies in investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, many of them run with the US Justice department.So far, civil and criminal charges have been brought against former executives at Brocade Communications Systems and Comverse Technology, both technology companies. The former executives deny the charges.When questionable use of stock option compensation hit the headlines, it emerged that scores of companies – either by failing to do the proper accounting or make the necessary disclosures to shareholders – appeared to have improperly awarded options with a lower exercise price than on the day that the award was made.An investigation into UnitedHealth Group by law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale – involving 600 boxes of documents and 80 interviews with current and former employees – uncovered a litany of irregularities. The firm concluded that grants to Mr McGuire of 1m options and to chief operating officer Stephen Hemsley of 500,000 options in 1999 were “likely backdated”. Backdating itself is not illegal.However, the probe found Mr McGuire was central to the options granting process and that the “full extent and nature” of financial relationships between him and the then-chairman of the company’s compensation committee that had created a conflict of interest in 1999 “likely were not disclosed” to the board at the time.In addition, a 1999 “supplemental grant” of options to employees and senior management, which had replaced previous options that had been “suspended” – and later re-activated – were “likely backdated”.Wilmer Hale said this grant had amounted to a “repricing” of the suspended options and had produced a change in accounting thathad not been recognised. The company had no comment on the report, which it published on its website. Mr McGuire accumulated $1.6bn in stock options between his appointment in 1991 and the end of 2005.During the same period, the group’s share price rose by 2,500 per cent. Its annual revenues when Mr McGuire took over were $600m – but reached $70bn last year.The stock options scandal has engulfed mainly technology companies, reflecting the popularity of stock options in the late 1990s as a way of attracting talent to Silicon Valley.But the case of UnitedHealth highlights a different phenomenon at work, according to Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida.“In their competition for talent, technology companies were backdating options to a wide number of employees. With others, it was mainly a case of management enrichment,” he said.SEC chairman Christopher Cox told the US Congress last month that the agency was devoting significant resources to pursuing suspected cases. He said more civil cases were expected.
145;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Wal-Mart fuels generic drugs price war;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday shook up the US healthcare industry by saying it would slash the prices of nearly 300 generic drugs sold at its in-store pharmacies by as much as 60 per cent.Bill Simon, who oversees the retailer’s pharmacy unit, said the company would start charging only $4 for a month’s supply of some of the most widely used generics – copies of branded drugs whose patents have expired.The move reflects growing scrutiny of generic drug prices, the retail prices of which often contain a large mark-up for middlemen including pharmacies and distributors.Mr Simon said the programme, initially launched at 65 stores in Florida, would extend across the state by January next year, and then be extended to the retailer’s nationwide network of more than 3,000 stores. Wal-Mart’s $4 price for a 30-day supply of metformin, the most widely used entry-level diabetes drug, will be 49 per cent lower than the branded drug price. A similar $4 supply of lisinopril, a high-blood pressure medicine, was 67 per cent lower than brand prices.Even with the planned reductions, he said Wal-Mart would not be selling the drugs at a loss, and that the company was not pressing manufacturers for price cuts.Wal-Mart’s move also comes on the heels of a crackdown on some generic drug pricing by UnitedHealth Group, the second-largest US health insurer. UnitedHealth has challenged the belief that generics are always cheaper, moving to discourage the use of 27 generic medicines because they were more expensive to the insurer than deeply discounted branded alternatives.The leading US drug store chains, who make most of their profits from generic sales, saw their shares fall on Thursday on the news. CVS was down 9 per cent to $32.27, while Walgreens fell 6 per cent, to $46.96, and RiteAid 6.5 per cent, to $4.45.The US generic market faces increasing pricing pressure as more and more competition enters the lucrative market. This competition is pressuring manufacturers’ margins, and moves such as Wal-Mart’s adds to this pressure, according to David Maris, Bank of America analyst.Wal-Mart this summer launched a marketing campaign focused on its pharmacy business, which it hopes can attract more customers and increase overall sales across its stores. Mr Simon said the pharmacies “are geared up to deal with significant volume increase” as a result of the new prices.Over the past year, Wal-Mart has responded to political criticism of its healthcare provision for its own workers by saying it is committed to reducing overall healthcare costs. It is expanding a network of walk-in clinics in its stores, which offer lower cost care for basic medical issues.
146;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-09-20T21:17:18Z;UnitedHealth tests generics orthodoxy;;UnitedHealth Group, the second-largest US health insurer, is cracking down on the use of some generic drugs because of their price. The move is an unprecedented challenge to the view that generics are always cheaper.In the last year, UnitedHealth has discouraged the use of 27 different generic drugs because they were more expensive than the original branded version or an alternative.The insurer has moved those generics out of a preferred first-use category and into second- or third-tier status which requires patients to pay more from their own pockets for the drugs.However, the health insurer is also questioning a fundamental rule in healthcare that cost-saving generics should receive unqualified preferential treatment.A confidential internal UnitedHealth memorandum reviewed by the FT stated: “The healthcare system has been built around this misconception that generics are always less expensive.”It is a significant challenge to the assumption held by lawmakers, doctors and patients that generic drugmakers help to cut healthcare costs.It also raises questions over the commonly held view that generic drugmakers are inherently good, and branded drugmakers are bad because of their pricing policies.UnitedHealth’s heightened scrutiny of generic pricing comes on top of US pricing pressure on branded drugs.Timothy Heady, chief of UnitedHealth’s pharmacy business, said in an interview: “The healthcare system has built itself on this one-dimensional logic that generics are always good. When they’re not, they should not be rewarded.”The next several years will see many expirations of blockbuster branded drugs.In response, new pricing strategies have emerged from branded makers who want to fight to preserve at least a fraction of sales from their expiring products. They want to use pricing pressure to hurt generic drugmakers in turn.The first launched generic version of a medicine enjoys a six-month period in which it is the only generic available.This monopoly period was given under a US law that has tried to promote more generic competition to control costs.But Mr Heady said that UnitedHealth had found that some generic prices it must pay to some pharmacies – as reimbursement for a patient’s drug purchase – are not as low as a deeply discounted branded drug.Two of those identified as more expensive are generic versions of blockbuster cholesterol drugs Pravachol and Zocor, made by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mr Heady said. Their patents expired this year for US drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, respectively.
147;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Barnes & Noble subpoenaed over options;;The stock options backdating scandal in corporate America widened on Tuesday as Barnes & Noble, the bookstore operator, became the latest company to be investigated by US authorities.In a brief regulatory statement filed on Tuesday, the New York-based bookseller said it has received a subpoena from the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, requesting documents regarding its stock-options practices.The company, which is already being informally investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declined to offer further details on the subpoena, saying it intends to “cooperate fully” with the investigation.Last month, B&N announced that its board’s audit committee would conduct an internal review of its stock-options granting programme after a shareholder, Timothy Hill, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful stock-options granting practices.More than 80 companies are currently being investigated by US authority over whether their managers might have improperly inflated the value of stock options by changing their grant dates to coincide with low points in the value of their companies’ shares.The practice, known as backdating, can fatten profits for options recipients when they sell their shares at higher market prices.The scandal has shocked boardrooms across the country and has led several companies to restate financial results to the tune of billions of dollars. Large companies which have admitted to having awarded backdated stock options to executives include home improvement retailer Home Depot, United Health Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Shares in B&N were down 1 per cent at $34.93 in early trade in New York.
148;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-08-24T21:25:41Z;Wall St edges up as traders digest data;;Wall Street closed barely higher on Thursday after mixed trading for much of the day, as investors digested data on home sales and durable goods orders that gave further indications of a slowing economy.Trading was tentative and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite both dipped in and out of negative territory throughout the day.Shares in mortgage finance group Fannie Mae jumped on news that it would not be facing criminal charges for accounting irregularities and that the US Justice Department had ended its investigation of the company. Its shares gained 4.8 per cent to $51.53, its best day since January.Online auction site Ebay dropped 4.5 per cent to $25.78 after Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “underperform”.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 3.07 points, at 1,296.06, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent, or 2.45 points, at 2,137.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 6.56 points, at 11,304.46.Sales of existing homes fell by more than expected in July, bolstering the picture of a cooling US housing market and presaging further economic slowing. Durable goods orders data for July were mixed, although the headline number dropped by 2.4 per cent, more than had been forecast.The sluggish durable goods figures precipitated a sell-off in heavy-industry stocks. Caterpillar tumbled 2.5 per cent to $65.50, while Joy Global, maker of farm and mining machinery, fell 2.6 per cent to $38.00.Consumer stocks were the worst hit by the news of slowing home sales and the attendant risks they posed to consumer spending. Electronics retailer Circuit City sank 4 per cent to $22.78, while jewellery company Tiffany & Co lost 3.3 per cent to $30.80.Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, said the fall-back in consumer cyclical stocks hinted at a shift in the sectors that would lead the market.“Going into 2005 and beyond, cyclicals have done well so the issue is, do we bottom fish, because they have dipped so much, or do we look for a change of leadership?” he said. “I think we should think in terms of a change in leadership.”While consumer stocks slumped, healthcare made strong gains. UnitedHealth rose 3.1 per cent to $51.16 and Aetna gained 3.5 per cent to $37.66.Clothes retailer Chico’s FAS sank 25.5 per cent to $17.95 after it issued guidance for the third and fourth quarters that was below analyst expectations.Investors checked into hotel chain Wyndham Worldwide after it said it would receive $760m from its sale of real estate group Cendant and use the money to pay down debt. Shares in Wyndham rose 5.7 per cent to $27.88.
149;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Stock options troubles: background;;Apple Computer may be the highest-profile but it is not the first company to admit that it would probably have to restate its earnings as a result of the widening stock options backdating scandal.McAfee, the security software company, said last month that manipulation of the timing of options meant it would have to restate earnings going back to at least 2003, and the impact would be significant. It also fired its general counsel as a result of the episode.Mercury Interactive, a business software company, was also forced to restate several years’ worth of earnings reports. Mercury’s shares were de-listed from the Nasdaq and its former chief executive resigned last November amid revelations that he and other executives had benefited from favourable backdating of stock options grants.San Francisco-based CNET Networks also said last month that it expected to restate financial statements.Last month, US authorities handed down the first criminal and civil charges in the scandal, charging three former executives of California technology company Brocade Communications Systems.The probe so far has been centred on but not limited to Silicon Valley technology companies. In June, Home Depot became the largest US company to acknowledge having awarded backdated stock options to executives after conducting an internal investigation like Apple and many other companies. The home improvement retailer said it had discovered $10m of unrecorded expenses resulting from five cases of retroactively priced stock options.In some cases, the scandal has prompted lawsuits from shareholders. UnitedHealth Group, the health insurer, has been hit with a suit from two Ohio public pension funds.So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about 80 companies, but the probe could widen significantly. According to one published study conducted by Erik Lie, the University of Iowa finance professor whose research in 2004 helped spur the current set of probes, more than 2,000 companies appear to have used backdated options to boost executives’ income.Backdating involves the use of a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option. This allowed the option to be backdated to when the awarding company’s share price was lower, increasing the potential profit for executives when the option is exercised.Investigators are looking into whether options were deliberately backdated to periods when a company’s stock price was at or near a record low and whether this was properly disclosed and accounted for.Most cases relate to a roughly six-year period prior to the introduction of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Before then, option grants were disclosed once a year and could be made in a 45-day window, which was cut to two days by the legislation, curbing the ability of managements to manipulate options grants.Christopher Cox , SEC chairman, has said the agency is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock-options disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal that he presented earlier this year.The proposals would provide shareholders with a total compensation number for the CEO, CFO and the three other highest-paid executive officers. That would require options to be disclosed in a “summary compensation table” at fair value on grant.The latest accounting standards mean a company cannot hide the true value of the option by fixing option terms on a date other than the true grant date.

Markets pushed higher on comments by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve. The remarks were taken as a signal that a pause in interest rate rises might be at hand.Financial stocks performed particularly well on the comments. JPMorgan Chase announced better-than-expected profit of $3.5bn in the second quarter; up from $994m in the same period last year. Its shares gained 5.8 per cent to $43.05.Bank of New York rose 7.1 per cent to $34.08 after it reported a 13 per cent increase in second quarter earnings.The fly in the ointment was Yahoo, which plummeted 21.8 per cent to $25.20 after the company reported a 78 per cent drop in second quarter earnings, although that was in line with analysts’ expectations.Investors were worried by a delay in the introduction of the company’s new advertising platform. The stock is now at its lowest level since April 2003 and is down 34.5 per cent this year. Ebay lost 2.5 per cent to $25.93.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent, or 212.19 points, to 11,011.42. The S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent, or 22.95 points, at 1,259.81, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.8 per cent, or 37.49 points, at 2,080.71.The only flat sector was energy, as oil prices slid further. Nymex futures have lost more than $5 in three days.Data showing higher than expected core US inflation were released before the start of trading but had no impact on stocks.Investors chose instead to focus on the congressional testimony of Mr Bernanke, which was interpreted to mean that the interest rate tightening cycle might soon be over.“It’s a Bernanke market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“He ignited a strong rally here. This comes from the fact that the market was oversold and from the options expiration this Friday.

153;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-06-16T22:04:30Z;Home Depot ensnared in options scandal;;Home Depot has become the largest US company to acknowledge having awarded backdated stock options to executives, extending the scandal further beyond the technology sector where the controversial practice was most common.The home improvement retailer said it had discovered $10m of unrecorded expenses resulting from five cases of retroactively priced stock options.More than 40 US companies have been exposed for manipulating the exercise price of stock options to increase their value to executives.Home Depot is the best-known name to have become embroiled in the scandal, attracting fresh scrutiny to its corporate governance at a time when the company was already under fire over soaring executive pay.All five cases of backdating occurred before 2000, when Bob Nardelli, the current chief executive, took charge.The company did not disclose who had received the backdated options but said its billionaire founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, were not involved.An official said the company had made the find in the course of a voluntary internal investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission was not involved.“Home Depot is committed to high standards of corporate governance and transparency in its reporting practices and, as such, conducted a review of its stock option grant practices and procedures since 1996,” the company said, in a statement.Other large companies caught up in the scandal include UnitedHealth Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Backdating involves the use of a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option.This allowed the option to be backdated to when the awarding company’s share price was lower, increasing the potential profit for executives when the option is exercised.Home Depot said that in three of the five cases, the company’s share price was higher on the award date than on the date when the exercise price was set.Backdating is not necessarily illegal but the practice has forced several companies to restate earnings and sparked probes by the SEC and the Justice Department because stock option expenses were not properly disclosed.Home Depot said its $10m of unrecorded expenses were not great enough to merit a restatement.But its involvement in backdating is an acute embarrassment for the company, coming weeks after it faced a shareholder rebellion over the nearly $250m of compensation awarded to Mr Nardelli over the past six years.Most cases of backdating occurred before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which aimed to improve corporate governance in the US.Christopher Cox, chairman of the SEC, is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock option disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal he presented earlier this year.

I think the market is going to plod along and not be a bull or a bear.“There’s enough muck on the ground that the turtle is not going to make much progress.”Economic data this week helped ease fears of inflationary pressures in the US economy. On Friday, non-farm payroll figures showed job growth was significantly weaker than expected, while other figures showed a slowing in manufacturing and construction activity.Markets took the data in their stride, and were unfazed by the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s May meeting, which said inflation expectations had risen.Oil pushed higher, with crude for July delivery finishing the week at $72.33 – a three week high – as Tehran brushed off a conditional offer of talks from the US.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 2.51 points, for the day at 1,288.22, a weekly gain of 0.6 per cent.

The producer of telecoms software posted a far smaller quarterly loss than had been expected, and gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the third quarter. The shares gained 16.8 per cent to $4.65, a seven week high.Qwest followed suit, jumping 7.5 per cent to $7.45, its highest level since April 2002, while a broker upgrade for AT&T sent shares 1.9 per cent higher to $26.73.The traditionally defensive utility sector saw heavy trading as deals news buoyed stocks, sending the S&P Utilities Index up 2.6 per cent on the week.

156;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-05-21T21:30:25Z;Law firm opens new front in stock option probe;;One of the most powerful securities class-action law firms in the US has opened a new front in prosecutors’ investigation of the backdating of stock options.The firm promises to file suits against executives and directors who allegedly manipulated stock option practices to guarantee the receipt of windfall compensation.New York-based Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, filed suit against UnitedHealth Group last week and signalled that it is ready to target more companies being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York.The lawyers’ decision to take on the stock option scandal comes as the class-action securities industry is reeling from last week’s indictment of one of its most prominent players, Milberg Weiss, and two of its senior lawyers, after a six-year probe.BLB&G,says law firms should be judged by their own conduct. The indictment could boost firms such as BLB&G if Milberg’s clients change lawyers.As part of its legal action against UnitedHealth, five pension funds represented by BLB&G are asking a judge to freeze $2bn in unexercised stock options that were granted to the company’s chief executive and chief operating officer.Gerald Silk, a partner at BLB&G said: “We’re basically asking the judge to take the key out of the getaway car until the backdating mess is sorted out.”Mr Silk said he was discussing with clients potential litigation against another group that is being probed, Affiliated Computer, and others. John “Sean” Coffey, another BLB&G partner, says the backdating of options is a “very hot issue” that his institutional clients are “upset over”. An investigation by US authorities into whether executives and directors changed the effective dates on stock options to secure higher compensation widened last week after prosecutors issued subpoenas to companies. These included UnitedHealth, which said it was co-operating, and Vitesse Semiconductor, the chipmaker that fired its chief and two other executives as it widened its internal probe into the timing of stock-option grants. American Tower Corporation and RSA Security said they also received SEC letters of inquiry.At the core of the BLB&G legal action are allegations that William McGuire, chairman and chief executive of UnitedHealth, and Stephen Hemsley, chief operating officer, breached their fiduciary duty when they, along with other executives, received stock options during the 1990s at “abnormally low and statistically anomalous exercise prices”.

Retail and technology posted the biggest gains, with investors eyeing Limited Brands and Amazon along with market debutant Burger King.“I’m a little surprised that we’re not seeing a bigger snap-back in the stock market today [Thursday],” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, who pointed to falling bond yields and the release of economic data that should have buoyed the market by easing fears of interest rate rises.“We got a reassuring [jobless] claims number saying job growth was weak. For stocks the big fear was this continued rise in rates. It [now] seems to have gotten a little better.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, or 8.51 points, at 1,261.81, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7 per cent, or 15.48 points, to 2,180.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled, also 0.7 per cent, or 77.32 points, to 11,128.29.Retail was the best performing sector, with the S&P Retail Index rising 1.4 per cent thanks to strong earnings reports.Sears Holdings was the star, reaching its highest level since July last year, after the retailer unveiled unexpectedly strong earnings. Shares gained 12.97 per cent to $155.85.Limited Brands added 5.5 per cent to $26.68, after it reported a better-than-expected 19 per cent increase in first-quarter profit. The news prompted Morgan Stanley to raise its rating on Limited from “equal weight” to “overweight”.Technology stocks also made advances. Amazon added 3.2 per cent to $32.61 after competitor Barnes & Noble reported a 0.3 per cent fall in same-store sales.Hewlett-Packard rose 1 per cent to $32.48, continuing the previous day’s gains after broker Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock from “under weight” to “equal weight”. HP’s rival Dell also nudged higher, rising 1.4 per cent to $23.95, ahead of the release of its quarterly earnings.Falling bond yields helped push homebuilders higher. Pulte was up 1.8 per cent at $33.00, while DR Horton rose 1.9 per cent to $27.50.UnitedHealthcare slumped 3.4 per cent to $45.30 after it received a subpoena requesting documents relating to stock-option grants and a lawsuit was filed against the company accusing it of violating anti-trust laws.Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.7 per cent to $39.80 after losing an appeal against a $44m penalty that a European Court had imposed on it for operating a price-fixing cartel.Sprint rose 3.4 per cent to $22.92 after spinning off its fixed-line service Embarq to Sprint shareholders.Burger King made a strong stock market debut. More than 15m shares in the fast-food chain changed hands. Burger King gained 2.9 per cent to $17.50.
158;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
159;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-05-11T21:07:57Z;Lex: UnitedHealth Group;;The controversy over UnitedHealth Group’s share option grants could give share options a bad name – had they not already been tarred by the excesses of the boom years. Admittedly, UnitedHealth’s stock has been a hit. Citigroup calculates that if the chief executive’s options had a strike price set at the average price for the year – as distinct from particularly advantageous strike prices, as its critics maintain – the options would still be worth over $1bn. In other words, blame the market, not lax procedures, for this eye-popping wealth.Still, procedures do matter. UnitedHealth disclosed policies in its SEC filing that should have been best practice everywhere for every company. It should be obvious, for example, that only the compensation committee should have the authority to grant stock options. The same applies to picking the exercise price. Flexibility on this is bound to raise questions, even if there has been proper disclosure. Fixing a regular annual date for the grant of stock options – as UnitedHealth now does – is clearly sensible. Companies could go even further by flagging to the market in advance when executives intend actually to exercise their options.But this debate has stirred up something more than irritation at share options. There is growing concern that absolute levels of total chief executive compensation, benefits in pensions and healthcare and non-cash perks are breeding resentment among employees who perceive their own benefits are being pared back with little in the way of wage inflation.Against this background, it was not surprising that United scrapped golden parachutes and further equity-based awards for a select few. Too many other companies are showing a tin ear to the current mood, at the risk of investor ire.

161;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2020-04-23T03:06:37+0000;Microsoft shares drop despite profits increase;;A spectacular fall in Microsoft on Friday morning brought a surprising conclusion to a week in which Wall Street twisted and turned in reaction to twin interest rate surprises, mixed economic data and continued positive earnings reports.The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit six-year highs before slipping on Friday, largely thanks to Microsoft.By Friday’s close, the Dow was up 19.69 points, or 0.2 per cent, for the week at 11,367.14, with the Nasdaq Composite – also harmed by Microsoft – trading 0.9 per cent lower, down 20.29 points, at 2,322.57. The S&P 500 barely moved, down 0.67, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,310.61.Microsoft disappointed investors, even though quarterly profits were up 16 per cent, by saying its earnings would be hurt by increased investments and giving a more downbeat forecast for the second half of the year than Wall Street had expected.The shares fell more than 11 per cent on Friday morning, their biggest slide since December 2000, knocking $33.9bn off the value of the company. Over the week, the stock was down 11 per cent at $24.15, back to the level at which it was trading in late 2000.“The fact that a stock like Microsoft could fall so much is a sign that there is very little investment activity in the market,” said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak. “It is a symptom of the domination of traders and hedge funds in the market.”Traders awoke on Thursday to news of a surprise announcement of an increase in the Bank of China’s lending rate – the first rise for 18 months.That sent a shudder through equity markets, as it seemed to signal slower growth and reduced demand from the fast-growing Chinese economy.But sentiment on interest rates turned when Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, testified to Congress later that day. He hinted at a pause in monetary tightening after next month’s meeting of the rate-setting open market committee, giving succour to stocks and particularly to bank stocks.The S&P banking index moved higher, finishing the week up 5.6 per cent.Major banking gainers included Bank of America, which followed up on last week’s robust quarterly earnings report with an announcement that it might spend up to $12bn over the next 18 months to buy back 20m shares.The news sent Bank of America’s stock to its highest level ever, and the stock finished the week up 6.5 per cent at $49.92.Citigroup also surged, after it received an upgrade from “market perform” to “outperform” from Piper Jaffray, which raised its price target on the bank from $52 to $55. It is trading at $49.95, after gaining 4 per cent for the week.It was also a peak week for corporate earnings. So far 334 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 have reported. “It looks like we’re on course for an eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth,” said John Butters of Thomson Financial.The blended growth rate, a composite made up of actual results and analyst forecasts, now stands at 13.4 per cent.“With 23 of the 30 in the Dow having reported, it would take something pretty serious to drag us below 10 per cent,” said Mr Butters.Monster Worldwide was one of the biggest gainers for the week after it reported better-than-expected earnings, sending the stock up 10.7 per cent to $57.40. It was one of several recruitment agencies to register gainsBut several announcements – even from companies reporting headline profits – led to sharp falls.Healthcare services and equipment suffered a bout of ill health in spite of positive earnings from health insurers, such as Aetna, and health management company Express Scripts.But investors were less interested in profits than in the ability of health insurers and managed care providers to prove that they could keep costs under control.The catalyst came from Aetna, which said its “loss ratio” – which compares costs it paid out for services to the amount it collected in premiums – had risen sharply, to 79.4 per cent from 74.6 per cent.That swamped its strong profits, and led to selling across the sector. Aetna plummeted 20 per cent in one day, finishing the week down 18.3 per cent. Cigna lost 10.9 per cent for the week, United Healthcare fell 0.3 per cent, and Express Scripts fell 7.3 per cent.
162;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-04-04T11:14:20Z;Australia may sell health fund Medibank;;The Australian government is understood to be preparing to sell Medibank Private, which controls 30 per cent of the country’s private health insurance sector.Nick Minchin, Australia’s finance minister, said on Tuesday that an “announcement on the future of Medibank Private is imminent but I’m not in a position to make that announcement today”.Federal cabinet ministers are understood to have agreed to sell the nation’s largest health fund, subject to industry reforms which are yet to be finalised.Analysts believe the sell-off could raise about A$1.5bn (US$1.1bn). It would be the latest in a growing list of planned privatisations in Australia which include the troubled A$25bn sale of the government’s 51.8 per cent stake in Telstra, the telecoms operator, and the A$3bn floatation of Snowy Hydro, the country’s dominant hydro-electric power generating companyBupa, the UK-backed health insurer that operates the HBA and Mutual Community brands in Australia, and local insurer MPF are believed to have expressed interest in buying their market rival.Bupa declined to comment on Medibank Private but confirmed that the health insurer was “looking to grow further in Australia”.Germany’s Munich Re, South African-based Discovery Holders and UnitedHealthcare, a unit of US-based UnitedHealth Group, are also seen as potential international buyers. Other local interest has come from Challenger Financial Services and healthcare provider Symbion.However, Medibank Private’s board is believed to favour an initial public offering, which would turn its 1.4m policyholders into investors in what would be Australia’s only publicly-listed health insurer.The government contemplated selling Medibank Private in 2003 but was dissuaded by a tough market for health insurance that led the company to report a $175m loss in 2001.The government’s renewed interest in a sell-off appears to have been ignited by improved market conditions and the company’s return to profit.But Julia Gillard, opposition health spokeswoman, said a sale could reduce competition and increase premiums, which had already risen 40 per cent since 2000.“It won’t lead to another monopoly but you will have one less big player in the market. Instead the big player will have been eaten up by the smaller players.”Industry reforms being considered by cabinet ministers are said to include restrictions on how funds can price products for customers with different health profiles and extending reinsurance – pooled funds through which insurers share the cost of expensive members – to treatments delivered outside of hospital such as dialysis.
163;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2006-01-25T14:46:32Z;Smaller banks triumph on market value;;The market value of the world’s largest banks has not grown as quickly as that of their smaller rivals, according to a new report on the state of the financial services industry.The research by Mercer Oliver Wyman, the financial services consultancy, shows that just four of the world’s 30 largest financial services groups have seen their market value increase by more than the industry average since 2001. The best performers were medium-sized banks such as Erste Bank of Austria and Australia’s St George Bank as well as specialised groups such as UnitedHealth Group, the US health insurer.The report is further confirmation of the investor malaise that has affected the share price performances of large banks such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Royal Bank of Scotland in recent years. It will also raise further questions about the perceived benefits of scale in financial services that drove much of the consolidation in the industry during the 1990s.The report also confirms the growing appetite among financial services executives for exposure to emerging markets, and an increasing willingness to make acquisitions to achieve that end. Three-fifths of the 90 chief executives polled by Mercer now say smaller acquisitions are a strategic priority, while executives in Europe increasingly expect cross-border deals.John Drzik, Mercer’s chief executive, said: “Growth in new markets is a big success factor and something that the CEOs are flagging as a change from prior years. There is a sense that one has to take risks to grow as opposed to just optimising the business.”Despite widespread concerns about global financial imbalances and the sustainability of the current low interest rate environment, the chief executives remain optimistic about their growth prospects, predicting that financial services companies will expand more quickly than the underlying economy this year.Mercer’s study shows that what the group calls conglomerates – companies that span a range of businesses including banking, asset management and insurance – have been the worst-performing group over the period. In the past few years, Citigroup has simplified its structure by spinning off or selling its insurance and asset management businesses.The Mercer study identified 37 groups that had consistently outperformed their peers. Though it is hard to generalise about the group, John Drzik, Mercer’s chief executive, said the companies had all enjoyed several years of good growth in revenues. “What separates them is consistent and high top-line growth, not cost control or lower credit losses,” he said.Mercer measures the total shareholder return of the world’s 400 largest financial institutions by market capitalisation, adjusted for the volatility of their share prices, over the past five years.
164;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2005-09-27T16:03:03Z;Wellpoint agrees to buy rival for $6.3bn;;WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, on Tuesday agreed to pay $6.5bn in stock and cash to acquire WellChoice, a rival boasting a customer base of about 5m members in the New York City area.The deal furthers a nearly two-year wave of consolidation in the US health insurance industry. WellPoint, itself the product of a $16bn merger that closed last November, and UnitedHealth, its main competitor nationally, have aggressively sought to expand through acquisitions.By acquiring WellChoice, the parent of the powerful Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield brand, WellPoint will be placing itself in direct competition with UnitedHealth in the New York market, which can be exceptionally lucrative because of the presence of many corporate employers.UnitedHealth bolstered its presence in New York last year when it agreed to buy Oxford Health Plans in a $5bn deal. In July this year, UnitedHealth set its sights on the western US when it announced plans to pay $8.1bn for PacifiCare, whose customers are located in states such as California, Colorado and Texas.In a statement on Tuesday, Larry Glasscock, chief executive of WellPoint, suggested the acquisition of WellChoice would help curb - rather than exacerbate - the rising cost of health insurance, one of the most significant issues confronting US corporations and policymakers.“We can assure our members in all of our states that this merger will not add in any way to premium increases,” Mr Glasscock said. “Both WellPoint and WellChoice have strong track records of reducing administrative costs while improving customer satisfaction.”WellPoint - which was formed last year after Anthem agreed to buy WellPoint for $16bn and took its name - is paying $77.23 per share to WellChoice shareholders - or the equivalent of an 9 per cent premium to WellChoice’s value on Monday. The cash portion of the payment will be worth $38.25 per share, while the stock portion is worth $38.98 per share.The New York Public Asset Fund, WellChoice’s majority shareholder, is supporting the merger and will receive a cash pay-out of nearly $2bn and an additional 27m WellPoint shares after the deal closes. The deal offered a way to get around legal restrictions that would have required the fund to cut its stake in WellPoint to under 50 per cent by November.After the close of the transaction, Michael Stocker, chief executive officer of WellChoice, which went public in 2002 after abandoning its not-for-profit status, will run WellPoint’s NorthEastern operations. In midday trading, WellPoint shares were 0.15 per cent lower at $74.98. WellChoice shares were up 6.7 per cent at $75.33.
165;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2005-07-07T15:35:21Z;Omnicare buys healthcare rival for $1.6bn;;Omnicare, the US provider of drugs and pharmacy services to nursing homes, on Thursday agreed to buy NeighborCare, a rival, for about $1.6bn, marking the end of a takeover battle that has lasted more than a year.Omnicare had been pursuing NeighborCare since June 2004, when it launched a unsolicited bid worth $30 per share that was rejected by the target.Last month, Omnicare raised its bid to $32 per share in the hope of luring NeighborCare into takeover talks - which it eventually did, leading to Thursday’s deal struck at $34.75 per share.Omnicare will also take on more than $200m of NeigborCare debt.“More than a year in the making, the combination of our companies, we believe, will create a premier institutional pharmacy company“, said Joel Gemunder, Omnicare’s chief executive.The enlarged Omnicare will serve 1.6m beds in nearly all US states and have about $6bn in revenues. John Arlotta, NeighborCare’s chief executive who had been on the frontlines in resisting Omnicare’s approaches, said: “Our organisation has made significant progress in achieving our business goals and we are pleased that Omnicare has recognised the values inherent in our enterprise.“The deal came in a busy week for mergers and acquisitions activity in the US healthcare services industry. On Wednesday, UnitedHealth, the country’s second largest health insurer, agreed to buy PacifiCare for $8.1bn in stock and cash, cementing its standing as the top rival to WellPoint, the largest US health insurer.Omnicare shares rose 2 per cent in morning trading to $46.95, giving it a market capitalisation of $4.9bn. NeighborCare shares were up 0.7 per cent to $34.60.Lehman Brothers and Lazard advised Omnicare, which is based in Kentucky. Goldman Sachs advised NeighborCare, whose headquarters are in Maryland.
166;UNH;Unitedhealth Group Inc;2005-07-06T22:42:26Z;UnitedHealth to buy Pacificare for $8.1bn;;UnitedHealth, the second-largest US health insurer, on Wednesday agreed to buy PacifiCare Health Systems for $8.1bn in cash and stock, extending a deal-making spree that has lasted almost two years.The acquisition will allow UnitedHealth to establish a strong presence in the western US, where PacifiCare has about 10m clients and derives some $12bn in annual revenues.Industry observers suggested that UnitedHealth’s expansion would intensify competition with WellPoint, the largest US health insurer created out of last year’s $16bn merger of Anthem and WellPoint.The US health insurance industry has been consolidating because many of the players are feeling pressure to gain clout with hospital and pharmaceuticals companies. William McGuire, UnitedHealth’s chief executive, on Wednesday described the deal as “advancing a national presence that can help address a highly fragmented health care system”.Over the past decade, Mr McGuire has presided over the growth of the company, which is based in Minnesota, through a series of acquisitions. The latest were the $2.7bn takeover of Mid Atlantic Medical Services in 2003 - a deal followed last year with the $5bn purchase of Oxford Health.These deals allowed UnitedHealth to become a dominant force in many mid-Atlantic and north-eastern US states.Besides the appeal of moving into states such as California, Colorado and Texas, the purchase of PacifiCare is also appealing to UnitedHealth because the target is one of the top providers of Medicare programs, which offer low-priced medical care to the elderly.In the late 1990s, United withdrew from the Medicare market in several states. Under the terms of Wednesday’s deal, PacifiCare shareholders will be receiving $80.05 per share - of which $21.50 will come in cash and the rest in $2.2bn in UnitedHealth shares at an exchange ratio of 1.10. This price represents a 10 per cent premium to PacifiCare’s value on Tuesday.Investors will in the next few weeks be closely monitoring the regulatory response to UnitedHealth’s latest deal. John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner who last year held up Anthem’s merger with WellPoint, on Wednesday said he would give “close scrutiny” to the acquisition of PacifiCare.UnitedHealth’s latest purchase comes on the heels of a strong first quarter for the company, whose net income rose 41 per cent to $779m and revenues jumped 34 per cent to $10.9bn.PacifiCare shares on Wednesday closed up 6 per cent at $77.09. UnitedHealth shares closed up 0.5 per cent at $53.50. MorganStanley and MTS Health Partners, a private merchant bank, advised PacifiCare. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup advised UnitedHealth.
