Meh.;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.“Continuing to Inspire Humanity” was perhaps a surprising subsection to a press release announcing bailout terms. But that is how US budget airline JetBlue wanted to punctuate the document explaining its plan for moving forward after being debilitated by the Covid-19-inspired global economic shutdown.The US Treasury department announced this week the highly anticipated terms of the relief package for US airlines which had been previously outlined in the Cares Act. The hot button issue was around just how much equity the airlines would have to give to the US taxpayer in exchange for billions of dollars of grants and loans. The answer: not much.JetBlue explained that the value of the loans, grants and warrants were tied to their two payroll expenses in the middle two quarters of 2019. The bulk of JetBlue’s near-$1bn package would be in the form of a “grant” or straight subsidy. The rest would be a “low-interest” unsecured loan due in a decade. It did not specify the equity it would give up but said it was a “limited number of warrants”.Delta Air Lines, however, was more specific, revealing that the Treasury would receive warrants representing 1 per cent of its equity value struck at Tuesday’s closing price as part of a $5.4bn package of grants and low interest loans. DD’s Sujeet Indap did some illustrative maths to show that given the modest equity sweetener and a mostly free subsidy to Delta, the US taxpayer would almost certainly be earning a negative rate of return. The break-even point occurs if, after 10 years, Delta shares rocket from $24 today to $560.Judging by FT reader comments, citizens are outraged by what they believe are sweetheart bailouts to mismanaged companies who treat flyers poorly while diverting cash flow to bonuses, buybacks and dividends (the rescue financings now place restrictions on all of these as well as on employee lay-offs).PJT Partners, the boutique bank representing the Treasury in the negotiations, was in a tough spot.Airline workers, of all stakeholders, did not want too tough a bargain because they worried that the carriers would then rely on more expensive private capital and resort to eventual mass lay-offs. As Lex pointed out, airlines have as much “operating leverage” as any other industry so they need a snapback soon. It will not be clear for years just how lopsided or not these airline bailouts prove to be. But for now, “humanity” does not seem to be very inspired.When Occidental Petroleum agreed a $10bn financing deal with Warren Buffett to buy Anadarko Petroleum, it angered the company’s shareholders in two ways. First, the investment from Buffett’s group Berkshire Hathaway allowed Occidental to go ahead with the controversial deal without getting shareholder approval. Second, the $10bn was in the form of preferred shares that pay dividends at a rate of 8 per cent per year — a yield way above market rates at the time. Now Occidental’s shareholders have a third reason to be irritated. Occidental, which has been riled by the oil-price rout that has rattled the industry, is paying Buffett’s dividends in the form of shares instead of cash.The heavily indebted oil producer disclosed on Wednesday that it had issued 17.3m shares to Berkshire Hathaway, worth about $257m, equal to 1.9 per cent of the company’s equity. Shareholders did not take the share dilution well. The company’s stock price declined 12 per cent at one stage, triggering short-sale limits on the shares. Investors have punished Occidental since it took on debts of almost $50bn to clinch the $55bn Anadarko takeover, which closed in August. Loudest among them has been activist investor Carl Icahn who said in a letter lambasting Vicki Hollub, the company’s chief executive: “The Buffett deal was like taking candy from a baby.” An awkward statement surfaced on the public social media account of China’s HNA Group this week.The company, which by 2017 had spent more than $40bn on global acquisitions, was apologising to its investors for suddenly announcing a delay by a year for both principal and interest payments for a bond issued in 2013 that was due on April 15. It also said it was sorry for hastily organising a last-minute teleconference on Tuesday night to tell its investors about the delay. It was difficult to notify its large investor base on such short notice, the company said.It’s unclear if investors were moved by the apology. But the price of a separate HNA bond certainly was.The Shanghai stock exchange said on Wednesday that trading in HNA’s seven-year, Rmb3bn ($425m) bond issued by the company in 2015 was halted shortly after the market opened due to “abnormal fluctuations”. After a brief resumption, trading was again stopped after the bond fell below 30 per cent of its par value.DD readers will remember HNA as the Chinese group that seemingly came out of nowhere four years ago to buy up stakes in everything from Hilton hotels to Deutsche Bank, while also rapidly expanding its holdings in airlines assets around the world. But HNA’s glory days seem like ancient history. More recently it has shed tens of billions of dollars in global assets and also faced a cash crunch in China.Rumours have circulated about an Anbang-style government takeover that would put to rest its problems once and for all, but such a deal hasn’t taken place yet. The only substantial change in recent months has been the appointment of two senior Chinese state executives to management roles in February.The company’s problems are likely to get worse. In its apology letter, it warned that the coronavirus outbreak was having a big impact on its hotels, leisure and airlines businesses. It might need a little more help from Beijing.Moelis & Co has hired Mark Renton as managing director in its oil & gas unit.

1;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Revolvers at dawn: Inside the corporate dash for cash;Companies rush to pull on emergency funding once considered taboo ;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One scoop to start: Masayoshi Son explored an audacious leveraged buyout of SoftBank over the weekend with investors including Elliott Management and Mubadala before opting for asset sales to fund a huge share buyback and debt reduction plan. More here. Now to today’s lead topic . . .Banks offer certain perks to win over big clients. One of those is something called a credit line, which under normal circumstances is a “nice to have”. Few banks anticipate that the clients they serve will need to use the credit lines in full. Up until a few weeks ago, if companies needed more money, they could tap the $10tn US corporate bond market where cash is cheap rather than tug on the safety net of a revolver which tends to be used in emergencies. But over the past three weeks, more than 130 companies in Europe and the Americas have drawn at least $124.1bn from their lenders, according to analysis by FT reporters. The figure is probably even higher because some companies just don’t have to report it.The uncertainty injected into the market by the coronavirus — particularly as to how long a global lockdown will last — has pushed many companies to draw on their credit facilities, some of them in full. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer by volume, is among them. It pulled its entire $9bn loan facility last week to secure some flexibility in the weeks ahead. Kraft Heinz, Hilton Worldwide and Delta Air Lines also secured funding in the same way. The pain is more acute for companies in hospitality and aviation, but almost every industry is feeling it. On the day that the final car facilities across Europe halted, General Motors also drew $16bn from its credit facility, hot on the heels of Ford. Bankers at JPMorgan Chase have been kept busy, providing more dollars in credit line extensions so far this year than any other bank. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to them. JPM went into the year with more than $367bn — about 13 per cent of its $2.7tn balance sheet. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo together provided another $1.2tn of lines, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had a combined $260bn, regulatory filings show. For many people in the banking industry, this is all relatively new. But for those that have lived through other events — like the 2008 financial crisis and 9/11 — they think the worst is yet to come. Even in the aftermath of the last crisis, tapping a credit line remained taboo.On Tuesday DD told you about “Arbageddon”, today we bring you “Quant Quake”. We’re not panicking, honestly. For anyone out there that feels like they’re having a hard time adjusting to the brave new coronavirus world, perhaps you can take some comfort in the fact that even computers are malfunctioning. Quantitative hedge funds, which rely on high-powered computers, vast data sets and algorithms to turn a profit, have over the past decade been a rare bright spot in the hedge fund industry. But the turmoil inflicted by Covid-19 has unsettled even the gold standard of quant funds. DE Shaw, Two Sigma, and Renaissance — the holy trinity of quantitative investing — have all seen some of their biggest funds hurt this month, DD’s Ortenca Aliaj and our colleague Robin Wigglesworth report. One large hedge fund investor called his book of quants a “disaster”. The pain is more profound because everyone seems to have expected the strategy to perform well, as was the case in 2018 when two volatility leaps inflicted huge losses on the hedge fund industry but quants stood tall. It’s almost unheard of to see Renaissance’s flagship Institutional Equities Fund take losses even in the single digits, let alone the 18 per cent drop it suffered in the first three weeks of March. Similarly, DE Shaw’s pricey “statistical arbitrage” hedge fund Valence, which at 3-and-30 charges almost treble the industry average, lost more than 9 per cent this month. Steve Cohen’s quant unit at Point72 Asset Management has also been hit, Bloomberg reported, and is down more than 20 per cent. The glitch in the quant system is perhaps another reminder that markets aren’t functioning as expected. Investors will have to see how the “Quant Quake” shakes out.India, the world’s second most populous country, is headed into lockdown as it tries to stop the spread of the coronavirus. So depending on how you see things, Facebook’s plan to buy a multibillion-dollar stake in Reliance Jio, the mobile internet service company, has come at an opportune time.As 1.3bn Indians are locked inside their homes in the coming three weeks, internet and mobile services will be of vital importance to receive information, work from home and stay in touch with friends and family. If they can get the deal through the door, that is. The investment has been stalled by the coronavirus travel ban.The deal, first reported by the FT’s Anjli Raval, Tim Bradshaw and Benjamin Parkin, will give Facebook a 10 per cent share in Jio, whose cut-price service has attracted 370m Indians in just three years. The social media network stands to get a key foothold in the Indian market where its WhatsApp chat service already has 400m users and is about to launch a payments service. Launched four years ago by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, below, Jio is valued at more than $60bn, but its rapid expansion has lumbered Reliance with a heavy debt load.A deal with Mark Zuckerberg would help the company meet its target to cut net debt to zero in a year.

2;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US airlines show it is time to switch off buyback machine;Industry has lavished 115% of free cash flow on repurchasing shares since 2014;"As the tide recedes on stock markets with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, it has not taken long to reach the “Warren Buffett moment”. That is when we discover who in the ebbing market “is wearing shorts and who was swimming naked”, as the billionaire investor once said.Conspicuous among those lacking apparel in the present turmoil is the US airline industry. Having lavished a thumping 115 per cent of their free cash flow on share buybacks since 2014 (and that is aside from their regular dividends) America’s four biggest airlines have precious little to cover their pecuniary embarrassment. They lack the financial flexibility even to contribute materially towards the costly business interruptions that loom.Not being some optional extra but a crucial part of the US economy, that fragility has been dumped wholesale in the laps of the hard-pressed American public. Taxpayers are being asked for a $50bn bailout just to keep the airlines in the skies.Of course, airlines are not the only industry to have hollowed out their balance sheets with share buybacks, making themselves less resilient to downturns. In 2018, impelled by the boost to corporate profits delivered by President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, companies in the S&P 500 index repurchased $806bn worth of their own shares, beating the previous 2007 record by $200bn. Last year, they gobbled up $730bn.Nor have they confined themselves to surplus cash flow to do it. The proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds was as much as a third in 2016 and 2017, according to research by JPMorgan Chase.Now there is nothing wrong in principle with returning capital to investors. Companies in mature industries might lack sufficient appealing investment opportunities to absorb their surplus cash. But the buyback movement has been driven by less innocent motives. Leveraging simply to buy back shares is, as a recent article by three academics observed, “bad management, given that no revenue-generating investments are made that can allow the company to pay off the debt”.Airlines should be left to bear the financial hit for their inattentionIts real appeal to bosses lies in the scope for financial engineering. After all, buybacks do not simply gear a company’s balance sheet; they also supply a further twist by reducing the number of shares in issue. The result is to manipulate upwards the earnings per share number — sometimes dramatically.The main beneficiaries are not shareholders; buybacks tend to happen when share prices are rising anyway, and they run the risk of companies destroying value by purchasing overvalued equity. The biggest winners are managers whose pay is tied to stock market measures such as EPS growth.In many sectors, this has been all but formalised into a mechanism for self-enrichment, according to the investor Ben Hunt. Take Microsoft for instance, whose managers have perfected the art of plucking the shareholder goose without much hissing.In 2018, the tech company bought back 150m shares, “returning” $16.8bn to investors. Yet in the same year, Microsoft issued 116m new shares to employees as they exercised options or vested previously restricted stock units, in return for which it received a paltry $1.1bn in subscription cash. The net effect of this buying-high-and-selling-low strategy was to transfer 70 per cent of the value of the buyback into managers’ pockets.That is not the only way that buybacks can hurt investors. There is also the problem that managers become focused mainly on running a sort of hedge fund with a commercial business attached.Just look at Boeing under its buyback-loving former boss Dennis Muilenburg. The aircraft maker’s repurchase of $43bn of its shares between 2013 and 2019 made Mr Muilenburg extremely wealthy, helping him in 2018 to pocket $30m in compensation and gains from exercising options. But it was financed by squeezing the development cost and cutting corners on the 737 Max, whose fatal flaws and subsequent grounding have thrown the company’s future into doubt.There is nothing now to be done about the extraordinary gains made by the Big Four US airline chief executives since 2014, when they gobbled $430m in stock-based compensation. American Airlines chief Doug Parker collected $150m from selling the carrier’s stock over that period, while Ed Bastian of Delta raised another $127m from sales, despite only starting as CEO in 2016, according to Mr Hunt’s analysis of SEC filings. That money isn’t coming back.But investors should get wise to the conflicts that drive the wealth-transferring buyback engine. In the case of the airlines, that should mean leaving them to bear the financial hit for their inattention. That includes Mr Buffett, who, with Primecap Management, a large US fund, owns a quarter of the Big Four carriers’ equity.Stock market investors talk a lot about sustainable investment. Maybe it is time they thought harder about the financial sustainability of the businesses they own.jonathan.ford@ft.com"
3;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-03-13T19:11:56Z;British Airways boss warns that airline faces a fight for survival;UK group in talks for urgent financing as other carriers scramble to weather cancellations;The chief executive of British Airways has warned staff in a doom-laden memo that the carrier will have to cut jobs, suspend routes and ground aircraft because of the coronavirus pandemic.Alex Cruz told 45,000 staff in the message entitled “The Survival of British Airways” that BA was “under immense pressure” despite a robust balance sheet and the support of a strong parent company in IAG.BA has discussed a need for urgent financing with multiple lenders including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank in the past few days, according to people familiar with the matter. BA and the banks declined to comment.“Some of us have worked in aviation through the global financial crisis, the Sars outbreak and 9/11,” Mr Cruz said in the memo. “What is happening right now as a result of Covid-19 is more serious than any of these events. It is a crisis of global proportions like no other we have known.”The BA chief’s memo was the most dire of a series of warnings from airline chiefs on Friday, all of whom were scrambling to shore up their businesses following a sharp rise in cancellations and President Donald Trump’s move to block most travel by Europeans to the US.Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our companyEd Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, told employees the Atlanta-based airline was in discussions with the US government for help and taking moves to preserve cash, revealing that cancellations were outnumbering bookings for flights in the next four weeks.“The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen — and we’ve seen a lot in our business,” Mr Bastian wrote in a memo to employees. He also said he would forego his salary for the next six months.Delta is cutting capacity by 40 per cent in the next few months, which is more than it did in 2001 after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and will park 300 aircraft. It will eliminate services to continental Europe while keeping routes to London. It will defer delivery of new aircraft, reduce capital expenditures by at least $2bn for the year and cut back its use of contractors and consultants.BA was taking similar measures, including suspending routes and parking aircraft “in a way that we have never had to before”, Mr Cruz wrote to employees. “Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company,” he said. He added the carrier would have to make job cuts. BA declined to comment on the number.Germany’s Lufthansa announced it would ground more than two-thirds of its 800 planes and would drastically reduce its routes to the US, having already cancelled more than 30,000 flights to cities in China, Israel and Iran.Carsten Spohr, the group’s chief executive told staff in a video statement: “Instead of 70 daily flights to the United States, we will only be offering a dramatically reduced flight schedule with only four daily flights from tomorrow, onwards.”Air France-KLM said on Friday that it had drawn down €1.1bn of its revolving credit facility and its total liquidity now stood at €5.5bn to “limit the impact of the virus on its profitability and preserve its financial flexibility”. In a video to staff, the Franco-Dutch group’s chief executive, Ben Smith, said the company faced an “unprecedented situation” and was preparing a crisis plan after its share price halved over the past month.The French government, which owns 14.3 per cent of Air France-KLM, has promised to stand behind the company. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said on Friday that France would “help all companies in which the state has a stake . . . Whatever it costs we will be at their side.”Airlines have demanded immediate action from governments to alleviate the deepening crisis, which has further darkened an outlook for a sector estimated to be facing a hit of at least $100bn from the pandemic. The chief executive of Norwegian Air Shuttle on Friday said he was confident the government in Oslo would rescue the embattled low-cost airline. Jacob Schram said: “We have a good dialogue together and I’m absolutely confident that we will together solve the liquidity crisis.” He said Norwegian was facing “the worst crisis in the company’s history and the biggest in the country since the second world war”.Mr Bastian of Delta said while he was “optimistic” US government help would arrive, “the form and value is unpredictable, and we can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government”.Lufthansa will seek state aid from European governments and Mr Spohr, along with other German industry bosses, will take part in crisis talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday evening.Stephen Furlong, an aviation analyst at Davy, said: “This is probably a months’ issue not a years’ issue, but my god the months could change global aviation.”Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London and Joe Miller in Frankfurt
4;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Airlines slash flights to cut costs as coronavirus hits travel demand;Qantas warns slump will be ‘survival of the fittest’ as American, Delta and United lower forecasts;The crisis engulfing the airline industry deepened on Tuesday as carriers cancelled flights, withdrew earnings guidance and implemented austerity measures to cope with the travel slump caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Scott Kirby, president of United Airlines, said the carrier was bracing for revenues to fall as much as 70 per cent in April and May. “We’re planning for the public concern around the virus to get worse before it gets better,” he said.In the US, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United pulled their 2020 financial forecasts.Alan Joyce, chief executive of Qantas, said: “I think this will be a survival of the fittest,” as the Australian carrier outlined drastic cost-cutting measures that included cutting almost a quarter of international flights, asking staff to take unpaid leave and sacrificing his own salary for the next three months.“We know we can ride this out,” said Mr Joyce. “Not all airlines around the world will.”Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of the most financially stretched carriers, said it would slash 3,000 flights over the next three months, equating to about 15 per cent of its total capacity.We are taking decisive action to also protect Delta’s financial positionCracks have already begun showing in those nations worst affected by travel restrictions. Korean Air has warned it may not survive if the coronavirus outbreak is not brought under control quickly. The group has cut 80 per cent of its international capacity because of the virus, compared with 18 per cent in 1997-1998 during the Asian financial crisis.What is “daunting is that the situation can get worse at any time and we cannot even predict how long it will last”, Woo Kee-hong, Korean Air chief executive, told employees in an email seen by the Financial Times. “If the situation continues for a longer period, we may reach the threshold where we cannot guarantee the company’s survival.”China’s main carriers — Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines — have slashed routes and put pilots on unpaid leave. Some have had to refinance their fleets. Beijing has provided state subsidies and is considering a bailout for Hainan, which is China’s fourth-largest carrier.Travel demand has crumbled as coronavirus cases have surged outside China. The International Air Transport Association estimates the virus could reduce 2020 global passenger revenue by $63bn to $113bn.Delta said on Tuesday it would defer $500m in capital expenditure, suspend share repurchases and delay $500m in pension funding. In addition it introduced a hiring freeze and offered voluntary leave options as part of efforts to lower costs.“As the virus has spread, we have seen a decline in demand across all entities, and we are taking decisive action to also protect Delta’s financial position,” said Ed Bastian, chief executive.American Airlines said its overseas capacity would be reduced by 10 per cent over the peak summer travel period, including a 55 per cent reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. Domestically, capacity would be down 7.5 per cent in April, it said.Among the changes to its schedule, American said it was suspending services to mainland China and Hong Kong from Los Angeles through the summer. From Dallas-Fort Worth it was suspending services to mainland China through the summer and Hong Kong through June. The carrier is also suspending flights to Rome and Milan from Philadelphia.On the same day that Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte introduced a ban on all non-essential travel, European budget airline Ryanair suspended all flights to, from and within the country.Norwegian Air Shuttle on Tuesday said it was also introducing emergency measures, including temporary lay-offs of a significant share of its workforce. The 3,000 flight cancellations will take place over the period mid-March to mid-June. According to an internal note sent to Norwegian staff, seen by the FT, the airline said it needed “to be prepared for a scenario where we reduce capacity by up to 50 per cent.”The EU also said on Tuesday it would relax airport slot rules to aid the ailing airline industry. Under normal circumstances, carriers lose airport landing and take-off slots if they do not use them for 80 per cent of the time — a requirement that is becoming more difficult to meet in light of widespread flight cancellations because of coronavirus.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the relaxation of the rules would also decrease emissions by avoiding so-called ghost flights — when airlines fly almost empty planes simply to keep their slots. “This is just one example of a sector where help is needed and we are ready to act,” she said.British Airways cancelled all of Tuesday’s scheduled flights to Italy as the country went into lockdown in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus. Wizz Air, the low-cost carrier, also said it was suspending all flights to the country with immediate effect, as well as stopping flights to Israel from Thursday.Reporting by Mamta Badkar in New York, Tanya Powley and Naomi Rovnick in London, Jamie Smyth in Sydney, Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis in Tokyo, Nicolle Liu and Primrose Riordan in Hong Kong, John Reed in Bangkok, Song Jung-a and Edward White in Seoul, Stefania Palma in SingaporeSubscribers can use myFT to follow the latest ‘coronavirus’ coverage
5;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-12-12T18:41:45Z;Delta Air Lines: plastic fantastic ;Airline’s deal with Amex should help to insulate it against headwinds;Forget RASM, CASM, TRASM and the dizzying alphabet soup of metrics used to gauge airline stocks. When it comes to Delta Air Lines, investors should instead focus on a lucrative but often overlooked aspect of the $36bn airline’s business — its frequent flyer miles partnership with American Express.Delta has emerged as a top performing airline stock this year. Among the big four US airlines by market value Delta is the only one that has been unaffected by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets, a big advantage. The company said on Thursday it is taxiing towards a record 2019, and solid sales and profit growth in 2020. Robust travel demand and a push to sell more premium-cabin seats have helped.The share price hit a peak of $63 this summer. Shares have since retreated just over a tenth. There are concerns over rising costs, and expectations for a ramp up in industry seat capacity next year when the 737 returns to service. Uncertainty over how ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical turmoil would affect air travel is also giving investors pause.But this bearish narrative is overblown. Delta’s long standing credit card deal with Amex should help insulate the company against some of these headwinds. The partnership generated $3.4bn in revenue for Delta in 2018. That works out to nearly 8 per cent of group total. The figure is expected to more than double to $7bn by 2023, Delta says.In terms of profits, Stifel thinks the card deal carries even more weight. It reckons the programme accounted for more than a third of Delta’s operating income last year. Given its importance, there is a case to be made for Delta to report it as a separate segment on its income statement.*If anything, such a move should at least give wings to the stock’s valuation. The shares are trading at just a little over 8 times forward earnings, below its five-year average. Southwest and JetBlue both command a higher multiple.

6;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-12-12T12:00:27Z;Delta sees revenue growth continuing next year;Chief executive Bastian calls 2019 ‘the best year in Delta’s history by almost all measures’;Delta Air Lines expects to fly through the “headwinds” of US election uncertainty and the return of Boeing’s 737 Max planes to competitors’ schedules to produce revenue growth of 4 to 6 per cent in 2020, the US carrier will tell investors on Thursday.Ed Bastian, chief executive, told the Financial Times that 2019 would be “the best year in Delta’s history by almost all measures”, and predicted that momentum would continue, allowing it to report diluted earnings per share of $6.75-$7.75 next year. Analysts’ consensus estimates see Delta’s earnings hitting $6.99 per share in 2019 and $7.06 in 2020.Mr Bastian said November’s election and the return of the Max would pose “some interesting challenges” for the company. As in 2016, he expected the election year to “weigh somewhat” on US consumer and business sentiment, which has been buoying Delta’s traffic.Delta has claimed to have seen little advantage from not having the Max in its fleet at a time when rivals including Southwest and American have had to ground many of their planes for months after two fatal crashes. Similarly, Mr Bastian said he expected the impact of its return to service to be localised and not material to Delta.The Federal Aviation Administration faced sharp criticism on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for not grounding the Max even after its own risk analysis showed it was more accident-prone than most aircraft.Mr Bastian said he had not seen the FAA administrator’s testimony but believed that “we will all learn from what happened with the Max”. As regulatory changes were made in response, “I expect they will be for the benefit of our customers and our people,” he said.The Atlanta-based airline will use Thursday’s investor day presentation to portray itself as the best-positioned operator in a structurally improved industry.It will tell shareholders it plans to produce $4bn of free cash flow in 2020, 70 per cent of which it intends to distribute in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Mr Bastian said it remained interested in a proposed €100m investment in Alitalia, the struggling Italian carrier.Delta’s stock is up 10 per cent this year but investors were rattled in October by the prospect of Delta’s costs per available seat mile rising above inflation as it hires 1,300 more pilots next year to meet demand.Mr Bastian said it would confirm on Thursday that it expected non-fuel costs to grow by 2 to 3 per cent on a unit basis, stressing that it would be able to maintain profit margins.In a separate announcement, Delta said it would merge its private jets business with Wheels Up, a venture-backed company whose membership programmes give 6,000 users access to a fleet of over 115 private aircraft.Mr Bastian declined to disclose what sum of money was changing hands but said Delta would have a minority stake in Wheels Up, which struck its last fundraising in August at a valuation of $1.1bn.The partners hoped to make private aviation “accessible to the masses” by using technology to lower costs, he said.
7;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-10-10T17:32:59Z;Delta Air Lines confident about US demand after earnings soar;Carrier hails rise in domestic revenues and points to strong bookings for holiday season;Delta Air Lines sees no hint of a slowdown in demand from US leisure and business travellers, the Atlanta-based carrier said on Thursday, as it reported better than expected third-quarter earnings coupled with rising costs. Net income for the three months to September 30, adjusted for swings in the value of Delta’s stakes in international airlines, rose 21.5 per cent to $1.51bn, lifting adjusted earnings per share 29 per cent to $2.32.That was 6 cents above the consensus of analysts’ forecasts but Delta’s shares fell 3.8 per cent to $51.85 in morning trading as investors reacted to news that it expected costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel, to rise another 4-5 per cent in the fourth quarter as it steps up hiring to meet rising demand.“We see growth in demand for air travel, and particularly for Delta, like nothing we’ve seen in a very long time,” Ed Bastian, chief executive, told the Financial Times. Revenues, excluding fuel sales from a refinery it owns, rose 6.5 per cent to a new quarterly record, while Delta added 2.5 points to its operating margin. Investors are scanning the third-quarter US earnings season for signs of economic slowdown, but Mr Bastian pointed to a 7.8 per cent increase in domestic revenues in the quarter and strong bookings for the upcoming holiday season. “The US consumer continues to be very healthy,” he said.“The business customer is confident in the US,” Mr Bastian added, pointing to even stronger growth in corporate revenues, up 8 per cent. Premium revenues rose 11 per cent, reflecting Delta’s efforts to narrow the price gap between its premium-priced seats and those in the main cabin as well as allowing customers to use air miles to upgrade.Mr Bastian said Delta had taken share from its domestic rivals in the period, but attributed little of its growth to its advantage in not having the Boeing 737 Max in its fleet. Rivals including Southwest and American have been forced to ground the planes for months as regulators work through the aftermath of two deadly crashes. On Wednesday, American Airlines pushed back the time it expected Max flights to resume by six weeks, saying it was cancelling 115 flights a day until November 2 and now expected the Max to start returning to its schedule on January 16 after regulators approve software updates by Boeing. “We certainly picked up incremental demand from the Max being down, but I don’t think it was material,” said Mr Bastian, adding that he expected a similarly limited benefit in the fourth quarter.Union officials told Reuters on Wednesday that Delta pilots had earned record sums of overtime pay because the disruption to rivals had prompted Delta to add 4.5 per cent more capacity.In its earnings statement, Delta attributed a 2.4 per cent rise in non-fuel unit costs in part to employee costs, but noted that it had announced a 4 per cent increase in base pay rates for some ground staff and flight attendants in the quarter.Delta’s international performance was more uneven, with Pacific revenues falling 4.6 per cent. Delta cited “weaker macroeconomics [and] trade uncertainty”, and Mr Bastian noted that it had seen customers cut back on flights between its Detroit hub and car manufacturing bases in China and Japan.Revenues on transatlantic routes increased 3.2 per cent. “Certainly, economic challenges within the EU including Brexit weigh on travel,” said Mr Bastian. He was monitoring Brexit negotiations but said he was “not overly concerned” about their potential impact on the company, which owns a substantial stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways.Earlier this month, a World Trade Organization ruling in a long-running US-EU state aid dispute cleared the path for the Trump administration to impose a 10 per cent levy on new planes from Airbus, the European manufacturer that counts Delta as a customer. Delta was examining its options to mitigate any cost increases, Mr Bastian said, but did not expect any impact in the fourth quarter. “Tariffs cost the consumer eventually and our industry is already one of the most heavily taxed industries,” he said.
8;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-07-11T14:57:13Z;Delta boosts profit outlook as airline dodges 737 Max fallout;Grounding of 737 Max aircraft has boosted fares and was a ‘marginal benefit’ for carrier;Delta Air Lines on Thursday raised its profit outlook, pointing to strong domestic demand, lower fuel costs and moves by rivals to ground the 737 Max jet.The Atlanta-based carrier boosted its full-year earnings outlook to between $6.75 to $7.25 a share, up from its previous forecast for between $6 to $7 a share.The rosier guidance accompanied upbeat second-quarter results, boosted by higher demand and higher revenue from premium seats as well as lower fuel costs.Chief executive Ed Bastian also told Reuters it had seen a “marginal benefit” from the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max planes. A spokesperson confirmed the comments.Delta does not use any 737 Max aircraft, which are used by rivals like United, American and Southwest and that continue to be grounded following two fatal crashes in which 346 people died. As a result, the company hasn’t faced similar fleet woes. However, the grounding of the 737 Max has raised the industry’s pricing power as seat availability has been restricted.American Airlines on Wednesday warned of a $185m hit to its second quarter pre-tax profit as a result of flight cancellations because of the grounding. Its fleet currently includes 24 737 Max 8 aircraft, with an additional 76 on order. However, it bolstered its outlook for a closely watched gauge of pricing power.In its fiscal second quarter, Delta said revenues rose 6.5 per cent from a year ago to $12.54bn, just ahead of expectations for $12.5bn, according to a Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts.“With record passenger loads, customer satisfaction and $1 billion in revenue growth for the June quarter, demand for Delta’s customer-focused product and service has never been stronger,” said Mr Bastian.The carrier, which serves 200m passengers annually, said its total passenger revenue climbed 8 per cent from a year ago, while its fuel expenses fell 2 per cent over the same period.Net income rose to $1.4bn or $2.21 a share in the three months ended in June, up from $1.04bn or $1.49 a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of $2.35 a share, topping expectations for $2.28 a share.In the September quarter, the company forecast earnings of between $2.10 to $2.40 a share, ahead of analyst expectations.Delta shares, which are up nearly 20 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s close, were up more than 1 per cent to $60.20.
9;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-04-02T16:29:45Z;Delta shares soar on upbeat March quarter outlook;;Healthy corporate demand, lower fuel costs and a March quarter record of 45m passengers carried prompted Delta Air Lines to boost its revenue outlook for the period.The upbeat outlook — which sent Delta shares more than 7 per cent higher and boosted those of its rivals — comes after a challenging time, as the US airline industry contended with the partial shutdown of the government and more recently the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets amid safety concerns.Delta, the second-biggest carrier in the US, said it expects to report growth in total unit revenue — a closely watched industry metric — of 2 per cent in the three months ended March 31, “as overall demand remains healthy, led by corporate volume”. That is an improvement from the flat to 2 per cent growth it guided to back in January.The company also said it now expects top-line revenue growth of 7 per cent — nearly double the pace implied by the median forecast among Wall Street analysts — and a “record-setting operational performance” in the March quarter.Non-fuel unit costs were expected to be flat to up 0.5 per cent, which would be a better outcome than the 1 per cent to 2 per cent previously pencilled in, while adjusted earnings are forecast to come in between 85 cents and 95 cents a share, versus the median estimate among analysts in a Refinitiv poll of 80 cents.The revised outlook follows a shaky few months for the Atlanta-based company. It cut its fourth-quarter revenue target in early January. Then barely a fortnight later cut its March quarter outlook and warned the partial shutdown of the US government would weigh on revenue, to the tune of an estimated $25m a month, although it did highlight at the time corporate demand had been strong.The all-time high number of passengers Delta carried for a March quarter was underpinned by a monthly record for March itself of 17.6m.Shares were up 7.1 per cent in morning trade to an almost four-month high of $55.87. Rivals were also buoyed by Delta’s outlook, with United Continental up 3.9 per cent and American Airlines up 3.2 per cent.Southwest Airlines was up a more modest 1.3 per cent. The carrier is one of the biggest users of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, which became subject to a global grounding in March following two fatal crashes in the space of five months. Analysts suggested concerned customers might switch to airlines like Delta that do not operate 737 Max 8 (or its variants) aircraft, and Southwest itself lowered its guidance late last month, primarily owing to the recent grounding.Delta also renewed its contract for its co-branded credit card with American Express through 2029. It said it expected benefits from the partnership to hit nearly $7bn annually by 2023, from $3.4bn in 2018.
10;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-03-13T21:04:59Z;Aviation stocks recover after US grounds 737 Max;;Shares in most US airline stocks recovered from a drop after the US ordered the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, bringing in line with international peers that had suspended operations of the jet in the days following an Ethiopian Airlines crash.Boeing clawed its way back to close 0.5 per cent higher on Wednesday, recovering from a drop of as much as 3.2 per cent.The company said in a statement it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but following consultation with US authorities and customers around the world said it would recommend to the Federal Aviation Administration a temporary suspension of the entire global fleet of the aircraft, which totals 371 jets.Other US aviation stocks also peeled off their lows. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines are the largest US-based operators of the 737 Max 8 jet — the same model involved in the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash — with 31 and 24 of the aircraft, respectively. Their shares were up 0.4 per cent and up 3 per cent, respectively.United Airlines, which operates 737 Max 9 models that will now also be grounded, finished up 1.7 per cent. Delta Air Lines, which does not operate any 737 Max aircraft, was up 0.7 per cent.Over the course of this week, the share prices of most operators of 737 Max aircraft have been dented (see above chart) as airlines grounded their relevant jets and as some countries banned flights of the aircraft even if none of their national carriers use them.Concerns over the 737 Max fleet have not been negative for all aviation stocks this week, though. The big winner has been Boeing’s main rival, Airbus, which is up more than 6 per cent over the past three sessions.Earlier this week, Atlanta-based Delta was seen as a possible beneficiary if anxious flyers cancelled or avoided bookings with rival US carriers. Its shares are up 2.9 per cent over the past three days.And although Mexico’s Aeromexico and Brazil’s Gol grounded the aircraft in question, their shares have advanced since last Friday.
11;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-02-13T21:40:48Z;Delta and EasyJet explore joint bid for Alitalia;Airlines join with Italian state-backed railway company to kick-start talks;Delta and EasyJet confirmed on Wednesday that they had joined hands with Italy’s state-backed railway company Ferrovie dello Stato to explore a bid to take over the country’s troubled national carrier Alitalia.A sale of Alitalia, which was placed into administration in 2017 after a string of restructurings and investments over the past decade had failed to shift the Italian flag carrier’s fortunes, has been years in the making and drawn a handful of interested bidders.Ferrovie dello Stato said that it would begin negotiations with Delta and EasyJet to agree a plan for Alitalia. Delta and EasyJet confirmed that talks with the state-backed rail company were ongoing. EasyJet cautioned that there was “no certainty” it would proceed with a transaction to buy a stake in Alitalia.To secure a deal EasyJet and Delta would need to convince the Italian government that they are the best partners to stabilise Alitalia, which has suffered large financial losses and has struggled to compete with low cost rivals.Italian news media reported on Wednesday that the country’s rightwing populist coalition government would be inclined to back a deal with Delta and EasyJet, as long as Ferrovie dello Stato retained a majority stake in Alitalia.The sale and restructuring of Alitalia had earlier been delayed by the change in government in Rome. The new populist leadership has made it clear to prospective bidders that any offer should include a domestic group owning a majority stake in Alitalia.“The government is willing to participate in the creation of a New Alitalia, through the economy ministry, on the condition that this is in line with European rules and that there is a sustainable business plan in place,” prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s office said in a statement. Mr Conte had earlier on Wednesday met with his deputy Luigi Di Maio and economic minister Giovanni Tria to discuss a rescue plan for Alitalia.The lossmaking carrier has been circled by suitors before, and had earlier counted Gulf carrier Etihad as a minority shareholder before its collapse in 2017. International airlines Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, as well as private equity group Cerberus Capital Management, had all previously approached Alitalia.Lufthansa has said it is only interested in acquiring Alitalia if the airline conducts a round of extensive job cuts while in administration. The German carrier also has made its offer conditional on getting full control of Alitalia, without government ownership. Air France-KLM was not expected to renew its interest in the carrier in the latest round of bidding, the FT reported last year.
12;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-01-15T14:05:11Z;US government shutdown to weigh on Delta revenue growth in Q1;;Delta Air Lines, the second-biggest carrier in the US, did little to allay investor concerns about the outlook for the industry in 2019, warning that the US government shutdown would weigh on revenue growth in its current quarter.The warning, which also highlighted currency fluctuations and the timing of Easter as challenges, came as the company reported fourth quarter revenues that were roughly in line with recently downgraded guidance and earnings at the higher end of forecasts.“Our March quarter adjusted unit revenue growth is expected to be flat to up two per cent including impacts from the timing of Easter, increasing currency headwinds, and the ongoing government shutdown,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta president, in a statement.That poses an additional challenge for the company, as well as its peers, having already cautioned investors at the start of this month that it was struggling to keep raising ticket prices.Delta said it expects to report earnings of 70 cents to 90 cents a share in its first quarter, which is below Wall Street forecasts for 99 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Analysts had estimated year-on-year revenue growth of about 4.7 per cent in the current quarter, to about $10.4bn.Still, Ed Bastain, Delta’s chief executive, said the company expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth in 2019 by keeping control of costs and thanks to the “modest benefit” from lower fuel prices.For the three months ended December 31, Delta reported adjusted total revenue of $10.7bn. It said adjusted revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) — a closely-followed measure of airline profitability — rose 3.2 per cent, a little ahead with its recently trimmed guidance of 3 per cent.Adjusted earnings of $1.30 a share came in three cents ahead of analyst expectations, and at the top end of the company’s recently upgraded guidance range of $1.25 to $1.30.American Airlines followed in Delta’s footsteps and last week cut its full-year profit guidance, saying it had a “lower than anticipated improvement” from its strong performance in the domestic market during the fourth quarter in 2017.Delta shares, down about a fifth over the past 12 months, were down 0.9 per cent in pre-market trading.
13;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2019-01-03T18:00:35Z;Delta revenue warning dents US airline stocks;Lowered forecast sparks investor fears over ticket pricing;Delta Air Lines sent US airline stocks sliding on Thursday, after warning that fourth-quarter revenues would be lower than forecast and reviving investors’ concerns the industry will struggle to keep raising ticket prices.The carrier predicted that adjusted unit revenue for the fourth quarter would rise 3 per cent, compared with prior guidance of 3.5 per cent, and an initial guidance range of 3 per cent to 5 per cent.Investors worried that revenues will weaken in 2019 in an industry that has been notorious for profit-sapping price competition. Shares in Delta were down 9 per cent by mid-morning in New York, American Airlines shares fell 8 per cent and United Continental dropped 5 per cent. “The overall demand environment remains healthy with strength in both business and leisure segments throughout the quarter,” Delta said in an investor update, but it added a note of caution on the pace of ticket price rises at the end of last year: “While close-in yield momentum continues, the pace of improvement in late December was more modest than anticipated.”Delta predicted fourth-quarter earnings per share would be $1.25 to $1.30, at the high end of its previous guidance range of $1.10 to $1.30. It also forecast fuel prices would drop by 10 cents a gallon for the fourth quarter, with a gallon of fuel expected to cost $2.38 to $2.43.But investors focused on the expected decline in unit revenues.Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen, wrote in a note: “This is exactly why investors are apprehensive about getting involved in the group in a declining fuel environment. In the past, the airlines have competed away gains from lower fuel as they reward customers with lower fares. With oil trending lower in recent months, investors are worried this time will not be different.”Delta said it expected its non-fuel unit costs to be down approximately 0.5 per cent year-on-year due to cost control and fleet changes.Jim Corridore, airline analyst at CFRA research, said the share price decline was an overreaction. “Investors must have been hoping for a large EPS beat for the fourth quarter,” instead of the slight increase that Delta gave in its investor update, he wrote in a note. “We think these numbers show decent demand, and we see 2019 benefiting from higher fares, lower fuel costs and solid traffic numbers. We think shares are overreacting today.”
14;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-12-13T19:30:30Z;Weak earnings guidance from Delta clips airline sector’s wings;;Airline stocks suffered a broad sell-off on Thursday as weaker than expected earnings guidance from Delta Air Lines further rattled already shaky sentiment towards the sector.Delta fell 4.7 per cent to hit a six-week low of $53.60 after the country’s second-largest carrier by revenue said it expects 2019 fiscal earnings to come in at between $6 to $7 per diluted share. The midpoint trails the average of $6.70 that Wall Street had forecast.Top line growth is projected to be between 4-6 per cent next year, compared to the 5 per cent analysts are expecting.Some in the market had hoped the carrier would issue a more bullish outlook given the recent pullback in crude prices. Oil has tumbled nearly 30 per cent since hitting a four-year high in late October, providing Delta and other carriers with a much needed respite from mounting fuel costs.In an effort to drum up more revenues, Delta has been increasing ticket prices and baggage fees. But the worry among investors is that these gains could be eroded by slowing global growth and rising seat capacity across the industry.Delta said it would expand capacity by 3 per cent next year. A day earlier, United Continental reiterated its plans to boost its flight network by another 4 to 6 per cent in 2019.US airline stocks have been convulsed by repeated bouts of selling since March amid concerns that an increase in capacity could lead to a fare war. Jitters over the health of the sector have been fanned by the sharp run-up in oil prices over the past year as well as losses and costs related to a series of devastating hurricanes that have hit the US this year.The underwhelming outlook from Delta also clipped the wings of rival carriers.United Continental was down 2.9 per cent, American Airlines shed 4.2 per cent, Southwest lost 1.7 per cent while JetBlue Airways traded 2.2 per cent lower.The wider NYSE Arca Airline Index dropped 2.3 per cent, putting the gauge back in correction territory, defined as a drop of 10 per cent or more from a recent week.The index slumped into bear market earlier in June, and despite a November rally spurred by lower oil prices, it remains down some 17.2 per cent for the year.
15;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-12-04T16:14:13Z;Delta outlook disappoints despite fuel price tailwind;;Delta Air Lines issued fresh quarterly guidance that underwhelmed Wall Street, sending shares lower on Tuesday, even as the company benefits from a sharp decline in oil prices.The company said it expects to register a 3.5 per cent increase in unit revenue, excluding refinery sales, for the fourth quarter ending in December. That comes at the low end of Delta’s prior forecast of 3 to 5 per cent growth.But the second-largest US airline also said it remains on track to expand pre-tax margins in the current quarter, thanks to the “recent moderation in fuel prices” and other cost controls. In the initial fourth-quarter guidance it gave in October, Delta said it was bracing for a 30 per cent increase in fuel prices year-over-year, and during the summer, it announced a planned increase in fares and fewer flights to counter rising fuel costs.Last month’s rout in oil prices, which saw West Texas Intermediate crude dip below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than a year, could be a boon to airlines’ profits. Jet fuel bills accounted for 21 per cent of the global airline industry’s operating expenses in 2017, according to the International Air Transport Association.Delta projected earnings per share at the high end of its previously announced forecast of $1.10 to $1.30 for the December quarter. Analysts polled by Refinitiv are looking for earnings of $1.23 a share.The Atlanta-based company forecast top-line growth of 7.5 per cent, near its initial guidance of around 8 per cent.In November, traffic rose 4.2 per cent to 16.83m revenue passenger miles. Available seat miles were up 3.8 per cent.Shares in Delta fell 3.3 per cent in morning trading.
16;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-11-05T05:00:34Z;Delta says price rises will help cover higher fuel costs;Chief executive Ed Bastian reports solid demand despite US-China trade war;Ed Bastian, Delta Air Lines chief executive, says the airline expects to recoup $2bn in higher fuel costs this year partly by increasing ticket prices, thanks to continuing passenger demand despite the US-China trade war and concerns about a slowdown in the US economy.“Demand is strong and when demand is strong it gives you a good opportunity to price and recover,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “We’re expecting fuel costs up $2bn year on year for us in ’18, but we’re also anticipating our overall profits to be about flat” at around $5bn.“On that simple premise we recovered almost all the fuel increase within the year which, on that size of increase, hasn’t been done before,” he said, adding “we’re managing the other costs of our business well. In the third quarter our non-fuel costs were flat”. His comments come at the end of a US third-quarter earnings season during which several US carriers reported stronger than expected profits despite fuel prices up nearly a third from a year ago. “We are seeing revenue accelerate at a fairly robust clip, with management teams stating this is the best revenue environment in recent memory,” Helane Becker, airline analyst at Cowen, wrote in a recap of third-quarter earnings. We are seeing revenue accelerate at a fairly robust clip, with management teams stating this is the best revenue environment in recent memoryThe news has eased investor concerns about a price war, and worries about the impact of fuel costs, which depressed airline shares earlier this year. The NYSE Arca Airline index is down nearly 13 per cent year to date, but it has regained some ground since carriers announced third-quarter results. United Continental said it expects to be able to recoup about 90 per cent of the rise in fuel prices for the full year.Asked whether he sees any signs that US consumers are cutting travel plans ahead of an expected slowdown, Mr Bastian said: “We don’t see any cracks, the economy continues to be strong, demand is healthy, consumer confidence is still relatively strong . . . when thinking about the economy at large, domestically, we don’t see any material change”.“Our corporate revenue base is healthy,” he said, adding “that would be the first place we’d start to see some slip in demand from a political issue or economics, but our corporate revenues year to date are up 10 per cent so I feel pretty good”. The trade dispute between the US and China is “not having an impact on demand as best we can tell or in terms of pricing,” he said, adding that Delta’s Chinese revenues are up by double digits year on year. Transatlantic travel has not so far been impacted by the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, he said, adding that he “finds it hard to believe” that there will not be some kind of deal between the US, UK and Europe to allow air travel to continue to grow. Reflecting on the tenth anniversary last month of Delta’s merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008, soon after Delta emerged from bankruptcy in 2007, he said the merger had allowed the carrier to make the investments to become a global airline. “Mechanical reliability” had also improved with a 99 per cent reduction in cancellations because of maintenance, from 5,500 in 2010 to 75 year to date, he said. Airline fares are at the same level as 10 years ago, adjusted for inflation, he said, helping create an atmosphere where “consumers are incredibly resilient when it comes to travel.”
17;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Airlines slide after Delta details earnings hit from Hurricane Florence;;US airline stocks lost some of their altitude on Tuesday as a trading update from one of the sector’s leading carriers underwhelmed investors.Delta Air Lines led the decline, falling 3.6 per cent to $54.57 after warning earlier this morning it would take a $30m hit to its third-quarter earnings as a result of Hurricane Florence. The category 1 storm, which battered the Carolina coasts last month, resulted in over 1,000 cancelled flights across the sector and the closing of dozens of airports in the area.Delta said the hit to pre-tax earnings will shave 0.5 percentage point off total revenue for each seat flown a mile (TRASM) — a closely watched industry metric — for the September quarter.This means TRASM for the period will now rise by between 4-4.5 per cent, compared to the median forecast for a 4.5 per cent increase.Adjusted diluted earnings per share is seen to be in the $1.70-$1.80 range, also undershooting the $1.77 average that the market had expected.The warning from Delta weighed on the wider airline sector, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index down 0.9 per cent for the day. Within this, United Continental fell 1.3 per cent, American Airlines shed 2.6 per cent while Southwest Airlines traded 0.8 per cent lower.Concerns over the potential financial blow from Florence come as airlines are already being squeezed by higher fuel and labour costs while a ramp-up in the supply of seats in the domestic market has kept a lid on ticket prices and margins.In a bid to generate more revenue from sources other than ticket sale, airlines including American, Delta, United and JetBlue all moved last month to raise prices for check-in luggages.

One person familiar with the move said it was designed to find a clever solution to the problem.These demands are the mark of insecure, impotent leaders who know the future will not belong to themAmerican said it had taken the same approach in the way it referred to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. But its website still lists “China” for Beijing and Shanghai flights. Passengers booking flights to Europe, Latin America and other parts of Asia on all three carriers will see the country name listed with their destination city.The Chinese foreign ministry initially suggested that the changes would suffice. But the Chinese aviation regulation then said that their efforts were “incomplete” and that it would “pay close attention” before making a determination.Doug Parker, American’s chief executive, said on Thursday that he thought the US carrier had come up with a “nice solution”.“We had a deadline, we complied with the deadline with what we thought was a nice solution for everyone and hopefully that will be the case,” said Mr Parker. “This is a matter of international affairs that is more important to those countries than to American Airlines and we don’t want to intervene in that process.”The approach taken by the US carriers stood in contrast to some other foreign airlines, which went further by adding either “China” or “CN” to their destinations in Taiwan. Air Canada’s website says “Taipei, Taiwan, CN” for flights to Taiwan, while Qantas uses, “Taipei, Taiwan, China”. British Airways uses “Taipei, Taiwan — China”.The US airlines came under fire from some Republican politicians, including Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator who is a hawk on US foreign policy.“It’s disappointing that American Airlines, Delta, and United complied with this ultimatum, but the Chinese Communist party’s obsession with Taiwan — the only democracy on Chinese soil — is pathetic,” said Mr Cotton. “These demands are the mark of insecure, impotent leaders who know the future will not belong to them.”Chris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey, also criticised the move and urged the US carriers “not to succumb to Beijing’s ‘Orwellian nonsense’”. He said the US should “push back against this type of economic coercion and censorship”.Aviation experts said the airlines were caught in a bind because while they did not want to antagonise the White House, and possibly provoke criticism from President Donald Trump, they were concerned at losing the ability to service what is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world.“The US airline industry is a global business that must contend with a host of regulations and requirements,” said Airlines for America, an industry lobby group, which added that it and the airlines “appreciate the engagement and counsel we have received from the [Trump] administration”.A Taiwan government spokesperson said Taipei was exploring possible litigation on the issue, adding: “Taiwan has been closely interconnected with the world, and defending our shared democratic values on the front-line. That is a fact which cannot be easily erased by simply removing the name of Taiwan from the internet. The people of Taiwan will not bow to pressure.“We call on international society to take China’s aggressive international conduct seriously, and work together to prevent an expansion of such unwanted pressure.”After Beijing issued the demand in May, the White House described it as “ Orwellian nonsense” and asked carriers to leave negotiations to the US government. But one industry expert said China had refused to engage in talks with the US administration.The capitulation by the airlines comes as the US and China are locked in an escalating trade war. Some China experts say the trade tensions have reduced leverage with Beijing — from the fracas over Taiwan to dealing with North Korea.While the White House tried to convince the airlines that it could protect them, carriers were worried that Beijing would respond to non-compliance by denying them landing spots in China.The Chinese pressure came as Washington, from Congress to the Trump administration, has taken a tougher stance towards Beijing over Taiwan. In March, Mr Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which urges exchanges between US officials and their counterparts in Taiwan, despite official protest from Beijing.China views Taiwan as an inalienable part of its sovereign territory and hopes to assume control of the island. The US deals with Taiwan under its “One China policy”, a four-decade-old diplomatic formula under which Washington recognises Beijing as the capital of China while maintaining unofficial relations with the island of 23m people, mainly through a liaison office in Taipei.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir and Ben BlandFollow Demetri Sevastopulo on Twitter: @dimi

22;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-07-12T11:52:00Z;Delta slashes earnings outlook as higher fuel costs bite;America’s second-largest carrier becomes latest US airline to warn on profits;Delta Air Lines has become the latest US airline to issue a profit warning as a spike in fuel prices pushed its operating costs sharply higher.The US’s second-largest carrier by passenger traffic said it now expected full-year earnings to come in at between $5.35 to $5.70 a share. This is a sharp decline from the $6.35 to $6.70 range it forecast in January and comes as Delta warned on Thursday that it expects its fuel bill to surge by $2bn in 2018.Oil prices have rallied more than 56 per cent over the past 12 months, pushing up fuel prices and crimping profits even as airlines report stronger passenger and revenue growth. The challenges facing the airline industry were underscored by Delta’s second-quarter results.While total revenue topped expectations, rising 10 per cent to $11.78bn for the June quarter, net income fell to $1.03bn, or $1.47 per share, from $1.19bn, or $1.62 per share, in the same period a year ago.Delta flew more passengers and made more revenue per passenger during the quarter. Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) — a closely followed measure of airline profitability — increased 4.6 per cent in the quarter, boosted by higher average fares.The passenger revenue momentum that we saw accelerating into the second quarter is continuing into the third quarterHowever, this was more than offset by the 38 per cent — or $653m — jump in fuel expenses during the period. Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, sought to strike an upbeat tone, saying steps taken by the company to recoup the higher fuels costs — including reducing less profitable flights — are showing signs of success. “We have seen early success in addressing the fuel cost increase and offset two-thirds of the impact in the June quarter,” he said. “With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end.”On a call with analysts, Mr Bastian stressed that passenger demand remains strong. “The passenger revenue momentum that we saw accelerating into the second quarter is continuing into the third quarter,” he said, adding that the current US-China trade battle had not had any effect on travel. “Who knows where the thing goes but we aren’t seeing any negative impacts currently.”Mr Bastian’s positive comments sent Delta shares up about 1 per cent in morning trading, though the carrier’s stock remains about 11 per cent down for the year to date. Delta’s results come a day after American Airlines trimmed guidance for second-quarter growth for TRASM, sending airline shares lower across the board. Analysts said concern about fare weakness are exacerbating investor worries about the unexpected jump in fuel prices. “Delta and other airlines have not been able fully to recapture the move in oil prices with higher fares as there is typically a 6 to 12 month lag,” said Helane Becker, a Cowen airline analyst. “We believe Delta is now in a position to raise numbers going forward rather than continuing to reduce numbers,” she wrote.
23;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-06-12T11:00:29Z;Delta, Qantas and the rise of CEO activism;Business school professors study leaders who take a position on controversial topics;Delta Air Lines cancelled its discounts to members of the National Rifle Association in February after a shooting in a Florida school that killed 17 teachers and students, one of the deadliest school massacres in the US.Edward Bastian, chief executive, was acting on a sense of moral conviction over a matter unrelated to Delta’s core business, says Aaron Chatterji of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. Prof Chatterji studies what he calls “CEO activism” and he believes it to be on the rise. In Delta’s case, speaking out had consequences: pushback from lawmakers.A few days after the Delta statement, legislators in the airline’s home state of Georgia responded by scrapping a planned jet-fuel tax break. Casey Cagle, the state’s deputy governor, commented on Twitter: “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.”Prof Chatterji says that in his experience a legislator had never punished a company so quickly, and that he believes more examples will follow. “And the cost of these actions will be higher,” he says.With high stakes, why are chief executives getting involved in politics? Prof Chatterji believes the growing polarisation of the debate is part of the explanation. “Being in the neutral middle, where most companies used to be a generation ago, is no longer tenable,” he says. “It is seen as lacking authenticity.”Chief executives are not speaking out because they want to, but because their customers expect them to. The current climate, he says, is driven by social media, acting as a microphone that is always on.Almost half of millennials in the US would be more likely to buy from a company whose chief executive takes a public position on a contentious issue, compared with fewer than a third of Generation X-ers and Baby Boomers, according to a 2017 survey by Weber Shandwick and KRC Research.A survey by the PR firm Global Strategy Group found that in 2017, 81 per cent of Americans expected companies to “take action to address important issues facing society”.Still, some chief executives claim to be speaking out because of a sense of conviction, echoed by Mr Bastian in a memo to employees: “Our values are not for sale.”Another example of CEO activism is Kenneth Frazier of Merck, who resigned from Donald Trump’s business advisory council after the US president failed to condemn neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville last year. More CEOs followed, and the president’s council subsequently disbanded.On Twitter, Mr Frazier wrote: “As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” Less than an hour later, the president accused Mr Frazier on Twitter of moving jobs out of the US, before declaring he would now have more time to “lower rip-off drug prices”. Merck declined to comment.In 2017, Qantas chief Alan Joyce had a pie thrown in his face by a protester who accused him of being part of a corporate network trying to “impose” same-sex marriage on Australians, after the chief executive publicly supported the new law.Dorothy Crenshaw, founder of Crenshaw Communications, a New York-based PR consulting agency that specialises in tech brands, says executives at multinationals are “deeply concerned” about the pressure to engage with social issues. “Many do not want to change,” she says.CEO activism is risky, she points out. “One mistake executives make is to retreat,” Ms Crenshaw says, explaining that once a chief has taken a stance on an issue, she or he should stay cool, even — or especially — when they are attacked on social media.Michael Toffel, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied the topic with Prof Chatterji, says leaders are right to feel pressured as expectations are growing. “And leaders in these positions do not feel well-equipped,” he says.Profs Chatterji and Prof Toffel teach courses on leadership and have written a teaching case study on CEO activism to encourage faculties at other business schools to cover the topic.Prof Chatterji says the distinction of what constitutes a “business issue” is changing. “Now CEOs are speaking about guns, and in the future all issues will be fair game,” he says.
24;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-06-05T16:33:48Z;White House presses US airlines to resist Beijing over Taiwan;Trump administration’s pushback over ‘Orwellian nonsense’ adds to Sino-US tensions;The Trump administration has urged United Airlines and other US carriers to ignore Chinese demands over how they refer to Taiwan, in the latest example of mounting friction between the US and China.US officials have asked United, American Airlines and Delta not to comply with a Chinese demand to write “Taiwan, China” instead of Taiwan on their websites and maps, according to five people familiar with the issue. The request came after China ordered 36 foreign airlines to remove any language which implied that Taiwan, a democratically ruled independent island claimed by Beijing, was not part of China.The White House last month described the Chinese order as “Orwellian nonsense”. Trump administration officials have urged the airlines to push back and to tell China, which has extended the deadline until late June, that the Taiwan issue should be handled by the US and Chinese governments.American Airlines declined to comment on the specifics of discussions with the government. But Doug Parker, its chief executive, last week told the Financial Times that the Taiwan issue was “between countries”.“The United States has replied to the Chinese government and as a result we are following the direction of the US government,” said Mr Parker, who would not say if he viewed the order as Orwellian nonsense. “I’m not certain if we are obliged to [heed the US government guidance] but right now it is between our government and their government and we are following the guidance of our government.”One person familiar with the talks between the US and the airlines said one top official had discussed the issue with Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive. Several people said the National Security Council had been unusually involved in the talks with the airlines, but a White House spokesperson denied that assertion.United declined to comment. Delta said it was reviewing the Chinese request and would “remain in close consultation with the US government”.While the White House argues that it can help provide cover for the US carriers, the Chinese threat poses a big problem for the airlines since they could lose landing spots in China for not complying. It also comes as the Chinese market becomes increasingly important for the global aviation market.“If airlines are denied landing rights, they will simply have to deal with the commercial realities presented by the Chinese government and US top cover won’t help,” said Evan Medeiros, a former White House Asia official. “The only message the Chinese will understand is if the airlines, for their own reasons, are not willing to accept Chinese demands. The Chinese know the pressure points, and it is airline operations and not government-to-government interactions.”Qantas this week became the latest foreign airline to say it would comply with the Chinese order, despite reservations from Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, who said companies “should be free to conduct their usual business operations free from political pressure”. Alan Joyce, chief executive of Qantas, said the Australian carrier would “meet the requirements” but it was “just taking time to get there”.The Taiwan spat comes as Sino-US relations have become more tense on many fronts, including the much publicised trade friction to US concerns about the militarisation of the South China Sea. China has expressed anger at Congressional moves to promote more visits by US officials to Taiwan, and is concerned that the Trump administration has several senior officials with strong pro-Taiwan views, including John Bolton, the national security adviser who has long been an ardent supporter of Taipei.The Chinese pressure over the way companies describe Taiwan has extended to several industries, including hotel chains such as Marriott and retailers such as Zara. Two people familiar with the reaction inside the White House said officials were angry when Delta earlier this year apologised to China for listing Taiwan — and Tibet — as countries on their website.One of the two people said the US airlines were willing to comply with the Chinese order after a period of time. But he said the Trump administration seemed intent on fighting China over the issue regardless of the views of the US carriers who are eyeing future growth opportunities in the Chinese market.A bipartisan group of US senators, including Cory Gardner from Colorado and Marco Rubio from Florida, recently wrote to United and American to urge them to resist the “long arm” of the Chinese government. Mr Gardner told the Financial Times that the airlines should think twice about complying with the Chinese order, and said the US should consider retaliatory measures again Chinese airlines if necessary.“The American airlines ought to be . . . representing the interests of this country. If China wants to cancel flights because of bullying tactics, the US should reciprocate,” Mr Gardner said. “If a US airline wishes to capitulate to the demands of China, perhaps they would rather do business headquartered out of China.”Follow Demetri Sevastopulo on Twitter: @dimi
25;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-05-08T12:13:09Z;How airlines aim to use big data to boost profits;Technology provides carriers with treasure trove of information to optimise customer service;“Good afternoon Mr Smith, and congratulations on reaching 500,000 air miles. Lunch will be served an hour after take off — we’re preparing your filet mignon just the way you like it. I’d like to apologise for the slight delay to your flight to Miami last week, and let you know we’re scheduled to arrive on time today.”Mr Smith no longer needs to be sitting in first class, wearing a Rolex and flashing a gold Amex to qualify for this sort of treatment. Airlines are seeking to harness big data to personalise customer experiences for as many travellers as possible — and they have a lot of data.“We need to be operating at the level of Google,” said Joe Leader, chief executive of the Airline Passenger Experience Association, in a report ahead of this year’s Aviation Festival.“For every passenger, we know every detail that serves as a marketing treasure trove of personalisation. We have full names, address, exact birthdays, seat assignments, credit cards and everything that should make personalisation easy,” he added.According to researchers at the Amrita School of Engineering in India, the average transatlantic flight generates about 1,000 gigabytes of data, the equivalent of about 2,000 hours of CD-quality recording.Writing in a blog in 2015, Mark Ross-Smith, who now works at Malaysia Airlines, said an airline could record details including how many times a customer researched a flight on its website before booking, whether their cursor hovered over upgrade options and whether they booked using their usual payment method.Airlines are hoping big data might prove one antidote to the pressures of tight profit margins and intense competition. “We really need to put our data to work,” said International Airlines Group, parent company of British Airways and Iberia, to “support our airlines’ brand, customer loyalty and profitability”.Earlier this year American Airlines rolled out an app that allows flight attendants to offer passengers “a gesture of goodwill”, usually air miles, when there are problems such as the flight entertainment system not working, instead of saying “contact customer relations when you land”.“Our goal is to improve the customer experience, particularly when things don’t go as planned, to make it a little bit less painful for them,” the airline said.Flight attendants on United Airlines have handheld devices that give them access to customer details such as when they last flew with the airline, whether they have a tight connection and if they have dietary requirements. Like American, United offers customers a bag-tracking service to alert them if their luggage is lost or delayed.Low-cost airline Ryanair has a broader vision, with aims to be the “Amazon for travel”, using customer data to cross-sell extras, such as hotel rooms, on a one-stop-shop platform.Customers could sign up for a MyRyanair account, which saved personal preferences and allowed the company to offer targeted products and services, said Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer. “If a customer is travelling to Alicante with two children, we can offer them a five-seat car for hire.”Meanwhile, Delta, a self-styled “data-driven” airline, has started asking flight attendants to interact with five passengers, who at the moment must be members of their SkyMiles loyalty programme, on every domestic US flight.“You want to feel valued,” said Allison Ausband, senior vice-president of in-flight service. “We are getting thank-you notes from customers for acknowledging them on the aeroplane . . . Whether apologising for delays or acknowledging their [loyalty programme] status, we make them feel that they are that valued customer.”On a flight last year, the Delta team alerted their control centre when a passenger who was flying to an interview spilled a drink on himself. The airline provided a clean shirt for the passenger at arrivals.Delta said it did not plan to increase staffing, reasoning that automation and digital improvements had sped up the check-in process.However, Gerrit Loots, from consultancy AlixPartners, questioned to what extent personalisation would drive customer retention. “Data exploitation is not really a competitive differentiator,” he said. “To be a top-tier airline these days, you have to have these things.”Another key question is how far personalisation should go, and at what point data collection strays into invasion of privacy.If Mr Smith has ordered a gin and tonic with a double twist of lime on his previous five flights, should a flight attendant offer him one on his next, before he is asked?Delta says this predictive service is coming soon, although other airlines say they are yet to launch into the area.Large troves of data also pose cyber security risks.According to Kevin O’Sullivan, lead engineer at research group Sita Lab, several of the world’s biggest airlines and airports are “waking up to the liability of sitting on big data”.Some IT departments, he said, “want to get away” from storing more arbitrary personal data, such as drink preferences, which benefited marketing but generated risk.However, said Mr O’Sullivan, the broader use of technology had enormous potential for the industry.Sita recently completed a six-month trial of blockchain technology with BA and Heathrow and Miami airports, which focused on flight-status information, where there is often no single data set or “version of the truth”.If all relevant airlines and airports worked from a single data set on the blockchain, he said, this problem would be solved.Blockchain technology could have other uses, such as helping streamline supply chains and making them more transparent, he added. IAG said blockchain was a “key priority”, while Lufthansa has started a “blockchain for aviation” initiative.IAG has launched a tech accelerator for start-ups working in the aviation space. One such company, Migacore, aims to use the big data gathered by airlines, combined with data from other sources including news outlets and social media, which the company stressed was public content only, to predict customer demand for specific flights on specific days.“Airlines can’t price dynamically without a good forecasting system,” said Migacore co-founder Abheer Kolhatkar. Soon, he added, seat prices would be updated continually, in real time.According to Marko Javornik, of Comtrade Digital Services, airlines’ forays into tech indicated they were starting to understand that “significantly higher profits lie in monetising digital assets”, rather than simply seats on planes. “Mobile apps are just a first stage of transformation,” he said.After a series of public relations disasters in the past year, including the death of a puppy on a flight, United Airlines has stepped up efforts to improve its service by using big data, writes Camilla Hodgson.Flight attendants are equipped with an app filled with passenger information, including whether they have a tight connection or if their child needs their own seat.Staff also know where passengers have been and where they are going. Since United encourages as much personalisation as possible, a passenger may be asked whether their recent trip to Hawaii was pleasant the next time they ask for water.“Our flight attendants are able to access customer profiles and journey information at their fingertips through their handheld devices, allowing them to better engage with our customers,” the company said.All United’s frontline employees — from flight attendants to gate agents — also have the airline’s “In the moment” app, which allows them to compensate customers for accidents such as spillages or delays.A customer with a grievance no longer need spend hours on the phone to United HQ: if unexpected turbulence rocks the drinks trolley and launches a cup of tea into an unsuspecting lap, staff are allowed to try to address the problem straight away with complimentary food or air miles points.According to United, data and mobile technology would “enable more caring and relevant conversations with our customers”.

Mr Parker said the carrier had decided to cut its full-year guidance after fuel prices rose 12 per cent in the past two weeks. “This is the kind of increase that is going to have an impact on airline financials,” he said on an earnings call, predicting that low cost carriers would suffer even more than legacy carriers like American.Southwest Airlines also warned on fuel costs, predicting a fuel bill in the second quarter of $2.20 per gallon, up 10.5 per cent from the year earlier figure. Its shares closed down 1.0 per cent, additionally hit by news that second quarter bookings had dropped following an inflight engine accident last week in which a Southwest passenger died.Shares of Delta Air Lines and United Continental were also down on Thursday, each by 2.8 per cent.US airline stocks had already been under pressure for months as investors worry about an increase in capacity that they fear could lead to a fare war . The NYSE Arca Airline Index was already in technical correction territory, having dropped more than 10 per cent since its March peak.Mr Parker of American Airlines said that the industry could constrain capacity if costs remain at current levels, and predicted higher fuel would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher fares.American Airlines said it now expects full-year earnings per share (excluding special items) of $5-$6, compared with an earlier forecast of $5.50-$6.50 despite what it expects to be strong global travel demand for both business and leisure travel.Southwest said revenue per available seat mile will fall by 1-3 per cent for the current quarter compared to the second quarter last year, largely as a result of the booking downturn that followed the death of Jennifer Riordan on Flight 1380 on April 17.
27;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-04-12T17:22:08Z;Airline stocks rally as Delta strikes upbeat view on fuel costs;;Airline stocks were cruising higher on Thursday, bouncing back from a couple of rough trading sessions after Delta Air Lines delivered better than expected first quarter sales and profits despite higher fuel costs.Delta was enjoying its best day in over a week, up 2.3 per cent in midday trade. American Airlines clawed back some of this week’s steep losses, advancing more than 2 per cent. United Continental rose 2.3 per cent while Southwest and JetBlue tacked on 1.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.The sector rally comes as Delta brushed off concerns about the sharp ramp up in oil prices and the impact it would have on fuel costs and its bottom line. “I don’t view fuel in the $70 range as a big headwind,” said chief executive Edward Bastian in a call with analysts on Thursday. “In fact, it creates a lot more discipline about the business, and we've certainly proven the ability to make some very solid returns at this fuel price in the past.”“I think it’s premature to say $70 is the new normal . . . And I do think there's a tremendous amount of revenue momentum that we're seeing,” he added.Jet fuel, along with labour, are the top two cost items for airline operators. Shares in America’s leading airlines came under pressure this week as a flare up in geopolitical concerns in the Middle East pushed the prices of Brent crude to their highest levels since December 2014 and rekindled worries over cost pressures on the industry.American and United are both seen as particularly vulnerable to upward swings in oil prices because they have stopped buying hedging contracts that lock in fuel prices. However Mr Bastian said on Thursday that he expects the continued strength seen in the US economy to help drive demand for air travel and Delta’s top line growth. This along with tighter cost management and gains from US tax reform should help it compensate for higher fuel prices.“There's a lot of underlying strength on the top line, and we'll continue to see it over time,” he said.For the March quarter, Delta reported a 25 per cent — or $374m — jump in fuel costs and an 8 per cent — or $198m — rise in labour costs. The higher operating costs were not fully offset by the revenue gains and net income came in at $547m for the period. That’s down from the $561m reported in the year ago period — but better than the $510m the market had forecast.
28;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-04-12T12:54:22Z;Delta sales and profits top estimate despite higher fuel costs;;Delta Air Lines delivered better than expected revenue and profits during the first quarter, as higher fares and passenger traffic helped offset some of the sting from higher fuel and labour costs.For the three months to end of March, revenue at America’s number two airline by passenger traffic was up 9.5 per cent at $9.97bn, topping expectations for a smaller rise to $9.89bn.The gains were driven by demand for domestic and transatlantic flights, revenues from which were up 6.9 per cent and 14.7 per cent respectively during the quarter compared to the same period last year.However operating costs also swelled during the first quarter, rising by over $1bn, or 13 per cent. Over half of this was due to a jump in fuel and labour costs, which rose $374m and $198m during the period, representing year-on-year increases of 25 per cent and 8 per cent. The airline also took a $44m hit from disruptions caused by a series of winter storms during the quarter.As a result net income fell 2 per cent to $547m, although the figure was better than the $510m the market had forecast.“We are seeing Delta’s best revenue momentum since 2014, with positive domestic unit revenues, improvements in all our international entities, strong demand for corporate travel and double-digit increases in our loyalty revenues,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s president. Looking ahead, Delta said it expects continued revenue growth, better cost management and gains from US tax reform to help it mitigate the impact of higher fuel costs.Shares in major airlines have been hard hit this week after Brent crude prices surged to December 2014 highs. The sharp rise in oil prices have rekindled investors’ fears over the issue of cost pressure in the sector.Delta shares were up more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading.
29;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-04-11T17:44:59Z;Airline stocks grounded for second day by oil surge;;It was more pain and little gain for the airline sector on Wednesday.Airline stocks faced another day of turbulent trading as oil’s relentless march upwards continued to shake investors’ confidence in the industry’s ability to contain costs and protect profit margins.American Airlines fell 3 per cent to hit a five-month low of $46.06 in midday trade. The stock closed down 4.7 per cent in the previous session and including Wednesday’s drop, the carrier has shed 11.7 per cent of its value since Friday.United Continental was down 2 per cent at $66.02, extending its 1.3 per cent drop from yesterday. Delta Air Lines edged 0.6 per cent lower while Southwest dipped 0.3 per cent. JetBlue was the only main outlier, eking out a 0.2 per cent gain.The pressure on airline stocks comes after Brent crude surged nearly 3 per cent to its highest levels since December 2014 amid a ramp up in geopolitical concerns in the Middle East. Reports that Saudi Arabia’s air defences had intercepted a “rocket” above the kingdom’s capital have added to the escalation in the US-Russia clash over Syria.Jet fuel, along with labour, are the top two cost items for the airline operators. After reaping the benefits of lower fuel prices during the 2014-2016 oil crash, airlines are once again seeing their cost bases go up as crude prices continue to rebound, and new labour agreements have helped boost wages across the industry. American and United are both particularly vulnerable to upward swings in oil prices because they have stopped buying hedging contracts that lock in fuel prices. Airlines are also finding that they have less room to pass on the additional costs to consumers given the intensifying competition in the industry. Earlier this year, United unveiled plans to boost seat capacity and tackle low cost competitors on price — a move that triggered a sharp sell-off in the sector.

Delta Air Lines ended the day 0.4 per cent lower while JetBlue Airways edged down 0.6 per cent.The moves lower come as Brent crude soars to its highest level since December 2014 amid a combination of geopolitical jitters, easing US-China trade tension, weaker dollar and pullback in the outlook for US oil production this year.Jet fuel, along with labour, are the top two cost items for the airline operators. After reaping the benefits of lower fuel prices during the 2014-2016 oil crash, airlines are once again seeing their cost bases go up as crude prices continue to rebound, and new labour agreements have helped boost wages across the industry. American and United are both particularly vulnerable to upward swings in oil prices because they have stopped buying hedging contracts that lock in fuel prices. The cost pressures come as airlines plan to ramp up capacity and compete more aggressively on prices, leading to fears of an all-out industry fare war. Overall, the wider NYSE Arca index is down 2.9 per cent so far this year, compared to the S&P 500′s 0.6 per cent decline.
31;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-02-27T22:57:41Z;Delta faces backlash for cutting NRA ties after school shooting;Gun control divide between states widens after deadly attack in Florida;Republican politicians are threatening to penalise Delta Air Lines in its home state of Georgia after the airline cut its ties with the National Rifle Association following a US school shooting that is increasing the polarisation of gun laws at the state level.Over the weekend, Delta said it would no longer offer discounts to NRA members travelling to the gun lobby group’s annual meeting. In Georgia, where Delta is based, lieutenant-governor Casey Cagle responded by vowing to block a tax bill that would benefit the airline “unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA”.The political backlash contrasts with the reaction to FedEx’s decision to maintain its discounts for NRA members, which has prompted social media calls to boycott the courier company, and highlights stark differences between states over gun policy.With Congress unlikely to agree on any changes to federal gun laws, the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead has sparked a round of policy action at state level. But some proposed measures look set to exacerbate a stark divergence in gun laws.While elected officials in left-leaning states seek to avert more mass shootings by tightening access to guns, their counterparts in conservative strongholds such as Georgia are seeking to loosen gun laws, in the belief that safety comes from more people carrying weapons.“Especially when Congress fails to act you often find states jump in — and this seems to be one of those moments,” said Robert Spitzer, the author of five books on gun policy and chair of the political science department at the State University of New York.He noted that the 2012 massacre that killed 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut inspired a wave of state-level policy measures, adding: “We’re not quite at that stage yet, but there’s clearly been a lot of movement.”On Monday, Gina Raimondo, the Democratic governor of Rhode Island, signed an executive order establishing a “red flag” policy aimed at keeping guns away from people deemed a threat to themselves or others — making Rhode Island the first state to take such a step since the Florida massacre.Last week, Ms Raimondo and the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced plans to share more information about people prohibited from owning a firearm in each state, and to trace guns transported across state borders.But in right-leaning Indiana, a state Senate committee passed a bill last week that would abolish a $125 lifetime fee for a handgun permit and a House committee advanced a bill that would let some people carry firearms on school property.In Kansas, the state Senate is considering a bill that would lower the age at which people can carry concealed weapons in public from 21 to 18.Mr Spitzer said the shift towards more lenient gun laws in parts of the US was driven by a combination of NRA lobbying clout and Republican lawmakers’ fears of being challenged from the right in primary elections this year.But he added that the changes tended to be “fairly incremental”, citing moves to let judges carry guns or to broaden the range of places where people are permitted to have concealed weapons.Others challenged the idea that gun policies were becoming more polarised. Billy Rosen, deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, a group campaigning to curb gun violence, said: “From our perspective, the good is outweighing the bad.”He added that since Sandy Hook, some bipartisan consensus had emerged on the need to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, with 25 states, including several led by Republicans, enacting laws to restrict access.“This is a hard battle. The gun lobby is working hard,” Mr Rosen said. “But I’m seeing more and more a shift where common sense prevails in blue states and even red states.”Some of America’s largest companies have felt emboldened to take public stances on issues ranging from transgender rights to race relations by surveys showing the public increasingly expects chief executives to speak out. Since the Florida shooting, polls have also shown a growing majority of Americans support tighter gun laws.Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who has funded gun control campaigns, hailed Delta’s move, telling the CECP conference of chief executives and investors on Monday “it doesn’t cost them anything” because most customers supported the stance.But in Georgia, Republican senator Rick Jeffares said on Twitter: “I’m leading the charge to let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable.”Delta offered no reaction on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York
32;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-02-26T05:34:31Z;OneWeb and Airbus team up to put 5G on aircraft;Delta and Sprint also join alliance that aims to let passengers use phones while flying;OneWeb, the US satellite start-up backed by Japanese tech group SoftBank, has formed an alliance with Airbus to develop in-flight 5G services that would allow passengers to continue using the internet on their smartphones and tablet devices while in the air. Delta, the US airline, has also signed up to the Seamless Air Alliance, alongside telecoms companies Sprint, another SoftBank business, and Bharti Airtel, the Indian carrier. GoGo, which works with airlines on existing in-flight broadband systems, has also joined the group.The move, to be revealed at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, is aimed at creating standards that bring mobile roaming on to planes, one of the few remaining black holes in terms of connectivity. Rival satellite companies including Viasat and Inmarsat compete for contracts with airlines to create bespoke in-cabin broadband services that are sold at a premium to customers. Inmarsat has worked with Deutsche Telekom and Nokia to build the European Aviation Network, which provides both satellite and terrestrial connections into an aircraft, which it argues will create $30bn worth of extra revenues for airlines by 2035. The new alliance, however, aims to disrupt those services by allowing customers to roam while in the air using satellite systems with billing handled by their carrier. Greg Wyler, founder and chairman of OneWeb, said the move would radically bring the cost down compared to using the “hotchpotch of bespoke systems” on board different planes. “When people get on a plane, they are dislocated from the mobile networks. When they board an aircraft they have to pull out their credit card to stay online. Our goal is to fix that,” he said.The alliance will not produce immediate results. OneWeb, which also counts Richard Branson as an investor, will only start producing satellites later this year with the aim of providing broadband in 2019. Mr Wyler said it may take until “late 2020” before 5G roaming is available in the cabin but that the standardisation work to make the hardware, billing and log in systems should happen rapidly. “We will see the first fruits next year,” he said.Marc Fontaine, digital transformation officer at Airbus, said: “Easy-to-use, high-speed connectivity is part of the next revolution in aerospace.”SoftBank has invested $1.5bn into OneWeb, which alongside SpaceX is one of a new generation of satellite companies hoping to disrupt the established market. The Japanese company tried to forge a merger between OneWeb and European rival Intelsat last year but the $14bn deal collapsed.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that OneWeb said it will have 5G on planes in late 2020
33;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2018-02-25T16:22:49Z;More US companies cut ties to NRA after school shooting;Pressure from customers and campaigners forces corporate America to act;"Airlines, banks, car rental companies, hoteliers and insurers have cut their ties to the National Rifle Association after the latest US school shooting, as pressure from customers and campaigners forced corporate America to take sides on one of the country’s most divisive social issues. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Starkey, a hearing aid manufacturer, said over the weekend that they would end the deals they had offered the NRA’s more than 5m members.They join a growing list of companies severing links with the gun lobby group since a teenager with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Their statements followed a social media campaign to boycott brands with NRA partnerships that had prompted similar moves from car rental brands including Avis, Enterprise and Hertz, hoteliers Best Western and Wyndham, insurers Chubb and MetLife, and Symantec, the technology group behind the LifeLock and Norton digital security brands.The speed with which so many companies have distanced themselves makes this one of the most effective boycott campaigns of recent years. Few of the companies volunteered the reasoning behind their actions, with most announcing their decisions in terse tweets, but First National Bank of Omaha said “customer feedback” had prompted it to end the contract under which it issued an NRA-branded Visa card. The NRA responded with a statement accusing the companies of punishing its law-abiding members “in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and pledging that the brands would be “replaced by others who recognise that patriotism and determined commitment to constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve”.Social media sites, under fire for helping promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods about the shooting, have helped project the boycott campaign, with Stoneman Douglas students Emma González amassing a larger Twitter following than the NRA. Ms González and fellow student David Hogg were among those using social media to put pressure on brands including FedEx that had maintained their NRA partnerships, and on politicians siding with the gun industry. Efforts to introduce tighter gun laws in the wake of past mass shootings have failed, but Mr Hogg predicted that his generation’s ability to mobilise on social media would make this shooting different.“You’ve had an entire generation of kids growing up around mass shootings and the fact that . . . they’re starting to be able to vote explains how we’re going to have this change,” he told ABC News.Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku also came under pressure from campaigners including Shannon Watts, founder of the gun reform group Moms Demand Action, as their digital video services carry NRATV, an NRA-owned channel which airs shows including Armed & Fabulous and Love at First Shot.The targets of the #neveragain campaign have extended beyond companies with direct deals with the NRA to include large money managers and local pension funds, including those managing money for teachers, which own shares in gun manufacturers. Among the companies reviewing their ties to gunmakers was Bank of America, which said on Saturday that it was joining others in its industry “to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings”.It declined to comment on which other companies were involved, but said: “An immediate step we’re taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.""Companies taking a stance on one of the most sensitive topics in US politics risk a backlash from NRA members and others on the right of US politics, but opinion polls show growing public concern about America’s gun laws.A Quinnipiac University poll last week reported that 66 per cent of US voters supported stricter gun laws, up from 47 per cent in December 2015, with 97 per cent backing universal background checks and two-thirds wanting a nationwide ban on assault weapon sales. A CNN poll published on Sunday said 70 per cent supported stricter gun laws, the highest level since 1993.The pressure on businesses to isolate the gun industry marks the latest occasion in which online campaigns have forced chief executives to speak out on political issues including climate change, immigration, and marriage equality.Last year, companies including Amazon and Nordstrom faced the #grabyourwallet consumer boycott campaign targeting retailers selling Trump brands, as CEOs such as Merck’s Kenneth Frazier resigned from Donald Trump’s manufacturing council and Walmart’s Doug McMillon criticised the president’s failure to repudiate white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Shares in United fell 11.4 per cent on concern about the effect of the moves on the company’s profit margins, and the broad sell-off had wiped close to $8.4bn off the value of the country’s four largest carriers by the end of the trading day.United’s combatant attitude towards low-cost rivals and its plans to add more seats revived memories of the intense competition that ravaged airline stock prices in the past — and which investors, including Warren Buffett, had come to hope would not be repeated.United said at an investor event Tuesday night that it planned to increase capacity at a faster than expected rate of 4 to 6 per cent a year for the next three years. Scott Kirby, United’s president, said, “The best way to compete with a low-cost carrier is master prices.”He said: “Half our revenue approximately comes from customers that are mostly shopping on price and we cannot ignore half of our revenue and we can’t let our low-cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs.It's true that the airlines had a bad 20th century“No one chooses to fly on an ultra-low-cost carrier if they can get the same price on United Airlines — nobody — at least if they know what they’re buying . . . so it’s entirely within our control whether they succeed or fail in our hubs.” Rival airline shares fell after the United announcement because such a large increase in United capacity would add about 1 percentage point to overall industry capacity in 2020, UBS analyst Darryl Genovesi wrote in a note. That would “hit US airlines’ earnings per share by 6 to 8 per cent on average, all else being equal”, he wrote. Shares in Delta Air Lines, the country’s biggest airline by market value, ended down 5.2 per cent, while Southwest Airlines was off 4.7 per cent and American Airlines closed down 6.0 per cent. The US airline industry has had a chequered history, plagued by financial weakness and peppered with bankruptcies, but Mr Buffett’s investment in the four largest carriers in 2016 — which put him among the top five shareholders in each company — was a significant endorsement.”It's true that the airlines had a bad 20th century,” he told CNBC last year, likening them to the Chicago Cubs, which had just won the baseball World Series for the first time in 108 years. “And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand.""While good news for consumers, lower fares risk derailing the industry’s nascent recovery in pricing power. Full-service carriers could potentially be hit the hardest given that they face higher costs and have been raising wages for their staff in recent years. United’s aggressive growth plan aims to restore market share after a period of disappointing performance since its merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. “We definitely understand management’s decision to focus on improving their domestic network as the company admittedly shrunk too much post the Continental merger, but that was almost a decade ago and investors are likely to be somewhat frustrated by the company’s aggressive growth rate,” analyst Helane Becker at Cowen said in a note.She forecast that as United’s competitors “compete on price for the same passenger”, unit revenues, a closely watch industry metric, would suffer.

That will increase this year’s earnings per share to $6.35-70, up 20 to 30 per cent from the year earlier, Delta said. “We are very excited about the potential for increased business demand with the tax cut, we haven’t seen that materialise yet, but we expect that . . . in the first quarter,” said Delta president Glen Hauenstein.Like most of the US airline industry, Delta currently pays no cash taxes but chief executive Ed Bastian told analysts on a conference call that the company expects to become a cash taxpayer between 2019 and 2020, adding that it will be “high on our priority list” to use tax-related saving to contribute to the company pension fund.But the tax reforms were not all good news for the US airline, which took a one-time charge of $150m in the December quarter due to “the estimated impact of the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities”. Delta excluded the charge from results as a special item. Past losses that can be used to defer future earnings are worth less when tax rates fall.The company’s shares were up 5.4 per cent in New York after the company reported better than expected sales and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31.Competitors are also signalling better than expected fourth quarter sales: American Airlines, United Continental and JetBlue have raised their unit revenue outlook for the quarter this week.Delta reported a 8.3 per cent increase in revenue to $10.2bn for the December quarter, slightly ahead of the $10.16bn the market was expecting. Passenger unit revenue (PRASM) — a closely followed industry measure — rose 4.2 per cent as the company regained some of its pricing power following a brutal airfare war. The airline expects that measure to increase by 2.5-4.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year.

It is forecasting a 4-6 per cent increase in revenue and raised its full year earnings outlook to between $6.35 and $6.70 a share, saying it expects to receive a boost from US tax reforms.Shares in Delta rose nearly 3 per cent in pre-market trading.(Photo: Reuters)

By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 2,652.01, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fell 0.3 per cent to 24,508.66 while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3 per cent to 6,856.53.Among the biggest laggards were shares in Pier 1 Imports, the home furnishings and decor retailer, which slumped 26.5 per cent to $4.12 and was on track for its biggest one-day drop since February 2009, after revealing weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and lower guidance for the holiday quarter and the full-year.The Texas-based company said net sales decreased 1.4 per cent from a year ago to $469.2m in the three months ended November 25, ahead of Wall Street expectations.But net income fell to $7.4m, or 9 cents a share, compared with $13.6m, or 17 cents a share, and missed analysts’ estimates for earnings of 12 cents a share.For the fourth quarter, Pier 1 Imports now expects to report same-store sales decline of between 1.5 to 3.5 per cent, compared with its previous projection for same-store sales to stay flat or rise 2 per cent.It also sees more modest net sales growth of between 1 to 3 per cent, compared with a 5 to 7 per cent increase it had forecast in September. And the company now expects adjusted earnings of between 16 to 24 cents a share, compared with 36 to 46 cents a share previously.For the full year, the retailer expects same-store sales to decline as much a 1 per cent or stay flat, compared with prior estimates for growth of as much as 1 per cent. It sees full-year adjusted earnings of between 17 to 25 cents a share, down from 38 to 48 cents a share previously.Investors took an optimistic view on carriers after Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian said the tax plan being worked on by Congress could boost the company’s earnings by about $1 a share next year.Delta shares climbed 2.8 per cent to $55.12, American Airlines shares rose 3 per cent to $55.25, United Continental shares rose 0.2 per cent to $63.13 and Southwest Airlines share rose 1.1 per cent to $63.85.

The US carrier would likely use the money to complete the funding of its pension fund, he said. House and Senate Republicans are working toward a deal that would enshrine the 21 per cent corporate tax in law.Delta also announced on Thursday that it had agreed to order 100 Airbus A321neo narrow-body jetliners at a value of $12.7bn, a blow to Boeing, the rival aircraft maker, which had also been in the running for that order.Delta and Boeing have traded acrimonious words recently over a trade dispute involving another narrow-body plane, the Bombardier C series. Boeing brought a complaint to the US Commerce Department over a Delta order for the C series aircraft which it claimed were sold at unfairly subsidised prices. The Commerce Department imposed preliminary duties of 300 per cent on the planes as a result.“We at Airbus are very happy we won this hotly-contested campaign, together with our partner Pratt, and we are proud to serve Delta with the A321neo. This important order will further strengthen our partnership with Delta – one of the world’s best airlines – which we have developed over many years.” Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive said in a statement.Mr Bastian said in the presentation that Delta expects passenger revenue per available seat mile, a closely watched industry metric, to be up 4 per cent for 2017, at the high end of a previous forecast range. But he also said costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel, would be up 5 per cent, at the top of an expected range, which he said was a disappointment. “Delta is very focused on getting unit costs back in check,” he said. Delta shares rose 2 per cent soon after opening.Boeing said in a statement: “Delta remains a valued customer, and we’ll continue exploring ways to best meet their needs in the future.”Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger
41;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-11-22T17:53:15Z;Gulf airlines targeted by US tax reform provision;Etihad accuses US rivals of using Senate bill to pursue anti-competitive agenda;Etihad has accused US airlines of turning Donald Trump’s tax overhaul into a weapon in their war against Gulf carriers, after a provision was inserted into the proposed reforms that they say is specifically designed to punish them.The Middle Eastern airlines are threatened by language in the Senate tax bill that would abruptly end the exemption from tax that Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways enjoy on income derived from flights to and from the US — but the carriers say it could have much wider impact, and wreak havoc on international travel.The measure was added to the bill last week by Johnny Isakson, a Republican senator from Georgia, whose state is home to Delta Air Lines and its main hub, Atlanta airport.People close to the companies say the tax hit is the latest episode in a campaign US airlines have run against Gulf carriers in recent years over allegations of unfair competition, which the Middle Eastern airlines deny.Most big non-US airlines are currently exempt from tax on aviation-related income earned in the US under reciprocal tax deals with other countries. The Isakson measure is written in a way that would withdraw the benefit from Middle Eastern carriers and a few other airlines, but allow their big European peers to retain the exemption.The proposal calls for foreign airlines to pay US corporate tax if their home country has fewer than two arrivals and departures per week operated by US airlines, and if the home country does not have a full income tax treaty with the US.One person close to the Gulf airlines said it would also affect carriers flying to the US from Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Suriname and Fiji as well as other countries.An Etihad spokesman told the Financial Times: “Etihad Airways is aware of the language in the Senate tax reform bill, which is widely agreed to be inappropriate under US law and contrary to several international agreements.“We are working with a broad coalition of industry representatives to inform lawmakers on this issue, which appears to be the result of continued anti-competitive efforts by one or more of the big three US legacy carriers.”I am afraid that many countries will see what the US is doing and will follow suitTensions between the Gulf carriers and Delta, United and American Airlines have grown in the past decade as Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways expanded from being relatively small players to global challengers on many routes.Delta has been one of the most vociferous in its complaints. This summer, it released a 15-minute video highlighting the danger it said the Middle Eastern airlines pose to the US industry.People close to the Gulf carriers say the tax measure would threaten the financial viability of their flights to the US. Abdul Wahab Teffaha, head of the Arab Air Carriers’ Organisation, a trade group, described the tax provision this week as “an extremely bad turn of events”.“This will hurt global aviation in a major way like nothing else,” Mr Teffaha told Air Transport World magazine.“There is a real danger it will suppress aviation and it will be bad for the consumer. And there is also the danger of proliferation. I am afraid that many countries will see what the US is doing and will follow suit.”The International Air Transport Association echoed that view. “If enacted, the Isakson provision would upend decades of precedent — which the US has long supported — on the taxation of international aviation,” it said. “Foreign governments — even those not directly affected by the proposed language — could be tempted to follow the US example and impose reciprocal taxes in return.”Mr Isakson’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokeswoman told Reuters last week: “This provision supports American jobs by providing a level playing field and mutual fairness in international passenger aviation. Foreign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to US companies.”The Gulf airlines dispute the notion that their home markets are closed. They also deny a charge from US airlines that they are not holding up their end of Open Skies agreements because they accept billions of dollars in government subsidies.Their lobbying clout in Washington, however, is limited by their status as foreigners. They also have little time to push for changes because Republicans are rushing to meet Mr Trump’s demand for a bill to sign into law by the end of the year.Mr Isakson’s measure was included in a tax bill that was passed by Republicans on the Senate finance committee last week and will be debated by the full chamber next week. If it passes the Senate it would then need to be merged with separate tax legislation in the House of Representatives before being sent to the president.Emirates and Qatar Airways declined to comment. Delta, United and American Airlines did not respond to requests for comment.
42;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-10-19T18:13:32Z;United boss under fire as price war bites;Munoz faces hostile questioning from analysts after weak revenue guidance;United Continental shares fell by 12 per cent on Thursday as the carrier failed to persuade Wall Street that it can combat rising costs and hold its own in a price war with discount airlines in the US. The share price fall, its largest one-day drop in eight years, came after the Chicago-based airline forecast in a Wednesday earnings release that unit revenues would fall by 1 to 3 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter. This forecast was worse than that of some of its peers.Delta said last week that it expects the unit revenue measure to rise by 2 to 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. United shares, already down sharply in early trading, fell a further 4 percentage points during the carrier’s morning investor call on Thursday, during which chief executive Oscar Munoz parried increasingly hostile questions from analysts disappointed at the company’s profit and margin outlook.Questioners repeatedly asked whether he can deliver on a turnround plan designed to improve service and reverse the airline’s image as the weakest of the large US carriers. The shares continued to drop after the call finished, and closed the day down $8.21 at $59.78.“We have dug ourselves in a hole from a competitive perspective,” the chief executive said, adding “it’s about regaining our competitive advantage”. Under a barrage of analyst questions aimed at getting him to quantify costs for next year, Mr Munoz said the airline was “not ready to give detailed information for 2018 on costs”.In a note to clients, Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker said that “the irony of the 12 per cent decline in the stock today is that it has less to do with unit revenue, which is generally all investors care about, and more to do with the company's non-answers during the Q&A session of the earnings call”.Management did “an awful job of responding” to analysts’ increasingly exasperated questions about whether the company can meet 2016 investor day targets which are supposed to result in $4.8bn in profit improvements by the end of 2020, Ms Becker added. “In the end we heard that there is give and take in their $4.8bn profit improvement programme.” Mr Munoz has been under pressure from investors this year for slashing fares and for increasing the supply of flights and seats. He also faced public outrage after a passenger was violently removed from a United flight earlier this year, though that incident appeared to have little impact on the share price. On Wednesday the carrier said that disruptions caused by a trio of powerful hurricanes had caused profits to slide by more than a third during the third quarter. Net income was 34 per cent lower at $637m, compared to the prior year period, after the company was forced to cancel some 8,300 flights in the wake of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria devastating parts of southeast Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. “The headwinds have been significant,” he said on the Thursday call, identifying rising labour and fuel costs, brutal competition with so-called ultra low cost carriers such as Spirit and Frontier, and weak demand in Asia as factors depressing results along with the hurricanes.Unit revenues — defined as passenger revenue per available seat mile — fell 3.7 per cent during the third quarter, at the lower end of the 3 to 5 per cent decline it had forecast in September to take into account the effect of the hurricanes. However, it remains a steep drop from its original forecast for a 1 per cent decline to a 1 per cent rise.
43;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-10-18T16:50:35Z;Delta dismisses tariffs threat after Airbus-Bombardier deal;Airline’s chief said he expects to take delivery of C Series jets without 300% levy;Delta Air Lines, whose order of Bombardier jets led to a transatlantic trade dispute and this week’s landmark Airbus-Bombardier deal, said it expects to take delivery of the aircraft without paying 300 per cent tariffs proposed by the US government.Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said on Wednesday that the Atlanta-based carrier expects to take delivery of the 75 Bombardier C Series jets from Airbus’ plant in Mobile, Alabama. Bombardier agreed to hand over control of its C Series business to Airbus on Monday, partly to enable it to produce the planes in Alabama with the aim of averting recently proposed US sanctions that would have quadrupled the price of the planes for US buyers. Boeing said after the agreement “the announced deal has no impact or effect on the pending proceedings at all. Any duties finally levied against the C Series (which are now expected to be 300 per cent) will have to be paid on any imported C Series aeroplane or part, or it will not be permitted into the country.”Mr Bastian did not say when delivery is expected to take place, but he had said on an earnings call last week, before the Airbus-Bombardier deal was announced, that delivery of the planes might be delayed because of the trade dispute. He said at the time that Delta expected to take delivery of the planes without paying any duties.Mr Bastian confirmed that he had been aware that talks were taking place between Airbus and Bombardier but denied Delta was involved in striking the deal.Some US trade lawyers said it was not yet clear whether the arrangement, under which Bombardier expects the planes to be treated as domestic products and thus not liable to import duties, will succeed in avoiding duties. Boeing brought the trade complaint against Bombardier to the US government claiming production of the planes had been illegally subsidised by the Canadian and UK governments. Mr Bastian said that the trade battle, in which Delta has intervened on the side of Bombardier, will not prevent his company from buying Boeing planes in future. “We have a great relationship with Boeing,” he said, adding that both Airbus and Boeing jets are under consideration to replace Delta’s ageing fleet. Mr Bastian said he expected to make a decision on those replacements in the next six to 12 months. The Airbus deal marks a significant setback for Boeing, which has taken an aggressive stance on the funding of the C Series since Bombardier won the Delta order, even though Boeing did not compete for that order, which was for a smaller jet than the US company had in its portfolio.
44;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-10-11T11:29:21Z;Delta weathers brutal hurricane season, delivers sales, earnings beat;;Delta Air Lines overcame the impact of a brutal hurricane season to deliver third quarter sales and earnings ahead of expectations.The news sent shares in the country’s largest carrier by market value up more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading.For the three months to the end of September, revenue rose 5.5 per cent to $11.1bn compared to the prior year period, topping expectations of $11bn.Net income fell 6 per cent to $1.17bn largely as a result of the disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma in September. The category 5 storm devastated large swath of the Caribbean and Florida, and disrupted flights out of Georgia and Delta’s Atlanta hub.Adjusted for the impact of the disruption, net income came in at $1.1bn or $1.57 per diluted share, also better than the $1.52 per share analysts had forecast.“While we faced a number of challenges this quarter, including multiple hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico, I am proud of how Delta people responded and still delivered an outstanding performance this quarter,” said chief executive Ed Bastian. “Having just completed the busiest summer travel season in our history, we have good momentum, a determined team and a solid pipeline of initiatives to grow earnings and margins.”Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) – a closely followed industry measure of pricing power – rose 1.9 per cent year-on-year during the quarter, as the company regained some of its pricing power following last year’s brutal airfare price war.It expects the gauge to increase between 2-4 per cent in the fourth quarter while cost – as measured by another key metric, cost per available seat mile (CASM) – is expected to be either flat or down 1 per cent.
45;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-10-04T21:22:30Z;Airline stocks rise after positive Delta results;S&P 500 recovers from earlier losses;Airline stocks briefly led the Dow Jones Transportation Average higher on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines reported positive September operating results on Tuesday, holding close to earlier forecasts despite a challenging quarter.A bout of hurricanes in recent months closed many airports across the southern US, resulting in flight cancellations. It compounded a difficult year for the sector, with the S&P 500 airlines index in a tailspin, down more than 20 per cent between July 7 and August 24.But the positive news on Tuesday helped the index increase 5.6 per cent, with a further 1.2 per cent rise added on Wednesday.“Delta came out with positive September results,” said Chris Higgins, an analyst at Morningstar. “They were up the most since 2015 for a one-day gain. Delta’s performance results have been the catalyst, giving confidence for investors to come back into the market. They have fuelled a rally in the sector.”By the close of trading, shares in Delta increased 0.6 per cent to $51.56 on Wednesday, while United Continental rose 0.5 per cent to $64.47 and American Airlines gained 0.4 per cent to $50.73.“Year to date, [airline] performance has been atrocious,” Mr Higgins said, adding: “Aside from headlines and short-term news, a lot of investors are coming back in because they see some value.”The Dow Jones Transportation Average gained as much as 0.3 per cent in early trading, but later pared back gains to trade 0.5 per cent lower.More broadly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were both 0.1 per cent higher at 22,661.64 and 2,537.74, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite was nearly unchanged at 6,534.63.Elsewhere, consumer discretionary stocks were 0.5 per cent stronger with recent positive economic news seen as bolstering the sector. On Wednesday it was the second best performing index in the S&P 500, bringing its year-to-date gain to 11.9 per cent, closely behind the broader index. Big gains for stocks such as Netflix and Amazon have been supportive this year, though it has also been dragged down in part by travails for retailers.Consumer discretionary stocks are predicted to lead gains for the S&P 500 over the next year, according to analysis from Factset. The aggregate gain for the S&P 500 is predicted to be 8.4 per cent, calculated as the difference between analysts’ bottom-up target price and the index’s closing price on September 28 at 2,510.“At the sector level, the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors have the largest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price, while the telecom services, financials, and utilities sectors have the smallest upside differences,” said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at Factset.
46;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-10-03T19:28:37Z;Airline stocks cruise higher after Delta trading update;;Airline stocks were cruising at a higher altitude on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines issued a trading update that was not as bad as feared.Shares in Delta jumped 6.3 per cent — the most in 20 months — to $51.10 after the country’s largest airline by market value said it expects consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) for the third quarter to increase 2 per cent from the prior year period.While that is at the low end of the 2-3 per cent growth range it gave just a month ago, that previous guidance was given before Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria devastated large swaths of the southeastern US and the Caribbean.Delta said Hurricane Irma alone forced it to cancel 2,200 flights between September 7-12 and would result in a $120m hit to its third quarter pre-tax profit. Still, the financial impact was less severe than many were expecting and gave a boost to shares of rival carriers.JetBlue surged 7.1 per cent, the most in 14 months, while American Airlines rose 4.6 per cent. United Continental was 5.7 per cent higher, and Southwest Airlines gained 3.9 per cent.
47;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-09-19T03:01:37Z;Airlines look to take flight with lucrative extras;Passenger anger rises as carriers turn to baggage and food fees to shore up revenue;Just as passenger anger rises over airline charges and customer service, the world’s leading carriers are squeezing more money out of fees on everything from baggage, food to hotel bookings.Over the past decade, so-called ancillary fees have experienced huge growth. The top 10 airlines, ranked by total ancillary revenue, generated $2.1bn in 2007. In 2016, this had grown to more than $28bn, according to research by IdeaWorksCompany and CarTrawler.Among the most successful groups at selling ancillary services are United, which generated $6.2bn in revenue last year, Delta, which generated $5.17bn, and American, which generated $4.9bn.Globally airlines are estimated to have earned $67.4bn of income from ancillaries last year, representing about 9.1 per cent of airline revenue for 2016, up from 4.8 per cent in 2010.It is not a new trend. Ancillary fees have been creeping in across the whole airline industry as carriers search for ways to make up for lost revenue from falling ticket prices. But airlines have become more inventive over charging for services other than the ticket price. Activities include anything from frequent flyer miles, bidding for spare seats next to you, on-time guarantees, lounge access to hotel bookings, holidays and car hire.“Airline management teams have clearly identified ancillary revenues as a way to add incremental, high-margin revenue to the core seat product offer,” says Anand Date, aviation analyst at Deutsche Bank.However, it has raised scepticism from some within the industry who argue that the majority of these fees are for things flyers used to get for free and are therefore hidden fare increases.This year British Airways sparked criticism from some of its passengers after the carrier started charging for food and drink on short-haul economy flights across Europe.The move has led to a blurring of lines between full-service carriers and their low-cost rivals. Most airlines now offer a basic seat-only fare, allowing customers to choose what extras they want to pay for.The pressure on revenues has meant that even airlines that have long rejected the idea of charging for these services are realising the benefits they offer to their bottom line. Both Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlines, which have generally not charged for extras, have started to introduce ancillary fees over the past year as they look to boost their falling profits during a tough period for the Gulf airlines.With some of these charges, such as lounge access or spare seats, you are almost selling excess capacityLast October, Emirates introduced fees for advanced seat selection for economy passengers. Then in January, the carrier said it would allow economy passengers who are frequent flyer members to pay to access its lounges.In June, Etihad announced similar pay-per-access to its lounges for economy passengers, as well as taking the decision to start charging for chauffeur services that had previously been included for all its premium class passengers.It also introduced the option of offering passengers the option to bid for up to three empty seats next to their own.This focus on ancillaries is likely to grow across the global airline sector, according to aviation commentators. “I think we’re going to see more and more airlines go this way. When the largest part of the market is price driven, the lower the fare is going to become, the more you need to make up for the lower revenues by selling other services,” says John Strickland, an aviation consultant.Airlines are increasingly looking at what they have and do not sell but could. “There is a move to show you all the options you could have and at the same time sell you more,” says Chris Tarry, a London-based aviation consultant. “With some of these charges, such as lounge access or spare seats, you are almost selling excess capacity,” he adds.According to research by Sabre, a technology company, travellers are willing to spend up to $99 on airline extras such as seats, bags and food to personalise their flight.The low-cost airlines are unsurprisingly the best performers when it comes to the amount of ancillary revenue generated as a percentage of total airline revenue.Research from IdeaWorksCompany and CarTrawler reveals these charges can make up as much as 46 per cent of a budget airline’s total revenue in the case of US low-cost airline Spirit. In Europe, Wizz Air has the highest amount at 39.4 per cent, followed by Ryanair at 26.8 per cent.Outside of the more standard ticket-based extras, future growth in ancillaries is likely to come from installing WiFi on the aircraft and generating new revenue streams through exclusive films or advertising, or allowing passengers to book a restaurant, event or hotel in-flight.“The smart airlines will be those that continue to think about their passengers who generally lead busy lives and strive to make the time in-flight as useful as possible to their passengers,” says Graham Pickett, global head of travel and aviation for Deloitte.Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany agrees. “Airlines focus on selling airline seats. I think they need to begin to focus on the number of days away from home that a customer may spend, and that is an opportunity for them to sell more.”At Ryanair, chief executive Michael O’Leary has long talked about his desire to make the airline the “Amazon of air travel” as he hopes to make more money by offering a range of travel services through its website.As part of its “Always Getting Better” campaign, Ryanair has spent the past few years overhauling its business model as well as pouring significant resources into upgrading its website and app to make the brand more appealing. Over the past 18 months, this has also seen the budget carrier expand into new travel services, such as Ryanair rooms (hotels) and Ryanair holidays.The low-cost airline has previously stated an ambition to grow ancillary sales from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of revenues over the four years to March 2020. It has already grown them to 27 per cent.Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Ryanair, says it will continue to focus on the “bread and butter” services as well as some of the more “sexy” travel-related products.He notes that the introduction of products such as its plus fares, which saw the airline move away from one basic ticket price to launch bundled fares aimed at certain segments such as business travellers and families, have further growth potential.“It may be the less sexy stuff but they are the ones that have the bigger financial impact,” he notes. “We can look at the sexy things but they don’t necessarily convert as well as the bread and butter services.”Ryanair offers passengers flying into London the chance to book events such as concerts through the airline but Mr Jacobs notes that this service tends to be “overhyped” in terms of the amount of money that can be made from it because of high competition in this sector.Mr Jacobs admits that further expansion of its travel products will be down to building trust in the consumer. “There’s a journey involved and a sequence of products. You’ve got to really get it right with the targeting, putting the right product in front of them at the right time,” he says.

Another agency, Fitch, has rated Delta at BBB-, one notch above junk.

The S&P 500 airlines sub industry index fell more than 4 per cent.The broader S&P 500 declined 1.4 per cent to 2,433.04, with every major index within the benchmark posting losses, including utilities and real estate, which are seen as safer investments.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also suffered its worst day in three months, weighed down by earnings at Walmart, which posted lower profit margins as it invests in digital upgrades.

50;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-07-27T19:07:30Z;Branson gives up control of Virgin Atlantic in alliance rejig;Far-reaching deal brings new investors into his UK carrier and Air France-KLM;"Sir Richard Branson is giving up control of Virgin Atlantic, the airline he founded in 1984, as part of a wide-ranging shake-up of the industry that will see Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and China Eastern deepen their alliances. Air France-KLM will buy a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic from Sir Richard’s Virgin Group for around £220m, the companies said on Thursday. This will take Sir Richard’s stake in the airline from 51 per cent to 20 per cent. The far-reaching partnership deal also involves Delta and China Eastern each acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Air France-KLM at a 17 per cent discount to Thursday’s market price. In that transaction, AirFrance-KLM will raise €751m in new capital.And Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic said they have signed a provisional agreement to create a single global joint venture, as they try to fight back against low-cost competitors. The three companies promised to create ""the most comprehensive transatlantic route network” in the world.In an open letter on Thursday, Sir Richard said that his airline would continue to fly under the Virgin brand. He also tweeted the quote: ""No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.”This flurry of activity comes as traditional transatlantic carriers are under increasing pressure from low-cost rivals such as Norwegian and WestJet, who have done for long-haul travel what Ryanair and EasyJet have done for short-haul in Europe.Virgin Atlantic, once a trailblazing carrier, has struggled. The group’s fortunes were rescued by its joint venture with Delta Air Lines, which took a 49 per cent stake in the company in 2012.The group returned to profit in 2014. But it warned earlier this year that it was likely to go into the red again in 2017 as the weaker pound pushed up costs and put off holiday-makers.Air France-KLM is also battling with a high cost base compared to newer rivals. The company is trying to set up a new low-cost arm within Air France, but is facing union opposition.Shai Weiss, chief commercial officer at Virgin Atlantic, told the FT that the deal was the next logical step for the airline, which also faces competition from the British Airways and American Airlines partnership. It means “we can get more customers to more places and more revenues”, he said, noting that the joint venture with Delta was going well but this would maximise its access to customers across Europe. ""It's pure industrial logic,"" said Mr Weiss. Ed Bastian, the Delta chief executive, said that the joint venture would “deepen ties with our global partners to provide opportunities for mutual growth” while Air-France KLM said it would provide customers with “even more choice”.The joint venture would include the sharing of facilities at airports as well as the ability to use frequent flyer miles across the three carriers."

Net income fell by more than a fifth to $1.22bn amid a series of one-time adjustments related to its stake in Virgin Atlantic, hedges and taxes.Excluding these, net income was up about 7 per cent at $1.2bn, or $1.64 per share, a hair below the $1.65 per share analysts had forecast. Within this, PRASM increased 2.5 per cent during the quarter.Delta shares, which hit a record high of $55.75 this week, were down 1.21 per cent to $54.81 by late morning in New York trading.

Lastly, the 18%-20% margin guidance seems slightly aggressive relative to the PRASM, CASM-ex, and fuel cost guidance which get us closer to 18%.The weaker-than-expected outlook comes despite the renewed drop in oil prices, which should result in lower jet-fuel costs for airlines.

That compared to its previous guidance for a 3.5 to 5.5 per cent increase.Meanwhile, United Continental said late Tuesday that it expects second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to be up approximately 2 percent from a year ago — the midpoint of the company’s original guidance for between 1 to 3 per cent. That sent shares of the airline up nearly 4 per cent to $79.87at pixel time.United has been working to improve its image since April when a passenger was violently dragged from one of its flights by Chicago aviation police, leaving him with a concussion, a broken nose and two lost teeth. The airline has since settled with the passenger and worked to improve how it handles overbooking.The upbeat outlook also helped lift shares of rival US carriers.However, the broader NYSE Arca airlines index, which includes global carriers, was down 1.25 per cent for the day.
54;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-06-18T23:01:09Z;Consumers turn shopping into a political statement;Companies are having to tread carefully around hot topics;Fifty-seven per cent of global consumers buy or boycott products because of a brand’s stance on political or social issues, according to a new survey, a sign of growing pressure on companies to weigh in on hot-button topics from immigration and climate change to transgender rights and fake news.Amplified by the megaphone of the internet, consumers have successfully pushed companies including JPMorgan, Coca-Cola, Mercedes-Benz and Delta Air Lines to pull their marketing dollars from controversial television programmes, unsavoury internet content and even a production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.Edelman’s Earned Brand survey offers evidence that people are also wielding the power of their pocketbooks to reward and punish companies based on whether or not they share shoppers’ values. Of the 14,000 respondents in 14 countries, 30 per cent said they are buying or boycotting based on values more than they were three years ago. Nearly a quarter of consumers who said they prefer to buy from brands that share their beliefs are willing to pay more for those products.This trend represents “a real opportunity for multinational brands”, said Richard Edelman, chief executive of the world’s biggest public relations firm by revenues, who will present the research at the Cannes Lions advertising festival this week. “Brands have to take on bigger issues of the moment,” he said.Social media has accelerated the pace of consumer-led campaigns that helped oust Bill O’Reilly from Fox News and spurred hundreds of brands to stop advertising on Breitbart News, the far-right website. But companies are also responding to evolving expectations about their role on the public stage, Edelman’s research suggests.The data show us that 67 per cent of people will try a brand for the first time because of its position on a controversial issue. That is customer acquisitionPublic trust in institutions, from government to media, has dropped to the lowest level since the financial crisis, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer. People are increasingly looking to companies to fill that vacuum: 51 per cent of respondents in the new survey said they “believe brands can do more to solve social ills than government”.Companies have long wanted to distance themselves from inappropriate or controversial content. But today many are also using their financial support to signal their stances. JPMorgan not only pulled its advertising from NBC News over a planned interview with Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, but the bank’s chief marketing officer tweeted her disapproval, saying “as an advertiser, I'm repulsed that [presenter Megyn Kelly] would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes”.Corporate values have become a particular flashpoint in America’s polarised political environment. The chief executives of Apple, Google, Starbucks and Coca-Cola spoke out against President Donald Trump’s travel ban. After Mr Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, Bob Iger, Walt Disney chief executive, and Elon Musk, Tesla chief, resigned from the president’s business advisory council. Mr Iger said his decision was “a matter of principle”.Companies have also exerted influence on the state level. A corporate boycott of North Carolina sparked by a controversial law that barred transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice will cost the state an estimated $3.8bn over the next decade, according to the Associated Press. Similar pressure from big companies in Georgia, Indiana and Arkansas in recent years resulted in those states amending or dropping controversial “religious freedom” bills viewed as anti-gay.However, wading into public controversies can backfire. Pepsi apologised earlier this year for a tone-deaf ad featuring reality television star and model Kendall Jenner attending a Black Lives Matter-style protest that drew scorn and ridicule on social media. Many companies looking to sell their products to a wide array of people across the political spectrum fear that the risks of taking sides may outweigh the benefits.Brands were more likely to succeed when they picked issues that fitted closely with their products or customers and when they took concrete action to support those causes, said Chris Allieri, founder of Mulberry and Astor, a PR consultancy.“These things cannot be just statements from CEOs. They have to be followed up with actual programmes and commitments. If they are going to take a stand on an issue, they have to make an investment along those lines.”Mark Renshaw, global chair of Edelman’s brand practice, said the firm’s research illuminated a business opportunity awaiting companies that did take a stand.“The data show us that 67 per cent of people will try a brand for the first time because of its position on a controversial issue. That is customer acquisition. And they’re willing to pay more for those brands. You can gain customers and they will be better and more financially viable customers for you.”
55;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-06-05T03:05:29Z;Tech tweaks in just-in-time chains lead to disaster;Boards often bundle improvements with organisational change;"“Technology has a bad habit of not going away,” Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani told me last year. He could have gone further: technology also has a bad habit of biting back, as British Airways is the latest to discover.The airline has yet to explain adequately what caused the IT meltdown that hit 75,000 passengers. But it is no surprise that a “power surge” could trigger such a damaging chain reaction. The longest established carriers are at the knotty nexus of everything that makes IT investment complex, costly and potentially risky.In the 1960s, airlines were in the vanguard of technology innovation. As computers advanced, IT managers had to make new programs work with embedded systems. Consolidation obliged airlines to marry their technology with partners’ systems. More recently, competition from low-cost rivals with no burdensome legacy, investor demands to save money, pressure to provide ever more sophisticated smartphone applications for restless frequent flyers, and ever-increasing cyber attacks have added to the IT challenge.Like many established consumer-facing businesses — big banks being the other obvious example — airlines now run a just-in-time service. It is balanced precariously on the promise that for any problem, technology is the solution. But, as with just-in-time supply chains, a small interruption creates whiplash further down the line.Delta Air Lines suffered a wave of cancellations in April, triggered by severe thunderstorms. The underlying issue was decidedly low-tech: a Wall Street Journal analysis found that due to a dearth of old-fashioned phone lines, pilots and crew were unable to get through to the Atlanta hub that was reorganising their schedule. Amplify such day-to-day crises through always-on high-speed networks and they can quickly create systemic chaos.Boards are ill-equipped to assess such threats. Only one director of BA’s parent, International Airlines Group, cites experience in technology; he is a former tax partner at Deloitte. As a result, directors often balk at the hidden dangers of computer upgrades.In 2013, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland — whose customers have been hit by a series of failures — blamed predecessors for not investing in IT. RBS has decommissioned 1,400 applications and services since 2014 in a multi-billion-pound simplification drive. Another chief executive told me his company was still running nearly 400 applications, from till software to enterprise resource planning systems, three years after a merger. He had deliberately left the least visible but hardest integration task until last.Such caution is sensible, because as well as the risk of IT collapse, companies are also vulnerable to IT over-reach. A 2011 study by Bent Flyvbjerg and Alexander Budzier of Oxford university’s Saïd Business School found that IT projects typically over-ran their budget by more than a quarter. More worryingly, that average concealed a “fat tail” of one in six projects that came in at three times their projected cost, and took 70 per cent longer than expected.The academics warned at the time that one day a large company would fail because of an out-of-control IT project. That has not happened, in part because of the rise of “agile” techniques for technology and product development. Alas, pushing through shorter-term IT improvements at speed with smaller teams can make things worse.The researchers have found that a plethora of small projects adds to overall complexity. Bigger upgrades, dragged out over three or more years, get overtaken by tech advances. The sweet spot for successful IT upgrades is one to two years.In any case, Prof Flyvbjerg, who sticks to his prediction of a large IT-induced corporate collapse, points out that “the key to protecting yourself against these blow-ups isn’t related to the technology, it’s related to the people”. Which brings me back to BA.Join us on June 19th for a conversation about automation and what it means for the future world of work.Unions were quick to blame last week’s chaos at the airline on its outsourcing of certain IT functions. BA has denied such a link.But boards often bundle technology improvements with organisational change, lured by another glossy promise of technology: that improved IT will allow fewer staff to do the same job more efficiently.When a problem occurs, or project costs balloon out of control, companies can quickly enter a vicious circle of further cuts leading to more internal friction.Here is where incumbent airlines and banks — once early adopters, now the haunted inheritors of the old tech to which Mr Nilekani referred — find themselves: with too many complex systems in their back office and too few people out front to handle the simple human consequences when something goes wrong.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
56;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-04-12T17:24:53Z;Delta upbeat on outlook despite higher fuel costs;Key sales measure set to be in black after nine-quarter decline though profits fell;Delta Air Lines said it expected to snap a nine-quarter decline in a key sales measure, even as the carrier faces a surge in fuel costs and the repercussions of storms that hit its Atlanta hub last week.The Georgia-based group on Wednesday forecast passenger unit revenues, which gauge the sales generated for each passenger flown a mile, will climb 1-3 per cent in the quarter that ends in June. That would mark an uptick from the 0.5 per cent decline in the first quarter of this year.Delta’s improved outlook comes after it disclosed last week a 0.5 per cent rise in March passenger unit revenues, which marked the first monthly increase since November 2015.The group’s shares advanced 1.2 per cent to $45.85 on Wednesday, cutting their year-to-date decline to below 5 per cent. Shares in American Airlines, one of Delta’s main US rivals, were also up by roughly the same margin to $44.55.However, some Wall Street analysts are worried that Delta’s outlook may be too rosy.“We believe investors will view this guide as aggressive especially given the unit revenue mis-steps in [the first quarter of 2017],” said Helane Becker at Cowen & Co, referring to Delta’s earlier projection that first-quarter passenger unit revenues would be flat to up 2 per cent.“That said, this guidance should be viewed as quite bullish as it is inclusive of the April storm, meaning that the underlying environment is quite strong.”The carrier expects the severe weather that pounded its Atlanta hub and led to cancellations of about 4,000 flights will probably reduce this quarters pre-tax income by $125m.Net profits fell to $603m, down from $946m in the same quarter last year, following a sharp rise in fuel prices. Delta’s adjusted fuel expense climbed by $327m year-on-year, as the average price for a gallon of fuel soared from $1.33 to $1.71.The jump in fuel costs came as the average settlement price of US crude oil in the first quarter in 2017 was $51.78 a barrel, compared with $33.63 a barrel in the year-prior period, Bloomberg data show.Delta’s first-quarter revenues fell 1.1 per cent to $9.1bn, matching Wall Street expectations.Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis that excludes certain items, came in at 77 cents, exceeding analyst estimates of 75 cents.“Despite fuel price pressures, the Delta people once again delivered solid results across the board, with double-digit operating margins, strong improvements in customer satisfaction, and progress on our international expansion with the closing of our Aeroméxico transaction,” said Ed Bastian, Delta chief executive.Big US carriers have been in the spotlight this week after video surfaced of a man being violently removed from a flight on United Continental.After initially backing his employees, United chief Oscar Munoz apologised on Tuesday, and repeated his mea culpa on US television on Wednesday.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir

Unit revenues, which are closely watched by industry analysts, slipped 0.5 per cent, but capacity also declined by the same margin.Delta’s adjusted fuel expense climbed by $327m year-on-year, as the average price for a gallon of fuel soared to $1.71, from $1.33.Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis that excludes certain items, came in at 77 cents, exceeding expectations of 75 cents.“Despite fuel price pressures, the Delta people once again delivered solid results across the board, with double digit operating margins, strong improvements in customer satisfaction, and progress on our international expansion with the closing of our Aeroméxico transaction,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive.The carrier added that it expects the severe weather at its Atlanta hub last week that led to cancellations of about 4,000 flights will likely reduce current quarter pre-tax income by $125m. Delta said that it expects second quarter passenger unit revenue to rise 1 – 3 per cent, with capacity flat or up 1 per cent.The shares rose by 2.4 per cent in pre-market trading. As of Tuesday’s close, they were down by 7.9 per cent for 2017.Big US carriers have been in the spotlight this week after a scandal erupted after video surfaced of a man being violently removed from a flight on United, one of Delta’s chief competitors.
58;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Airlines shares hit as northeast braces for Winter Storm Stella;;It’s not just flights that are being grounded on Monday.Shares in major US airlines are also getting their wings clipped as cities up and down the mid-Atlantic and northeast coast brace for a paralyzing blizzard that could bring as much as two feet of snow to some areas.United Continental led the decline in the sector, dropping 3.5 per cent to $69.80. It was followed by American Airlines, down 2.9 per cent at $42.63 and Southwest Airlines, which retreated 1.6 per cent to $54.99.Delta Air Lines, the country’s largest carrier by market value, fell 1.3 per cent to $47.29.The sell-off comes as airlines are forced to cancel thousands of flights in the northeast ahead of what is being predicted as one of the worst winter storms of the season.While carriers are no strangers to revenues lost from flight cancellations and disruptions, unlike previous storms — such as the 2015 blizzard that forced New York City to shut down its subway system — airlines will not be able to count on cheap fuel prices to help offset the revenue shortfall.Indeed, even before news of Winter Storm Stella, airlines have been cautioning about tougher trading conditions for this year as the rebound in oil pushed fuel prices back up.Delta unexpectedly cut its guidance on a number of key metrics earlier this month after it said fare hikes have been unable to keep up with the pace of fuel price and wage increase.
59;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2017-03-06T17:01:30Z;Airlines get wings clipped after Delta guidance cut;;Airline stocks were cruising at a lower altitude on Monday after Delta Air Lines unexpectedly cut its guidance on a number of key metrics amid rising fuel prices and labour costs.The US’s largest carrier by market value said it expect passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) – a closely followed industry measure of pricing power – will be flat for the current quarter, which ends in March.This compares to the 0-2 per cent growth range it had forecast just two months ago and prompted Delta shares to slide 3.2 per cent in early trading.Operating margins are also expected to come in weaker for the March quarter as fare hikes fail to keep up with the pace of fuel price and wage increases. They are now seen to be in the 10 to 11 per cent range – down from the 11 to 13 per cent forecast it issued in January and below the 18.5 per cent recorded during the first quarter of last year.Delta said in a presentation to investors on Monday:For the March quarter, Delta is expecting pressures on margins as the pace of change in unit revenue will not match the cost impact of higher fuel prices and employee wage increases. This margin pressure is likely to peak in the March quarter, and the company expects margins to expand beginning in the second half of the year.The guidance cuts weighed on the wider airline sector, with the benchmark NYSE Arca Airline index losing 2.5 per cent – the most since late January.Within this, shares in Southwest Airline and United Continental were down 2.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively while American Airlines dropped 4.2 per cent.After reaping the benefits of lower fuel prices for the past few years, airlines are bracing for a tougher 2017 as market fuel prices continue to rise in tandem with the rebound in oil prices and companies struck a number of new labour agreements with their employees.Employees and fuel are airlines’ two largest cost bases.
60;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

And while the Oracle of Omaha has previously called airlines “a death trap for investors”, Berkshire has spent more than $2.1bn each on the shares of four carriers.In pre-market trading, American Airlines added 2.8 per cent, Delta Air Lines gained 2.5 per cent, United Continental Holdings rose 2.1 per cent and Southwest Airlines was up 2.5 per cent.Though Berkshire did not disclose shares in Alaska Airlines, its shares were also 1.3 per cent higher.It was first reported Mr Buffett, who had disparaged the stocks for years, had begun buying airline shares in November after several carriers had indicated signs of improvement. Prolonged weakness in fares, which had hit profits, had been easing, and a key industry metric, revenue per available seat mile, was recovering.Shares in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index are up more more than 40 per cent over the last 12 months.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6 per cent to 19,971, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8 per cent to 5,614.A measure of expected volatility for US stocks responded with its largest move upwards since the US election, but nonetheless remained at historically low levels.Despite volatility remaining low, and sentiment still broadly constructive for equity markets, investors are taking the opportunity to buy cheap protection, hedging against the possibility of a sudden downturn in stock prices.Traders have attributed some of the activity to one investor, now nicknamed “50 cent” because they purchase protection on the Vix volatility index each morning at a price of just $0.50.“Given all the political uncertainty, it is odd for the Vix to be so low and people are loading up on equity crash protection while it is cheap,” said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors.US airline stocks were among the worst performers on Monday, after President Donald Trump blamed a Delta Air Lines systems outage for widespread confusion over the implementation of his travel ban, despite the technical problem coming well after issues at airports across the country had begun.Delta shares dropped 4.1 per cent to $47.67 in New York on Monday, alongside American Airlines, which fell 4.4 per cent to $44.90, and United Continental Holdings, down 3.6 per cent to $71.72. Alaska and Southwest, the other two airline stocks in the S&P 500 index, were also hit, down 1 per cent to $94.16 and 0.7 per cent to $52.35, respectively.It comes after Mr Trump’s travel ban caused turmoil at airports across the US over the weekend, as people travelling to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries — including refugees and green card holders — were detained when trying to enter the country.Mr Trump blamed a systems outage at Delta that resulted in flight cancellations on Sunday evening and Monday morning. But the technical issue came well after detentions and protests had begun across the country on Saturday morning.Delta’s issue follows computer glitches that have grounded flights run by United Airlines, Air Canada and Porter this year.“It makes people nervous in a broader sense,” said Chris Higgins, an aerospace and airline analyst at Morningstar. “These IT issues seem to be happening over and over again, so when there is a problem like this people see it as a broader problem.”Mr Higgins added that travel was “very discretionary”, meaning the travel ban could be off-putting even to those who were not from the affected countries.Elsewhere, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists on Monday forecast that the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield would rise above 3 per cent by the end of the second quarter, as renewed vigour in the so-called Trumpflation trade continued to be bolstered by strong economic data.In a lighter morning for earnings announcements, Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, issued a profit warning on the back of a disappointing holiday season and said it would cut 6 per cent of its workforce, pushing its shares down 16 per cent to $6.06.

But the technical issue came well-after detentions and protest had begun across the country Saturday morning.Airlines, including American, Virgin and British Airways, said they would assist affected customers, including offering refunds.On Monday, the Air Line Pilots Association warned US members from those countries named in the ban that they should not accept assignments to fly outside the US for fear that they wouldn’t be able to get back into the country.“We recommend that green card holders from the above countries not accept assignments outside the U.S. until the government has confirmed that they will be permitted to return to the U.S. without challenge,” said the statement. “As of this moment, statements from the U.S. government have not provided assurance on this point.”

Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,…..” Mr Trump tweeted early Monday morning.The IT outage referred to by Mr Trump led to the cancellation of only 150 domestic flights on Sunday evening.It is unrelated to the protests – triggered by Mr Trump’s sweeping executive order on Friday to ban refugees and nationals from seven largely Muslim countries from entering the US – at airports across the country over the weekend.

Several years on from the megamergers that consolidated the industry into three primary carriers, the ability to go for a few years without losing money is taken for granted. Investors instead grade airlines on a curve according to their efficiency. How much revenue they make relative to their capacity — revenue per available seat mile — is the main item on investors’ report card.In recent years, that figure has been slipping. As is the risk in a quasi cartel, the group raised capacity to grow overall revenue at the expense of efficiency. The market, sensing a return to bad old ways, punished their shares. But Delta Air Lines’ comments earlier this week during its fourth-quarter earnings reveal the sector is learning its lesson.The sector had already rallied sharply in recent months on the “reflation” trade. Rising consumer prices make it easier for airlines to raise fares. Additionally, tax reform is expected to favour those companies with domestic income bases and heavy capital investment levels. In the past six months, the shares of Delta, American Airlines, and UnitedContinental have jumped by 43 per cent, on average.Earlier this month, Delta said revenue per passenger mile declined nearly 3 per cent last year — but promised that figure would be flat to positive in the first quarter of 2017. Its operating margin target for the quarter will be 12 per cent, on the way to an overall goal of 18 per cent. It pledged to remain disciplined on capacity until that target was reached. Efficiency gains are needed, since costs are also going up. Fuel expense and new labour agreements will contribute to a 5 to 7 per cent growth in costs per passenger mile, Delta estimates.The focus on these second-order metrics almost obscures the industry’s overall good marks. In 2016, Delta generated $4bn in net income and spent $3bn on dividends and buybacks. It boasts an equity value of nearly $40bn, compared with $7bn of net debt. But scoring high grades raises expectations. A more consistent level of coursework is now needed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Adjusted net income came in at $604m, a 35 per cent drop from the year ago period, as a result of new wage agreement with its pilots.The market had forecast revenue of $9.4bn and adjusted net income of $603.63m or 82 cents a share.

The airlines promise “seamless operations”, joint marketing, better connecting schedules for more frequent flights to more places, as well as a better customer experience on the ground.“The airlines have been partners for 22 years. The regulatory approval represents an important milestone in the process, announced last year, to launch a cash tender offer for Delta’s acquisition for up to 49 percent of Grupo Aeromexico S.A.B. de C.V., capital stock, further strengthening the partnership between the two airlines,” they said in the statement.Mexican regulators had objected to the original terms of the deal, saying it could force up prices on routes because of a reduction of competitive pressures. It would also have meant other airlines would have struggled to gain slots at Mexico City’s saturated international airport.

When it comes to arriving at your destination quickly planes can suffer the weather’s vagaries, while trains comfortably plod along. So it is with Warren Buffett’s rail operator BNSF, a predictable payer of dividends.Yet in an unexpected show of confidence, the Sage of Omaha has now invested $1.2bn in the four largest airlines, a historically more volatile sector. To vindicate his investment in American Airlines, Delta, Southwest and United Continental, the industry needs to abstain from mutually destructive infighting.Mr Buffett’s bet on passenger (not freight) transportation is in parts justified by recent consolidation. Despite rumblings about antitrust from the Department of Justice, only four of 10 US mega airlines remain after the Obama years. Mr Buffett’s disclosed airline investments cover 69 per cent of all distance travelled by domestic air passengers, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.Less competition has improved airline profitability. And so have lower fuel prices. Profit margins across all carriers are at their highest in 10 years. Yet while railway networks are geographically demarcated, the sky is limitless — destabilising price wars can never be ruled out.Investors worry about airline managements’ discipline under competitive pressure. That concern is expressed in their focus on revenue per available seat miles, a ratio that measures the hypothetical total distance travelled by passengers if all seats were filled. This ratio has continued to decline this year, indicating either pricing pressure or carriers’ overconfidence in building up seating capacity.Airlines are reacting. They are ordering fewer planes. Price earnings ratios — before the Buffett news spurred a rally — are as cheap as they have been in two years.Some conditions of a value investment seem satisfied. But full confidence requires faith that the boom and bust capacity cycle has been broken. As yet that is not clear.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
70;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-11-14T23:06:27Z;Warren Buffett invests $1.2bn in US airlines;Berkshire Hathaway reveals holdings in industry he called an investor ‘death trap’;"Warren Buffett used to call the airline industry “a death trap for investors”, but the world’s best known stockpicker has spent more than $1.2bn building stakes in four US airlines, he said on Monday.Disclosure of the investments by Mr Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, caused shares in the four companies — United Continental, American Airlines, Delta and Southwest — to rise sharply in after-hours trading.The news raised Buffett-watchers’ eyebrows, too.Mr Buffett has not only eschewed airline stocks for years; he has actively disparaged an industry where intense competition, high labour costs and volatile fuel prices have caused repeated rounds of bankruptcies.According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire had amassed a $797m stake in American Airlines as of September 30, along with $238m in United Continental and $249m in Delta. The Southwest stake was purchased after the end of the third quarter and was not included in the filing.Mr Buffett revealed the existence of the Southwest stake in an interview with CNBC following publication of the filing. “I’d feel terrible if the story the next day was why wasn’t Southwest included,” he said.He declined to discuss the investment thesis behind the stakebuilding by Berkshire, where he now shares investment responsibilities with two other fund managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. The pair has already widened Berkshire’s range of investments once this year; one of them was responsible for buying a $1bn stake in Apple in March, after years when their boss had shunned tech stocks.At Berkshire’s annual meeting in 2013, Mr Buffett told attendees that the airline industry was a “death trap”, saying: “Investors have poured their money into airlines for 100 years with terrible results.”Mr Buffett had sworn off airline stocks since suffering heartburn on an investment he made in US Airways in 1989. In 2003, he joked he had set up a freephone number to call counsellors who would talk him down if he got the urge to buy airline stocks. “My name is Warren and I’m an aeroholic,” he said.US airlines have exercised restraint in adding capacity and launching price wars since emerging from the Great Recession and, together with the effects of lower fuel costs, they managed record profits in 2015. This year’s rebound in oil prices has hit profits, however, and made airline shares cheaper.George Hamlin, analyst at Hamlin Transportation Consulting, said investing in all four airline stocks is an unusual move. “Over the past six or eight years, US airlines have focused far more on return on investment and far less on market share than ever before. What Buffett is basically saying is that the US industry has reached a position of relative stability and will behave.”US airline stocks have gained favour with investors in the last few weeks after several carriers have indicated that prolonged weakness in fares, which had hit profits, was likely to ease soon and the metric of revenue per available seat mile was likely to turn positive early next year after many months in negative territory."
71;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-10-26T14:46:30Z;Airlines shares hit as industry feels drag from higher fuel, labour costs;;Forecasts of higher labour costs and rebounding fuel prices are leading to turbulence for airline stocks after a rocky quarter.Shares of Southwest Airlines, the second largest US carrier by market value, fell 11.5 per cent on Wednesday after it became the latest major US airline to report declining third-quarter revenues. Shares in competitor Delta Air Lines declined 1.5 per cent and United Continental Holdings shares were down 2.6 per cent after Southwest announced its results.Southwest’s results echoed some of the same third-quarter themes reported by its peers — namely, increasingly volatilie fuel and labour costs — which could make it more difficult to sustain lower fares that have boosted passenger demand.After reaping the benefits of lower fuel prices for the past few years, airline revenues could be coming under pressure as market fuel prices rise year-over-year for the first time in more than two years and are poised to increase in the coming quarter, Delta executives said in a recent earnings call.“Demand has been strong, but it’s related to weak pricing,” said Delta chief executive Edward Bastian on a recent earnings call, calling the current revenue environment one of the most challenging in recent memory. The fare-price wars may have encouraged more customers to take flight in recent months, but that could be poised to change as airlines adjust for increasing costs.Labour has also been a wild card for airline margins, as a flurry of new agreements are inked between airlines and some of their largest employee groups. United Continental’s 25,000 flight attendants have recently ratified a new contract, and a tentative deal is in place with 9,000 technicians. Delta is forging ahead with a potential agreement with its pilots. Southwest, too, has said it has proposed deals in place with technician, pilots and flight attendants, which must be approved by those respective groups.United’s chief financial officer Andrew Levy said that, even though the airline hopes the more collaborative deals will boost employee morale and spark greater productivity and better customer service, he expected labour expenses, alongside a higher fuel curve, to be one of the most important cost factors it faces in coming months.Generally speaking, “we’re going to see an increase in labor expense. It is not completely offset by the profit-sharing or productivity. So we’re going to have to find ways to drive revenue and reduce expenses to continue to grow our margins,” Mr Levy said during a recent earnings call.As a result, airlines are adjusting their 2017 plans to project a more modest outlook in order to shore up the all-important passenger revenue metric.Southwest chief executive Gary Kelly said the airline will “continue to manage our growth prudently in light of the revenue environment and increasing fuel prices.” Delta said it expects to restrict capacity growth to around 1 per cent for next year, to withstand the weak pricing environment. United’s president J. Scott Kirby told investors that, while capacity is still outpacing demand, “we’re making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategies to help counteract that.”Investors may have expected the heady days of record profits from 2015 to continue, but for airlines, the cyclical forces of labour and fuel costs are not a major surprise. “We expected to have a pilot deal. We expected fuel prices to start to pick up,” said Delta chief executive Edward Bastian during a third-quarter earnings call.
72;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-10-13T21:14:16Z;Delta Air Lines turns positive on metric prediction;Looking more broadly, US equities experience selling pressure after weak China trade data;Airline stocks performed strongly on Thursday after Delta Air Lines said it expected a closely watched industry metric to turn positive again next year.The US’s number two carrier by traffic reversed a 3.5 per cent decline early in the day to close 1.9 per cent higher at $40.01, after Ed Bastian, its chief executive, predicted passenger revenue per available seat mile (Prasm) would return to positive territory in early 2017.While Mr Bastian acknowledged the pricing environment was “the weakest in many years”, he said the company also saw “a lot of green shoots in the domestic arena”.The company is moving to reduce capacity growth, limiting it to 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, in an attempt to boost fares. Mr Bastian said he expected these moves would help return Prasm numbers to growth following a 3-5 per cent decline in the fourth quarter.The upbeat comments helped drag rival airline stocks out of the red. American Airlines jumped 5 per cent to $39.24, Southwest Airlines gained 3.4 per cent to $41.38 while United Continental rose 1.5 per cent to $53.69.Having ended 2014 as one of Wall Street’s best-performing sectors as low fuel prices boosted profits, airline stocks have struggled as rivals expanded capacity and drove down fare prices.The NYSE Arca Airline index lost 16.5 per cent last year. It rose 2.1 per cent on Thursday, taking its year-to-date gain to 8.2 per cent.Elsewhere, shares of Baxter International, the healthcare equipment group, advanced after analysts at Wells Fargo started coverage of it with an “outperform” rating.The bank took a bullish stance on its strategic plan that Baxter started implementing after the spin-off last year of Baxalta, its biotechnology unit.“We believe [Baxter] can accelerate its sales growth and expand its operating margin to consistently deliver low- to mid-single digit [earnings per share] growth,” analyst Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo said.“Strengthening [of the] balance sheet could further enhance the long-term growth.”Baxter’s stock gained 1.6 per cent to $47.72, bringing the year-to-date gain to 25 per cent.The equities market faced selling pressure on Thursday after weak trade data from China shook investors’ confidence.The country faced a 10 per cent year-on-year drop in exports, in dollar terms, in September, widely missing economist forecasts of a 3.3 per cent drop and sparking worries about global demand.The data came as investors were already nervous about the sluggish pace of global economic growth despite years of aggressive stimulus measures by central banks.Economically sensitive sectors logged the steepest falls, with financials down 1.1 per cent, materials off 0.5 per cent, technology giving up 0.6 per cent and energy slipping 0.7 per cent.Inversely, sectors seen as insulated from economic fluctuations and utilised as bond proxies because of their steady dividends shined. The utilities group jumped 1.3 per cent, while real estate advanced 0.5 per cent.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent to 2,132.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off by the same margin at 18,098.9, and the Nasdaq Composite sold off by 0.5 per cent to 5,213.3.
73;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Share buyback helps Delta to earnings beat;;There’s a reason corporate America is in love with share buybacks.Delta Air Lines became the latest to report a smaller than expected decline in third quarter profit on Thursday thanks to the company’s stock repurchase programme.For the three months to end of September, sales fell 5.6 per cent to $10.5bn – in line with analysts forecasts.But a $500m share buyback programme during the quarter helped the US’s number two airline by traffic beat expectations on an earnings-per-share basis by reducing the number of the company’s outstanding share compared to a year ago.Net income came in at $1.26bn or $1.69 per diluted share, ahead of the $1.23bn or $1.64 a share the market was expecting.Passenger unit revenue – a closely followed industry metric – fell 6.8 per cent during the quarter, no thanks in part to this summer’s computer system crash that forced the airline to cancel about 2,300 flights.Delta said it expected the decline to moderate to between 3 to 5 per cent for the fourth quarter as it moves to slow capacity growth. Nonetheless it is still forecasting a slight decline in margin as gains from cheaper fuel are wiped out by lower fares and higher wages.“With our focus on building a more sustainable and durable business, we will be taking a cautious approach to 2017 by keeping our capacity in line with the December quarter’s 1 percent growth level,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive.Investors were unimpressed and sent Delta shares down 0.7 per cent in pre-market trading.
74;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-09-07T17:31:56Z;Delta Air Lines cuts profit guidance after computer crash;Carrier says margins will be lower after technology glitch forces cancellation of 2,300 flights;Delta Air Lines on Wednesday cut its profitability guidance for the third quarter after a computer system crash at the leading US airline last month caused chaos, forcing it to cancel about 2,300 flights.Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer, told a conference in Boston the airline expects operating profit margins to fall to between 18 and 19 per cent in the three months to September 30, compared with a previous forecast of 19 to 21 per cent.Other US airlines have encountered information technology problems this year that disrupted flights, and Mr Jacobson stressed Delta was seeking to avoid a repeat of its IT outage, which caused widespread problems for the carrier’s booking, check-in and flight systems.“It becomes a complete tragedy if we don’t use it as a learning experience,” said Mr Jacobson, adding “we like to think of ourselves as an industrial transportation company but we are every bit as much a technology company as well and the reliability of the systems has to match that”. Mr Jacobson said the knock-on effects of the IT outage would cut Delta’s pre-tax income by $150m in the third quarter.He also said unit revenues were predicted to fall 7 per cent in the quarter, including one percentage point because of the outage, but added that the “performance has improved”.Mr Jacobson highlighted how Delta was this autumn implementing capacity reductions. Such cuts can give airlines the ability to raise fares.Delta’s shares rose 4.9 per cent in early afternoon trading in New York, to $38.62, with analysts saying they were relieved that the impact of Delta’s computer crash was not even more significant. The company said last month that it had suffered a loss of power at its technology centre in Atlanta, and that important systems did not switch to back-up arrangements as they should have done. As a result, 2,300 flights were cancelled over three days during August.Mr Jacobson said Delta had began to outline “a plan” to try to ensure that a similar computer failure could never happen again. “We will be investing over the next couple of years to achieve that goal,” he added.George Hamlin of Hamlin Transportation Consulting said: “This would get any reasonable management’s attention and I think Delta’s management is reasonable.“I’m sure Band-Aids have been applied, but has the underlying problem in the circulatory system been addressed? It’s probably still under way. They may have uncovered other things systemically that need to be addressed.” Last week Delta said passenger revenue per available seat mile, a closely watched measure of unit sales, fell 9.5 per cent in August, year on year, after a 7 per cent drop in July. It added the computer outage impacted revenue by $100m in August.
75;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta lowers margins forecast in wake of IT glitch;;Delta Air Lines, which is struggling to recover its reputation for punctuality after a computer crash caused the cancellation of about 2,300 flights last month, has revised down its projected operating margins for the third quarter and estimated the cost of the IT glitch at $150m for the quarter.Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer, told a conference in Boston today that “this has been a challenging quarter made more challenging by the power outages we had last month… but the business story in the long term remains intact…and there are reasons to be optimistic that we are heading in the right direction for the fourth quarter”.Delta expects its operating profit margin to fall to between 18 and 19 per cent compared with a previous forecast of 19 to 21 per cent.Last week Delta said passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a closely-watched sales metric in the airline industry, fell 9.5 per cent in August, year-on-year, after a 7 per cent drop in July, writes Patti Waldmeir in Chicago.Delta faced three days of systems chaos after a backup system failed to take over after a power outage.“The August outage negatively impacted revenue by roughly $100 million for the month – or by two points of PRASM,” the company said in a statement adding:The airline also continues to see pressure from close-in domestic yield weakness – pricing on business travel tickets purchased close to the time of travel. Other pressure points cited are ongoing supply-demand imbalance in the trans-Atlantic and headwinds from its Yen hedge positions.

Other pressure points cited are ongoing supply-demand imbalance in the trans-Atlantic and headwinds from its Yen hedge positions,” the company said in a statement.Analysts for Cowen Group have estimated the financial impact of third quarter results of about $120m, the results of cancellations, delays and customer decisions to book on alternative carriers. Previously Delta boasted of its operational performance and lack of cancellations.“The true impact of the flight cancellations and delays will be felt on Delta’s costs. Delta will now face headwinds associated with less capacity and incremental costs from employee overtime and re-bookings”, Cowen said in a research note.Delta released the news on the eve of the long Labor Day holiday weekend, traditionally a peak travel time in the airline industry. Analysts expect a 4 per cent rise in passenger traffic over the seven-day Labor Day travel period, to 15.6m as low jet fuel prices helps to keep fares low.
77;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-08-10T14:29:13Z;Delta struggles through third day of disruptions;;Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday the travel chaos of the last 48 hours could end as soon as this afternoon as it scrambles to contain the reputation damage caused after a computer crash grounded planes around the world and left thousands stranded.However, the US’s number two carrier by traffic warned that fate may still intervene to disrupt the return to normal, pointing out that “a chance of scattered thunderstorms expected in the eastern US may have the potential slow the recovery”.Delta said it started operations today with about 150 cancellations after 800 flights were cancelled Tuesday and 1,000 on Monday, reports Patti Waldmeir in Chicago.“Technology systems that allow airport customer service agents to process check-ins, conduct boarding and dispatch aircraft are functioning normally with the bulk of delays and cancellations coming as a result of flight crews displaced or running up against their maximum allowed duty period following the outage” it said in a statement on its website.Delta shares fell 2.2 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, extending its losses from the previous two days. The stock is down 3.6 per cent since Monday and has shed more than 28 per cent of its value since the start of the year.“This isn’t the quality of service, the reliability that you’ve come to expect from Delta Air Lines,” said a contrite and exhausted looking Ed Bastian, Delta CEO, in a video posted to the company’s website. “We’re very sorry, I’m personally very sorry,” Mr Bastian said, promising “We’ll do everything we can to make sure this never happens again.”Delta said Monday that a power outage caused the systems failure, and Gil West, chief operating officer, elaborated Tuesday saying that “a critical power control module” had malfunctioned, causing a surge to the transformer and a loss of power. Airline industry analysts have questioned why Delta did not have adequate backup systems to deal with such an outage.
78;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-08-09T22:11:01Z;Delta warns of more flight disruption after IT glitch;US carrier struggles to recover from computer crash traced to power failure at Atlanta base;Delta Air Lines cancelled more flights on Tuesday and predicted further disruption following the computer system crash that grounded all of its planes around the world on Monday.The US carrier cancelled about 1,000 of its nearly 6,000 scheduled flights on Monday and said it would cancel 250 more on Tuesday.Gil West, chief operating officer, elaborated on the cause of the disruption, saying in a statement on Tuesday afternoon that “a critical power control module” at its technology command centre in Atlanta had malfunctioned, causing a surge to the transformer and a loss of power.Although power had been restored quickly, “critical systems and network equipment didn’t switch over to backups. Other systems did. And now we’re seeing instability in these systems.”Systems affecting check in and boarding were still running slowly he said, adding that disrupted flights mean Delta crews could not get to cities where they were needed, leading to further chaos for passengers.Georgia Power said on Monday that Delta’s problem was caused by a “failure overnight in a piece of equipment known as switchgear”. The electricity provider said it had traced the fault to a fusebox-like component that routes energy into a business or home and distributes it onwards.Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, apologised for the disruption and offered a waiver allowing affected passengers to rebook flights scheduled for Monday or Tuesday. Mr West said Delta would provide $200 in travel vouchers to all passengers whose flights were cancelled or had been delayed by more than three hours.Delta “has done a lot of the right things”, including apologising and offering refunds, Jim Corridore of S&P Global Market Intelligence said on Tuesday: “We think that, as long as there are no repeat occurrences of the issue, [Delta] should not see major customer defections or investors adding an extra risk premium to the shares.”The outage was one of several that have hit US airlines, underscoring their vulnerability to IT problems.George Hamlin, airline analyst at Hamlin Transportation Consulting, said a power outage was a “reasonable explanation but it doesn’t answer the question of why they didn’t have a back-up or why it failed”.“There have been meltdowns of airline computer systems in recent times but they haven’t have to do with an external power outage.”American Airlines suspended flights for several hours from Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami and Chicago in September after what it called “connectivity issues”. Southwest Airlines grounded flights last month after a technology failure.On Monday, passengers around the globe vented their frustration with the lack of communication from Delta, which announced the problems initially on Twitter. “Unfortunately, we aren’t able to access any of our systems,” it said early on Monday.Lauren Schaefer, who was delayed at London’s main airport, wrote on Twitter: “I’m sorry to say Delta but you have failed me. Stuck at Heathrow airport for who knows how long.”Delta shares, down 32 per cent this year as excess capacity in the US market put pressure on earnings, closed down 0.6 per cent on Monday and slipped another 0.35 per cent by Tuesday lunchtime.Fitch Ratings did not expect the outage to affect Delta’s credit rating but said such events could have a “meaningful” financial impact and could “generate a material amount of negative press and ill will with passengers”.Flights in the air during the outage were unaffected, but all other departures from Delta, which operates about 5,000 flights a day, were grounded for several hours.Delta said: “Customers heading to the airport should expect delays and cancellations. While inquiries are high and wait times are long, our customer service agents are doing everything they can to assist. There may also be some lag time in the display of accurate flight status at delta.com, the Fly Delta app and from Delta representatives on the phone and in [the] airport.”
79;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-08-08T16:47:14Z;Delta: 365 flights canceled, delays continue;;Delta Air Lines struggled to get back on track after a system outage forced it to ground all of its flights earlier this morning and threw its global operations in disarray.The country’s second-largest carrier by traffic said that as of noon, 365 flights have been cancelled and that it has operated 1,260 flights, or just a little bit over a fifth of the 6,000 flights scheduled today.Delta said the problem started with a power outage in Atlanta, its home base, at around 2:30am local time and spilled over into its computer systems – prompting it to halt all flights for about six hours.The company lifted the ground stop at around 8:40am local time but warned that cancellations and delays will continue.“Customers heading to the airport should expect delays and cancellations,” it said. “While inquiries are high and wait times are long, our customer service agents are doing everything they can to assist.”It is not immediately clear how big of a financial impact the outage – which have left thousands stranded during peak summer travel season – will have on the company. Shares in Delta fluctuated between gains and losses on Monday. They were down 0.1 per cent at $37.61 at pixel time.

82;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-07-31T15:09:13Z;The American consumer’s impotent rage;People sense that service providers pay more attention to regulators than to disaffected customers;Ask any American if they have lost their temper recently and there is a good chance it was on the phone to one of their service providers. Whether they were venting their spleen at a cable service company, a cell-phone operator, an airline or a health insurer hardly matters. What unites them is the impotent rage that comes from knowing how little you can do to punish the company in question.There was a time when the US consumer was still king. In most service markets, however, those days are over. If you are looking for a key to the American voter’s rage, keep in mind that the consumer is the same person. Most consumers — a steadily rising share according to surveys — are prone to moments of Trumpian rage nowadays. Lashing out usually makes things worse. But that is what people who feel powerless are liable to do.Many people’s instinct is to blame free markets for their sense of consumer impotence. In fact, the problem stems from lack of competition. Much like in politics, where congressional boundaries are rigged in favour of incumbents, most large US service sectors are dominated by a shrinking handful of players.Sectors where the top four companies have markedly increased their market share in the past decade — and thus their scope to treat consumers with impunity — include telecoms, information technology, transport, retail services and banking, according to a survey by The Economist. If you are still wondering why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did so well — taking more than 40 per cent of the two parties’ primary votes between them — both talked of how US politics is rigged. It is no accident that most Americans think the same about their economy.They have sound reasons to do so. The last people to grasp that things have gone wrong are the wealthy, the well-connected and the cognitive elites, which includes half the denizens of Washington. The wealthy’s share of the economy has risen sharply since the start of the century. The share of corporate profits in the economy has also soared.If you are rich you can afford what used to be normal for everyone — the privilege of interacting with human beings. Thus, high net worth individuals receive personalised banking, where your bank manager knows your name and needs. The wealthy also benefit from so-called concierge health services, which come with a human face. Many oligopolistic service providers keep clandestine lists of VIP customers who need not wade through robotic software before reaching a customer service agent. When they pick up the phone, a human answers.Ordinary consumers, much like most voters, know there are different rules for them. They also sense that the big service providers pay more attention to Washington regulators than to their disaffected customers. It is a perfectly rational thing to do. America’s capital is where the markets are rigged, after all.Politicians rank their priorities in much the same order. Voters come low on their list. Lawmakers devote chunks of their schedules to raising money from donors. In most districts, the voter barely matters since gerrymandering has rigged the election in favour of one or other party. Politicians with large war chests are far less likely to be challenged for their party’s nomination. The same logic leads companies to keep a strong lobbying presence in Washington.So what can people do? As consumers very little. If United Airlines keeps bumping you off flights, you might shift your mileage account to Delta or American. But your chances of mistreatment will not fall. Ditto for those who switch their health insurance from Cigna to Aetna, or their broadband from Comcast to Verizon. Perhaps you can start a new company? Alas, what goes in Silicon Valley for people seeking funding for social media start-ups does not apply to markets with high barriers to entry. America’s big four airlines might provide dismal service to most customers. But they are Olympic champions at stopping “open skies” competition.Maybe you should just shout at customer representatives? That is what many people do. But it usually backfires. Besides, on the rare occasions you reach a human, they are the last people you should berate. America’s mostly outsourced contact services industry is staffed by people reading instructions from a software manual. Every minute of their time is monitored. Consumers are not just voters — they are employees too.There are no easy ways to reduce market concentration, just as there are no easy fixes for corporate America’s grip on politics. But there are two simple ones. The first is to metastasise your consumer rage by voting for Mr Trump. This is the man who is best known to most Americans for saying “you’re fired” on television. For every problem America faces, he has a solution that is clear, simple and wrong. The second is to support aggressive antitrust action. Since Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency, trustbusting has a great history. It could also have a great future.Alas, no presidential nominee has yet found the conviction to champion breaking up the monopolies. The more is the pity. Taking on the titans would not just be great populism. It would also be smart policy.edward.luce@ft.com
83;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;American Airlines buffeted by tough competition;Top US carrier predicts Brexit could boost transatlantic traffic in the near term;Tough competition hit second-quarter revenues and profits of American Airlines, but cheaper fuel helped offset the negative impact, the top US carrier by traffic said.Unlike other large carriers that have recently issued profit warnings or announced capacity cuts in the wake of the UK’s referendum decision to leave the EU, American Airlines predicted that Brexit could actually boost its transatlantic traffic in the near term.“I think for the next few years at least there’s not going to be much impact from Brexit,” Scott Kirby, the airline’s president, said noting that so far it is “hard to see any evidence it’s a big problem”. He predicted that there are likely to be “a lot more lawyers, bankers, consultants flying across the Atlantic trying to figure out what it all means”.“Our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened.” Longer term impact is harder to predict, he said. “But near term I don’t anticipate an awful lot of issues.”Delta Air Lines said last week that it will reduce flight capacity to the UK over Brexit concerns.Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, said on Thursday that the “economic and operating environment” had been “difficult” in the three months ending in June, citing in part the impact of Brexit.At American, net income fell sharply in the second quarter to $950m from $1.7bn in the year earlier period, with the results hit by a $543m provision for income taxes. Excluding this, adjusted net income came in at $1bn, down 46 per cent from last year’s $1.8bn.Revenue for the quarter was $10.4bn, down 4.3 per cent year on year, and passenger revenue per available seat mile, the closely watched metric of airline performance, was down 6.3 per cent.“Second quarter 2016 revenue was hurt by competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness,” American said in a statement.Operating expenses were down 3.3 per cent to $8.6bn, but the company said that was “primarily due to a 24.9 per cent decrease in consolidated fuel expenses”.American said it would defer delivery of 22 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft.“I don’t think these are results to be concerned about immediately. But longer term, given that non-fuel costs are going up and unit revenue going down, that suggests that postponing capacity is a good thing,” said George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting.

Its shares fell almost 6 per cent on Thursday.The disappointing performances come ahead of figures on Monday from Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost carrier by revenue, which are expected to confirm the aviation industry is entering a descent after several years of steady climbing.“We’re at the end of the big bull run for earnings,” says Robin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.However, the results reflect not only weakening passenger demand — amid expectations of slowing global economic growth — but also a loss of industry discipline over fleet capacity, say analysts. Ticket prices are falling partly because airlines are pressing ahead with plans for new aircraft and routes, even as demand grows more slowly than expected.“There’s too much capacity,” says Mr Byde. “Therefore you’re seeing this weaker [average fare] environment.”The question is whether the industry can regain capacity discipline, and better align the introduction of new aircraft with growth in demand.Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, says restraint is vital if the industry is to push returns back to last year’s buoyant levels. “It needs to regain some discipline on capacity growth,” he adds.Despite the capacity issues, however, there is no doubt that a series of international events has caused a serious, unanticipated tailing-off of demand.International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia, issued a profit warning the day after the UK’s June 23 referendum on EU membership, citing weaker than expected trading in the run-up to the poll.Three days later, easyJet issued a profit warning for the April to June quarter because of several factors including air traffic control strikes. It also highlighted the risk of an economic slowdown after Britain’s vote to leave the EU.The sharp fall in the value of sterling since the UK referendum appears to be deterring many British travellers from heading overseas for summer holidays.News, comment and analysis on the UK’s decision to leave the EUThe truck attack in Nice on July 14 — France’s third terror atrocity in 18 months — has also hit demand.Last weekend’s attempted coup in Turkey has created further uncertainty over another popular holiday country.The effect has been global. Delta Air Lines of the US announced last week it would cut transatlantic capacity to the UK this winter to combat the effect of Brexit uncertainty on demand.Carolyn McCall, easyJet’s chief executive, said on Thursday the “economic and operating environment” had been “difficult” in the three months to June 30.“More recently, currency volatility as a result of the UK’s referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence,” she added.Airlines are likely to respond to the problems by, among other things, embarking on a new round of cost-cutting.News and comment on the Brussels bombings of March 22 and the attacks in the French capital in November 2015Lufthansa said it planned to cut underlying unit costs excluding fuel by 2 to 3 per cent in the second half of 2016, to tackle an expected 8 to 9 per cent decline in revenues.Yet the ultimate problem for the industry’s profitability may be that not all airlines have an incentive to rein in capacity to support ticket prices.While it could be in the interests of higher-cost flag carriers such as Lufthansa to avoid flooding the market with additional aircraft, budget airlines will be more confident that falling prices work to their advantage.EasyJet expects a year-on-year capacity increase of 6 per cent in the present quarter.Mr Byde points out that easyJet, Ryanair and other low-cost carriers tend to shape the ticket price environment for the whole market.“Both companies will see this as quite a good opportunity to revert to their good old business model of cutting prices and taking market share,” he predicts.

System capacity would rise just 1 per cent from the period last year.The news came after American Airlines this week announced a reduction to its planned capacity growth for the year.“The larger carriers are getting more aggressive on reining in capacity growth so they can get an all important metric called PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile) to turn positive,” said Jack Atkins, analyst at Stephens. “And if you cut capacity enough, you can do that.”Delta also reported profits of $1.55bn, or $2.03 a share, compared with $1.49bn, or $1.83 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.47 a share topped analysts’ estimates of $1.42 a share.Revenue fell 2.4 per cent to $10.45bn, just shy of analysts’ estimates for $10.48bn.That sent shares in the company up 3.6 per cent to $40.98 and helped trim the carrier’s year-to-date losses to 19.2 per cent.The gains in Delta shares arrived as US stocks moved to fresh highs. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 2,163.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 18,506.4, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 5,034.1.Elsewhere, shares in Line, the Tokyo-based messaging service, rose 31 per cent to $43 in its trading debut in New York.Shares traded as high as $44.49 at the market open — a 35.5 per cent jump compared with the $32.84 the stock was priced at earlier in the week.JPMorgan shares rose 1.5 per cent to $64.12 after the US bank reported second-quarter profits that topped estimates after analysts had lowered their forecasts for the entire sector.Meanwhile, shares in Yum Brands advanced 3 per cent to $88.27 after the fast-food chain raised its full-year profit outlook alongside stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.The owner of KFC and Taco Bell said it expected full-year core operating profits to climb by 14 per cent from the year prior, up from a previous forecast of 12 per cent.Cree shares jumped 10.6 per cent to $27.74 after the maker of lighting and semiconductor products said it was selling Wolfspeed to German Infineon Technologies for $850m in cash as it focused on its core LED lighting business.Chuck Swoboda, chief executive, said the move “unlocks value [and] increases management focus”. The capital raised “combined with improved free cash flow” would be used for deals and further stock buybacks, he added.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar.com
86;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Meanwhile, Microsoft shares slid 2.6 per cent to $50.14.Symantec shares rose 5.3 per cent to $18.21 after the cyber security company said it would acquire Blue Coat for about $4.65bn in cash.Greg Clark, chief executive of Blue Coat, will be appointed chief executive of Symantec after the transaction is completed.Despite investor optimism, some analysts were lukewarm on the deal. “We would have much preferred Symantec look towards where the security market is going, not where it was, when exploring potential acquisitions,” said Gur Talpaz, an analyst at Stifel.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"
88;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-06-07T14:47:39Z;Bombardier does a hard sell on its new passenger jet;Severe difficulties getting groundbreaking aircraft to commercial takeoff;Alain Bellemare is unapologetic about selling his new passenger jet, the CSeries, at a big loss. “We are going to do the deal we have to do to keep winning business and making it a success,” says the chief executive of Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft maker.Slouched into a sofa, tie askew and with a big smile on his face, Bombardier’s boss is nonetheless relishing the debate about the company’s CSeries aircraft, a 110-seat short-haul jet that is due to enter service with its first customer Swiss International Air Lines on July 15.“A year ago people were wondering if the aircraft would ever see the light,” he says in an interview with the Financial Times on the sidelines of a conference in Dublin. “Now they are wondering if it will ever be profitable.” Beside him, the head of Bombardier’s commercial aircraft division, Fred Cromer, chips in. “A year ago, you would have been asking us if we were going to survive.”Some of those questions have not entirely disappeared, especially as the already heavily indebted and lossmaking Bombardier will take a $500m “onerous contract” provision in the second quarter on deals covering 127 aircraft, including the sale of 75 CSeries jets to Delta Air Lines of the US in April.But it is clear that the company today is in a better position than it was in 2015, when Bombardier reported a second successive full-year net loss.The Delta deal was critical, the first new CSeries order in almost two years, and allows Bombardier to hit its target of having firm orders for 300 aircraft by the time the jet enters commercial service.Delta is the world’s largest airline by market capitalisation, and the deal gave the CSeries the credibility it sorely needed after years of difficulties that threatened the viability of the programme and the company itself. And persuading big airlines to buy the CSeries is vital if Bombardier is to succeed in breaking the duopoly enjoyed by Airbus and Boeing in the supply of short-haul passenger jets.At more than $5bn in development costs, and almost three years behind schedule, the CSeries forced Bombardier in 2015 to cancel one business jet programme, postpone development of another, and sell a 30 per cent stake in its train-building division. It also prompted the company to sell a big holding in the CSeries itself to Quebec’s provincial government. Now, Bombardier is negotiating a hoped-for $1bn bail out from the Canadian federal government, in return for another chunk of the CSeries programme.Yet even if having Delta put money on the table tempts others to follow, critics question how many more potential customers will demand similar price cuts on the CSeries.Mr Bellemare sidesteps the question. “We will continue to do right for customers given that we are in a very competitive environment,” he says. But losses on the first orders in a jet programme are entirely normal, he says.Boeing, the US aircraft maker, is still not profitable on its 787 Dreamliner long-haul jet, almost five years after it entered service, while Europe’s Airbus is only breaking even on a per-plane basis on its A380 superjumbo, more than eight years after its commercial launch.“This is no different than anybody else in our industry,” says Mr Bellemare, referring to the CSeries. “We are in the learning-curve period. The cost profile at this stage is not where we want it to be so it is normal.” Mr Cromer says the programme will begin generating profit by 2020-21, on a per-jet basis.Bjorn Fehrm, analyst at consultants Leeham, estimates that it takes an aircraft maker four to five years of production to bring costs on a new aircraft down to a level where programmes begin to be profitable.In the meantime, Bombardier’s success in finally reaching its CSeries order target has stung its rival, Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, which is threatening a challenge at the World Trade Organisation to Bombardier over allegedly unfair subsidies.More worryingly for future orders, Bombardier has roused Boeing and Airbus, which are determined not to allow a new competitor to encroach on their dominance of the short-haul market.Both have developed new, more fuel-efficient single-aisle jets — the Airbus A320 Neo and the Boeing 737 Max.Boeing underlined its determination not to cede ground to smaller rivals in January when United Airlines of the US chose its 737-700 jet over both the CSeries and Embraer’s new E2.People close to the bidding process told the Financial Times that Boeing entered the race very late, and only when it became clear United and Delta were seriously considering placing orders for the CSeries.Industry analysts believe Boeing offered the 737-700 jet at just over a quarter of its $80m catalogue price. Even if aircraft are rarely sold at the list price, such a discount — if true — would be steep, says one person with knowledge of the tender.But Delta’s order may not have been won entirely on price. The CSeries is acknowledged to be a highly efficient, unusually quiet aircraft, designed from scratch for the 100- to 150-seat segment.Moreover, Leeham believes Delta may also have won the right to provide lucrative maintenance services on the new geared-turbofan engine made by Pratt & Whitney for the CSeries. This could give Delta access to decades of lucrative servicing revenues on the fuel-efficient engine, not just for the CSeries but potentially other aircraft using the same turbine.While neither P&W nor Bombardier would confirm whether this was part of the deal, Mr Fehrm says it would not be unusual among those airlines with large jet-maintenance businesses providing services to third parties.Whatever the motives for the deal, Mr Bellemare’s job now is to make sure that the CSeries’ entry into service with Swiss goes smoothly, and that both the production ramp-up and customer deliveries face no hiccups. “We have a good plan, we are executing on that plan,” he says. “We want to stay focused.”Bombardier’s new CSeries aircraft has been called the “whisper jet”, thanks to its quiet flight. But John Leahy, the colourful head of sales at rival Airbus, has another name for the short haul jet. He calls it “that cute little plane”.Mr Leahy likes to goad his rivals, but his jibes have been getting more frequent now the CSeries is taking off with new orders, and the entry into service of the first aircraft is due next month.The CSeries is the first clean-sheet aircraft design in the 100- to 150-seat segment of the short-haul market for decades, and Bombardier claims the jet will be 20 per cent more fuel-efficient than others of its size.But the programme has had its fair share of delays.In 2014, a glitch was detected with the new-generation geared-turbofan engine supplied by Pratt & Whitney. A part of the engine oil system had to be redesigned, leading to a six-week halt in aircraft testing.But it is the software directing the hundreds of electronic systems fitted to the CSeries that has both been the making and near breaking of the programme.Analysts say the jet has one of the most sophisticated avionics systems in the air, with between 10m and 12m lines of code.Not only was the software regularly upgraded during the CSeries’ development, but each time this had to be integrated with every supplier and validated by aviation authorities.As the launch customer for the CSeries, buying the smaller version of the jet called the CS100, Swiss International Air Lines will take delivery of the seventh iteration of the aircraft, meaning that some 70m to 80m lines of code had to be accommodated and approved. The process took far longer than expected.Finally, Bombardier decided at the start of 2015 to extend flight testing by six months.“Getting it right was really critical for us,” says Rob Dewar, head of the CSeries programme at Bombardier.The world will soon forget about the two-year delay, he adds. “They will just measure it by how well it does in service.”

Recent terrorist attacks have also had a negative impact.Tony Tyler, Iata director-general, speaking at the industry’s annual meeting in Dublin, insisted the sector was performing strongly.Iata is now expecting airlines’ combined net profits to hit $39.4bn this year, an upward revision from its December forecast of $36.3bn, and resulting in a margin of 5.6 per cent.Moreover, for the second year in a row “and only the second time in the airline industry’s history, the return on invested capital at 9.8 per cent will exceed the cost of capital, estimated to be 6.8 per cent”, said Mr Tyler.Yet the industry’s boost from low oil prices was fizzling out, he warned. “We are probably nearing the peak of the positive stimulus from lower [oil] prices,” he said. Furthermore, global economic conditions were uncertain.Analysts have begun to flag concerns over how airlines are expanding their fleets at faster rates than growth in air travel in some regions of the world.Iata is forecasting a 7 per cent drop in air fares for this year. “I think we will look back at 2015 as the peak of the cycle,” said Chris Tarry, an aviation analyst.We are probably nearing the peak of the positive stimulus from lower [oil] pricesAirline executives insisted that a drop in yields — a measure of average fares paid — alongside increased capacity were not yet issues of concern for the industry, as long as margins continued to improve.“We are as fit as we have ever been,” said Jayne Hrdlicka, chief executive of Jetstar. “Capacity ahead of demand is not necessarily irrational. If that continues it could be considered irrational. But from where things stand now we are not quite there yet.”Ed Bastian, the new chief executive of Delta Air Lines, insisted there was no risk in expanding capacity despite the sluggish global economy. “We are absolutely not being complacent,” he said during an Iata debate.North American airlines are expected by Iata to be the biggest generators of the industry’s profits this year.In Europe the picture is more mixed, with airlines predicted to generate marginally higher profits in 2016 compared to last year. But while major carriers have seen solid improvements due to long-haul markets, small and medium-sized airlines continued to struggle.Asian airlines are also expected to return higher profits. But as carriers with a 40 per cent share of the global air cargo market, they were feeling the brunt of stagnation in the freight sector.
90;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-05-24T05:00:10Z;Bombardier jets operation charts a return to profitability;The aircraft maker looks set for recovery after winning new orders and investment;When Canada’s Bombardier issued first-quarter results on April 28, observers’ attention was focused mainly on good news for the commercial aircraft division.The company was able, after 18 months with no firm new orders for its C Series commercial jet, to announce that Delta Air Lines planned to buy at least 75 of the aircraft, intended to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 narrow-body jets. The order was widely seen as rescuing a programme that, as recently as last year, threatened the future of the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer by sales.Yet the first-quarter performance of Bombardier’s business aircraft division, until recently the world’s biggest supplier of business jets, underlined the price this part of the company has paid for Bombardier’s recent problems. Revenue for the quarter fell 15 per cent to $1.3bn, while earnings before interest and tax also fell 15 per cent to $82m.The falls reflected Bombardier’s decision last year to cut back on production of its top-of-the-range Global 5000 and 6000 business jets, which it had been producing unsustainably fast in an effort to earn cash. The cost and time overruns on the C Series consumed so many of the company’s available resources that it had to postpone by two years entry into service of its Global 7000 and 8000 long-range jets, to 2018 and 2019 respectively.The question for the company is whether Bombardier Business Aircraft can reclaim the powerful market position it has ceded during the past 18 months’ upheavals. Forecasts from the Virginia-based Teal Group project that aircraft delivered by Bombardier will account for only 28 per cent of the total value of business aircraft delivered this year, against 38 per cent for Gulfstream, once a smaller competitor.Alain Bellemare, the chief executive brought in last year to tackle the company’s corporate crisis, told investors after the results were published that the division was “taking a disciplined approach” and adapting to “challenging market conditions”.However, Richard Aboulafia, an analyst for Teal Group, says the C Series’ effect on Bombardier’s business aircraft operation has been “devastating”. He points particularly to the effect on the company of postponing work on the Global 7000 and 8000, which has left Gulfstream, part of General Dynamics, unchallenged as the leader in ultra-long-range aircraft.The extended range version of Gulfstream’s G650 can fly 7,500 nautical miles without refuelling. Such large aircraft have done disproportionately well since the last recession compared with smaller sizes. The Global 8000, when it eventually takes to the air, is due to have a 7,900 nautical mile range.“They gave Gulfstream a six-year lead in the ultra-large market, which was arguably the only growth part of the business in the last few years, because of the delays to the Global 7000 and 8000,” Mr Aboulafia says.They’re unlikely to get their number one position back — certainly not anytime soonThe core of the problem for Bombardier, according to one observer familiar with the company, is that the C Series’ problems have starved development projects across many parts of the company of resources they might otherwise have received. The company last year scrapped its only outstanding development of a smaller business jet — the Learjet 85 — although some observers believe the challenges of producing that innovative aircraft might have justified its cancellation anyway. “I think it’s good [Bombardier] killed it,” says the observer, who asked not to be named.Meanwhile, the sales performance of the Challenger 350 — which entered into service in 2014 — and many of the company’s other midsize aircraft has proved disappointing. Competitors such as Gulfstream’s new G500 have been taking market share. “They haven’t been winning their share of that market,” the observer says.Bombardier declined to comment.Yet the Delta C Series order is not the only reason to hope that Bombardier’s business aircraft division may be past the worst. A $1.3bn investment in the company’s trainmaking business, by a pension fund linked to the government of Bombardier’s native province of Québec, helped to keep net debt for the group steady at $6.35bn at the end of March compared with December.The company is also due to receive a $1bn investment from Québec’s provincial government in a joint venture to build the C Series. It is in negotiations about a potential investment from the Canadian federal government.Mr Bellemare told investors in April that the further investments would give the company “additional flexibility” and the ability to keep investing.He also predicted that, in cutting back production rates last year, the company had acted more promptly than other companies during difficult market conditions.“We were proactive. We took some tough actions last year, but they are starting to pay off this year,” said Mr Bellemare.Yet there is little doubt that events over the past few years — when Bombardier struggled to invest in new products — will have a lasting effect on the business. Mr Aboulafia reflects how the company once offered strong products across the whole size range, from its smaller Learjets up to the Global products — which were the first truly intercontinental business aircraft. “They’re unlikely to get their number one position back — certainly not anytime soon,” he says.

That competition could have resulted in less downward pressure on prices, it said.As a result, Cofece required Delta and Aeroméxico to hand over to competitors the number of slots at the airport equivalent to the ones used by Delta in 2015. The two airlines would not be allowed to hold overlapping routes.Aeroméxico said in a stock exchange filing that eight pairs of slots would have to be ceded.The two airlines are seeking a broad alliance which will go beyond their more than two decades old code-sharing agreement. Aeroméxico has said the tie-up will allow passengers to reserve, buy and fly interchangeably between both airlines.US anti-trust approval is still pending.

But unexpected consequences of the oil slump still lurk in the financial system.One area of the capital markets where this is apparent is secured lending to finance aircraft sales — which is fast growing but often ignored.When oil prices were high, they made older, less fuel-efficient aircraft more expensive to run and therefore encouraged airlines to upgrade their fleets. As a result, secured lending against new aircraft sales surged. Capital markets now fund almost 40 per cent of the $122bn aircraft finance market, according to Boeing, up from a negligible amount before the financial crisis.This has been a boon to aircraft leasing companies, which make money by buying planes and then leasing them to airlines to operate. They issued debt, which was snapped up by yield-hungry investors who offered these companies ever-cheaper borrowing terms over the past five years. This cheap financing for their product proved a similar boon to aircraft manufacturers: Boeing’s order backlog has almost doubled since 2011.Equity investors also started to get excited. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn declared that shares of AerCap, an aircraft leasing company, were a bargain at the 2015 Grant’s Investment Conference.However, the collapse in oil prices means the party may be coming to an end. Older, second-hand planes are now more cost effective to run, relative to newer more efficient aircraft — meaning demand for new stock should start to fall. Last year, Delta Air Lines said it was witnessing an “aircraft bubble”, noting that it had sourced a used 777 aircraft for just $7.7m in December, compared with a factory fresh price of more than $250m.All of this is cause for concern for holders of the leasing companies’ debt, and shares. While secured, the leasing debt is only as secure as the creditworthiness of the airlines that use the planes, and the second-hand value of those planes. Shares in emerging market airlines, the main buyers of new planes, have tanked over the past year. But leasing companies’s debt is still trading at par value. One aspect of this relationship will have to budge soon.miles.johnson@ft.com
93;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;United tumbles most since ’10 amid gloomy outlook;;Shares in United Continental tumbled after a disappointing sales outlook for the current quarter overshadowed stronger-than-expected quarterly profits.United’s shares dropped as much as 12.4 per cent in their biggest intraday decline in almost six years to $51.33, after the US carrier said its first-quarter net income fell to $313m in the first quarter from $508m in the same three-month period in 2015. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items, of $1.23 a share, beat Wall Street estimates of $1.18 a share. Revenues declined 4.8 per cent to $8.2bn, matching estimates.However, the Chicago-based group said that it expects its passenger revenue per available seat mile, a closely-watched sales metric in the airline industry, to fall between 6.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the current quarter, after a sharp fall in the first quarter.The guidance was “not good,” according to Joseph DeNardi, a Stifel analyst, who added that “we now have much less confidence assuming an improvement in [passenger revenue per available seat mile] through the year”.Thursday’s sell-off extended the drop in United shares over the past 12 months to 18.7 per cent. The shares of other airlines fell as well: Delta Air Lines dropped 3.5 per cent to $44.99, while American Airlines slipped 3.3 per cent to $39.90.
94;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-04-12T17:53:12Z;Corporate winners and losers amid the oil price crash;Airlines are beneficiaries of cheap fuel but consumer goods groups are not getting a big boost;Oil price crashes have profound consequences. The fall in crude after the 1997 Asian financial crisis ushered in today’s oil and gas supermajors after a flurry of megamergers that included BP’s tie-up with Amoco, Exxon with Mobil and Texaco with Chevron.The latest collapse in oil is having an enormous impact — even though the benchmark Brent price has rebounded in 2016, it is still about 60 per cent down since mid-2014.Oil and gas: Debt fears flare upRosneft runs to stand stillSaudi Arabia loses oil shareUS oil and gas sector reboots to surviveOil price: ‘Shot in the arm’ misses economic targetBut the consequences of this oil decline have not been the ones that history might suggest would occur, either within or outside the oil industry.Thousands of jobs have been axed as rigs have been idled and investment slashed across the sector.However, with the exception of Royal Dutch Shell’s acquisition of smaller rival BG Group, there has so far been nothing like the wave of large deals that followed the late 1990s oil downturn.That is because this downturn was preceded by a period of virtual “free money” following the 2008 financial crisis, says Tony Hayward, chairman of Glencore and former chief executive of BP.“Much of the industry was massively overleveraged in a way it wasn’t in 1998 and 1999,” he adds, and that is leading to bankruptcies in the US shale industry, and preventing consolidation.But what of the rest of the corporate world?Conventional wisdom says cheap fuel is good news for airlines, makers of gas-guzzling cars, and other companies able to produce or ship goods less expensively for shoppers with wallets fattened by lower pump prices.Conversely, a low oil price is supposed to be bad news for power generators using renewable energy and electric carmakers.But the reality has been more complicated in an oil price rout that has been deeper and longer than many experts predicted, and is happening in a world that has changed considerably since previous crashes.One of the biggest differences between the latest oil price downturn and past declines is the way consumers have responded to the extra cash in their pockets coming from cheaper fuel.Moody’s says lower oil prices will not translate into the expected strong spending on some consumer goods because many people are focused on saving.Expectations have failed to match reality in many parts of the power sector, too, thanks to the pronounced changes the industry has experienced since previous oil crashes.For one thing, the oil-fired power plants that generated as much as 18 per cent of global electricity in 1980 now produce about 5 per cent, so lower crude prices do not threaten wind farms and solar parks as much as might be imagined.The number of countries with renewable energy targets has soared from just 73 in 2010 to 164 in 2015, data from the International Renewable Energy Agency show.That is one reason the oil rout has failed to dent healthy annual growth in renewable power-generating capacity.Sales of fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles have jumped, but government incentives have to some degree protected the much smaller electric car industry.Monthly sales of electric cars and other vehicles in the US have fallen since the oil price started to decline in mid-2014, but they have risen in Europe, according to figures from Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm.For consumers, lower oil prices mean less expensive petrol, leaving more money in their pockets to spend on other items, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.This increase in disposable income is, in theory, good news for consumer goods companies — selling food, soap powder and toiletries — which also gain from lower fuel costs. But the reality is more nuanced.Consumers in oil-importing countries, such as India, benefit. But Sarah Solomon of Euromonitor International says those living in oil-exporting countries like Russia “are seeing their economies squeezed. Added to this, many emerging markets are experiencing currency weaknesses and this increases import costs, pushing up inflation, which can more than offset lower energy prices.”Unilever said in January that lower oil prices were helping its laundry business through reduced input costs, but hindering the sales growth of bulk tea, much of which is sold to Middle Eastern countries.Finally, as Ms Solomon points out, consumers do not necessarily spend the savings they make on lower energy bills. Globally, savings as a percentage of disposable income increased slightly in 2015.Moody’s said last month it now expects the effect of low oil prices on US packaged food companies, such as Kraft Heinz, to be “moderately positive” instead of “strongly positive”.Brian Weddington of Moody’s says: “Consumers have remained cautious spenders, which has resulted in heavy price competition . . . Thus, we expect that companies will reinvest much of the cost savings from cheaper fuel in promotions and marketing to at least maintain sales volumes.”Airline executives finally have a smile on their faces. After seeing fuel become their single biggest cost in the era of high oil prices, carriers are now celebrating the plunge, writes Tanya Powley.But while airlines are natural winners, how quickly they can reap the full benefits from cheap oil has varied significantly across the industry.This largely comes down to an airline’s hedging contracts. Fuel typically accounted for about one-third of carriers’ operating costs before the oil rout, and many airlines opt for the predictability that hedging oil purchases several months forward allows.US carriers, which are generally less reliant on fuel hedging, have enjoyed the biggest boost so far from cheap oil.Executives at American Airlines will be lauding their decision to abandon hedging in 2014, which has enabled it to enjoy lower fuel costs faster than many rivals. This contributed to record net profits for 2015.In January, Delta Air Lines said its fuel costs for last year were down 44 per cent compared with 2014.European airlines have had to be more patient. Both flag carriers and budget airlines on the continent tend to hedge 12 to 18 months out, so some have had to wait until this year to secure big benefits from cheap oil.“Most large European airlines are starting to see major benefits now,” says Oliver Sleath, analyst at Barclays. “They’re moving from paying an average effective rate of $90 to $100 a barrel in 2015 down to $60 to $70 a barrel in 2016.”The axing of investment projects by oil and gas producers has taken its toll on manufacturers that count energy companies among their most important customers, writes Michael Pooler.The energy sector accounted for one-third of corporate capital expenditure globally in 2014, but investment cuts will shrink that share to a quarter by 2017, according to Standard & Poor’s.In the US, the fortunes of the energy and manufacturing industries are particularly intertwined. This is highlighted by how the US manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, a measure of the sector’s health, started falling when the oil price began declining in mid-2014.“Oil has generally been a leading indicator for industrial confidence in the US,” says Matthew Spurr, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Once manufacturers realised we were in the lower-for-longer scenario, the PMIs started to reflect that.”Those affected include Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction machinery. Cheap commodities contributed to a 15 per cent fall in revenue in the company’s 2015 results, with the effect of lower crude prices hitting its unit that supports drilling and well servicing.The oil price collapse is also reverberating in South Korea, the world’s biggest shipbuilding nation. Its three giants of the industry — Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering — have recorded much reduced orders for energy platforms and drill vessels.Elsewhere, an expected lift for chemicals companies that make their products from oil derivatives has largely not materialised.This is partly due to reduced demand for chemicals in the energy industry, says Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein.Falling oil prices have led to a boom in sales of large, fuel-hungry cars, writes Peter Campbell.In the US, Europe and China, sales of sport utility vehicles and so-called “crossover” cars have outpaced traditional saloons.Large vehicles have higher margins for carmakers, and are also attractive for consumers because they offer better visibility and more storage space.SUVs became the best-selling type of car across Europe for the first time last year, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm, after sales rose 24 per cent to 3.2m units.SUVs accounted for 22.5 per cent of all cars sold in Europe, with demand rising in the 29 countries analysed by Jato. More than 1m crossover cars were sold last year.“Similar to the shift towards SUVs in the US car market, Europeans are clearly favouring these vehicles,” says Felipe Munoz, an analyst at Jato.“Both economic and social factors such as the lower fuel prices and the growing appeal of SUVs’ benefits had a big influence on this sales boom.”Between 2010 and 2014, unit sales of SUVs rose from 12 per cent of the Chinese market to 23 per cent.In the UK, several big manufacturers have seen demand for large cars rise in recent years.In February Jaguar Land Rover said the Range Rover Evoque, the luxury compact SUV built in Halewood, Mersyside, was the fastest-selling vehicle ever.Last month Nissan expanded production of its Qashqai crossover at the company’s Sunderland plant, after saying that annual output of 300,000 cars was not enough to meet rising demand.Tumbling oil prices have hurt the biofuels industry around the world, writes Pilita Clark.The sector’s fortunes depend heavily on government support for renewable fuels in most countries. But where crude prices go, biofuels generally follow, so the oil rout has had a negative impact on the industry.“It’s been significant,” says Claire Curry, analyst at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research group.In the US, the biggest biofuels producer, ethanol prices have fallen from nearly $3.50 a gallon since mid-2014, to less than $2 this year. Ethanol is usually blended with petrol for use in cars and other vehicles.The shares in some large US biofuels companies have followed a similar path to ethanol prices. For example, the stock of Green Plains of the US has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year.In Europe, Germany’s CropEnergies, one of the sector’s larger producers, suspended output at its Ensus refinery in the UK just over a year ago.That contributed to an 11 per cent decline in CropEnergies’ revenues during the first three-quarters of its 2015-16 financial year, but has helped ease concerns about too much capacity in the industry.The sector’s woes have also paved the way for some consolidation.For example, last year Pacific Ethanol of the US bought Aventine Renewable Energy, an Illinois-based ethanol producer.Global investment in biofuels had already dried up before oil prices began to fall, plunging from more than $25bn in 2007 to well below $5bn in 2014, as governments curtailed their support.This is the sixth part of a Financial Times series entitled ‘Oil: Lower for Longer’, looking at the consequences of the fall in crude prices.
95;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-04-03T16:30:55Z;Business is right to use its superpowers for social change;Big companies protect values by resisting attack on LGBT community in US, writes Margaret Heffernan;In the US state of Georgia, the Orwellian-sounding Free Exercise Protection Act has been vetoed by the governor, Nathan Deal. He was overriding his state legislature’s vote to allow faith-based organisations to refuse to serve or employ anyone who violated their religious beliefs. The bill’s implicit target was the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.Similar bills have been passed or are under consideration in a dozen states, as part of a backlash against last year’s US Supreme Court ruling in favour of nationwide marriage equality.Georgia’s bill sparked a broad coalition of resistance from some of the most powerful corporations in the US: Apple, Unilever, Delta Air Lines, Salesforce, Hilton, Walt Disney and Coca-Cola. The proposal represented an immediate threat to their diverse workforces: Disney’s forthcoming Marvel movies — Captain America: Civil War and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 — were made in the company’s Georgia studios. Coca-Cola is headquartered in Atlanta. Meanwhile, the National Football League warned Mr Deal that the legislation could rule out Atlanta’s bid to host a Super Bowl.You could argue that, by lining up in opposition to the bill, these organisations were simply protecting their businesses. In fact they were doing far more than that. They were saying that their cultural values outweighed those of the state in which they did business, and that their support for sexual diversity was more important than the feelings and attitudes of the democratically elected representatives of that state.It is more than a purely economic argument and reveals a clear social agenda. The tactic, however, is not new. In the 1930s, IBM started hiring female college graduates and Thomas Watson Senior, its chief executive, said they should be paid equally with men. He was decades ahead of the legal requirement to do so. In the 1950s, the company wrote an equal opportunity policy, in the 1960s a supplier diversity policy, in the 1980s a sexual orientation policy and in the 1990s it provided benefits for employees’ partners.While IBM set a high bar for other tech companies, many of which struggled to catch up, it was not the only organisation advancing social causes in advance of legislation. In 1992, Levi Strauss & Co was the first Fortune 500 company to provide health insurance to unmarried partners. Today this is standard in many large companies.More recently, Netflix began to offer unlimited paid maternity and paternity leave to its employees, something that is (currently) unheard of in the US.One could argue that these apparent trailblazers are economically self-interested — and they usually are. But their policies are value statements that shape public opinion and business norms. They give protection, even an incentive, to other companies who follow suit. In other words, these businesses set out to change society. And for those who believe that the business of business is just to make money, this is troubling. By what right do they wield such influence?Were these company innovations characterised by religious bigotry rather than social liberalism, we would expect to hear a lot about the abuse of corporate power. Some small businesses in Georgia may complain about overweening corporate influence. But the successful challenge to the state’s discriminatory legislation has been widely applauded in business circles, and corporations are now fighting a similar law in North Carolina.What makes this case a cause for celebration is that the companies’ stance is in line with public opinion and with federal law. In other words, demanding equality for a large and diverse community is not an idiosyncratic expression of corporate power, but a corporate defence of public consensus.In rejecting discrimination, the companies were not dominating society but serving it. And that is the business of business.The writer is author of ‘A Bigger Prize: How We Can Do Better Than the Competition’
96;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-03-22T20:28:03Z;Travel-related stocks shaken by Brussels attacks;US stocks lack direction but healthcare a standout performer;Travel-related stocks were shaken on Tuesday after a series of co-ordinated terror attacks in Brussels sparked concerns about demand ahead of the key summer season.At least 30 people were killed after two bombs went off in the city’s airport, and another one hit a metro station.The S&P 500 airlines index fell 2.5 per cent, before recovering to a decline of 1.3 per cent.Airline stocks frequently decline on the back of terrorist events amid worries that travellers will be rattled and choose to stay home instead of taking trips.American Airlines declined 1.6 per cent to $42.76, United Continental fell 1.1 per cent to $60.49 and Delta Air Lines declined 1.4 per cent to $49.41. All three large US carriers operate flights to Brussels, according to the airports’ websites.Elsewhere in the sector, Carnival, a cruise ship operator, fell 2.1 per cent to $48.75 and Priceline, a travel booking service, dropped 2.3 per cent to $1,319.41.Hotel stocks fell as well: Wyndham Worldwide declined 1.2 per cent to $76.15, while Hyatt Hotels fell 2.1 per cent to $48.80.Wynn Resorts, which runs casinos, bucked the trend after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.Wynn may go from a “double-digit ebitda decliner to double-digit grower in the next six months”, said Morgan analyst Thomas Allen, referring to a measure of profits called earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.He added that the brand might also benefit from a stabilisation in Macau, a Chinese territory known for gambling that has taken a powerful blow from the government’s corruption crackdown and a broader economic slowdown in the country.Wynn shares rose 2.4 per cent to $95, bringing their year-to-date rally to 37 per cent.Lumber Liquidators shares also climbed after the company said it reached a settlement with a California regulator relating to sales of certain laminate flooring. The review was completed with “no formal finding of violation or admission of wrongdoing”, the company said.As part of the agreement, however, it will pay the California Air Resources Board a fine of $2.5m and “implement a series of voluntary compliance procedures” to ensure its flooring products comply with the regulator’s standards.Investors appeared to be relieved with the news that the inquiry has ended. The shares jumped 16 per cent to $13.94 although they are still down 20 per cent for 2016.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,049.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened 0.2 per cent to 17,582.57 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 4,821.66.The S&P 500 healthcare sector was the standout performer on Tuesday, jumping 0.9 per cent. Within the group, biotechnology stocks posted particularly large price gains. Amgen rose 2.5 per cent to $150.62, adding to a 1 per cent gain on Monday as traders moved back into the sector that was shunned in the earlier part of the year.
97;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-03-20T12:06:07Z;Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic CEO, talks the long haul;The airline industry veteran now battling to maintain Virgin’s transatlantic ‘cool’;"The clock is ticking on one of the aviation industry’s most colourful wagers. In 2012, Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, bet Sir Richard Branson a “knee in the groin” that the Virgin Atlantic brand would disappear within five years, after US carrier Delta Air Lines bought a 49 per cent stake in the British carrier.But with just a year to go, it looks like Mr Walsh could be in for some pain.After three years of losses, Virgin Atlantic returned to profit in 2014, boosted by its transatlantic joint venture with Delta, which helped funnel more passengers on to its network. The British airline is expected to announce this week a further improvement in profits for 2015, helping Virgin Atlantic on its way to beat its record annual pre-tax profit of £99m by 2018.Craig Kreeger, the first American head of Virgin Atlantic, who was brought in three years ago to revive the flagging airline, dismisses any possibility that Sir Richard could lose the bet to his arch rival Mr Walsh.“The brand can’t go away,” he insists. “If Delta and Virgin Atlantic together can help fill more seats and get more customers to try Virgin Atlantic because that [Virgin] brand is positive that’s only going to make us more effective against British Airways and against every other competitor.”Wearing a blazer, with his top shirt button undone and no tie, Mr Kreeger looks every inch the relaxed Virgin Atlantic executive, reclining in a fashionable leather armchair.It is apt that he is delivering his fighting talk at Virgin Atlantic’s London office, which is known as the Battleship Building because of its resemblance to a warship. Virgin Atlantic was founded in 1984 by aviation upstart Sir Richard with a battle in mind: taking on the might of BA on transatlantic flights.The once trailblazing airline quickly became known for its customer service and pioneering product innovation, which saw it become the first to bring in televisions at every seat and the launch of its upper class suite, which offered the longest flat bed in business class and onboard bar.But over the past decade, the constant competition began to take its toll. In the five years to the end of 2013, the group racked up total pre-tax losses of more than £300m. High fuel prices and a struggling UK economy played a big role. But Virgin’s poor performance was accentuated after BA’s deal in 2011 for a joint venture with American Airlines: the British flag carrier became an even tougher competitor on lucrative transatlantic routes.Born

Golf, music, crossword puzzlesMr Kreeger, who grew up in Sacramento, California, knows all about the potency of BA’s transatlantic partnership. Before he joined Virgin, he spent 27 years at American Airlines, including running its international operations. This made him the perfect choice to help Virgin Atlantic’s joint venture with Delta get off the ground.“I get more credit than I deserve for the progress we’ve made,” admits Mr Kreeger. “My assessment coming in was that I was entering at the bottom, and many of the things that were going to help the company be more successful in the future were decisions that had already been made.”This included the purchase of 17 Boeing 787 Dreamliners to replace its old and more costly A340 planes, and the 2012 joint venture with Delta.Over the past three years, Mr Kreeger has pushed ahead with cutting costs, including restructuring his management team and closing a number of the airline’s international routes to refocus on its core strength, the transatlantic market.Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic’s 2016 profits will be helped by the low oil price. That factor has already boosted profits at some of Europe’s struggling flag carriers, for instance at Air France-KLM last year.“[The low oil price] hasn’t fundamentally changed our targets. I do think it al­lows us to feel pretty comfortable about 2016 continuing on track. We think we have an awful lot of momentum,” says Mr Kreeger.But not everything has gone smooth­ly. In 2014, Mr Kreeger announced the closure of Little Red, the group’s UK short-haul service, only 18 months after it was launched because it failed to gain enough traffic to compete successfully.The grounding of this domestic business, alongside retrenchment from international routesincluding Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town, has left some in the industry fearing that Virgin Atlantic has lost its pioneering edge and become boring.“In the past, the Virgin Atlantic brand was about being a challenger and a leader in the industry where it could be,” says a former executive. “It never was boring. That’s their issue now — if you are a more boring airline you don’t stand out.”While not as flamboyant or prone to publicity stunts as Sir Richard, Mr Kreeger is adamant that Virgin Atlantic has not lost its magic. “I joined this company because the experiences I had competing with it and flying on it as a customer were so cool and so fun, that the last thing I would want to do is focus on anything that would prevent that from still being the case,” he says.Some of this may be out of his hands, however. With Delta owning a 49 per cent stake in the carrier, there has been an obvious shift from showmanship to a focus on financial discipline under Mr Kreeger’s reign.He denies the suggestion that Virgin Atlantic is being run from the US.“Yes, we took planes out of four other long-haul markets and ended up moving them into the US market, taking the transatlantic portion of our network to about 70 per cent. But coincidentally, that’s exactly the same percentage that the airline had in 1999 and 2000, its last really successful years. So we have returned Virgin Atlantic back to the mixture that it was most successful with,” says Mr Kreeger.He acknowledges that Virgin Atlantic will no longer have “unlimited funds” to spend on new products, which will make it harder to compete against the deep pockets of the Gulf carriers that have been leading the way with business class innovation in recent years. However, despite this, he insists Virgin Atlantic can retain its “challenger brand status”.Looking forward, there are further battles on the horizon. And this time not just with BA. The rise of Norwegian Air Shuttle and its aggressive plans to ex­pand its low-cost transatlantic business means Virgin Atlantic and Delta are considering ways to respond. Mr Kreeger says this could see the airline use different planes or a different mix of seats on its planes to compete better, but it has no plans to launch its own low-cost subsidiary. “We haven’t really seen a big impact yet in demand for our product as a result of their presence . . . but knowing that they are planning on growing, we are trying to model . . . five or 10 years from now,” he says.Mr Kreeger clearly wants to be around for the fight. He has just committed to staying in the UK by buying a home in Battersea, south London, after years of renting.Just like Virgin Atlantic, he is keen to get on with “fixing it up”."
98;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2016-02-26T23:44:14Z;Transport delivers hope for equities rebound;Dow barometer records sixth consecutive weekly gain;One of Wall Street’s leading barometers of the US economy suggests a gloomy outlook may be misplaced, bolstering expectations of a stronger rebound for the broad equity market.The Dow Jones Transportation Average achieved its sixth consecutive weekly gain on Friday, repairing a bruising start to the year when the barometer fell some 12 per cent by mid-January.The rebound for the closely watched average, which includes 20 companies such as UPS, railroad Norfolk Southern and Delta Air Lines, is seen as a sign that the broader US equity market can gain further momentum in the coming weeks. Dow Transports have trimmed their loss for the year down to around 1 per cent, leading a recovery being seen in broader measures such as the S&P 500.“We feel as if technically the transportation average appears to have put in a strong bounce and could lead the market up as it did on the way down,” said John Brady, of RJ O’Brien and Associates. “It at least bears watching.”Global stocks were hit hard early in 2016 on concerns about the global economic outlook led by uncertainty over the extent of the slowdown in China. But as March approaches — ahead of crucial central bank meetings in the US and Europe — key market sectors have bounced off their lows recorded earlier this month, fanning hope of a turning point.In the wake of plumbing two-and-a-half-year lows on February 11, global stocks as measured by the FTSE All World index are up 6 per cent, while the S&P 500 is nearly 7 per cent higher.Some, however, are reluctant to call an inflection in market sentiment just yet.“We have had a nice rebound in the industrials, but I think the jury is still out,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments.This week, implied volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix has traded around a reading of 20, its long-term average, with this closely watched barometer of investor fear well below this month’s peak of 31.“After periods of volatility like we just had, it doesn’t just go away,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “We have to let the volatility play out through the system and that may take us to the beginning of the summer.”He said the financial sector also will be crucial to a market rebound after having fallen sharply this year as expectations for rate hikes diminished with the market turmoil and fears about the European banking sector flared.With a 10.9 per cent drop, financials are the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year.

The charge — $577m on a post-tax basis — pushed Goodyear into a $380m net loss for the quarter, against net income of $2.13bn for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales fell 6.7 per cent to $4.06bn.The crisis in Venezuela looks set to push the country into a default on its debt payments, amid a dire recession and galloping inflation. After years of mismanagement, the country’s economy has also been one of the worst hit worldwide by the fall in the price of oil, which accounts for some 95 per cent of the country’s trade revenue.Tight currency controls imposed by the socialist government have created an acute shortage of dollars for companies seeking to do business with the country. Amid a byzantine foreign exchange system, which fuels distortions, the black market rate now trades at about 160 times the main government set exchange rate of 6.3 bolívares per dollar. The country has four exchange rates: three official ones and the black market one, which on Tuesday was trading at some 1016 per greenback.Conditions in the country have hit US airlines particularly hard, since they have been unable to repatriate from Venezuela revenue earned there. American Airlines — the most dependent of the US’s big three legacy airlines on Latin America — reported a $592m write-off for the fourth quarter for the value of its holdings of bolívares. Delta Air Lines took a $75m fourth-quarter write-off for its bolívar holdings, while United Air Lines announced a $61m write-off over Venezuela alongside its third-quarter results in October.The conditions have also hit other companies in the automotive industry, besides Goodyear.

Glen Hauenstein, executive vice-president, will replace Mr Bastian as president.The reshuffle comes as Delta and the other US legacy airlines — American Airlines and United Continental — enjoy a period of robust profitability, buoyed by declining competition, low fuel prices and the US’s reviving economy.Dan Carp, the company’s current non-executive chairman, said the planned succession had been “several years in the making” and would keep Delta “on top of the global industry”.Mr Anderson’s appointment as executive chairman means that Mr Carp will stand down as chairman and become a non-executive member of the board of directors.“Under Richard’s leadership, Delta has become the most profitable and best run airline that consistently delivers excellent customer service,” Mr Carp said.Under Mr Anderson, who became chief executive in 2007, Delta has pursued a distinctive policy of retaining older, less efficient aircraft at a time when its rivals have invested more heavily in new fleets. The policy has benefited Delta since the fall in fuel prices, when the cost disadvantage of operating its older aircraft has been eroded.Mr Anderson’s departure will also remove from front line leadership one of the most vocal industry figures in the campaign to restrict the rights of the big Gulf airlines — Emirates, Qatar and Etihad — to fly to the United States.The legacy airlines last year launched a campaign, called the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies, claiming that $40bn hidden subsidies paid to the Gulf airlines put US carriers at a competitive disadvantage on long-distance routes.The Gulf airlines have denied they receive unfair subsidies and pointed to aid given to US airlines after the September 11, 2001 attacks as signs that US airlines also receive government aid.Mr Anderson’s role in the campaign received particular attention after remarks he made in a television interview last February appeared to link the Gulf airlines’ home nations to the September 11 attacks.“It’s a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates, from the Arabian Peninsula, talk about that,” he said, when asked on CNN about Emirates’ reference to the aid US airlines received after September 11. “Our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/11, which came from terrorists from the Arabian peninsula.”Emirates subsequently said Mr Anderson’s remarks called into question his fitness for his position.Delta’s shares were down 0.4 per cent in after-market trading, at $43.61, following the announcement. They had risen 0.4 per cent in normal trading.

He also merged Delta with Northwest Airlines, where he had previously served as CEO, helping Delta expand its global footprint.Dan Carp, chairman of the Board said:Under Richard’s leadership, Delta has become the most profitable and best run airline that consistently delivers excellent customer service.Ed Bastian, president of Delta, has been tapped to succeed Mr Anderson as CEO and the company said that “the succession plan has been several years in the making”. Mr Anderson will then become executive chairman.Upon Mr Anderson’s appointment, Frank Blake a director at the company will be appointed lead director of the board. Meanwhile, Mr Carp will step down as non-executive chairman but remain on the board.Shares in Delta, which have gained 92 per cent since Mr Anderson took the helm in 2007, were little changed in extended trading.

Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen, said while she thinks there could be slower bookings “during a time of heightened media coverage and general fear”, she views the drop in airline shares as a “buying opportunity”.“We do not view this virus on the same level as the Ebola outbreak in late 2014 or SARS in 2003,” she noted.Click here to read more on the Zika virus.
103;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US airlines: fuel to the fire;Carriers make the right noises but concerns about global economic growth mount;Airline investors are a tough bunch to please. Their cynicism is justified, given the industry’s boom/bust/bust again cycle. Yet, despite the perverse collective horror at the diving oil price (something we all buy is cheaper!) one might have hoped that US airline stocks would benefit. They have not. Shares in big US carriers, Delta, United Continental, and American, are down between 8 and 21 per cent this year.The magnitude of the fall in fuel expense is extraordinary. Delta reported this week that 2015 fuel costs were down 44 per cent. At UAL they were down 36 per cent. The drops are so precipitous that wages have replaced kerosene as the biggest single cost line. The figures could have even been better were it not for legacy hedging programmes that will mostly wind down in 2016.The figure that is causing investor agitation relates to revenue, not expenses. RASM — revenue per available seat mile, a measure of efficiency — is the obsession. Across the industry, RASM drifted lower by a few percentage points over the past year. Fuel surcharges on international flights have slowly disappeared because of the decline in oil prices. The strong dollar has also clipped reported revenue.The ultimate worry is about airlines’ original sin: growing capacity unprofitably in order to grab market share. Management teams are struggling in vain to shift investors’ attention to indicators such as operating margins (about 15 per cent) or cash flow (the billions in free cash flow airlines are generating is mostly being returned, in dividends and buybacks).Airlines are making the right noises about halting capacity growth in 2016. But just as efficiency is about to bounce back, concerns about global economic growth are beginning to mount. UAL has already said reduced business from energy companies will contribute to a 1 point decline in 2016 RASM. Prosperity is not only a burden, but a fleeting one.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Founder Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group retains the rest.Shai Weiss, chief financial officer, said strengthening the company’s financial position was a critical part of its turnround plan. It also represents the first time that Virgin Atlantic has accessed the capital markets.“We’re strengthening our position so that we can invest more into our customer proposition,” he said. “We’ve now unleashed the value of these landing and airport slots which we couldn’t realise the value before.”The group racked up total pre-tax losses of more than £300m in the five years to the end of 2013, but has pledged by 2018 to beat its record pre-tax profit of £99m recorded in 1999.European airlines have long looked at how to use airport access to secure debt. While US airlines have used airport gates as debt collateral for some time, it is a novel practice in Europe, where access is allocated by time slots rather than physical infrastructure.IAG, parent of British Airways, pulled a similar deal to raise at least £250m three years ago because of its complexity.Mr Weiss said the deal was made possible by the creation of an airline company — Virgin Atlantic International — which will be on standby to take over the slots if the main airline goes bust. The new carrier will be used to fly two aircraft between London Gatwick and Caribbean destinations, including Barbados and Saint Lucia.The parent company, which is the third-largest slot holder at Heathrow, retains the legal title to the slots. In the event of a default it could sell them to repay investors, reducing the risk that they would not get their money back.Mr Weiss said Virgin Atlantic has spent the past year working on the transaction. “We had to find the right structure that achieves the purpose for both lenders and Virgin Atlantic,” he said.The deal was privately rated by Moody’s. Virgin Atlantic said it was not able to reveal the interest rate that it paid but said that it was “very attractive” at a 10-15 year maturity. Investors included Standard Life Investments and Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management.Secondary trading of slots at Heathrow has been a reality for some time but the European Commission formally sanctioned the practice in 2012, opening the door for European airlines to diversify their debt funding in this manner.In the US ordinary unsecured corporate debt trades at a significant discount to bonds which are secured against gates and aircraft.

That compared with an increase of 2.6 per cent in the third quarter.The impact on sales prompted the Colorado-based company to rescind its full-year comparable sales outlook.Meanwhile, forecasts for earnings in a range of $2.45 to $2.85 a share were shy of analysts’ estimates of $4.06 a share.Sales trends have been “extremely volatile”, Chipotle said, pointing to sharp fluctuations as US regulators have issued updates on the outbreak of the potentially serious bacterial infection that affects the digestive system.Chipotle announced the closure of 43 restaurants on November 3, which caused a 20 per cent drop in comparable-store sales.The sales gradually improved after that point but when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced further cases of E.coli in three additional states, comparable sales fell about 22 per cent.It also said it expects to incur expenses of $6m to $8m in the current quarter for the cost of replacing food, lab analysis of food samples and other items related to the outbreak.Chipotle’s pain was compounded by downgrades from Cowen and Guggenheim on Monday.Analysts at Cowen cut the stock to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered the price target nearly 34 per cent to $515.Chipotle shares, which have declined more than 20 per cent this year, pared losses to trade 1.68 per cent lower at $551.75 by the close of trading in New York.Keurig Green Mountain shares jumped 71.93 per cent to $88.89 on news that the maker of K-Cup single serve coffee pods was being taken private by an investor group led by JAB Holding for $13.9bn.Shares in airline stocks advanced for a second straight day as crude continued its slide following Friday’s Opec meeting when the cartel outlined neither a deal on production cuts nor output targets.Fuel is the biggest expense for airlines making them sensitive to moves in oil prices, and Monday’s sell-off helped send the NYSE Arca airline index, which includes global airline stocks, 0.51 per cent higher.Shares in Delta Air Lines advanced 4.02 per cent to $51.78; JetBlue shares jumped 3.96 per cent to $26.49; shares in American Airlines rose 1.80 per cent to $45.78; and shares in United Continental were up 2.68 per cent to $60.52.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.70 per cent to 2,077.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.66 per cent to 17,730.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.79 per cent to 5,101.81.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"

Investigators are probing claims that Mr Samson — who has denied any wrongdoing — arranged favours for United in return, including reduced landing charges at Newark and assistance with improving access to the airport.In the competition case, the justice department claims United has built a monopoly at Newark — one of three big New York area airports operated by the port authority, alongside JFK and LaGuardia.The slots that United intends to purchase from Delta Air Lines would add to the 902 — 73 per cent of the total — that it already controls at Newark.A complaint filed by the justice department seeking to block the slots purchase said that, with each additional slot it acquired, United “reduces competition and forecloses entry or expansion of a rival that would otherwise use the slot to compete”.“In short, permitting United to acquire more slots would further entrench United’s dominance at Newark and foreclose competition that is already in critically short supply,” says the complaint. “As a result, passengers at Newark would face even higher fares and fewer choices.”The justice department’s action is the latest sign of the antitrust regulator’s concern about the competitiveness of the US airline industry. It announced in July that it was investigating whether airlines were colluding to restrict capacity increases and maintain high fares amid the past year’s sharp fall in fuel prices.The industry has consolidated rapidly in recent years, leaving only three big legacy carriers — American Airlines, United and Delta. The mergers have helped to make North America much the most profitable big airline market in the world.United rejected the justice department’s claims, saying that, with three large airports, the New York — Newark area was the “most competitive air transportation market in the country”.“We firmly believe this transaction benefits our customers and the region by enabling us to enhance service at our Newark hub and manage congestion at the airport,” it said.Mr Smisek’s successor, Oscar Munoz, suffered a heart attack in October and is not expected to return to work until the first quarter of next year.United’s shares were up flat at $60.15 in New York on Tuesday afternoon.
109;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-10-15T17:38:00Z;Drone completes first UK flight alongside commercial aircraft;Remotely piloted Watchkeeper flies for an hour alongside commercial aircraft;Drones could soon be flying alongside commercial aircraft in the skies above Britain after UK civil air traffic controllers managed their first unmanned flight in controlled airspace.The large Watchkeeper remotely piloted military aircraft — recently used in Afghanistan for surveillance operations — flew for an hour in the same airspace as jets from United Airlines, British Airways and Delta Air Lines on September 30.The commercial jets flew significantly higher than Watchkeeper, which cruised at 15,000 feet against the commercial airliners’ 35,000 feet. However, other smaller aircraft from Stobart Air and VLM were just 2,000-3,000 feet higher.The trial marks a milestone in the drive to open the skies to unmanned aircraft. Online companies such as Amazon are pushing regulators to open up airspace for drone test flights as they explore new lower cost ways to deliver the billions of parcels that leave their depots every year.Nats, which operates the UK’s main air traffic control centre at Swanwick, said it believed the unmanned test flight — code named Cronus — was the first in the world to take place in civil controlled airspace during peak commercial flight times. The aircraft took off at 10am from West Wales airport and entered commercial airspace over the Irish Sea.Ramón Raposo and Mark Watson, who have managed the project for Nats, said the test flight of the Watchkeeper, which has a wingspan of 10.5m, had demonstrated the potential for controllers to handle larger unmanned aircraft such as cargo jets in controlled airspace. “This is more equivalent to commercial aircraft and is another step towards integration,” Mr Raposo said.“It performs very much like the other air transport we handle,” said Mr Watson.The UK has set a target for full integration of unmanned aircraft into controlled airspace by 2020, and identified the commercial use of drones for parcel delivery and infrastructure management as a key policy goal.However, there had been concerns that the UK’s ambitions to develop a lead in commercial drone use would suffer after the government this summer pulled funding for an industry-led initiative known as Astrea to develop technology and procedures to enable drone flights in all classes of airspace.This includes the development of detect-and-avoid technology, which would allow unmanned aircraft to sense and fly away from other aircraft. The Watchkeeper aircraft, made by French defence electronic company Thales, had not been equipped with such technology.Mr Watson said that until such technology was proved and certified, remotely piloted aircraft could not be used in civil airspace even if controllers were confident they could handle the traffic.“Industry has not yet agreed on what the right technology for that is,” he said. However, a number of companies were testing suitable technology, including Thales, he said, which would soon be available for integration.Most developed countries are seeking to develop a regulatory framework for the routine use of drones. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, the global body that establishes safety standards for the industry, has set three milestones on the path to developing a worldwide framework for the safe flying of unmanned aircraft in ordinary airspace.By 2018, drones should be accommodated under certain conditions. By 2023 there will be partial integration, allowing some types of drones to fly over populated areas. By 2028, all restrictions should be lifted, and drones will fly side-by-side with manned aircraft.

The index was down 1.2 per cent.Official US government figures showed that a gauge of retail sales, excluding food and energy, had unexpectedly fallen last month, even with the tailwind of lower petrol prices, a steady job market and house prices that are still rising.The report “suggests that US consumers are beginning to tighten their purse strings”, said Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities. “This will be a particular concern for the Federal Reserve as this segment of the economy remains the key source of support for the economic recovery.”Anxiety swirling around the retail sector deepened after Walmart, the largest US retailer, forecast sluggish sales growth and warned that profits would be depressed by hefty investments in its online business.Walmart shares shed 10 per cent at $60.03 while losses deepened for its rivals. Target slid 3.5 per cent to $76.19 and Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, fell 6 per cent to $34.83.The S&P 500 Food & Staples Retailing index was the worst performing on the benchmark, sliding 3.7 per cent.Away from the discomfort for the retail sector, it was a weaker day for the US stock market. The S&P 500, whose rally has trimmed its loss for the year to 3 per cent, was 0.5 per cent weaker by markets close at 1,994.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, home to 30 of the best-known US companies, was 0.9 per cent lower at 16,924.75. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite performed slightly better, escaping with a drop of 0.3 per cent to 4,782.85.While red was the dominant colour on the S&P 500, with 340 stocks lower in by close, there was better news for some companies. Shares of TripAdvisor, a travel site that gathers reviews on hotels and allows consumers to book hotels, surged 25.5 per cent to $83.72 after it struck a deal to incorporate Priceline’s hotel offerings into its website.The news cheered investors of TripAdvisor, which had dropped 11 per cent this week, but proved painful for a rival travel portal. Expedia shares tumbled 4.9 per cent to $121.85, making it one of the 10 biggest losers on the S&P 500.Sticking with the business of travel, shares of Delta Air Lines climbed 1.8 per cent to $48.59 after the carrier said third-quarter profit had almost quadrupled to $1.31bn. Delta is benefiting from the weaker oil price, like other airlines, but also from its decision to buy an oil refinery a couple of years ago.Yesterday’s rise was not enough to leave Delta’s shares in the black for the year. They are down 1.2 per cent after surging 79 per cent last year and 131 per cent in 2013.richard.blackden@ft.comTwitter: @richardblackden

The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company is conducting a large, late-stage trial for Anacetrapib, a drug that uses a similar mechanism to Evacetrapib. Analysts are expecting sales of $567.2m for the Merck drug in 2019, and $858.6m the following year, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Jeffrey Loo, equity healthcare research analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the news from Lilly “raises more uncertainty” about Merck’s drug, but “doesn’t necessarily mean [it] won’t be efficacious”.Eli Lilly shares shed 8 per cent at $79.45 by the close of trading.On the other side of the spectrum, companies that were recently approved for new cholesterol drugs climbed on the day. Amgen, which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug called Repatha in August, climbed 2 per cent to $153.03. Meanwhile, Regeneron, which in partnership with Sanofi scored a green light from the FDA for Praluent in July, rallied 4.6 per cent to $526.83.Mr Loo said both of those drugs are aimed at lowering “bad” cholesterol among people who do not respond well to so-called statins, such as Lipitor.Elsewhere, Phillips 66 said its board approved an increase in its stock buyback of $2bn, bringing the total authorisation to $9bn. The Houston-based oil refiner also unveiled a $3.6bn capital budget for next year, excluding its Philips 66 Partners’ capital programme.Of those capital expenditures, $2bn will go to the midstream business, which includes the continued construction of a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the Gulf Coast. It is also investing in pipeline projects to move crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken region to market centres across the US.Meanwhile, $1.2bn will be invested in the company’s refining business, with 70 per cent of that sum heading to safety and environmental initiatives.By close, the shares were up 0.4 per cent to $83.87.The US energy sector as a whole dropped after its best week of 2015 amid a decline in the price of crude oil.

Four additional co-conspirators also lived in Georgia, New York and Pennsylvania. Five of the suspects who live in the US were arrested.The suspects were charged in federal courts in New York and Newark, New Jersey. The indictments were announced at a press conference late Tuesday morning by Paul Fishman, US attorney for New Jersey, Kelly Currie, acting US attorney in Brooklyn, homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson, secret service director Joseph Clancy, Securities and Exchange Commission chief Mary Jo White and others.A parallel civil complaint by the SEC is aimed at a wider ring of suspects, naming 32 people and companies who live in or are based in Russia, Malta, France and Cyprus. The SEC, which has a lower legal bar to meet in civil charges, alleges the suspects reaped $100m in profits.“This international scheme is unprecedented in terms of the scope of the hacking, the number of traders, the number of securities traded and profits generated,” Ms White said. “That deception ends today as we have exposed their fraudulent scheme and frozen their assets.”The stolen press release data covered earnings and mergers involving companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Netflix, Delta Air Lines, Boeing, Bank of America, Ford Motor, Honeywell and Viacom, according to one of the indictments.Devastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. The FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to fight back against the hackersThe suspects allegedly traded ahead of the releases in 800 instances. The transactions were executed through the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Knight Capital or Direct Edge, according to the indictment.For about five years starting around February 2010, the suspects hacked into the networks of Marketwired, PR Newswire and Business Wire to steal confidential press releases before they were made public, according to one of the indictments.Mr Currie said the scheme was an “unholy alliance” between hackers and traders, while Mr Fishman claimed it was a “full service” business with the hackers providing tutorials and the traders giving shopping lists.“The hackers were relentless and they were patient,” Mr Fishman said.In one example, Caterpillar was set to announce its third-quarter earnings on October 24 2011 and sent its release to PR Newswire three days before that date. By accessing the release before it was made public, the suspects made a profit of about $648,000.In another example, the suspects made $1m by stealing information from Panera Bread’s press release that said it was downgrading its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. The press release was sent to Marketwired on October 22 2013 and made public a day later.The suspected hackers are Ivan Turchynov and Oleksander Ieremenko, who both lived in Ukraine. Arkadiy Dubovoy, his son Igor Dubovoy, and relative Pavel Dubovoy allegedly engaged in securities trading and live in Georgia and Ukraine, respectively.Their alleged co-conspirators, some of whom were broker-dealers registered with the SEC, are Vitaly Korchevsky, Vladislav Khalupsky, Aleksandr Garkusha and Leonid Momotok.It was not clear if the suspects have legal representation and they could not be reached for comment.The trader defendants are accused of paying the alleged hackers for access to the press release servers, and their fee was based partly on a percentage of the profits in the insider-trading scheme.A foreign bank account of Tanigold Assets Ltd, an overseas entity connected to Pavel Dubovoy, was used to send some of the proceeds from the insider trading to the alleged hackers, the indictment said. Two overseas shell companies were also used by the alleged hackers to receive additional profits.The hackers allegedly used a variety of techniques, including injecting malware, launching spear phishing attacks that involve fake emails, decrypting data in “brute force attacks” and other methods.

In mid-July, Delta announced it would take part in a rival proposal made by Intrepid Aviation, the US aircraft leasing company that is Skymark’s biggest creditor.By number of creditors, 78 per cent of those who voted supported ANA’s plan.“We think this is evidence of the creditors’ confidence in both the feasibility and speed of Skymark’s rehabilitation plan, of which ANA is a sponsor,” ANA said in a statement.Creditors had appeared divided between the two offers until the final days, but people familiar with the matter said that Airbus, Skymark’s second-biggest creditor, ultimately swung the vote by deciding to side with ANA.Airbus said it looked forward to “Skymark’s swift and stable rehabilitation”.Founded in 1998, Skymark was the first major budget airline to challenge the domestic duopoly held by Japan Airlines and ANA. Its fortunes took a turn for the worse after expensive purchases including six Airbus A380 superjumbos in 2011, which drowned the group in losses as a steep slide in the Japanese yen pushed up its US dollar-denominated costs.Had Delta won the sponsor role it would have gained access to 36 landing slots that Skymark holds at Tokyo’s Haneda airport — the only slots belonging to a budget carrier not linked to the country’s two big airlines.“While Delta will not be able to support Skymark as a sponsor airline, we wish for Skymark’s recovery as one of the three largest Japanese airlines,” said Masaru Morimoto, Delta’s managing director in Japan. “Delta continues to focus on the Japan market by improving the customer experience and enhancing our network offering.”
114;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-07-28T16:11:17Z;China: unintended consequences;Shares have fallen again. They were not supposed to;"This was not supposed to happen. Everything was supposed to be calmer by now. After a hairy week or two earlier this month, the Chinese government’s efforts to settle the country’s stock markets were intended to produce a more serene environment. But on Monday China’s indices had one of their biggest ever one-day falls. On Tuesday they struggled to stay flat after opening sharply down again.That is not for want of trying on the part of the Chinese authorities. They have deployed well-tested measures, as well as some made in China. Selling pressure, and supply, have been stemmed by bans on sales by large shareholders, cancellation of initial public offerings and suspension of shares from trading. Buying has been augmented by government funds. To ensure a healthier market, margin financing has been reined in. None of this has worked. Investors are clearly still twitchy despite China’s protestations that it will stand behind markets.They may have good reason. Even after all the recent share price falls, Shanghai and Shenzhen have returned 71 and 86 per cent over 12 months, respectively, leaving ample room for profit-taking. The Shanghai Composite index trades at 19 times historical earnings, which is not cheap enough to attract bargain hunters.And China’s economic slowdown is real. This week, the Caixin purchasing managers’ index hit a 15-month low — although, given the index’s bias towards traditional manufacturing industries, it may omit much of the modern economy. Still, multinational companies are feeling the impact: from the UK’s Burberry to United Technologies of the US, recent results have been dragged down by China.Yet despite the near-term concerns, China’s appeal to corporate investors does not seem to have dimmed. This week, General Motors said it would spearhead its strategy into emerging markets with Chinese partner SAIC; and Delta Air Lines said it would buy 4 per cent of China Eastern Airlines. The stock markets may be subject to the volatility that comes with youth but longer-term potential for growth remains intact."

But the low-cost carrier was forced to file for bankruptcy in January this year, saddled with more than $600m of debt after an aggressive expansion push.Its fortunes took a turn for the worse after expensive purchases including six Airbus A380 superjumbos in 2011, which drowned the group in losses as a steep slide in the Japanese yen pushed up its US dollar-denominated costs.If Delta wins the sponsor role, it would gain access to 36 landing slots that Skymark holds at Tokyo’s Haneda airport — the only slots belonging to a budget carrier not linked to the country’s two big airlines.That would allow the US carrier, which does not have an alliance partner in Japan, to offer flights connecting international travellers to cities across the country at a time when Japan is enjoying a strong boom in tourism on the back of a weaker yen.Foreign visitor numbers are expected to continue to rise with Tokyo hosting the Summer Olympics in 2020.36Number of lucrative Haneda airport landing slots Skymark holdsStill, the timing of the decision to invest in Skymark is awkward, with Delta recently having decided to suspend service between Seattle and Haneda. The carrier, which has more flights connecting with Narita airport near Tokyo, only has one remaining route from Haneda, to Los Angeles.Skymark’s landing slots are for domestic routes only and airline regulators say they cannot be transferred to international routes, which would provide more opportunities for Delta.For now, Delta officials admit immediate benefits for users will be limited since Delta’s flights are concentrated in Narita while Skymark’s landing slots are at Haneda. But Mr Morimoto said Delta is seeking longer-term benefits in supporting the carrier.Under the alternative plan proposed by ANA in April, the Japanese carrier would buy a stake of up to 19.9 per cent in Skymark while Integral, a Japanese private equity fund, would take 50.1 per cent.ANA said on Wednesday that it believed it was best-positioned to help Skymark considering its know-how and experience in supporting other domestic airlines.

117;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-07-12T18:09:47Z;The not so friendly skies of America;The clout of the big carriers in Washington outweighs the woes of millions of frustrated flyers;There are few things more American than Gershwin piping through the speakers as you taxi down the runway. Yet for the second time in two months, United Airlines was forced to ground all flights last week because of a computer glitch. Whether it is shrinking legroom, rising fares or cancelled flights, the home of aviation is now synonymous with bad service. Gulf carriers are wiping the floor with their US competitors. Asian airlines are in a different league. While US skies remain closed to others, that gap will only widen. Global aviation’s centre of gravity is shifting eastward with Washington’s passive collusion.The continued decline of US airlines is no mystery. Wherever competition is restricted, the US economy does badly — and vice versa. With four big carriers carving out 80 per cent of domestic travel between them, service is substandard. The same applies to the US cable internet industry, which is dominated by a clutch of behemoths. US internet quality is as sluggish relative to Singapore, for example, as the experience of boarding a flight at John F Kennedy airport versus Changi. In the Skytrax global airline rankings voted for by customers, Delta Air Lines is America’s highest at 45. The leagues are dominated by Asia, the Middle East and one or two from Europe. Much the same applies to global airport rankings.The obvious remedy is to open up the US skies to foreign carriers. Yet the biggest US airlines — United, American Airlines and Delta — are pushing in the opposite direction. They want the US Department of Justice to revoke the rights to fly to US destinations of the three big Gulf carriers (Emirates, Qatar and Etihad) on the grounds that they have benefited from $42bn worth of government subsidies in the past decade. They call this “fair skies”, as opposed to the open variety.That is certainly one way of looking at it. The US pilots and flight attendants unions back their complaint. Some of their case is well founded. Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier, was set up just a decade ago yet it is already one of the busiest in the world. Without the state’s largesse it is hard to imagine that happening.Yet whenever an industry reaches for the word “fair”, alarm bells should go off. Here is a better way of thinking about it. US airlines have benefited from the huge advantage of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy law. Starting with United in 2002, most of the big US carriers have gone bankrupt at some stage. US law has enabled them to restructure debts, slough off legacy pension costs and survive to fly another day. The industry-wide crisis has also prompted consolidation. The market has shrunk to just three big legacy airlines plus Southwest. A fifth, Virgin America, is nibbling at the edges.Nor are they strangers to direct government subsidy. At today’s prices, US airlines have benefited from $155bn of government help in the past half century, according to a US government report. After years of lossmaking, the airlines are back to profitability. US airlines have made almost $25bn since 2013 after losing a cumulative $33bn in the previous decade. Yet consumers have never been less happy. In a separate case, the DoJ last week said it was investigating collusion between the big three US carriers in which they allegedly agree to keep prices high on each other’s primary routes. In the industry they call this “discipline”. Consumers call it gouging. What will it take to make US flying a pleasant experience again?Asian airlines compete on quality, US airlines on price — but only by hoodwinking the consumerThe only solution is open skies. The objection is that the US would be unilaterally disarming. By opening America’s skies to foreign carriers without reciprocal rights, it would be tantamount to bankrupting US airlines all over again. The best foreign carriers are so much better than their US counterparts — and, in most cases, so much more profitable — that they would steal all their business. Yet the same would probably happen even if the open skies were mutual. It is hard to imagine United, or Delta, displacing Cathay Pacific, or Emirates, in their backyards. Both reality and trade theory suggest the consumer would be better off if the US opened its skies unilaterally.So, too, does psychology. The real gulf between Asia and the US is that the former compete on quality while US airlines compete on price. But they do so only by hoodwinking the consumer. To every dollar you spend on a flight is added a large chunk of change in hidden costs. The price of a ticket does not include food, checked baggage, punctuality or WiFi. If your plane happens to have seat screens, the chances are they are not working. If they are, you must swipe your credit card. Even after you have paid for your food, its quality is a human rights violation (and this is coming from a Brit). Meanwhile, the average US domestic “pitch” — the industry measure of a seat’s size — has shrunk from an average of 33 inches a decade ago, to just 31 today. This is at a time when the average waist size has grown. The US consumer expects less than their Asian or European cousins — and receives less. Only the bracing shock of competition can alter this.Is that likely to happen? The chances are slim. The clout of the big carriers in Washington outweighs the woes of millions of frustrated flyers. The same is true in other restricted sectors. Until the US consumer finds its voice again, the gulf with the best of the world will continue to widen.edward.luce@ft.comAmerica’s middle class settles for the cattle car / From Guy WrobleOpen skies policy demands fair and equal opportunity / From Captain Tim Canoll

The S&P 500 energy sector rose just 0.5 per cent while the broader index gained 1.2 per cent to 2,076.62 by close of trading in New York.US airline stocks climbed at the fastest pace in more than five months as American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, trimmed its capacity growth forecasts.The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said on Friday it expected to increase the number of seats flown by roughly 1 per cent in 2015 compared to a year earlier. In April, American had forecast a 2 per cent rise in capacity.The reduction soothed fraying investor nerves that rising capacity across the industry would pressure fares and weigh on operating margins as travel demand fell short of expectations.US carriers were set to increase capacity faster than the growth of the US economy for the first time since 2006 ahead of Friday’s announcement from American, according to Credit Suisse.Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said the airline appeared to be retiring older aircraft at a faster pace, reducing its mainline fleet. “This is the first ‘official’ reduction by a major airline and should be well received by the market despite being somewhat telegraphed.”The NYSE Arca Airline index rose 3.5 per cent to 95.03.

A year ago Smucker’s raised its roast prices when commodity costs jumped, only to see sales hit sharply as coffee drinkers took their business elsewhere.In November the company said the increase was a “misstep”, and annual profits in 2014 slid 39 per cent, largely thanks to its struggling US retail coffee business.Cablevision’s stock soared 7.3 per cent to $26.67 a share, leading the S&P 500 index, after the Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that Patrick Drahi, owner of Altice, was eyeing the company for takeover.Implied equity volatility dipped on Friday after breaching the 20 mark briefly on Thursday, its highest level in five months.The CBOE’s Vix index fell 3.1 points to 16.83, after a testing week in which chaos in Greece and turmoil in Chinese stocks had put markets on edge.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 17,760.41 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 4,997.70.

According to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in the fourth quarter last year they were up 3.3 per cent adjusted for inflation from the low reached in the second quarter of 2013. The price of a US gallon of jet fuel, the biggest single cost item for airlines, declined 21 per cent over the same period.“We are investigating possible unlawful co-ordination by some airlines,” Emily Pierce, a DoJ spokesman, said in response to inquiries.The investigation comes after US airlines have enjoyed some of their strongest profitability. The International Air Transport Association projected in June at its annual meeting that North American airlines would this year earn $15.7bn in net profits and achieve net profit margins of 7.5 per cent — twice the worldwide average. Most observers attribute the higher profits to a reduction in competition after mergers across the industry.In the most recent merger, involving American Airlines and US Airways in January 2014, the DoJ initially sought to block the deal because of potential damage to competition. It subsequently cleared the deal after the airlines agreed to give up some take-off and landing slots.$15.7bnForecast net profits for North American airlines this yearWhile it is unclear which statements have led to the investigation, Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, in May vowed to compete fiercely on price as low-cost airlines added capacity following the fuel price fall. SouthWest Airlines’ chief financial officer had previously sparked sharp falls in airlines’ share prices by saying the company planned to expand US capacity by between 7 and 8 per cent this year. Gary Kelly, SouthWest’s chief executive, subsequently cut back the growth projections to only 7 per cent.SouthWest did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Airlines said it had received a “civil investigative demand” seeking documents and information from the past two years related to statements and decisions about airline capacity.“We will co-operate fully with the investigation and demonstrate that the last two years have presented an entirely new competitive landscape that has greatly benefited air travel consumers,” it said.We will …demonstrate that the last two years have presented an entirely new competitive landscape that has greatly benefited air travel consumersUnited Airlines and Delta also both confirmed the DoJ had approached them.The DoJ’s potential case was civil rather than criminal, and would consequently be easier to prove, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.Companies facing antitrust suits of the kind the DoJ investigation could produce often reach settlements with the government, pay fines and agree to restraints.“It may be that the government can assemble a case that would lead to a settlement or possibly even pursuing a civil case [to court],” Professor Tobias said.News of the probe sent US airline shares down, with American Airlines falling 2.84 per cent, Delta 1.97 per cent, United 2.49 per cent and SouthWest 1.42 per cent.US airline industry displays split personality / From Matt Andersson
120;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-06-30T16:14:58Z;Sky-high demand curbs impact of cheap oil on cost of flights;Airlines in the EU and US have little incentive to pass on fuel savings to passengers in the summer;If you were hoping to bag cheaper flight tickets in the near future, think again. Airlines may be benefiting from the sharp fall in the oil price, but it will be a while before their passengers get to share the cost savings.A near 50 per cent drop in the cost of oil since the summer of last year is good news for carriers, an industry where fuel accounts for about one-third of operating costs.But while some airlines are already getting a boost, they are unlikely to significantly cut fares while demand is high in the summer peak season.“At current prices airlines are getting high levels of occupancy, so it’s not logical if you are filling your seats at these prices to go and cut fares,” says John Strickland of JLS Consulting.Instead, many airlines are expected to maintain fares to boost profitability in an industry ravaged by losses.The International Air Transport Association, the main trade body for the world’s airlines, estimated that carriers would this year generate the strongest profit margins since the mid 1960s — as they finally enjoy the benefits of years of cost-cutting, newer, more efficient aircraft and falling oil prices.But this does not mean that consumers will not see any benefits. Ticket prices have already come down slightly, according to experts.Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada, who monitor air fares, found that while prices had begun to increase during the peak summer season, they were doing so at a slightly lower rate than recorded over the past two years, as some fuel savings were passed on to passengers.According to Mr Strickland, travellers are likely to have to wait until later in the year for more significant price cuts.He says some airlines may decide to maintain capacity in the market for longer because of cheaper fuel costs, which could result in more competition and lower prices in order to fill their aircraft.In May Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost carrier by revenue, warned that lower fuel costs would probably lead to an even more competitive price environment as rivals used the savings to cut fares.But not all airline executives are crowing over cheaper fuel because many carriers are locked into hedging contracts — aimed at smoothing out volatility in the oil price — that mean they cannot take advantage of the current low value of Brent crude. Ryanair has hedged nine-tenths of its fuel purchases this year at $92 a barrel.Other airlines have fared better. Delta Air Lines, one of the leading US carriers, expects low oil prices to cut its costs by $1.7bn annually, while Lufthansa expects to spend about €900m less on fuel in 2015 compared with last year.
121;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Oil price poses little risk for aerospace manufacturers;Robust profits increase leasing of fuel-hungry veteran aircraft and orders for efficient new models;When Delta Air Lines, one of the US’s big three traditional airlines, held a conference for investors last December, it found itself with unexpectedly good news to announce.The airline has been far slower than American, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, its chief rivals, to introduce more fuel-efficient aircraft. But the average price of a gallon of jet fuel had fallen over the course of the year from nearly $3 to about $1.80. The company was consequently facing not only far lower outgoings on aircraft purchases than its rivals, but also bills that were far lower than had been feared for the extra fuel its older aircraft consume.Delta told investors it expected falling fuel prices to cut its costs by $1.7bn annually.Delta’s sudden boost exemplifies the effects of lower fuel prices on demand for aircraft. The fall is making it both more viable to add capacity and more profitable to operate flights with older, less efficient aircraft, which consume up to 20 per cent more fuel on a given flight than the latest models.Leasing companies are able to sign long leases for aircraft that are 15 years and older, when it was previously hard to find anything other than very short-term leases.The question is whether, as some analysts have speculated, a long-term lowering of fuel prices could make airlines reluctant to invest in more fuel-efficient aircraft such as Airbus’s A320neo, Boeing’s 737 Max and A350 and 787 wide-body jets.• How is the oil price collapse affecting civil aviation manufacturers and paying passengers?• How safe is air travel?

Oil was about $40 a barrel when the company launched the 787 in 2004 — still below the current rate of about $65.“The aeroplane made great sense to our customers at that time, and at today’s fuel prices it looks even better,” he says. “They buy planes to use for 20 years or more and they know that fuel prices are volatile.”Nevertheless, Richard Aboulafia, analyst for the Virginia-based Teal Group consultancy, says the fuel-price fall should serve as a warning to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) — that the continued expansion of production rates for narrow-body jets could pose risks if demand falls.Boeing is working to increase production of its 737 family to 52 per month but the rate could increase, Mr Aboulafia says, to nearly 60. “I’m not concerned about numbers falling,” he adds, referring to the potential for current orders to be cancelled. “But I am concerned about OEMs concluding that 60 narrow-body jets per month may be a good thing. This is a good time for caution.”For the moment, however, the main effect of the oil price decline is on the market to lease second-hand aircraft.Ron Wainshal, chief executive of Aircastle, a leasing company that owns more than 150 aircraft, points out that, for many European airlines, the decline in the price of jet fuel has been offset by the decline in their own currencies against the dollar, in which jet fuel prices are quoted.He says that the change is prompting airlines to lean towards keeping aircraft with current technology and up to 15 years old in use for longer. Among the deals that point to the change, he mentions his own company’s successful leasing of five 15-year-old Boeing 737-700s to Southwest Airlines for 10 years — a term that airlines would probably not have considered for older aircraft when fuel prices were higher.“That will take them to the end of the economic lives, so we don’t need to worry about them again,” Mr Wainshal says.One possible effect of the fall in fuel prices could be to shift airlines away from the very high-density seating plans that were popular during the high fuel-price era.Mr Tinseth says that most airlines have opted in recent years for 787 layouts featuring nine seats to a row in economy, rather than the eight that Boeing originally envisaged would predominate. However, there remains flexibility for airlines to choose other configurations.The extra demand for leased aircraft mainly provides the extra capacity airlines are introducing, thanks to their improved economics, rather than substituting for new aircraft.Nevertheless, the key factor in airlines’ continued enthusiasm for ordering new aircraft is, according to Mr Tinseth, likely to be their profitability. And signs for that have so far been promising. US airlines remained robustly profitable in the first quarter — when many traditionally make losses — and airlines are forecasting operating profit margins for this year well into double figures.This follows a surprisingly strong performance for most US airlines during the difficult economic conditions of recent years. Most maintained profit margins by restraining capacity increases and keeping yields high.However, that discipline could yet collapse, wrecking operators’ profitability and casting fresh doubt on their orders. Worries have grown more intense since late May when Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said that his company would “compete aggressively” with low-cost airlines that were adding capacity, to ensure American retained market share.The remarks sent shares in American and United down some 10 per cent and shares in Southwest down 9 per cent. These falls reflected fears that the remarks could foreshadow a return to the kind of price war that ended many previous periods of stable profitability for airlines, and ushered in uncertainty for their suppliers.“We’re not going to lose customers on price,” Mr Parker said. “We’re not going to give anyone else an advantage and allow them to expand at a rate that takes away customers and is not good for our shareholders.”

Returns on capital are expected to exceed cost of capital for the first time since Iata started studying the metric in the early 1990s. Airlines are, finally, enjoying the benefits of years of cost-cutting, improved aircraft efficiency and a falling oil price.However, after years when many groups racked up debt and struggled to replace ageing fleets while investors watched share prices dwindle, there was little clear sense at the meeting of how quickly improved profitability will feed into better service for passengers.Alan Joyce, chief executive of Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier, expresses concerns typical of many in the industry. His airline — which bounced back to a profit in the second half of last year and has $17bn of new aircraft on order — is investing in its fleet to ensure long-term profitability, he says.“At the same time we want to strengthen our balance sheet. We’re making progress on paying down $1bn of debt. We have to return resources to shareholders who are giving us this money.”The main caveat to Iata’s bullish profit forecast for 2015 is that it masks geographical differences. Most carriers worldwide remain a long-haul flight away from robust profitability.North American airlines are doing best, with Iata expecting them to make $15.7bn of net profits this year — 54 per cent of the global total. Their 7.5 per cent net profit margin, according to Brian Pearce, Iata’s chief economist, reflects reduced competition after a series of mergers. The effect of the sharp oil price fall since last year has not been damped for US airlines by the dollar’s strengthening.The big three US legacy airlines — American Airlines, United and Delta — are investing heavily in new aircraft to take advantage of the improved climate.However, Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airline, the fast-growing Dubai-based carrier, points out that all three US legacy airlines have started share buybacks alongside their investment programmes — a development he regrets.“The money should go into product, giving people fair value, not treating them as commodities,” he says.Far more modest net margins for airlines in Asia-Pacific and Europe — of 2.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively — reflect those regions’ weaker economies and more fragmented industries.Alexandre de Juniac, Air France-KLM’s chief executive, says the company is now bringing in new aircraft and investing to improve customer satisfaction.Nevertheless, he goes on: “The uncertainty in the macro-environment is clearly casting a shadow over our activity.”Even if all airlines were performing at the average projected net income level of 4 per cent, few in the industry are prepared to declare that a final victory over the history of lacklustre profitability that has left many airlines reluctant to invest.In other economic sectors, Mr Pearce points out, companies expect to earn more than their cost of capital every year.“Although this is a remarkable result for the air transport industry, it’s a basic result for most other industries,” Mr Pearce says.Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, says it is “unacceptable” that the industry is only just earning its cost of capital.“The industry will not have a long-term future unless we start challenging all parts of the cost base and all parts of the value chain,” Mr Walsh says.He has asked Iata to investigate whether there is scope for legal action against aircraft manufacturers and maintenance providers over what he describes as persistently, unjustifiably high costs.Yet the overwhelming concern for many airlines is not whether profits can be increased. It is the prospect of cut-throat competition — particularly from the Emirates and Etihad Airways in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar Airways — eroding profits back to unsustainable levels.This year the big three asked the US government to review the Gulf carriers’ access to the US market, saying the $42bn in subsidies they allege the state-controlled carriers have received in the past 10 years breach international open skies agreements.Sir Tim links that decision to the launch in 2013 of Emirates’ first direct flight from Europe — from Milan’s Malpensa airport — to New York over the highly profitable north Atlantic.Mr Pearce says, for the moment, aircraft remain “pretty full”— a driver of profitability. Iata projects that aircraft will operate with an average 80.2 per cent of seats filled this year.There has not yet been the rash of new flights that have materialised in many past periods of high profitability, and which usually lead to price wars.But Alexandre de Juniac, the Air France-KLM chief executive, says carriers are starting to transfer aircraft from modestly profitable routes in Asia and Europe to more lucrative transatlantic services. If such moves gain pace the airlines’ moment of reasonable profitability could prove as fleeting as the vignettes projected on the Miami Beach walls.“Everyone is pushing capacity to transatlantic, which is totally understandable,” Mr de Juniac says. “But it’s too much.”It may not feel obvious to a passenger crammed into a Ryanair flight to a remote airport, but, at least in terms of ticket prices, travellers have been the beneficiaries of cut-throat competition.The average passenger will pay just $429 for a return fare, a 64 per cent decline in real terms on 20 years before, according to Iata figures released this week. Over the same period the number of routes offered by airlines worldwide has more than doubled.In the US fares have not recovered to the levels before the 2008 financial crisis. They have been falling for six months as fuel prices have declined along with the value of crude, although in other countries fares have been slower to fall.Many airlines’ fuel bills have shrunk because their currencies have depreciated against the dollar, in which jet kerosene is priced. Carriers’ hedging strategies are another factor temporarily limiting the benefit of falling fuel prices.Some airlines will hope that, even as the fuel price drop becomes more widely felt, they can maintain fares to boost profitability after a tough decade.

Without it, he said, the agreements would be illegal.“We signed the open skies agreement with the US in 1999,” Sir Tim said. “Two or three years later, antitrust immunity started to appear on the horizon.“They gained [antitrust immunity] on a co-ordinated schedule and pricing basis. If I had done that with Emirates with any of those airlines, I would have ended up being jailed.”The UAE had not complained about the change, Sir Tim said. “We didn’t complain because, as far as I’m concerned, all’s fair in love and war,” he added.Sir Tim went on to say the open skies agreement, which he helped negotiate as part of the UAE team, covered very few of the issues which the US carriers have complained about.The deal provides wide latitude for UAE-based airlines to operate into the US from other jurisdictions, including a service from Milan’s Malpensa Airport to New York JFK that Emirates launched in late 2013, he said.Airline chief complains about protectionism coming from parts of US and EUContinue readingThis brought the airline into the lucrative US to Europe market that generates much of US carriers’ revenue.Many other international airlines were either partly or wholly state-owned and have received subsidies similar to those allegedly given to the Gulf carriers, Sir Tim said.He insisted that Emirates had received no more than about $200m worth of aid from the emirate of Dubai when it started in the 1980s.The company now has assets worth $31bn and would be valued in an initial public offering at $60bn-$120bn, he estimated.The “underlying tensions” that the stand-off between US airlines and Gulf carriers had created could threaten wider international airline co-operation through organisations such as Iata, which deals with safety and other standard-setting issues, Sir Tim said.

United Continental fell 4.36 per cent to $51.73, Delta Air Lines retreated 5.01 per cent to $40.75. Southwest Airlines was down 2.85 per cent to $36.11 and JetBlue tumbled 7.22 per cent to $19.01.Airline stocks have experienced a turbulent couple of weeks after low-cost carrier Southwest announced in late May plans to expand capacity this year in an attempt to win greater market share. Concerns that rivals would respond by slashing prices to compete with Southwest are further compounded by signs that demand growth could be weaker than forecast.“We believe that the US airline industry is maintaining the capacity discipline that has supported profit growth over the last few years, especially in the context of sharply lower fuel prices,” said Savanthi Syth, analyst at Raymond James.“However, while we continue to expect the recent pricing softness to improve as we head into the seasonally stronger summer months, the recovery is likely to be somewhat muted versus previous expectations due to the softer than expected US economic growth and American’s aggressive pricing response to Southwest’s capacity growth impacting markets beyond Dallas.”As a result, Raymond James lowered its forecast for American’s earnings per share this year to $8.43 from $9.32. It also cut earnings estimates for Delta, United, Alaska Airlines and Spirit Airlines.Overall, the New York Stock Exchange Arca airline index fell 2.6 per cent to a near six-month low of 93.20.Away from the skies, retail stocks were in focus after Sears became the latest major US retailer to report a slide in first-quarter same-store sales as consumers remain reluctant to part with their hard-earned dollars. Shares in Sears were down 4.25 per cent to $39.01, extending the slide from last Friday.Lacklustre US sales also weighed on McDonald’s. The world’s biggest fast-food chain fell 0.23 per cent to $95.32 after it reported a steeper than expected drop in its US like-for-like sales in May.Ebay suffered its biggest one-day drop in nearly seven months after trimming its free cash flow outlook for 2015. The stock fell 3.76 per cent to $60.85.The broad stock market failed to break last week’s losing streak, with the S&P 500 closing 0.65 per cent lower at 2,079.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned negative for the year after falling 0.46 per cent to 17,766.55. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.92 per cent to 5,021.63.

The US carriers claim that Dubai’s Emirates Airline, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have received $42bn in hidden, competition-distorting state subsidies over the past decade.Doug Parker, American’s chief executive and one of the most vocal critics of the alleged subsidies, is chairing the Iata meeting in Miami Beach.When Mr Parker asked for comments on the normally formal step of adopting the Iata annual report, Mr Al Baker said the trade body should express concern about the “calls for protectionism coming from certain circles in the US and Europe”.“Those should be considered as part of the risks facing our industry and the liberal open market and open skies,” Mr Al Baker said. “It’s important that Iata reiterates its support for freedom of the aviation industry.”Mr Parker took no action over Mr Al Baker’s request, and the annual report was adopted.But the differing stances of Mr Parker and Mr Al Baker raise the likelihood of tensions inside the Oneworld global airline alliance, because American Airlines and Qatar Airways are both members.Qatar is also the biggest shareholder in International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia, which are both Oneworld membersMr Parker declined to comment on the issue, but insisted at a media briefing afterwards that the campaign against alleged subsidies for Gulf carriers was a “public policy issue” separate from American Airlines’ working relationship with Qatar Airways inside the Oneworld alliance.The controversy about the Gulf carriers comes at a time of unprecedented profitability for airlines.Tony Tyler, Iata director-general, forecast in his annual report that this year the aviation industry’s returns would cover its cost of capital for the first time in the trade body’s 70-year history.Iata forecast industry wide net profits for this year up 79 per cent from 2014, at $29.3bn, on revenues of $727bn. The improvement is largely a result of the sharp fall in fuel prices, although Mr Tyler also cited a record high in expected load factors — the number of seats filled on passenger jets — to 80.2 per cent.Mr Tyler pointed out, however, that this year’s forecast net profit margin would still amount to only 4 per cent.The revenue and profits are also very unevenly distributed across regions. North American carriers are expected to generate net profits of $15.7bn this year, resulting in a margin of 7.5 per cent.

Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.92bn driven by an improvement in customer traffic and average transaction amount.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 82 cents a share on sales of $4.94bn.Dollar General said same-store sales, a key industry metric, gained 3.7 per cent, missing estimates for a 4.1 per cent gain.“We were looking for slightly better sales performance given the improvements we have seen in blue-collar labour trends and modest upward pressure on wages — although the gas price tailwind is rapidly losing steam due to the rebound in gas and oil prices,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Dollar General maintained its full-year earnings guidance in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share and said it expects sales to rise 8-9 per cent.Shares of Dollar General, which have gained 39 per cent in the past year, rose 3 per cent to $74.92.PVH Corp was one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the retailer, which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, topped first quarter adjusted earnings forecasts and lifted its full-year earnings guidance on Monday.The New York-based company increased its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $6.85 to $6.95 a share from an earlier forecast for $6.75 to $6.90 a share. The projections compared to Wall Street estimates for full-year earnings of $6.86 a share.The outlook accompanied PVH’s first-quarter results, which showed profits tripled from a year earlier to $114.1m, or $1.37 a share, in the three months to May 3. Sales declined 4 per cent to $1.9bn, in line with expectations.PVH shares jumped 7 per cent to $112.13.Iron Mountain shares slid 6 per cent to $34.68 after analysts at Jefferies downgraded the US storage and information management company to “underperform” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $29 from $33.“Iron Mountain was once a beacon of stability but steepening declines in paper usage and ever cheaper cloud storage . . . should result in a further deterioration in Iron Mountain’s already battered North America storage rental organic growth,” said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies.The company agreed to acquire Recall Holdings earlier this year, but Mr Dolev said this would not resolve its “chronic cash shortfall” and that Iron Mountain would likely have to issue equity or raise debt to avoid cutting its dividend.Airlines stocks were under renewed pressure on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines warned that a key industry metric, PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, fell 5.5 per cent in May from a year earlier. Shares of the US carrier shrunk nearly 3 per cent to $43.21, while the NYSE Arca Airline index fell as much as 1.5 per cent before paring back losses.US stocks were modestly lower as Greek debt talks continues and utilities lagged behind the benchmark S&P 500.The S&P 500 declined 0.1 per cent to 2,109.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 18,011.94.

127;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-05-27T15:55:21Z;US airlines: Here we go again;Industry discipline is breaking down;Perhaps the newfound confidence in US airlines was misguided. The industry was long a laughing stock because of its inevitable cycle of bankruptcies (Chapter 11, often followed by 22 and 33). But after a wave of consolidation over the past decade, the industry has been looking more stable. The survivors — American Airlines, Delta, UAL and discount upstarts Southwest and JetBlue — are all so profitable that they are paying dividends and buying back shares. Shares in the US airline sector are up 267 per cent in the past three years.But last week Doug Parker, the respected head of American, got everyone very worried again. He said that he would not cede market share to discount rivals such as Southwest. In some sectors, such television rhetoric is easy to shrug off. But airline shares fell a tenth over the next few days.The key to the revival of US airlines has been both the restraint in capacity growth (in the US “available seat miles” inched up less than 1 per cent in 2014) and the benefit of lower oil prices (fuel accounts for 40 per cent of airline costs). Credit Suisse estimates that shareholders are receiving 70 per cent of the $7bn in fuel savings that US airlines have made.But this year and next the industry is expecting to increase capacity by between 4 and 6 per cent, or twice the rate of economic growth. And while American, Delta and UAL would prefer to hold the line, rivals are keen to expand. Discounters including Southwest, JetBlue, Alaska, Frontier and Spirit are adding “available seat miles” at a rate approaching 10 per cent a year. Southwest recently said that its revenue per passenger, a measure of efficiency, would fall 3 per cent in the second quarter of this year.And so the airlines’ dilemma echoes that of the oil industry, where Saudi Arabia would rather put up with falling prices than cede its market position in the wake of falling prices. In oil, as in airlines, consumers are the beneficiaries.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

On an adjusted basis, Delta reported earnings of 45 cents a share, ahead of forecasts for 44 cents.Sales rose 5 per cent to $9.4bn in line with expectations.On the earnings call, the company said revenue per available seat mile should decline 2-4 per cent in the second quarter, better than buyside expectations for a decline of 3-5 per cent, according to Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Delta also said it would reduce international capacity by 3 per cent year on year for the winter period.In the December quarter, the company said it expects a 15-20 per cent cut in service from Japan, a 15 per cent reduction in Brazil and 15-20 per cent reductions in Africa, India and the Middle East. It also said it would suspend operations in Moscow over winter.“This is music to the ears of many investors who believe Delta should not overgrow capacity,” Ms Becker said. “The international capacity reductions will be focused on countries that have been hardest hit by the strength of the US dollar,” she added.Delta shares, which have gained 36 per cent in the past year, climbed 3 per cent to $44.20 and were among the best performers on the S&P 500.Intel shares gained 4 per cent to $32.83, after the US chipmaker announced a 3 per cent rise in profits and said sales were being driven by the “internet of things”.The company reported first-quarter profits of $2bn or 41 cents a share, on sales of $12.8bn, largely in line with analysts’ estimates.Revenue from the Internet of Things Group slipped sequentially but rose 11 per cent from the same period a year ago to $533m. “Year-over-year revenues were flat, with double-digit revenue growth in the data centre, IoT and memory businesses offsetting lower than expected demand for business desktop PCs,” said Brian Krzanich, chief executive.Shares of American hospital chain HCA Holdings were buoyed after the company lifted its full-year earnings and sales expectations. President Barack Obama’s overhaul of healthcare insurance, through the Affordable Care Act, has lowered the number of uninsured Americans and helped improve patient trends, the company said.The operator now expects sales of between $39bn and $40bn this year, from previous forecasts for $38.5bn and $39.5bn. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation will range between $7.55bn and $7.85bn, up from previous estimates for as much as $7.65bn.Shares of gunmaker Smith & Wesson popped on Wednesday, after the company raised its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and sales guidance on better than expected orders in the last quarter of fiscal 2015. Smith & Wesson shares gained more than 15 per cent to $14.97.A rally in oil prices lifted the S&P 500 energy sector up 2 per cent on Wednesday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 per cent to 2,106.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 18,112.61.

Every $1 rise in the price of jet fuel depresses the US airline industry’s pre-tax profits by $400m, Deutsche Bank estimates.The S&P 500 airlines industry sub-index declined more than 3 per cent to 304.74.Shares of Delta Air Lines fell 3.8 per cent to $43.26 while United Continental Holdings dipped 4.8 per cent to $64.01. American Airlines shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $50.44.Shares of Sears Holdings rallied as much as 8 per cent on news that it expects to raise $2.5bn by offering rights to buy shares in its Reit, Seritage Growth Properties, to partially finance its purchase of 254 stores.Separately, Sears also entered into a real estate joint venture with General Growth Properties, under which the Illinois-based retailer would sell 12 properties located at GGP malls.Sears, which is behind the Kmart chain and its eponymous brand, has struggled to keep consumers that have increasingly turned online.Shares of GoDaddy, the web-hosting company, opened at $26.15 in their New York trading debut, 31 per cent above its initial public offering price of $20.The Chicago-based company, which sells internet domain names to small businesses, raised $460m in its IPO.Michael Kors shares declined 2.5 per cent to $64.08 after analysts at Piper Jaffray lowered the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and cut their price target to $70 from $89.“While the Michael Kors brand continues to enjoy share gains domestically and increasingly so in international markets (with still runway to go), we believe the stock is likely to trade in a range until North American comps stabilise,” said Erinn Murphy, an analyst at PiperJaffray.Michael Kors’ North America same-store sales, a key industry metric, have slowed from 21 per cent to 6 per cent in the past three quarters.US stocks declined at the start of the new quarter as disappointing economic data weighed on sentiment.

It had received equity injections from the government — one of the hidden subsidies to which the US carriers object.However, he insisted that the US airlines had not properly grasped how the Gulf carriers operated.“We shouldn’t attack what we don’t understand,” Mr Hogan said. “We should work through appropriate channels to resolve our differences.”Fair and Open Skies, a campaign group formed by the US airlines, alleged that Etihad received almost $18bn of the $42bn of hidden aid, including $6.3bn in equity injections.We shouldn’t attack what we don’t understandThe expansion of the three large Gulf airlines has been a strategic priority for Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar, which have built modern airports to serve as the carriers’ global hubs.The US airlines are particularly unhappy about the effect of competition on routes between the US and India, where the Gulf carriers have a significant market share.Doug Parker, American Airlines’ chief executive, told Bloomberg the US carrier would like to fly to India but was unable to do so because Gulf airlines’ fares were so low.“They’re flying at fares that certainly can’t be profitable,” Mr Parker said. “If you don’t level the playing field, jobs will flow from the US to the Gulf.”
131;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-03-15T17:52:02Z;Emirates Airline considers action against US rivals;Airline rebuts allegations that his airline has grown aggressively and is unfair competition;Emirates Airline is considering legal action against US carriers who have accused their rapidly growing Gulf-based rivals of unfair competition.Sir Tim Clark, chief executive of Emirates, will meet transport officials in Washington on Monday to rebut the allegations from US airlines and unions that his airline has grown aggressively on the back of state subsidies.“We will deal with [the allegations] line by line. They will be eating their words,” he told the Financial Times.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines allege that Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, have benefited from $42bn in state subsidies over the past decade.In the same period the Gulf carriers have grown from relatively small players to serious challengers on many routes, with Emirates now in the top three globally by capacity.The US aviation industry has won the support of unions in an increasingly acrimonious battle to force a renegotiation of the Open Skies agreements with Gulf states, which allow national carriers greater access to each other’s markets.Privately, US officials have said the campaign would not threaten the principle of Open Skies, which has helped to open up the global aviation market. But some in the industry fear US politicians could be susceptible to such lobbying in the run-up to the 2016 national election.Willie Walsh, head of the UK-based International Airlines Group which is the parent of British Airways and Iberia, recently warned of “protectionism” that was “rearing its head again, notably in the US”.Sir Tim said the allegations were also beginning to affect opportunities in other markets where legacy carriers were struggling to compete with Gulf carriers’ younger fleets, services and fares.“There is an element of contagion in Europe,” he said. A German politician had recently called for a ban on granting landing rights to Gulf carriers “unless they answer the subsidies question,” Sir Tim said.The boss of the United Arab Emirates-based airline added: “If we establish there has been commercial damage as a result of what has been said about us . . . all options are on the table,” including legal action.At the Monday meeting with US officials, Sir Tim said he would ask that the airline “reasonably be given the chance to respond in the time that it takes us” before any action was taken. “I worry about knee-jerk reactions,” he said.Although he was making a direct appeal to the transport secretary he stressed that governments, not carriers, would ultimately address any potential renegotiation of the Open Skies agreement. “These are government issues. That is where it lies in the first instance.”However, revising the treaties that liberalised aviation markets would be “a huge error of judgment because there are so many things at stake,” he said.Sir Tim said the US carriers had missed an opportunity to benefit from the expansion of Gulf airlines, which flew to many destinations not served by the US aviation industry. Emirates had tried several times to link up with American Airlines, for example.“The smart thing to have done was actually to talk to us,” he said.
132;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-03-11T20:49:23Z;Airlines rebound as fuel costs slide;Boost from rise in revenue passenger miles for Southwest Airlines;US airline stocks rebounded on Wednesday after a turbulent start to the week as energy costs slid and one of the country’s largest carriers said a key measure of revenues had climbed.Spot jet fuel continued a recent slide, one of the key tailwinds for the sector, reversing a bounce recorded at the end of January when prices climbed 26 per cent as crude oil producers cut capacity.A lack of demand and ever rising crude stockpiles have depressed energy prices in the US and abroad. Jet fuel prices have tumbled 45 per cent to $1.647 a gallon since touching a peak last June, according to Platts.Carriers also found lift after Southwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US airline by market valuation, reported a 1 per cent gain in revenue passenger miles from a year earlier, reversing a 1 per cent decline in January.Analysts with UBS had expected industry revenues to slip 1.2 per cent in February, while those with Cowen & Co had projected a 1 per cent dip for Southwest.Airlines proved one of the most popular trades last year, as carriers flew more tightly packed jets and fuel prices declined. This, with an improving US economy and structural changes through industry consolidation, have propelled the New York Stock Exchange ARCA Airline index 42 per cent higher since the start of 2014.“We continue to believe capacity and capital discipline will prevail in the lower fuel environment and that management teams have a strong desire to protect pricing,” Julie Yates, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said. “Yes, pockets of competitive tension exist but we think broadly the industry structure in the US remains healthy and demand solid.”Southwest shares advanced 2.1 per cent to $43.84. Rival Delta climbed 1.83 per cent to $44.02, American Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $47.39 and United Continental increased 2.1 per cent to $65.97.SanDisk shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $82.73 after brokerage Goldman Sachs added the company to its conviction buy list. Analysts with the investment bank said they expected margins to expand for the flash memory manufacturer and that they had increased confidence in the industry’s supply-demand dynamic.“We expect demand to improve from a seasonally slow first quarter,” said Mark Delaney, an analyst with the bank. “In addition to normal seasonality, our discussions and product announcements at Mobile World Congress suggest that the iPhone 6 is helping lead to an increase in NAND content in the products of other [manufacturers].”Weibo shares in New York recovered from earlier falls to end up almost 1 per cent to $15.02 after the Chinese social network said profits tumbled 79 per cent to $4.6m, or 2 cents a share.Overall, US equity markets dipped after a sharp sell off on Tuesday, though banks rebounded ahead of stress tests from the Federal Reserve.The S&P 500 slipped 0.19 per cent to 2,040.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.16 per cent lower to 17,635.39.

133;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-03-11T12:36:01Z;Warren Buffett shows HSBC and Delta Air Lines how to say sorry;When business leaders make mistakes, they have nothing to lose from a proper apology;"Doctors bury their mistakes and, according to a 2008 UK survey, often keep quiet about them.They shouldn’t. The General Medical Council practice guidelines say doctors who err “should offer an apology and explain fully and promptly . . . what has happened”. But the survey of junior doctors found that “errors were normalised, dealt with through teasing, or minimised”. Dead patients would probably have died anyway.Daniel Sokol, a lawyer and medical ethics lecturer who cited the survey in a BMJ article, says that “admitting a mistake is painfully difficult for any self-respecting professional”. He could have said the same of many business leaders.Last month, Richard Anderson, Delta Air Lines’ chief executive, accused Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways of receiving state subsidies.The Gulf carriers have argued that US airlines received government help after 9/11, but Mr Anderson called their riposte a “great irony”, given that the attacks “came from terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula”.Delta said in defence of its chief executive: “He didn’t mean to suggest the Gulf carriers or their governments are linked to the 9/11 terrorists. We apologise if anyone was offended.”Of course they were offended. It was hard to read in Mr Anderson’s statement anything other than an association between the airlines or their governments and the attacks.What would it have cost Mr Anderson to have spoken for himself? He could have said: “Sorry, I went way too far. Of course the airlines had nothing to do with 9/11. I was irritated because they keep saying we got subsidies. There was a one-time payment to airlines in the aftermath of the US airspace closure after 9/11. Delta didn’t receive any loan guarantees.”All that was in Delta’s statement but because of the flimsy apology, few paid any attention.HSBC, whose chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, described its Swiss private bank’s role in tax evasion as a “source of shame” did say sorry. He said it in a letter to customers, shareholders and staff and twice before UK parliamentary committees, most recently this week.But he and other senior HSBC leaders repeatedly stalled when pressed on whether they had asked themselves why so many non-Swiss people had Swiss bank accounts and why they were not more suspicious about customers withdrawing huge amounts in cash. Admittedly, these parliamentary hearings are adversarial and pitiless, with MPs probing for any admission of guilt they can leap on.But, again, Mr Gulliver would have been no worse off if he had said: “Look, things were different back then. Private banks, and not just ours, took the view that it wasn’t up to us to make sure our customers paid their taxes. It was a matter for them, their tax authorities and their consciences. But, since the financial crisis, everything has changed, and we recognise that.”HSBC said just that, in more formal terms, in a January update.One business leader who has no problem detailing his mistakes is Warren Buffett. He regularly does it in his annual letter to shareholders. This year’s marked the golden anniversary of his and Charlie Munger’s control of Berkshire Hathaway so he dredged up 50 years of mistakes.They included investing in dying textile companies and seeing acquisition “synergies” evaporate.More recent mistakes included holding on to Tesco shares even though he knew it was likely that the UK retailer’s initial problems were just the first in a series. “You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives,” he wrote.The reasons Mr Buffett gave for his mistakes were not poor advice, or lapses by his managers, but his own “thumb-sucking”, “childish behaviour” and “I simply was wrong”.The advantage of pointing out your own errors is not only that it deprives others of the opportunity but that it makes it plain that business is hard, that we make mistakes and that only by examining them can we reduce, but not eliminate, our chances of making them again.Doctors often fear the legal consequences of admitting errors. Business leaders sometimes do too but, far more often, it is stubborn pride.If they opened up, they might discover that the sky would not fall or, in the case of HSBC, that there is no point in denying the obvious because it already has.michael.skapinker@ft.com

The group has pledged by 2018 to surpass its record pre-tax profit of £99m recorded in 1999.“This company has been through a relatively rough period financially,” said Craig Kreeger, the chief executive brought onboard in 2013 from American Airlines to turnround the ailing carrier. “We are very pleased with the progress we have made on all fronts. The recovery plan is complete and we are on to the future.”Virgin’s transatlantic joint venture with Delta is giving the UK carrier the ability to mount a stronger competitive threat to British Airways, which has a similar partnership with American. All four carriers are benefiting from the economic recovery in the US and the UK.Mr Kreeger signalled that the competition on transatlantic routes would hot up as the carrier planned to add seven new flights between Heathrow and major US cities, taking its peak daily services to 39 from the current 32.The Virgin Atlantic head dismissed questions about the ongoing EU inquiry into whether Delta could be exercising undue influence over Sir Richard’s airline despite rules that bar foreign investors from owning majority stakes in European airlines.“I’ve actually given it absolutely no thought,” he said. “We are 100 per cent confident in all the reasons the [regulators] approved our deal in the first place, and in how we run this company, which is for the benefit of Virgin Atlantic.”The group, 49 per cent owned by Delta and 51 per cent by Sir Richard’s Virgin Group, has racked up total pre-tax losses of more than £300m in the five years to the end of 2013.On Monday, it reported profit before tax and exceptional items of £14.4m for 2014, against a pro forma £51m loss for 2013. Revenues at £2.9bn last year were flat on 2013. The 2013 numbers were restated to reflect the change in the company’s financial year to the end of December.Mr Kreeger said that as well as the fruits of the Delta partnership, the carrier had benefited from cost reductions, the closure of lossmaking routes, and the low oil price.Virgin was also enjoying better returns from its new Boeing 787s, the first of which began operation in October. It now has three of the more fuel efficient long haul passenger jets operating from Heathrow to US destinations.Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said the relationship with Delta was “paying benefits, helping to bring in higher value passengers from the US. It’s been a tough number of years for them but new aircraft will assist in structurally improving the economics of the business”.Passenger numbers were down almost 1 per cent to 6.2m in 2014 as the carrier scaled back its network and retired older aircraft. Its load factor, a measure of how full its aircraft are, fell just over 5 per cent to 77 per cent.

The calls for action in Washington underline how the Gulf carriers have become the most disruptive force in long-haul aviation, putting pressure on Asian, European and now US carriers.The US campaign, unusually, pitches two members of one of the big worldwide airline alliances – American and Qatar both belong to the oneworld partnership – against each other. American also co-operates closely on many routes with British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, in which Qatar is the biggest shareholder.A person involved in the campaign, who asked not to be identified, indicated the US government was taking the airlines’ claims seriously but had not yet decided how to proceed.The carriers claim that the alleged subsidies violate provisions of so-called open skies agreements liberalising air routes between the US and both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The US campaign wants the Obama administration to hold talks with Qatar and the UAE “to address the flow of subsidised [aircraft] capacity [by Gulf carriers] to the US, and requesting a freeze on new passenger service during the consultations”.None of the three Gulf carriers immediately responded to requests to comment on the US airlines’ claims but Emirates has previously denied it receives any form of subsidy.The US campaign claimed that Emirates, the largest of the three main Gulf carriers, received $6.8bn in subsidies and “unfair benefits” between 2004 and 2014, while it said Etihad obtained $17bn and Qatar $17bn.Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, said: “The subsidies provided by the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates undermine the true spirit of open skies and distort the international aviation market.”The subsidies provided by the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates undermine the true spirit of open skies and distort the international aviation marketFor Emirates, owned by the emirate of Dubai, the biggest alleged subsidies are the government’s assumption of $2.4bn of fuel hedging losses, $2.3bn in artificially low airport charges at its Dubai hub and $1.9bn in lower labour costs because the airline is non-unionised.For Qatar, the biggest items are said to be $7.7bn in interest-free loans from the Qatari government and $6.8bn in reduced interest costs due to sovereign guarantees for its borrowings.The campaign said Etihad received $6.3bn in equity infusions from its owner, the emirate of Abu Dhabi, $4.6bn in interest-free loans with no repayment obligation, and $4.2bn in “additional committed subsidies”.Emirates questioned Mr Anderson’s fitness for office after he said it was ironic to have the UAE complain about financial support for US airlines, given they were “shocked” by the September 11 2001 attacks that involved terrorists from the Arabian peninsula.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Are US airlines ready to give up their subsidies? / From Amy Schultz Isik
136;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
137;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2015-02-20T22:16:58Z;Emirates attacks Delta chief’s credibility;Escalation of competition row draws in US terror attacks;Emirates, the ambitious Dubai airline, has questioned whether Delta Air Lines’ chief executive is fit for his position, in an escalation of a competition dispute that has turned into a war of words about the September 11 2001 attacks on the US.The airline made its highly unusual attack after Delta’s Richard Anderson partially apologised for commenting on Monday on the “great irony” that criticisms of US airlines were coming from the “Arabian peninsula,” like the September 11 attackers.Mr Anderson appeared on CNN’s Quest Means Business programme to publicise the claims of Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines that Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have received $40bn in state subsidies.The US airlines want the US government to renegotiate or cancel aspects of its open skies treaties allowing unrestricted flying between the countries because of the subsidies, which they portray as unfairly distorting competition.The three Gulf carriers have regularly argued that the US airlines should simply compete with them to see which succeeds. They also regularly point out that US airlines received government aid and loan guarantees after the September 11 attacks led to a two-day closure of US airspace and subsequent fall-off in business.“We believe that the statements made this week by Mr Anderson were deliberately crafted and delivered for specific effect,” Emirates said. “This brings into question his credibility as a CEO of a US public listed company, as well as the integrity of the submission which his airline has submitted to the US authorities”.Delta declined to comment further on Emirates’ response.Mr Anderson had claimed on CNN that investigations by the airlines had uncovered full financial statements for the three Gulf carriers — which all publish some form of financial statement— showing they had received $40bn government subsidies.Emirates and Etihad are both based in the United Arab Emirates and owned by the emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi respectively. Qatar Airways is owned by the government of Qatar.Mr Anderson’s most contentious remarks came after Richard Quest, the program host, asked him about the Gulf airlines’ contention that the US airlines had received government support.“It’s a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates, from the Arabian Peninsula, talk about that, given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/11, which came from terrorists from the Arabian peninsula.”Delta subsequently said Mr Anderson had not meant to suggest the Gulf carriers or their governments were linked to the 9/11 terrorists.“We apologise if anyone was offended,” it said.However, it reiterated that the payments after 9/11 had been compensation for the losses resulting from the airspace closure and that the subsequent bankruptcies of a series of big US airlines had been “completely transparent”.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, the aerospace consultancy, said Mr Anderson’s comments were “one of the more spectacular overplaying of hands” that he had seen.Overseas carriers were not in a strong position to resist the Gulf carriers’ rapid growth, Mr Aboulafia said.

It warned of “very impressive snowfall totals” of between one and three feet (30cm-90cm) from New York City northwards.Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, declared a state of emergency for all of New York City and several counties on Long Island and immediately north of the city. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, Dan Malloy of Connecticut and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts all declared emergencies in their states.Forecasts for the heaviest snowfall in New York City slipped back during the day. By mid-evening, the heaviest snow was forecast to fall between 2am and 6am, several hours later than previously forecast.By Monday night, 2,848 domestic and international flights had been cancelled around the US, according to FlightAware, the information website. The worst-affected airports were LaGuardia, John F Kennedy and Newark International, all in the greater New York area, where more than half of all arrivals had been cancelled.New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority warned that the city’s subway service would be restricted after 8pm as the authority sheltered trains on underground express tracks.Mr Cuomo announced that the system, which normally operates 24 hours a day, would shut entirely from 11pm. The only two previous complete shutdowns in the system’s 110-year history were in 2011 for Hurricane Irene and 2012 for Superstorm Sandy.New Jersey Transit announced that it would shut down rail and bus services after 10pm and not restart heavy rail services until at least Thursday morning. Bill de Blasio, New York City’s mayor, banned all but emergency road travel after 11pm. Massachusetts banned travel after midnight on Monday.US travellers face widespread cancellations in light of a blizzard stretching along the east coast from Maine to New Jersey, including the cities of Boston, New York and Philadelphia. For a detailed status of airports, trains, public transit and government offices, see the links below.

The Metropolitan Opera closed its doors, and the Knicks game against the Sacramento Kings at Madison Square Garden was postponed.The NWS’s warning of what it called a “crippling and potentially historic blizzard” covers New York, Boston and Philadelphia from late Monday afternoon.“This could be the biggest snowstorm in the history of this city,” Mr de Blasio said on Sunday, telling residents to prepare for something worse than we have ever seen before”.Boston and other areas to the north could suffer still more severe snowfalls and disruption.On Monday, snowploughs and salt spreaders were out on roads across the region and long queues formed at grocery and hardware stores.In rural and suburban areas where power lines are above ground, thousands of homes are expected to be cut off.The storm was expected to disrupt several businesses, but New York’s markets planned to operate as normal.In spite of lower than average trading volumes, the NYSE and Nasdaq operated normally on Monday, and as of late afternoon said they would reopen for normal trading hours on Tuesday. Sifma, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said it was “closely monitoring” the storm but at this time “recommends fixed-income markets remain open”.The US Treasury department changed its auction schedule, moving forward to Monday the sale of four-week bills and postponing to Wednesday an auction of $41bn in two-year floating and fixed-rate notes originally scheduled for Tuesday. It moved an auction of five-year notes from Wednesday to Thursday.Uber, the car-hailing network that has faced criticism from local politicians for its “surge” pricing during periods of peak demand, said it would cap prices at 2.8 times the normal fare. Uber said it would donate proceeds above the cap on “surged trips” to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts.“This reflects Uber’s national policy developed with New York Attorney General [Eric] Schneiderman that balances the goal of reliable transportation options with affordability during disasters,” the company said.Delta Air Lines cancelled as many as 600 flights ahead of the storm, with winds of up to 75mph (120kph) forecast.A blizzard is defined as a snowstorm that lasts for at least three hours where winds exceed 55km/h (35mph) and visibility is reduced to 400m, or a quarter of a mile, or less.As the first snow started falling, business was brisk at the Mazzone hardware store on Court Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, where a steady stream of vehicles was pulling up for people to load bags of calcium chloride pellets for melting ice.“It’s been going like crazy — a lot of salt and shovels,” Matt Mazzone, the store’s owner, said.He nevertheless insisted that, despite the dire forecast, it was a “normal panic”.“He looks fine,” he said, gesturing towards a customer.Across the street, trade was brisk at the Gourmet Fresh grocery store, although there were none of the long queues that were forming at two big nearby grocers — Whole Foods Market in Gowanus and the Park Slope Food Coop.A customer emerging from Gourmet Fresh — Victoria Lovejoy, originally from Australia — expressed scepticism that panic buying was justified in the city.“We’ve all been fooled by stocking up before,” she said, explaining why she was carrying relatively few groceries. “I don’t think we need to worry too much in Carroll Gardens.”The US northeast has so far experienced a relatively mild winter, but last year New York City endured its sixth snowiest year since records began in 1868. The region’s worst storm last winter dumped up to 35cm (14 inches) of snow in February, leading to widespread disruption, with more than 6,400 flights cancelled across the country.

Yet as consumers gained the opportunity to search competitors such as Amazon in flight, SkyMall lost its dominance of commerce in the skies.With “minimal” barriers to enter the market, rivals had “greater, or vastly greater, resources, longer histories, more customers, and higher brand recognition,” Mr Wiley said. Changing technology and the costs of putting brochures in seat pockets have also made the in-flight catalogue “increasingly unattractive to the airlines”, he conceded. Delta dropped SkyMall from its flights last November, and Southwest, the low-cost US carrier, notified the company in December that it too would drop the catalogue from April.With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalogueExecutives are now looking to sell the company’s assets — valued in the filing at between $1m and $10m, against liabilities of $10m-$50m — and complete an orderly wind-down of its affairs. An auction of SkyMall’s assets will be held on March 24 with sales closing in April.Delta, American and US Airways, which has merged with American, were listed as SkyMall’s largest creditors, owed a combined $3.1m.Xhibit, which was valued at $742m after agreeing to merge with SkyMall in 2013, was dealt a blow following the Federal Aviation Administration’s move that October to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets from “gate to gate” during flights.In September of 2014, Xhibit terminated or sold all its other businesses to focus solely on the SkyMall commerce division. The company said the unit generated revenues of $15.8m in the nine months to the end of September, compared to $32.8m for all of 2013.Financial duress forced the firm to lay off 47 employees in January, most of whom served in its call centres, and to suspend it retail catalogue business.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
140;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US airlines: turning the page;The industry’s latest round of reorganisation just may have worked;Chapter 11 . . . Chapter 22 . . . Chapter 33 . . . Has the thick tome of airline bankruptcy finally closed? Reorganisations aim to reset capital structures along with labour and other commercial agreements. The latest set of workouts may finally have got it right. In the past two years, shares of the big US carriers UAL, American and Delta are all up at least 150 per cent.Consolidation has left four carriers controlling 80 per cent of US capacity, and that capacity is down 6 per cent since 2006. Along with healthy demand driven by steady economic growth, carrier capacity utilisation is above 80 per cent, a historical high. Most US airlines are paying dividends or buying back stock. Falling jet fuel prices, typically a third of operating expenses, just add to the embarrassment of riches.The strong returns are correlated, in part, to the timing of the carriers’ mergers. Delta and Northwest closed their combination in late 2008. In the past five years, return on invested capital — the most crucial measure of operations because of the capital intensity of the business — has soared from 0 to 19 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.United Airlines and Continental completed their merger in late 2010 and the integration, initially plagued by technology and cultural problems, remains very much a work in progress. United’s ROIC stands at just 10 per cent, roughly in line with its cost of capital. In 2013 it unveiled a $2bn cost-reduction plan. Remember, though, that 2015 and 2016 will be the fifth and sixth years since the merger, the same years that Delta and Northwest wrung out the most efficiencies in their transaction.Individual results obscure the real transformation in American aviation: the emergence of an oligopoly. The US carriers are exhibiting discipline on capacity and capital spending. Good results have followed.Even discount carrier JetBlue announced in November it would add seats to aircraft (that is, reduce leg room) and institute bag fees. The airlines say better financial results mean a better flying experience. Passengers may disagree.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
141;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Oil’s decline poses a pricing challenge for managers;Too few companies know how to brace themselves for commodity turbulence;"“Trying to forecast oil demand, supply and price in today’s market is like trying to paint the wings of an aeroplane in flight. Even if one succeeds in covering the subject, it’s unlikely to be a tidy job.”Howard Kauffmann, then president of Exxon, was speaking in 1982, as the price of crude declined from its post-oil-shock high, but his comments may as well apply today, with prices weak and pundits who warned of “peak oil” a year or two ago fretting instead about “peak demand”.Oil majors are price takers: the level at which they sell their product is largely dictated by the market. Not surprisingly, when the price falls, they have to adjust other costs. BP last week heralded big cuts and job losses; ConocoPhillips said it would reduce capital spending by a fifth in 2015.But what about the price makers, the companies for whom oil is one of many raw materials for their product? Their management challenge is more complex.Despite the efforts of economists to boil the pricing question down to essentials (Alfred Marshall famously used a fish market to illustrate “perfect” competition), and centuries of experience, even large companies sometimes seem to flounder.One reason is that organisations flout the Kauffmann Principle by switching to autopilot and ignoring any risk of turbulence ahead. After a long period of commodity stability in the 1990s, some managers simply forgot how to adjust the paint-pots in flight, according to one former executive at a multinational. They had lapsed into a complacent view that the cost of commodities was predictable, projected prices accordingly, and duly suffered when raw material prices misbehaved.The textbook answer to the question of how to smooth commodity volatility is to hedge. But hedging can be a dangerous game if it is not your core activity. In 2012, Delta Air Lines actually bought a refinery near Philadelphia as part of its effort to manage fuel prices. The decision perplexed analysts, one of whom said it was “like a rabbi buying a church”. Glory be, Delta said last week that, partly as a result of its unorthodox strategy, it expected lower fuel prices to yield an annual net cost benefit of $1.7bn. But some critics still believe the refinery gambit — launched when oil was costly — will not work as well now crude prices are weakening.At least Delta is trying. Francesco Barosi of AlixPartners, the consultancy, says most companies “instead of looking ahead, are looking back”. Very few are good at both tactical pricing, which depends on managing existing contracts and orders, and strategic pricing, which involves keeping an eye on the horizon. Most ignore even valuable internal information from customers and suppliers that could allow them to anticipate volatility and be less reactive.Knowledge of the consequences of a shift in raw material costs remains patchy. Some companies examine only the potential impact on their top three products; some look at their whole portfolio; some remain in the dark. Recession and online competition have pushed pricing to the top of the board’s agenda at retail businesses, according to one chief financial officer. But AlixPartners reckons fewer than half
of companies put price analysis and negotiation in the hands of a dedicated senior team.Such lapses are surprising, given that pricing the product properly is one of the basic imperatives of business. One of the great pleasures of watching The Apprentice is seeing how novices mess it up. In one recent episode of the UK version, the teams competed to create candles (which in their commercial form depend, as it happens, on paraffin wax, an oil byproduct). To call their pricing strategies naive would be a gross understatement. In the end, the candidates with the better product were trounced because their opponents, despite having made various moronic errors, had used cheaper ingredients and sold their candles at a higher margin.Some manufacturers will get lucky as the cost of crude oil falls. They may be able to hold prices and bank a higher margin. Congratulations if that decision was thought through. If, however, you did not know, let alone anticipate, how that windfall occurred, you deserve to be ranked with the blunderers on The Apprentice: you are neither price taker, nor price maker, but a price faker, whose bluff will eventually, and expensively, get called.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
142;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-12-11T22:44:00Z;Delta aims for $1.7bn fuel price boost;Falling costs are helping fortunes of big US carriers;Delta Air Lines expects lower fuel prices to produce an annual net cost benefit of $1.7bn, the company said on Thursday, in the latest sign of how falling fuel costs are boosting the fortunes of big US carriers.Delta gave the estimate at an investor day in New York at which the company also said it expected pre-tax profit of $4.5bn in 2014, up $1.9bn compared to last year.The company’s shares surged almost 5 per cent on the announcements, to $48.38.Delta has taken an unusual approach to managing fuel prices by purchasing the Trainer oil refinery near Philadelphia.Delta has also persevered with significantly older — and hence more fuel-hungry — aircraft than other US airlines, betting that it can maintain the passenger jets better than competitors and therefore save on capital spending.Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer, claimed both strategies were proving successful. The refinery — which has lost money heavily during periods after Delta bought it from ConocoPhillips in 2012 — was expected to contribute $70m to operating profit in the fourth quarter, and the company was successfully managing expenses.“I think we’re on a strong path,” Mr Jacobson said. “We’ve created a lot of value. We have a lot more value to create.”Delta and other US airlines have enjoyed sharply rebounding profitability in recent years as a series of mergers has reduced cut-throat competition, and the US economic recovery has encouraged travel.Delta said its cost per available seat mile excluding fuel expenses would rise by only 1 per cent for the last three months of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter last year.“The cost performance has been a really terrific performance over the last couple of years,” Mr Jacobson said.I think we’re on a strong path. We’ve created a lot of value. We have a lot more value to createHowever, Delta would increase its overall seating capacity by about 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year.“We’re not so focused on cost discipline that we miss out on investing in the product,” Mr Jacobson said.The US airline industry still had considerable opportunities to improve its profitability given recent consolidation, he added.“We talk a lot about still being in the relative infancy of consolidation, learning to be comfortable in our own skin, learning to appreciate the economies of scale that this industry has never seen before,” Mr Jacobson said.Delta estimated that its distinctive fuel strategy should gain it an 8c to 10c per gallon advantage over competitors. It expected to pay an average $2.88 per gallon this year, against $2.97 for the wider industry.

145;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-11-01T21:31:53Z;Branson’s familiar path offers limited clues into the future;Virgin Galactic founder shows a preference for industry partners;Although its activities might be eye-catchingly different from the group’s other enterprises, Virgin Galactic has followed a strikingly similar development path to other businesses in Sir Richard Branson’s diverse Virgin Group, where he has tended to work with experienced, long-term players within each businesses’ respective industry.Virgin has relied for the complex system to launch tourists into space on Scaled Composites, the Mojave-based company that ten years ago became the first private company to reach space from earth. Northrop Grumman, a significant military contractor, bought Scaled Composites in 2007.The arrangement, sealed when Virgin first reached agreement with Scaled Composites at Virgin Galactic’s founding in 2004, is similar to how Stagecoach Group provided the public transport expertise for the company’s Virgin Trains operation in the UK. Singapore Airlines held a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic, the company’s long-haul airline, from 1999 to 2013 before selling it to Delta Air Lines.The company has also relied on private investment for financing, as the group has done for most of its enterprises since the Virgin Group’s brief but bruising experience as a London-listed company in the 1980s. Abu Dhabi’s Aabar Group in 2010 paid $280m for a 31.8 per cent stake in Galactic and has since increased its holding to 37.8 per cent.Yet, while Sir Richard insisted on Saturday that his company had always recognised the significant dangers involved in operating in space, it remains to be seen how the approach works when confronted with such a catastrophic crash.The closest previous parallel is the 2007 Grayrigg train crash, in which a Virgin Trains Pendolino travelling from London to Glasgow derailed at speed, killing one passenger and injuring many others. In that case, however, it was clear from the start that the crash was the fault of Network Rail, the UK rail infrastructure owner, rather than Virgin.Friday’s crash is likely to raise far more questions about safety practices at both Virgin and Scaled Composites – and to have a far more direct effect on Virgin Galactic’s business.Doug Messier – a space blogger who witnessed the crash on Friday and wrote he had previously been concerned about the operation’s culture – pointed out on Twitter that the co-pilot’s death followed the death in 2007 of three people at Scaled Composites’ Mojave factory. They died after an accident during testing of the engine for SpaceShipTwo, the spacecraft that exploded on Friday.The real question involves the competence of Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, their safety culture and their procedures“The real question involves the competence of Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, their safety culture and their procedures,” he wrote.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute who consults for some of the biggest US aerospace companies, says the explosion is bound to concern Virgin Galactics’ customers, signed up and otherwise.“Every episode like this is likely to create sceptics among the likely customers for launch services, both public and private,” he says.The financial consequences both of any fall in public confidence in Virgin Galactic because of the crash and of further delays and redesign work to fix the problems could be significant. Galactic has promised to refund customers’ deposits at any time, while post-crash investigations could force the company fully to redesign the spacecraft’s propulsion systems if they turn out to be at fault.“Ten years into [the] SpaceShipTwo programme and they still don’t seem to have reliable and safe propulsion system,” Mr Messier wrote on his Twitter account, @spacecom. “Doesn’t bode well.”Yet Sir Richard on Saturday was able to provide to the venture one commodity of which he has never been short – optimism in the face of adversity. It remains to be seen whether that optimism is enough to pull the entrepreneur and his group through its first crisis on humankind’s last frontier.“We are determined to honour the bravery of the pilots and teams here by learning from this tragedy,” he told reporters gathered in Mojave, near the crash site. “Only then can we move forward, united behind a collective desire to push the boundaries of human endeavour.”

Delta also lifted its third-quarter expected fuel costs.The industry has been buffeted by profit warnings from several European carriers over the summer, as demand for flights between western Europe and the US has ebbed.Delta noted revenue passenger miles – a key industry metric – on its transatlantic flights in August was roughly flat from a year earlier. Revenue passenger miles for flights between US and Asia-Pacific markets slipped 2.4 per cent in the month.The company’s chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said the airline was taking action to reduce its capacity on flights between the two regions, including trimming planned flight increases to Europe.Mr Jacobson, speaking at an investor conference, added the “Ebola situation, as well as geopolitical events elsewhere in the Middle East and in Russia” have had “an impact on our unit revenues”.Despite Wednesday’s declines, US airlines have had an exceptional run. The six largest US airlines have each climbed more than 20 per cent this year, while Delta has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.The advance has been predicated on consolidation and a relentless focus on profits – airlines have cut unprofitable commercial flights and increased business and first class amenities to compete for corporate travel. Analysts with UBS noted Delta still had a “meaningful” opportunity in 2015.“Assuming combination of sustained demand strength, reasonable supply growth, and further benefit from up-gauging, we see potential for another year of 3-4 per cent [passenger revenue growth],” Darryl Genovesi of UBS said.Delta shares fell 5 per cent to $38.82, American Airlines slumped 3 per cent to $39.14, United Continental slipped 2 per cent to $49.03 and Southwest declined 1 per cent to $32.58.Toll Brothers shares led US homebuilders lower after the company said net contracts signed in its third quarter fell 6 per cent, short of Wall Street consensus estimates.Overall, sales rose 53 per cent from a year earlier to $1.06bn while profits more than doubled to $97.7m, or 53 cents per share. Analysts with Goldman Sachs said they were concerned by the weakness shown in new orders.They added they were “not yet willing to read too much into” August trends “given this is a slower seasonal time”.Toll Brothers shares fell 5 per cent to $33.95, NVR declined 2 per cent to $1,146.57 and PulteGroup slipped 4 per cent to $18.18.Alere and Stericycle were under pressure after analysts with Goldman Sachs dimmed their views on both healthcare companies.The brokerage cut its rating on Alere to sell from neutral and its assessment of Stericycle to neutral from buy. Analysts with the investment bank said Alere would have difficulty surpassing year ago comparisons.Shares in Alere fell 1 per cent to $35.71 while Stericycle slipped 1 per cent to $117.82.Apple was the worst performing stock on the Nasdaq 100, declining 4 per cent to $98.94, a day after it disclosed the theft of nude pictures of celebrities from its iCloud storage service was a “very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions”.The attack, which Apple is investigating alongside the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, comes less than a week before the iPhone maker is set to debut new devices.Overall, US equity markets were little changed ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,000.72 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 17,078.28.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 4,572.56.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

It will drop flights to Tokyo’s Narita, Mumbai, Vancouver and Cape Town.The changes to Virgin’s network are designed to maximise the benefits of the carrier’s partnership with Delta Air Lines, the US carrier that bought a 49 per cent stake in the UK airline last year. The two airlines have a joint venture on transatlantic routes, similar to a partnership between British Airways and American Airlines.Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said the network changes were “a big deal for us”.“It allows us to continue to capitalise on the growth we are seeing from routes in transatlantic,” he added.“We are on track for becoming profitable this year. It is a sign that we moving into a success phase, allowing us to grow in time.”Virgin has been lossmaking for three years. But it halved its pre-tax losses in 2013 to £51m, down from £102m a year earlier.Virgin and Delta will now offer eight daily flights between London Heathrow and New York JFK. British Airways or American Airlines serve the route with 12 daily flights.Virgin’s network revamp also includes a switch in operations with Delta. Virgin will fly daily between Manchester and Atlanta on a route previously operated by Delta, while the US carrier will take one of the UK airline’s services from Heathrow to Newark.The 500 additional flights planned by Virgin for next summer will amount to an increase of up to 5 per cent compared to the same period this year.“This is about trying to put more capacity into where they think they can be strongest, inevitably transatlantic routes,” said Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum.“On the routes they have dropped, the assumption has to be they have looked at where they are making and losing money and cut accordingly.”The European Commission earlier this year began an investigation into Delta’s stake in Virgin, after allegations that the UK airline was in effect being controlled by the US carrier.Mr Kreeger dismissed the allegations. “I have no concerns,” he said.Delta paid $360m to buy its Virgin Atlantic stake from Singapore Airlines. Sir Richard retains a 51 per cent stake in the UK carrier.From the end of this month, Virgin will start to take delivery of Boeing 787 aircraft, primarily as replacements for its Airbus A340 aircraft.The 787s are more fuel efficient than the A340s, and therefore should be an important part of Virgin’s efforts to return to profit.Virgin plans to invest £300m in a number of customer service improvements such as putting WiFi on its aircraft and building an airport lounge in Los Angeles.

149;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-28T14:18:20Z;Virgin America files for IPO;;Virgin America, the California-based airline partly owned by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, has announced plans for an initial public offering amid the strongest market conditions for airlines since 2001.One person familiar with the deal said the company hoped to raise more than $300m and was targeting a market value of more than $1bn.The company, in which Virgin Group holds 22 per cent and Cyrus Capital Partners, a private equity firm, holds 72 per cent, gave no timetable or capital-raising targets for the proposed IPO.A combination of reduced competition because of mergers, economic recovery and moderating fuel prices have helped most US domestic airlines to return to robust profitability in the past two years, after a prolonged period of losses and bankruptcies. Delta Air Lines last week surprised investors by announcing better than expected net income of $801m on $10.6bn revenue for the three months to June.VA’s initial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that it recorded $10.1m net income on $1.42bn revenue for 2013, its first annual profit since it started operations in 2007. However, it recorded a $22.3m net loss on $313m in revenue for the first quarter of 2014, the most recent period for which it gave figures.The registration statement outlines how the IPO proceeds will allow a comprehensive restructuring of the company’s capital, including the paying off of high-interest loans from Virgin and Cyrus.Virgin America differs from other low-cost start-ups in the US market because it offers first and business class cabins in addition to standard economy cabins as part of an effort to maximum its passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric.The SEC filing outlines how the company plans to grow significantly, mainly by serving new destinations from its existing bases at Los Angeles International and San Francisco International airports but also from a new base at Dallas Love Field. The company plans to start offering flights between New York LaGuardia Airport and Dallas in October.US rules restrict the Virgin Group, as a foreign company, from owning more than 25 per cent of a US domestic carrier. Virgin Group separately controls 51 per cent of Virgin Atlantic, the long-haul carrier, of which Delta owns the remaining 49 per cent.According to Dealogic, the information service, the planned Virgin America IPO will be the first of a US airline since Spirit Airlines, the low-cost carrier, raised $190m when it joined Nasdaq in May 2011.The IPO is being jointly managed by Barclays and Deutsche Bank.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock
150;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-23T16:50:56Z;Delta gains on domestic demand underpin;;Delta Air Lines lifted the US airline sector on Wednesday after it said results were underpinned by strong domestic demand, offsetting weaker international figures.The Atlanta-based carrier was the first of the country’s major airlines to report quarterly results, which showed a 16 per cent surge in US passenger revenues.Overall, sales climbed 9 per cent from a year earlier to $10.6bn, in line with Wall Street expectations. Profits advanced 17 per cent to $801m, or 94 cents per share.The sales figures in the US were eclipsed only by the company’s operations in Latin America, which jumped 23 per cent.Delta, which acquired a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic last year, has tried to improve its offering to economy passengers on the New York to Los Angeles route – one of the most profitable ones for carriers in the US.Delta’s performance in the quarter was also helped as oil hedges cut its fuel expenses. Cost cuts, consolidation and a steady improvement in the US economy have swelled profits at US airlines over the past year and sent their shares soaring.The wider Dow Jones Transportation Average, which includes Delta, has risen 30 per cent in the past 12 months.Delta shares climbed 4 per cent to $39.15. United Airlines rose 3 per cent to $46.00 while American Airlines advanced 2 per cent to $43.33.Shares of Hawaiian Airlines, which reported better than expected results, soared 14 per cent to $14.75.Puma Biotechnology shares nearly tripled after the company said results of a late-stage experimental breast cancer treatment study helped prevent the return of the disease.The drug, neratinib, was studied in women who had undergone surgery to remove a tumour and completed treatment under Roche’s Herceptin IV infusions.Puma said patients who were then treated with neratinib showed a 33 per cent improvement in disease free survival, compared to those on placebo. Disease-free survival indicates the length of time a patient lives without signs of the illness returning.Analysts with Citigroup said the study “was a game changer” and sales could reach $4.1bn a year.“This is a solid result and will lead neratinib to be a part of the standard of care,” Yaron Werber, an analyst with Citi, said. Mr Werber expects the drug to gain regulatory approval in 2016.The results come amid a volatile year for the biotech sector, which has been under renewed pressure after the Fed voiced concern about the valuations of biotech, social media and small-cap stocks.Although the Nasdaq Biotech index has recovered much of its losses since touching a February peak, it has often swung wildly. The index slumped more than 20 per cent from February to an April low before rebounding.Puma shares surged 295 per cent to $233.43, valuing the company at $7bn. Roche rose remained essentially unchanged at $36.82. The broader biotech index advanced 2 per cent to 2,709.89.PepsiCo, the company under pressure to split itself in two, said on Wednesday that sales at the US company’s snacks business continued to outshine its drinks division.Organic revenues at the company’s Americas foods group climbed 4 per cent in the quarter while those of beverages inched 1 per cent higher.Faster growth at the snacks division was not enough to prevent quarterly profits dipping 2 per cent to $1.98bn, or $1.29 a share. PepsiCo, which is cutting $1bn in costs, also raised its full-year profit forecast.Pepsi shares climbed 2 per cent to $90.82.Apple shares continued a years long climb, rising 3 per cent to $97.19, after the company reported quarterly profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.While iPhone and iPad shipments fell short of forecasts, the company said it was seeing strong growth in emerging markets.Overall, US equity markets shifted higher as earnings season barrelled on. Of the 148 companies within the S&P 500 to report thus far, more than four-fifths have met or exceeded expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,987.01, after touching a record high of 1,989.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,086.63. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 4,473.70.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
151;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-23T13:55:56Z;Flights to Israel halted after rockets land near airport;Cancellations come amid sensitivity after MH17 was shot down;A series of international airlines halted flights to Tel Aviv and the US airline regulator banned all flights to the city after rockets fired from the Gaza Strip landed within a mile of the country’s main international airport on Tuesday.The cancellations come amid heightened sensitivity over the potential for conflicts to affect civilian aircraft after a surface-to-air missile apparently fired by pro-Russian militants brought down a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine last week.The most sweeping action was taken by the Federal Aviation Administration, the US air regulator, which barred all US carriers from operating to Tel Aviv for 24 hours, starting from 12.15pm on Tuesday US eastern time (5.15pm London time).The European Aviation Safety Agency, which oversees flight safety in the EU and tries to be consistent with the US Federal Aviation Administration, said it had issued a “strong recommendation to avoid Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International airport until further notice”.“The recommendation applies to all European airlines,” it added.Air France, Germany’s Lufthansa, the Netherlands’ KLM, Italy’s Alitalia, Turkish Airlines and the UK’s easyJet were among the airlines which decided to suspend flights. Air Canada said it was cancelling its flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening and the return flight on Wednesday.Lufthansa and the US’s Delta Air Lines on Wednesday extended their suspensions for another day.The German airline said it made the decision because “at the current time there is no sufficiently reliable new information that would justify a resumption of air operations”.Its original suspension was made because of the “uncertain situation” at Ben Gurion Airport. “This decision was made based on the criteria that the safety of passengers and crews of all airlines has highest priority even though no sharply increased travel warnings from the responsible officials were issued,” it said.The suspension applies to its subsidiaries Germanwings, Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Brussels Airlines.Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, which on Tuesday diverted a flight en route to Tel Aviv from New York with 290 people on board to Paris, told CNBC: “We will not allow a flight to be dispatched over Iran, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan or North Korea. We make this decision wholly independent of any geopolitical or regulatory mandate.”British Airways, which has two daily flights from London to Tel Aviv, said on Wednesday that these services would continue, including one scheduled to leave Heathrow airport at 8.50am on Wednesday.“Our flights are operating normally. Safety is our top priority. We would not operate flights unless it was safe to do so. We are monitoring the situation closely,” said BA.The rocket that landed near the airport exploded in the town of Yehud, 65km north of the Gaza Strip, shortly after 10am local time.Ben-Gurion airport is an essential gateway for Israel, which does little trade with its immediate neighbours in the Middle East and receives most of its visitors from and does most of its business with Europe and other overseas regions.Before Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, aimed at stopping Hamas rocket fire and weakening the militant group, tourist arrivals in Israel were at record levels, of 1.5m between January and May.Yisrael Katz, the country’s transport minister, on Wednesday ordered the opening of Ovda airport, in the south of the country and more than 150km from the Gaza Strip for airlines concerned about landing at Ben Gurion, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israeli carriers El Al and Arkia had increased their flights to a number of cities in Europe because of the flight ban, according to Israel Radio.The US State Department said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, called John Kerry, secretary of state, to discuss the US ban on flights to Israel. The department said that the flight ban would remain in place and that “the only consideration in issuing the notice was the safety and security of our citizens”.The FAA has banned US airlines from flying to or from Ben Gurion airport for up to 24 hoursA clutch of European airlines have followed the US decision, but ultimately carriers have the ability to choose where they fly, based on their own risk assessments.Read moreBut before the FAA’s decision, Israeli media quoted Mr Katz criticising the US airlines’ decision. “There’s absolutely no reason why American airlines in particular should stop their flights and thus hand a prize to terrorism,” he said.EasyJet said its decision to cancel flights was taken because of the FAA instruction to US airlines. It said it “will review its operations to and from Israel on a day-by-day basis taking into account the advice from all the relevant authorities”.The US decision came the day after it warned its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Israel, the West Bank or Gaza. The State Department denied suggestions in Israel that the decisions were an effort by the Obama administration to put pressure on Israel to halt its military operation in Gaza at a time when Mr Kerry is in Egypt trying to broker a ceasefire.Hamas, which previously was able to hit only a small number of southern Israeli towns with its rockets, has been deploying far more powerful weapons in this conflict than in the past. Ben Gurion Airport is around 85km from the nearest point in the Gaza Strip.The rockets concerned are nothing like as powerful as the SA-11 anti-aircraft missile thought to have brought down the flight over Ukraine. But aircraft landing and taking off are particularly vulnerable to missiles and shrapnel, making the attack near the airport a particularly intense security concern.According to Israel’s military, more than 2,100 rockets have been fired at Israel since it began its military operation against Hamas and other groups on July 7. Of these, at least 420 were intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defence system and about 1,700 hit Israel, mostly in open areas and largely but not only in the south of the country, near Gaza.Two Israeli civilians have been killed in injuries sustained from rockets, and a foreign worker in a greenhouse was injured by a rocket near the Gaza border on Wednesday.Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air, Greece’s Aegean Airlines, Lot of Portugal and Air Berlin were the other airlines to cancel flights.
152;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-23T11:15:51Z;Q&A: Why are airlines allowed to fly over war zones?;;Why are we seeing many airlines stop flying to Israel’s Tel Aviv airport?On Tuesday at 12.15 EST, the Federal Aviation Administration, the chief US aviation regulator, banned US airlines from flying to or from Ben Gurion International airport for up to 24 hours because a rocket thought to have been fired from Gaza struck close to the hub earlier that day. On Wednesday the FAA extended this ban by 24 hours.The European Aviation Safety Agency, which oversees EU aviation and seeks to be consistent with the FAA, strongly advised European airlines not to fly to Ben Gurion. Both agencies are concerned about the impact of the conflict between Israeli government forces and Hamas, the militant Islamic group, in Gaza.So US carriers including Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Tel Aviv and a clutch of European airlines have done the same, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.Have all airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv?No. El Al, Israel’s flag carrier, is continuing to use the airport, as is British Airways and several other airlines.Has this regulatory action got anything to do with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17?Strictly speaking, no. The US and European regulators based their decisions on the fact that a rocket landed a mile from Ben Gurion on Tuesday. But it would be naive to think that the MH17 crash, which raised significant concerns about the policing of air space, was not at the forefront of their minds.Have the airlines that stopped flying to Ben Gurion overreacted?Israel thinks they have. Yisrael Katz, transport minister, said: “There’s absolutely no reason why American airlines in particular should stop their flights and thus hand a prize to terrorism.”Michael Bloomberg, New York’s former mayor, said: “The flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately. I strongly urge the FAA to reverse course and permit US airlines to fly to Israel.”So how does the regulatory action on Israel compare with Ukraine?They are very different, which highlights the diverse range of influences that are brought to bear on airspace management.The main say on airspace rests with individual countries. The Ukrainian authorities on July 14 imposed a ban on passenger jets flying below 32,000ft across eastern Ukraine, according to Eurocontrol, the umbrella organisation for airspace management in the EU. Eastern Ukraine is the scene of fighting between pro-Russia separatists and government forces, and military aircraft have been shot down.But this 32,000ft threshold could not safeguard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 from a surface-to-air missile. US authorities believe the Boeing 777 was probably brought down by a missile fired mistakenly by pro-Russia separatists.Many airlines, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, sent their jets over eastern Ukraine until the MH17 crash.However, others, including British Airways, stopped flying over eastern Ukraine well before the crash, saying safety was the top priority. This highlights how airlines ultimately have the ability to choose where they fly, based on their own risk assessments.Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association, said: “The process behind the choice of airspace routing is based on a risk assessment – both by a country’s national aviation security services in the advice that they give to their airlines, and by the airline in how they assess this advice.“This risk assessment approach can give an illusion of safety but it is in fact vulnerable to all sorts of influences including commercial pressure and so it is not surprising to us that there are differences in the way that this risk is assessed by different airlines.”Will the decisions made by the Ukrainian authorities feature in the international investigation into MH17?Almost certainly. The ban on flying below 32,000ft was shown to be inadequate. There is now a complete ban on flying over eastern Ukraine.Do airlines fly over other war zones?Yes. Malaysia Airlines on Monday defended how one of its flights from Kuala Lumpur to London went over Syria, highlighting how the country had not imposed any restrictions in its air space.Does there need to be reform of airspace management, particularly in war zones?The airline industry certainly thinks so. The International Air Transport Association is calling for a review of airspace management in war zones, saying governments must consider whether better procedures can be drawn up. It wants a review led by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the UN agency that sets global aviation standards.Tony Tyler, IATA’s director-general, said: “Nobody should be shooting missiles at civilian aircraft – governments or separatists. Governments will need to take the lead in reviewing how airspace risk assessments are made.”The British Airline Pilots’ Association said ICAO should have powers to declare airspace unsafe, and therefore provide better international co-ordination.

Airlines reacted swiftly to the news, with US and European carriers rerouting traffic away from the country.“At this time, it is important we are very clear: safety is the top priority. No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings,” Tony Tyler, chairman of the International Air Transport Association, said.The Bloomberg world airlines index climbed 0.7 per cent, following a 2 per cent decline on Thursday. The index was led by US airlines, which operate fewer routes over continental Europe than international peers including Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa.Delta shares rose 2 per cent to $37.18, American Airlines climbed 3 per cent to $42.92 and United Continental advanced 2 per cent to $44.25.AMD, the chipmaker that was once valued at $20bn, plunged on Friday after forecasting third quarter sales short of analyst expectations.The company said it expected revenues to rise 2 per cent from the preceding quarter, plus or minus 2 to 3 per cent. The view equates to net revenues between $1.43bn and $1.51bn.AMD has been at work repositioning itself away from its core desktop PC market, after years of declining demand from businesses and consumers.“While management has executed well to some key milestones, the structural headwinds continue to dominate the company’s fate,” John Pitzer, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said.Shares slumped 16 per cent to $3.83, reducing its market capitalisation below $3bn.Google shares climbed 4 per cent to $595.08 after the company said revenues, excluding sales handed on to partners, exceeded Wall Street forecasts.The company behind the namesake search engine generated revenues of $12.7bn in the three months to the end of June, topping forecasts of $12.3bn. Profits rose to $3.4bn in the quarter, up from $3.2bn a year earlier.Google is grappling with how to lift advertising rates as more consumers read ads on mobile devices, which historically command lower rates than desktop adverts.Although the average price for an ad slipped 6 per cent from a year earlier, that topped predictions of a 7 per cent decline. Total clicks on the ads it served rose 25 per cent last quarter, matching analyst forecasts.“We believe Google continues to gain share both in Search and Display, fuelled by its own sites, which is impressive considering its leading position in both segments,” Youssef Squali, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said.American manufacturer Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast as demand increases across its businesses.As a result, the company expects earnings per share for the full-year to be between $5.45 and $5.55, compared to earlier guidance as low as $5.40 per share.Chief executive Dave Cote said positive trends were emerging for the manufacturer with “growing robust backlogs supported by favourable macro trends and strong win rates”.Shares of Honeywell rose 2 per cent to $96.82.VF Corp, the owner of The North Face and Timberland brands, was under pressure following weaker than expected earnings guidance.The company, which topped second quarter forecasts, said it expected to earn $3.06 per share for the full year, three cents below Wall Street consensus.Citi analysts noted store checks indicated the company was making progress diversifying its business away from brands focused on winter apparel, which would boost first-half results.VF shares fell 1 per cent on the news to $60.95.Overall, US equity markets rebounded after a jolt of volatility on Thursday tempered investor enthusiasm and sent Treasury yields sharply lower.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,978.22 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7 per cent to 17,100.18.

United had earlier forecast a 1 to 3 per cent increase.Deutsche Bank analysts said the domestic results were “not surprising in light of what other carriers have indicated thus far”.“However, Pacific revenues surprised to the upside despite 20 per cent additional capacity in United’s China and Hong Kong markets,” analyst Michael Linenberg said.The Chicago-based airline has focused intensely on cost cuts after reporting a $609m loss in the first quarter.United, which has dropped its money-losing Cleveland hub and plans to outsource jobs at some airports, said it now expects non-fuel costs to be flat from a year earlier. The forecast marks an improvement from earlier guidance.The monthly performance figures from United cap a bumpy period for the sector after profit warnings from Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa dented investor enthusiasm.Air France singled out overcapacity on transatlantic routes for some of its difficulty.US airlines have avoided much of that fate, reining in capacity on unprofitable routes.On Wednesday, American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, said it expected second-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile to rise between 5.5 and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.Since the year’s start, the Dow Jones transport index has advanced 11 per cent, led by Southwest, Delta and Alaska airlines.Shares of American rose 2 per cent to $42.82 while Delta climbed 1 per cent to $37.45.American Apparel shares popped 20 per cent higher to $1.02 after the company reached an 11th-hour deal with its board to extend an emergency cash lifeline and overhaul its leadership structure.The company said investment firm Standard General will inject $25m of immediate financial support into the company.The move allows American Apparel to pay off a $10m loan to creditor Lion Capital that had fallen into default.The rise for American Apparel was not echoed across much of the US retail sector on Thursday.Shares of several large specialist retailers declined following lacklustre June sales figures from Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands.The company said same-store sales rose 2 per cent in June, trailing the 3.1 per cent rise expected by analysts on Wall Street.L Brands shares declined 3 per cent to $60.21 while Express dipped 2 per cent to $16.04. Urban Outfitters slid 2 per cent to $33.78 and Michael Kors fell 2 per cent to $89.17.Media giant CBS was under pressure after chief executive Leslie Moonves reported the sale of 375,000 shares worth $23.9m with securities regulators.Shares of the Manhattan-based company declined 3 per cent to $61.80.Potbelly shares slumped 25 per cent to $10.97 after the Chicago-based chain of sandwich shops cut its sales forecast for the year after a testing second quarter. Same-store sales for the quarter to June 29 fell 1.6 per cent.The company offered few details on why sales fell short but said profits in the period were hit by $400,000 of expenses stemming from its launch of new, flatter sandwiches.Overall, US equity markets shifted lower as a rout hitting eurozone periphery markets reached across the Atlantic.The sell-off in European shares was sparked by concerns over the health of Banco Espírito Santo, a Portuguese bank.The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,964.68 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,915.07.

155;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-09T16:40:57Z;Chipotle extends hot streak;;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain that has developed a fervent following across the US, climbed on Wednesday after brokerage Wunderlich Securities said recent price hikes by the chain have not blunted sales.Wunderlich analyst Robert Derrington said traffic trends were little changed by an average 5.5 per cent increase to prices, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $604.11.Mr Derrington now expects the company to report same-store sales growth of 11 per cent in the second quarter, compared to an earlier 8 per cent forecast.“Operators in various geographies we recently spoke with mentioned little if any pushback from customers, perhaps aided by the fact that the company hadn’t raised prices in almost three years,” Mr Derrington said.The restaurant chain, which began increasing prices in April, has likely completed the roll out across its 1,600 locations, he added.Chipotle executives blamed rising food inflation for the need to increase prices, including a 25 per cent jump in beef costs in April from the end of 2013.Wunderlich lifted its price target on Chipotle to $560 from $542 and reiterated its hold rating.The company’s shares, which have advanced 12 per cent since the year’s start, have outperformed much of the fast food sector, including those of McDonald’s, Yum Brands and Domino’s Pizza. Chipotle has mapped out an aggressive expansion over the current year, expecting to open as many as 195 new restaurants.Since the year’s start, the Russell 3000 restaurant index – which includes the largest US restaurants and holds a market capitalisation totalling $286bn – has risen 3 per cent.Garmin shares led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Pacific Crest Securities lowered its rating to underperform from sector perform as inventory of its new vivofit fitness band accumulates.Analysts with Pacific Crest said Wall Street sales expectations for the fitness band were overestimated and a new, larger iPhone could weigh on sales of Garmin’s personal navigation devices.“We have concerns about the underlying strength of the outdoor and fitness businesses, which contribute over half of the company’s operating profit and are critical, in our view,” analyst Brad Erickson said.Garmin shares fell 5 per cent to $57.23 while Telenav slid 2 per cent to $5.47.Shares of Alcoa jumped 6 per cent to $15.67 after the metal mining company turned a profit following two straight quarters of losses.Profits in the quarter to June 30 were $138m, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $119m a year earlier. Sales were little changed from a year earlier at $5.8bn.Alcoa’s results come two weeks after it agreed to buy UK-based Firth Rixson, a maker of aeroplane engine and landing gear components, as the US company seeks to expand its divisions behind everything from aerofoils used in jet engines and sheets used in the auto industry.American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, was buoyed on Wednesday after the company said it expected second quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, to rise between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.The forecast followed a profit warning on Tuesday from Air France-KLM, which weighed on the airline sector.Shares of American Airlines advanced 4 per cent to $41.96 while rival Delta inched 1 per cent higher to $36.94.Container Store shares slid 9 per cent to $24.72, touching the lowest level since they began trading last November, after the retailer said sales in the three months to May 31 missed Wall Street forecasts.“Consistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail ‘funk’,” chief executive Kip Tindell said, referring to a 0.8 per cent decline in same-store sales.Overall, US equities snapped a two day losing streak ahead of and following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,972.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 16,985.61.

156;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-08T22:22:24Z;Airlines bounce back after Air France-KLM warns on profits;;"US airlines began to climb on Wednesday after a months-long retreat, after being dragged down earlier in the day by a profit warning from Europe’s second-largest airline group.Shares of the five largest publicly traded US airlines slid after Air France-KLM said it would miss earlier targets, echoing a warning from Deutsche Lufthansa in June, but several rallied by the close.The Franco-Dutch carrier, listed on exchanges in the Netherlands and New York, announced a cut of up to 12 per cent to expected full-year earnings.Air France now expects earnings of between €2.2bn and €2.3bn. The airline blamed overcapacity on transatlantic flights, as well as difficulty repatriating revenues from Venezuela because of a currency dispute.The warning on flights between the US and European destinations weighed most heavily on Delta, American Airlines and United Continental. More than two-fifths of international revenue passenger miles flown by the three carriers in May, a key industry metric, were on routes across the Atlantic.UBS analysts remained optimistic on the sector, forecasting transatlantic revenue passenger mile growth of between 4.4 and 5.5 per cent in the second and third quarters for the US-based carriers.“Transatlantic bookings continue to come through strong, although we see risk down the road if high single-digit capacity growth continues,” analyst Darryl Genovesi said.Delta fell 5 per cent earlier in the day, but pulled back to close down 1.25 per cent to $36.44; American Airlines slid 4 per cent but ended the day 0.40 per cent up at $40.26; and United Continental climbed from a dip of 1 per cent to end the day up 2.38 per cent at $39.54.Domestic-focused carriers JetBlue fell 1.22 per cent to $10.49 and Southwest fell 1.73 per cent to $26.70.AbbVie shares weakened on Tuesday after the company raised its bid for UK-listed drugmaker Shire to £51.15 a share, or just over £30bn.The US company is again offering a mix of cash and its own shares for Shire, which has long been seen as a likely takeover target as drugmakers seek new medicines.Under the bid, Shire investors would receive £22.44 in cash and 0.856 AbbVie shares for each Shire share they own.AbbVie shares declined 2.98 per cent to $55.69 while Shire shares trading in New York fell 2 per cent to $232.92.US retailer Guess climbed 3.87 per cent to $28.45 after broker Piper Jaffray lifted its rating to overweight from neutral as European confidence improves.“With the exception of France in which visibility remains cloudy, consumer confidence is building in the region and discretionary spending is improving,” analyst Erinn Murphy said.Europe accounted for 35 per cent of Guess sales and 44 per cent of operating earnings in the year to February 1.Guess shares remain nearly a tenth lower since the beginning of the year, as heavy discounting across the retail sector crimped margins, and harsh winter weather in the US kept shoppers away from malls.Shares of specialist grocer Fresh Market declined 2.16 per cent to $31.96 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating to sell from neutral, citing high food cost inflation and intensifying competition.“The bottom line is The Fresh Market is operating in a more competitive environment for speciality grocers that we expect will cap the top line and pressure margins long term,” analyst Stephen Grambling said.Mr Grambling added that a likely re-acceleration in same-store sales would not be enough to offset inflation and the impact from competitors.US markets broadly declined on Tuesday, despite improving job opening figures from the labour department.The S&P 500 fell 0.70 per cent to 1,963.71 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.69 per cent to 16,906.62. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.35 per cent to 4,391.46.After touching a multiyear low last Thursday, the Vix volatility index climbed for its second day. The index, also known as the “fear gauge”, rose 6 per cent to 11.98.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
157;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-07-02T17:13:09Z;Constellation cheered by Modelo results;;Constellation Brands was toasted by investors as the $5.3bn acquisition of beer maker Grupo Modelo, completed last year, showed further signs of paying off.Shares in the wine, beer and spirits company jumped 2 per cent to $90.45 on its results for the quarter, continuing an upward trend since Constellation acquired the Mexican business.Its market value has risen 76 per cent during the past year.A marketing campaign for its newly acquired beers, including Model Especial and Corona, had lured consumers as the summer began, the brewer said.Constellation raised its annual profit forecast to between $4.10 and $4.25 a share, up from an earlier estimate of $3.95 to $4.15.The group, which is based in New York, secured Modelo’s US business after regulators forced larger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev to offload it.AB InBev was seeking approval to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo.Sales more than doubled to $1.53bn in the quarter from a year earlier while profits followed a similar upward path, climbing to $215m.Ahead of the bank earnings season, shares in Bank of America rose 2 per cent to $15.85 after Deutsche Bank upgraded its target value from $16.50 to $18.Analyst Matthew O’Connor noted that shares in the lender were almost 10 per cent below recent highs after investors had priced in a “slew of disappointments”, including weaker first-quarter results than expect, an accounting error that halted capital deployment plans and the US Justice Department mortgage settlement.“These issues are well known at this point,” Mr O’Connor wrote.“[Earnings per share] power has an upward trajectory and if macro conditions improve, EPS and valuation should both benefit.”He concluded that there was less litigation risk for the bank, apart from remaining mortgage issues, than for some of its peers that face action over Libor manipulation, foreign exchange trading and money laundering scandals.Shares in Delta Air Lines fell 5 per cent to $38.24 after it reported lower growth than expected in passenger revenue per seat available.The measure increased 4.5 per cent in June, year on year, but was less than expected because of lower international yields.Domestic demand had been strong, Delta reported, but business demand to Latin America was lower because of the World CupShares in Tyson Foods rose 3 per cent to $38.96 on news that it had sealed its deal to acquire Hillshire Brands for $8.55bn after beating rival bidders.Tyson’s acquisition of Hillshire had been only a matter of time after a bidding war with Pilgrim’s Pride forced the price up to $63 a share – about 70 per cent higher than Hillshire’s value before the battle erupted.For the acquisition to happen, Hillshire had needed to extricate itself from a promise to buy Pinnacle Foods.Tyson disclosed on Wednesday that it had paid Pinnacle a $163m termination fee on behalf of Hillshire to shelve that deal.Shares in Hillshire were little changed while Pinnacle Foods was down 2 per cent to $31.48.Harley-Davidson fell 4 per cent to $67.80, after broker Raymond James downgraded the motorcycle company from “strong buy” to “market perform”.Overall, US equities remained on a modest upward march. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,974.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1 per cent upwards to 16,976.24 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.02 per cent to 4,457.73.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected earnings of 32 cents a share. The news came just one day after the retailer’s founder failed in an attempt to oust two directors.By contrast, shares at retailers Lands’ End and Restoration Hardware enjoyed gains, respectively adding 8 per cent and 13 per cent.Now separated from Sears, Lands’ End saw a significant rise in profit as it has pursued its quest to become a “lifestyle brand”. The apparel retailer reported an increase in net income of nearly 50 per cent in the first quarter, to $10.9m, on total sales of $331m.Revenue was lifted by stronger direct sales through its online platform as well as traditional catalogue. Its retail business, however, reported a 2.3 per cent decline in sales, as it cut the number of its in-store shops at Sears.Shares in Restoration Hardware, an upscale home furnishing company, rose to touch a new intraday high of $80.40, after announcing first-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 14 cents a share at the company, which has recently outperformed its competitors.The company posted a net income of $1.8m for the quarter ending May 3, up from a loss of $161,000 for the same quarter last year. Net revenues increased 22 per cent.Shares in Twitter rose 4 per cent to $36.79 after its chief operating officer, Ali Rowghani, resigned. Mr Rowghani was said to be the driving force behind Twitter’s hunt for a music company, which could include Soundcloud and Spotify, though the company has yet to announce any deals.Overall US equities were weaker, the S&P 500 down 0.71 per cent at 1,930.11 by close of trading in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 109.69 points, or 0.65 per cent, at 16,734.19, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.30 points, or 0.79 per cent, to 4,297.63.

CBS owns 97m shares of CBS Outdoor common stock, representing some 81 per cent of all outstanding shares.CBS shares closed just over 1 per cent higher at $61.80. CBS Outdoor shares were down 2.84 per cent to $31.15.The US transport sector came under pressure after a profit warning from Europe’s second-largest airline felled rivals across the Atlantic.Shares of the three largest US carriers slid after Deutsche Lufthansa warned it would not meet its 2015 earnings targets, dragging the Dow Jones Transport Index lower.Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald highlighted weakness on transatlantic routes after Lufthansa executives said bookings were down between 1 and 1.5 per cent.More than two-fifths of Delta and United Continental international revenue passenger miles flown in May, a key industry metric, were on routes across the Atlantic.“Excess capacity, particularly on north Atlantic routes, is a concern but we expect that most carriers, seeing that yields are being negatively impacted, will now trim their plans,” analyst Robin Byde said.Brokerage RBC added that the rise in capacity across Europe had outpaced GDP growth, a challenge for the industry.Airline shares have nonetheless had an exceptional run since the year’s start, with the six largest US airlines each advancing more than 20 per cent.The results have been underpinned by industry consolidation and a relentless focus on profits – fewer seats on commercial flights have flown without a paying customer.Shares of Delta declined 2.86 per cent to close at $40.72, United Continental fell 5.23 per cent to $45.26 and American Airlines slid 3.14 per cent to $42.29. Alaska Air Group also dipped 1.92 per cent to end at $96.84.Shares in Hilton Worldwide were also weaker after the recently-listed hotel operator said some of its shareholders were selling 90m shares at $23.04 a share.The price fell to $22.82, down 2.6 per cent. This compares with an initial public offering price of $20 a share when the company was listed in mid-December.Shares in Lululemon continued on a rollercoaster ride as Chip Wilson, the founder of the fitness apparel company, said he would vote against the re-election of the chairman Michael Casey and director RoAnn Costin to the boardThe retailer, which suffered a product recall on see-through yoga pants last year, fell 2.59 per cent to close at $44.30 – near the year-low of $42.28 – after the outspoken founder and 27-per-cent shareholder issued a statement on his voting intentions.Mr Wilson founded the company in Vancouver in 1998, but Mr Casey, a former Starbucks executive, had taken over as chairman after Mr Wilson resigned “to focus on other ventures”.Overall, markets ended the day slightly lower. The S&P 500 ended 6.9 points or 0.35 per cent off at 1,943.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.04 points or 0.6 per cent, to close at 16,843.88, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.06 points or 0.14 per cent, to 4,331.93.
160;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta shares lifted by capital return plan;US equities weaker on drag from financials;Delta Air Lines enhanced its status as one of the 10 best-performing stocks since the first-quarter US earnings season began last month, after the escalation of a capital return programme.The carrier expanded its share buyback plan and lifted its dividend on Tuesday, moves which it said would return another $2.75bn to investors by the end of 2016.US airlines have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of an improving US economy with rising demand allowing the likes of Delta to improve profit margins.“This next phase of our shareholder return programme reflects the board’s confidence in Delta’s ability to sustain and improve upon its already strong financial performance,” said Daniel Carp, the chairman of Delta.The share buyback plan will be boosted by $2bn and the quarterly dividend lifted to 9 cents a share from 6 cents, starting in September.Shares in Delta climbed 0.4 per cent to $37.69 by the close of trading. They had already added 15.5 per cent since the start of the first-quarter earnings season, after its earnings for the period beat forecasts.DirecTV, the satellite TV company that has been the subject of recent takeover speculation, rose on talk about its position in ongoing industry consolidation after it reported slowing subscriber growth in the US during the first quarter.The company added a net 12,000 subscribers compared with 21,000 in the first quarter of 2013.DirecTV, which competes with the likes of Comcast and Dish Network, said the slowing pace was “primarily due to a higher number of subscriber disconnections associated with the larger subscriber base”.The group, which also has satellite television businesses in Brazil and Mexico, has not escaped suggestions that it will be drawn into the rapid consolidation of the US TV industry.AT&T, the telephone and internet service provider, had approached DirecTV about a possible takeover, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.Comcast’s $45.2bn agreement to buy rival Time Warner Cable earlier this year – still subject to regulatory approval – has ignited the prospect of further consolidation as incumbents seek to combine their television and broadband offerings in a market facing disruption from online video streaming services such as Netflix.The company did not make any mention of the reported approach from AT&T in its results for the first quarter, in which profits fell to $561m, or $1.09 a share, from $690m, or $1.21 a share. Overall revenues climbed 4 per cent to $7.86bn.DirecTV shares rose 2.4 per cent to $81.74.Mosaic, one of the biggest producers of fertilisers, fared poorly despite forecasting the return of some stability to a potash market that has been in upheaval for the past year.The price of potash – a key ingredient in fertiliser – slumped after a Russian and Belarusian producer last year ended an agreement that helped sustain prices.That hit first-quarter earnings at Mosaic, though the $20bn US company forecast a brighter second half of the year.“In the second quarter, we expect improving phosphates margins, stable potash prices and strong volumes for both nutrients,” Jim Prokopanko, chief executive, said.Its first-quarter results, however, missed Wall Street expectations.Profits slumped to $217.5m, or 54 cents a share, from $379.8m, or 89 cents, in the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts had forecast that Mosaic would earn 59 cents a share.Revenues fell to $1.9bn from $2.3bn. Sales at Mosaic’s potash business fell to $733m from $825m in the same quarter last year.Shares in the producer fell 2.1 per cent to $48.66.US equities overall edged lower, led by losses in financial stocks, while the technology sector was weighed down by a sell-off in shares of Twitter as the pre-IPO stock lock-up period expired. Twitter tumbled nearly 18 per cent to close at $31.85.American International Group shares fell 4.14 per cent to $50.54, a day after it reported a 27 per cent drop in quarterly income, dragging the S&P financial index down 0.8 per cent.The S&P 500 lost 0.9 per cent to 1,867.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.78 per cent to 16,401.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.38 per cent to 4,080.76.
161;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-04-24T16:12:09Z;Virgin Atlantic chief dismisses EU fears over control of airline;;Concerns in Brussels that Delta Air Lines of the US controls Virgin Atlantic Airways were dismissed as “rubbish” by the boss of Sir Richard Branson’s UK airline.Craig Kreeger, who took over as chief executive last year, said he was certain that investigators would find nothing wrong with the way the business is managed following the acquisition of a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic by Delta last June.The European Commission this month said it had launched an inquiry into the large stakes held in four European airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, by non-EU carriers amid concerns they could amount to “effective control”.EU law prohibits a company based outside the 28-member bloc from owning more than 49.9 per cent of an airline, in line with similar restrictions on “foreign” ownership of carriers in place around the world.Mr Kreeger told the Financial Times that Virgin Atlantic had already “passed through those hurdles” with the UK authorities when its joint venture with Delta on transatlantic routes was approved last year.He said he had gone back to check with the UK regulator since the commission announced the probe and was satisfied the company’s governance would pass muster. Asked about the concerns in Brussels that Virgin Atlantic was now controlled by Delta, he replied: “That is rubbish.”Sir Richard’s Virgin Group owns 51 per cent of the company and appoints four of the nine board directors. Delta appoints three, while the two others are from Virgin Atlantic management’s team, including Mr Kreeger.Mr Kreeger’s comments came as he revealed that Virgin Atlantic, which includes Virgin Holidays, was on track to break even this year.The group generates about 65 per cent of its revenues from the UK market and has recorded losses in the three of the past five years, including the past two successive financial years.Mr Kreeger said a combination of revenue growth, driven by the joint venture with Delta that went into effect in January, and cost-cutting would see the company at least break even in 2014. “We are exactly on track.”Virgin Atlantic said pre-tax losses halved in the 12 months to the end of December 2013 to £51m, down from £102m a year earlier. The company, which is changing its financial reporting period to a calendar year from a February year-end, saw revenues rise 4.9 per cent to £2.98bn.The airline reported a sharp rise in traffic, up 12 per cent to 6,197,888 in calendar year 2013. A large chunk of that was driven by the launch in April 2013 of three UK domestic routes between its base at London’s Heathrow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.The move was designed to replace feeder traffic into its long-haul business that previously came from a deal with BMI British Midland, before that airline was acquired by arch-rival British Airways.Virgin Atlantic would not break down how much traffic the domestic service, dubbed Little Red, was providing but Mr Kreeger said it was a significant improvement on the deal with BMI. “We didn’t get that much feed from them.”
162;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-03-04T22:03:36Z;Delta soars above bumpy weather;;Delta Air Lines shares climbed to the highest level since its emergence from bankruptcy protection seven years ago after the airline reported a rise in passenger revenues in February despite severe weather that hampered results at its peers.The third-largest US carrier said passenger revenue per available seat mile – a key airline metric – rose 4 per cent in February from a year earlier as flights to Latin America and those across the US were filled to a great capacity.Delta was forced to cancel 8,000 flights during the month, adding to nearly 4,000 cancellations in January. The company said it flew 11.2m passengers in February, a 1 per cent rise from a year earlier.Wall Street analysts expect Delta to report first-quarter profits of $247m on sales of $8.9bn, 5 per cent higher than one year ago.The figures were considerably better than those reported by United Airlines days ago, which showed 22,500 cancellations in the same period.That, coupled with a late Easter and spring holiday for many schools, will crimp United passenger revenues per available seat mile between 0.5 and 2.5 per cent in the quarter.Nonetheless, airlines have been one of the bright spots for US equity markets since the year began with carriers making up four of the five best performing members of the Dow Jones Transportation Index.Delta shares advanced 5.7 per cent on Tuesday to $34.45.JC Penney shares jumped 4.1 per cent to $8.29 after rating agency Standard & Poor’s raised its outlook on the company from neutral to stable, indicating the possibility of a downgrade in the coming months has receded.Standard & Poor’s said the retailer, which has struggled since its failed turnround by former chief executive Ron Johnson, had made progress and “stabilised” its business.The rating agency noted the company’s liquidity position was “adequate” to service its debts this year.Last Wednesday, JC Penney said it expected to finish 2014 with $2bn in cash and cash equivalents, roughly the same as at the end of last year, and grow same-store sales 3 to 5 per cent in the first quarter.The company has $5.5bn in debt outstanding, including $2.5bn due in 2018.“However, we believe the company’s capital structure is unsustainable in the longer term but it does not have any meaningful maturities over the next 12 months and so we do not see a clear path to default,” analyst David Kuntz said.The rating agency affirmed JC Penney’s ‘CCC+’ rated debt.Qualcomm, the maker of chips used in mobile phones, sweetened its returns for shareholders ahead of its annual meeting today, sending its shares 3.4 per cent higher to $76.11.The San Diego-based company announced a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend from 35 to 42 cents, as well as a $5bn boost to its share buyback programme.The new scheme lifts the outstanding buyback authorisation to $7.8bn as Qualcomm purchased $2bn in shares over the past five months.“Our business continues to generate strong operating cash flows driven by the global adoption of our advanced technologies, including 3G and 4G, enabling us to continue to invest in our strategic growth opportunities,” chief executive Paul Jacobs said.Bond insurer MBIA jumped 11.4 per cent to $14.84 after it said it reduced its exposure to soured loans in the fourth quarter. Profits in the period fell 79 per cent from a year earlier to $132m.Overall, US equity markets rose sharply on Tuesday as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to step back from a threat to push further into Ukraine.The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,873.91, a new record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.4 per cent to 16,395.88. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.7 per cent to 4,351.97.
163;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;American Airlines swings to profit after merger;;Profits for the companies that merged last month to form the new American Airlines Group improved nearly fivefold in 2013 compared with 2012, underlining the increasingly benign environment for US airlines.AAG said combined 2013 net income excluding net special charges for AMR Corporation and US Airways, which merged on December 9, would have been $1.9bn on $40.4bn revenue, up from $407m net income on $38.6bn revenue on the same basis for 2012. The figures were calculated as if the two airlines had been merged for the whole of both years.A series of mergers and bankruptcies that have reduced competition and allowed airlines to cut costs have sharply improved US airlines’ profitability after a decade when most traditional airlines were barely profitable.Doug Parker, chief executive of the new, merged company, said the merger’s early returns were “very positive”.“These financial results are evidence of the strong foundation we have in place and we anticipate improving upon these results as we further integrate our operations in 2014,” he said.The figures sent the group’s shares up 1.7 per cent in premarket trading.The new, merged group’s financial figures were complicated both by the merger and the emergence from two years’ bankruptcy of AMR Corporation, parent of the old American Airlines. US Airways’ shareholders received 28 per cent of the new company, while AMR’s creditors received the remainder.Under the US’s generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), AMR recorded a $1.83bn net loss for 2013 on $26.7bn in revenues, against a $1.87bn net loss on $24.9bn in revenue for 2012.In contrast to the combined figures, the GAAP figures include US Airways’ results only for the 22 days in December after the merger with AMR. The figures were dragged down by $3.1bn of net special charges, including $2.66bn of reorganisation charges. The 2012 figures included $1.7bn of net special charges.For the three months to December 31, the two airlines’ combined passenger revenue per available seat mile – a key measure – on mainline routes improved 6.6 per cent to 12.56 cents over the combined figure for 2012’s last quarter. On regional routes, it fell 0.3 per cent to 22.48 cents.The merger has turned American Airlines Group into the US’s biggest airline operator by sales, ahead of United Airlines and Delta. Shortly before it sought bankruptcy protection in 2011, American placed the biggest commercial airliner order in history, split between the US’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus. Deliveries of the new, fuel-efficient aircraft, started last year.
164;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2014-01-21T20:10:08Z;Delta results underscore lift for sector;;Shares in Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US airlines, rose 3.2 per cent on Tuesday after the company unveiled fourth-quarter operating income nearly double last year’s level.The figures were the latest evidence of the robust recovery in US airline profitability, after more than a decade when cut-throat competition and lacklustre demand pushed many airlines into bankruptcy.The improvement in operating income – from $352m in the last quarter of 2012 to $701m last year – reflects the company’s success in improving revenue faster than operating costs. Operating revenue grew 6 per cent to $9.08bn, while operating costs rose only 2 per cent to $8.38bn.Net income grew still more dramatically. The company recorded net income of only $7m for 2012’s last quarter after interest expenses and other financial charges nearly wiped out profits. For 2013’s last quarter, the company recorded $8.5bn in net income, boosted by an $8bn benefit for the reversal of a previous tax valuation write-off.The shares were up 90 cents at $31.97 by lunchtime in New York.Richard Anderson, chief executive, said the quarter capped a “successful year” for Delta, marked by strong profitability and margin expansion and significant improvements in customer satisfaction.“We have a solid set of initiatives in place to improve our financial results, operational performance and customer satisfaction levels beyond 2013’s record levels,” Mr Anderson said.The company forecast operating profit margins of between 6 and 8 per cent for the first quarter of the current year.The tax valuation change also boosted full-year net income, to $10.5bn against $1.01bn for 2012, on revenue up 3 per cent to $37.8bn. Excluding special items, the net income would have improved from $1.1bn to $2.7bn.Passenger revenue for the quarter rose 18.5 per cent on routes to and from Latin America and rose 9.4 per cent on domestic routes in the US. Revenues fell 1.6 per cent on trans-Pacific routes.
165;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta Air Lines: flying high;Key issue is about affordability of thriving US carrier’s shares;Delta Air Lines just may have soared past a safe cruising altitude. With the notorious boom and bust cycle in aviation, it is a nice accomplishment that the key issue around Delta is not about its survival but rather the affordability of its shares. Its fourth-quarter results and 2014 outlook, announced on Tuesday, confirm the fine condition of both Delta and the US airline business. But Delta’s stock price has jumped 160 per cent since the beginning of 2013, taking its valuation multiple up by a similar proportion. And with earnings expected to be strong but growing more slowly, investors may just want to keep their seat belts fastened.Adjusting for special items, Delta’s fourth-quarter earnings were $0.65 per share, more than double the same period last year and a penny ahead of expectations. Revenue and traffic rose 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively – decent – but operating expenses only up 1.5 per cent, partly thanks to lower fuel costs, is the real story. Free cash flow for the year of $2.1bn was good enough to pay down debt, buy back $250m in shares and even initiate a modest dividend. The shares now offer 1 per cent yield.This year looks to be another good one for US airlines. The International Air Transport Association expects them to generate over $8bn in profits based on stable fuel prices and the benefits of a shrunken industry. Now that the American/US Airways tie-up is closed, UnitedContinental, American and Delta will have more than 70 per cent of the US market.The question then for investors is whether the strong outlook for airlines has already been priced in to stocks. Delta’s forward P/E ratio has jumped from 5 to 12 in the past year. The shares now trade in line with UnitedContinental, which use to enjoy a premium over Delta.

The merged company will probably be bigger by sales than both Delta Air Lines and United Continental, the company’s US rivals.In previous airline mergers, the integration of the two companies’ operating systems, fleets and crews has proved to be a significant challenge, with service to customers suffering.Mr Parker said customers would start to see some benefits from the merger in January, with the two airlines cross-recognising the top levels of each others’ frequent flyer cards.However, it would take between 18 and 24 months before the two had a single operating certificate – proof from regulators that they work as one operation.“We are taking the best of both US Airways and American Airlines to create a formidable competitor, better positioned to deliver for all of our stakeholders,” Mr Parker said. “We look forward to integrating our companies quickly and efficiently so the significant benefits of the merger can be realised.”The new company’s shares rose 2.3 per cent on their first morning on Nasdaq, from $23.95 to $24.51 by lunchtime.Monday’s transaction marks the emergence from bankruptcy of American, which sought Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in November 2011. The restructuring during bankruptcy sharply cut the company’s costs and, unusually, allowed equity holders in the old company to recover some value.American announced on Monday that each share in the old AMR Corporation would receive 0.0665 shares in the new company, valuing each AMR share at $1.63.The merger is the outcome of nearly 18 months’ negotiations between American and US Airways. The two announced the merger plan in February but in August ran into serious objections from the US Department of Justice, which said it would seek to block the deal on antitrust grounds. The two settled the DoJ’s objections on November 12, agreeing to give up take-off and landing slots at Washington’s Reagan National Airport and New York La Guardia, as well as two gates at each of several other airports.
167;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-11-14T21:00:52Z;Gulf carriers destabilise alliances;Traditional groups are under threat from fast-growing players;"The great and the good of the aviation industry gathered in Doha last month to celebrate an unusual event.With much ceremony, Qatar Airways became the first of the large Gulf-based carriers to enter a global airline alliance by joining Oneworld, led by American Airlines and British Airways.“Becoming a member of Oneworld is one of the most significant landmarks in Qatar Airways’ history,” declared Akbar Al Baker, the airline’s chief executive.This move highlights how the fast-expanding, state-controlled Gulf carriers – Emirates Airlines, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways – are no longer viewed with universal hostility by western airlines.But Emirates and Etihad are unlikely to be joining one of the three global airline alliances – Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance – in the near future. These two carriers, based in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively, are pursuing their own partnerships – actions that are destabilising the alliances and could play an influential role in reducing the importance of these groups.The alliances were established in the 1990s because foreign ownership rules often prohibited carriers from combining via cross-border mergers. Even the biggest carriers knew they could not fly to all big cities, so airlines formed alliances that in effect bolted their networks together to offer destinations worldwide – notably to business travellers.These alliances were supposed to be clubs that looked after their respective interests, but last year Qantas – a founding member of Oneworld – sent shockwaves through the industry by agreeing to form a far-reaching partnership with Emirates.Founded in 1985 and now flying to more than 130 destinations with the world’s largest fleet of wide-body passenger jets, Emirates has inflicted financial pain on long-haul carriers in the US, Europe and Asia – including Qantas. But the Australian carrier is hoping the collaboration with Emirates will play a key role in restoring its international operations to profit.At the heart of the partnership is a code-share that gives Qantas passengers a much greater choice of routes between Australia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa because they can fly on Emirates’ jets.The main casualty of the deal was Qantas’ 17-year-old partnership with British Airways although the Australian carrier, which is still a Oneworld member, continues to fly to London’s Heathrow airport.Tim Clark, president of Emirates, says the Qantas partnership is providing the Gulf carrier with additional revenue, because it is now flying more higher-spending business travellers based in Australia and New Zealand. He adds that Emirates has no interest in joining one of the global alliances, because it does not want to be “beholden” to some of the most powerful carriers within these groupings.“Emirates, if it wants to make its way against a very strong competitive force, must be smarter …It was within our DNA to chart our own destiny,” says Mr Clark.Etihad, the youngest of the big Gulf carriers, also has no plans to join one of the alliances – and arguably is doing more than Emirates to destabilise these groupings.For the past two years, Etihad has been assembling its own mini-alliance by buying minority stakes in five airlines, including Air Berlin, Germany’s second-largest carrier, which is a Oneworld member. It is close to finalising the purchase of a 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, the Indian airline.More than $750m will have been spent on equity stakes in these partner airlines once the Jet deal takes effect, and Etihad is also providing some carriers with loans to support network expansion.In part, Etihad benefits from some of the six airlines’ passengers helping to fill its jets, because the Abu Dhabi carrier has code shares with those airlines.James Hogan, Etihad chief executive, says its stakes in other airlines have put the 10-year-old carrier on a stronger competitive footing. “The only way we can build the scale we need to compete effectively is through strategic partnerships. These enable us either to access markets we do not serve in our own right or to build our presence in areas where our competitors have advantages,” he adds.So, against this backdrop of Emirates and Etihad pursuing bespoke partnership strategies, why is Qatar joining Oneworld?Qatar, which flies to 131 destinations, highlighted at last month’s joining ceremony how it would be able to offer its customers access to Oneworld’s global network.The 13 airlines in Oneworld, and their affiliate carriers, fly to 883 destinations in 151 countries.Qatar’s choice of Oneworld seems partly based on the strong working relationship between Mr Al Baker and Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways.Mr Walsh highlighted last month how British Airways’ customers would benefit from the opportunity to fly with Qatar to smaller cities in India and other parts of Asia that the UK carrier does not reach.“Qatar has a fantastic network from Doha …into areas we would not be able to serve directly,” he said.Mr Walsh’s self-confessed admiration for the Gulf carriers contrasts with concerns expressed by Lufthansa, which last year complained that it was not competing on a level playing field with these airlines, partly because they benefit from government-funded airport infrastructure.Mark Schwab, chief executive of Star, the alliance that Lufthansa helped to found, says the grouping did not seek to woo Qatar because of the risk that the Doha carrier would end up flying passengers currently with its member airlines.“We can see lots of value being transferred from our members to one of the Gulf carriers, but it’s really hard to see what they get back in return,” he adds.In truth, it is not just Emirates and Etihad that are putting pressure on the global airline alliances.There is the potential for significant tension inside the alliances, because, in recent years, some of their members have formed joint ventures. For example, American Airlines and British Airways began a transatlantic partnership in 2011 that is broadly similar to joint ventures involving Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines, and Lufthansa and United Airlines.These partnerships are more important than the broader alliances, because they are focused on the most lucrative long-haul markets and the partners share profits. Airlines in the alliances but outside these joint ventures therefore risk being reduced to minnows.But Bruce Ashby, chief executive of Oneworld, insists the alliances are not facing obsolescence because of the quasi-industry consolidation unleashed by joint ventures.“Two airlines may merge, but you are not going to merge with all of the Oneworld partners into some sort of mega-Godzilla airline,” he says. “There’s still a pretty big role for the general concept of alliances.”However, Rigas Doganis, visiting professor at the UK’s Cranfield University and a former head of Athens-based Olympic Airways, says the global alliances are “very unstable” because of the airline joint ventures and the strategies of Emirates and Etihad.“The partnerships being made by the Gulf carriers are destabilising the alliances by changing loyalties; and loyalties within the alliances are being undermined by joint ventures which create a two-tier membership structure,” he says."
168;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-10-31T20:29:14Z;US airline regulator relaxes rules on using gadgets in flight;;Like passengers who have seen the “fasten seat belts” sign turned off, airlines raced to ditch restrictions on the use of electronics after US regulators relaxed rules that have forced millions of passengers to stow tablets, smartphones and ereaders for take-off.Delta Air Lines said it expected to have clearance as soon as Friday to apply the new rules on 570 of its mainline domestic aircraft, while JetBlue said it would implement changes “immediately” once it received approval.The airlines powered down their old rules after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday a report had shown most commercial aircraft could withstand radio interference from personal electronics. Provided airlines could show their aircraft would cope safely, it was safe to use small, handheld devices from “gate to gate” during flights, the FAA said.However, passengers can still expect a stern look from a flight attendant if they try to make a phone call. The FAA gave no consideration to allowing use of gadgets communicating with outside voice or data networks. The signals involved with such use are stronger and more likely to interfere with aircraft systems – and regulation of such networks is beyond the FAA’s remit.Anthony Foxx, US transportation secretary, said the decision reflected both the US government’s commitment to safety and consumers’ increasing desire to use their devices during “all phases” of their flights.“These guidelines reflect input from passengers, pilots, manufacturers and flight attendants, and I look forward to seeing airlines implement these much-anticipated guidelines in the near future,” he said.Nevertheless, harassed business travellers are still likely to have some respite from answering the boss’s emails. Delta said its aircraft WiFi systems would start working only above 10,000 feet – which is also the current lower limit for use of electronic devices. Other airlines are likely to take a similar approach.There would still be rare instances, such as a landing in low visibility, when passengers would be asked to turn off all devices, the FAA warned.However, once an airline had verified its fleet’s tolerance of electronic devices, it could generally let passengers use handheld, lightweight electronic devices – such as tablets, ereaders, and smartphones – at all altitudes.The rules could push passengers towards iPads and other tablet computers. The FAA said larger computers such as laptops would still need to be stowed for take-off and landing.The Global Business Travel Association said business travellers would applaud the FAA’s recommendations. “These busy road warriors will take every opportunity to stay connected with their customers and partners – the key to success,” it said.

Unsatisfied with one source? Add another. Still, it is tricky to ignore the US jobs report, which sputtered out its September reading on Tuesday. Even allowing that the report is noisy, a slowing trend is evident. On a three-month rolling average, the US is adding 140,000 jobs a month; six months ago the rate was more than 200,000.If jobs growth is weakening, though, some companies are managing to do well – and not just innovative companies, such as Netflix, which take share in sluggish markets. Tuesday brought strong earnings reports from two companies in mature, competitive industries that are sensitive to consumer spending. Delta Air Lines saw passenger miles grow slightly and revenue per mile tick up; total passenger revenue was up 7 per cent as a result. Whirlpool’s appliances sales in North America rose 11 per cent on a unit basis. Shares of the companies – which do not look terribly expensive – popped.So certain stocks are worth owning, despite a long rally and slowing GDP growth. In aggregate, however, company performance confirms the jobs report. Net margins on S&P 500 companies may touch their 2006 record of 9.6 per cent this quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. This has protected earnings growth. However, sales at S&P 500 companies are unlikely to grow at all between the second and third quarters.Stock pickers will find opportunities in companies such as Delta and Whirlpool. Bulls on stocks generally must believe one of three things: (a) margins can exceed record levels (b) sales growth will pick up, despite what the jobs report suggests, or (c) monetary policy can keep stock valuations expanding indefinitely.

170;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-10-22T15:59:18Z;Buoyant Delta earnings leap by a third;US airline’s turnround sends shares up 4% on strong traffic outlook;Shares in Delta Air Lines, one of the US’s two big legacy airlines by sales, climbed more than 4 per cent after it announced third-quarter net income had jumped 31 per cent to $1.37bn and sounded a positive note about traffic in the fourth quarter.The strong figures – struck on operating revenue up 6 per cent to $10.5bn – were the latest evidence of how US airline profitability has benefited from recent years’ reduction of cut-throat competition as a result of a series of mergers.Airlines have proved far better in recent years at passing on fuel and other rising costs to passengers in ticket prices than previously.Richard Anderson, chief executive, said the figures reflected the progress the company had made over the past five years, since Delta announced plans to merge with Northwest Airlines to form the current company.“We have even more exciting opportunities ahead of us as we build a better airline for our customers, employees and investors,” Mr Anderson said.Passenger revenue increased 10.7 per cent on domestic US routes, 9 per cent on transatlantic routes and 16 per cent on Latin American routes but declined 5 per cent on trans-Pacific services.Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, said there had been a particularly strong performance on services to and from Atlanta, New York and London, and predicted continued buoyant conditions for the rest of the year.“The revenue environment appears solid through the end of the year, including strong holiday bookings, and we expect to continue to build on the revenue premium we deliver versus the industry,” Mr Bastian said.The US Department of Justice pointed to airlines’ recovering profitability in August as one of the main reasons to seek to block the proposed merger between AMR Corporation, American Airlines’ parent, and US Airways. The merger would create a new company rivalling in size both Delta and United Continental, its rival, which has similar revenues.Operating expenses were only 4 per cent higher than in last year’s third quarter, helped by a 4 per cent fall to $474m in aircraft maintenance costs and a 28 per cent fall to $47m in aircraft leasing costs. Both reflect Delta’s renewal of its fleet, which is allowing it to dispose of leased aircraft and reducing the cost of keeping aircraft flying.Costs for restructuring and other one-off costs fell 29 per cent to $106m.The $1.8bn in cash flow that the company generated in the quarter had allowed it to reduce its debt to $9.9bn – below its initial $10bn target. It would press on to a new target of $7bn, Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer, said.Diluted earnings per share grew 29 per cent to $1.59.The shares were up 3.24 per cent to $25.49 at the close in New York.
171;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-09-23T21:00:46Z;Delta and Virgin joint venture plans approved;Airlines set to co-ordinate transatlantic routes;US regulators on Monday approved plans for a joint venture on transatlantic routes between Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic.The US Department of Transportation is granting Delta and Virgin immunity from domestic antitrust laws to enable them to establish a partnership that will operate on routes between the US and the UK.The two airlines expect to start co-ordinating their transatlantic schedules from next March, enabling them to offer more flights to customers, in a joint venture that should provide stronger competition for a similar partnership between British Airways and American Airlines.Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic has been running up losses for the past two years, and the joint venture with Delta is an important element of the UK airline’s turnround plan.Delta decided to establish the partnership partly to increase its presence at London’s Heathrow airport, which airlines are keen to fly to because it attracts large volumes of higher spending business travellers.The US Department of Transportation said: “We have concluded that, overall, the . . . joint venture [between Delta and Virgin] will be pro-competitive and . . . likely to generate substantial public benefits to the travelling public.”In June, Delta paid $360m to purchase a 49 per cent stake in Virgin, buying shares held by Singapore Airlines.Delta and Virgin announced a code-share agreement at that time, enabling the UK airline to offer customers a much broader range of US destinations.Delta and Virgin applied for antitrust immunity for their joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia. The Franco-Dutch and Italian carriers already have a partnership with Delta on routes between the US and Europe.Virgin said in April it was interested in the possibility of a joint venture Air France-KLM and Alitalia on routes to Asia, the Middle East and Africa, although no final decisions have been taken.

The S&P Dow Jones Indices released the news on Friday after the market close, sending the shares up in after-hours trading. The company will replace BMC Software after the market closes on Tuesday.A listing is considered beneficial for a stock, as its inclusion means funds tracking the S&P 500 must buy up shares.Delta has risen more than 83 per cent in the year to date, as improvement in its financial position has allowed the company to resume dividend payments.Southwest Airlines, the only other carrier on the S&P, was up 1.3 per cent to $13.27.Strength from Asia helped send US materials and industrials stocks higher, which helped boost the S&P 500 by 1 per cent to 1,671.71 – its best day since August 1.The materials sector was up 1.5 per cent, as strong Chinese trade data helped spread optimism about the world’s second-largest economy.Fertiliser Mosaic Company was among the strongest risers, up 5.1 per cent to $44.31. Iron miner Cliffs Natural Resources gained 6.1 per cent to $23.18, and US Steel was 3.5 per cent higher at $19.53.The news also drove Caterpillar to lead the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The construction equipment producer was 2.6 per cent higher at $85.59, while the Dow added 0.9 per cent to break back above the 15,000 level to 15,063.12.Alcoa also benefited from the rally, up 2 per cent to $8.08.The Nasdaq Composite Index was better by 1.3 per cent to 3,706.18.Apple, the most-heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, was up 1.6 per cent at $506.17, taking it back above the $500 mark the day before Tuesday’s events. Analysts anticipate the company will be announcing new iPhones as well as a possible partnership with China Mobile.Online travel company Expedia rose 1.9 per cent to $50.64 after investment bank Lazard upgraded its rating on the company to “buy” from “neutral”.

The company ticked down after announcing that it would pursue a secondary share offering worth $1bn.However, investors do not appear too concerned, as the company is up 3.7 per cent in the past five days and 116.9 per cent higher on the year to date.Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the CBOE Volatility Index – known as the Vix – rose in early trading but finished the day 1.7 per cent lower at 15.58.The Vix was quiet for much of the summer, but has begun to awaken as investors return from vacations to concerns about Syria, a forthcoming US debt ceiling debate, and the prospect of the Fed “tapering” quantitative easing.The lacklustre performance of the S&P in August has given way to five consecutive positive sessions, taking the index back above the 1,660 level. The index is now 17.2 per cent higher for the year.The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P sits at 16.01, while its Shiller PE ratio (prices compared to 10 years of inflation-adjusted earnings) is at 23.93. While those are not alarming levels, the index’s performance could foretell a rotation out of the US, said Meb Faber, chief investment officer at Cambria Investment Management.“The biggest story has been the outperformance of the US this year,” he said. “A lot of the foreign markets have struggled this year . . . However, now it looks like it may have started to change in the past two months. A lot of foreign indices have started to perform much better.”“Prior to that, the US was the second-most expensive in the entire world,” he added. “More importantly to me, it goes to show how cheap the rest of the world is.”

174;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-08-18T11:51:41Z;Chief of Virgin Atlantic fuels profit hopes in joint venture;;The new chief executive of Virgin Atlantic Airways has expressed a “high” level of confidence that the UK airline can return to profit in 2014-15, and remain a significant player in global aviation.In an interview with the Financial Times, Craig Kreeger – the first American head of Sir Richard Branson’s airline – says he is looking to put Virgin on a course for sustainable profits through its planned transatlantic joint venture with Delta Air Lines of the US, and the use of more fuel efficient aircraft.Virgin Atlantic Airways, founded by Sir Richard in 1984, has run up operating losses over the past two years, but Mr Kreeger believes he has a comprehensive turnround plan that is buttressed by the long-haul airline’s high-profile brand and reputation for good customer service.“I think we can be profitable [in 2014-15],” he says, adding that his target to restore profitability at the airline also applies Virgin Atlantic Limited, the holding company for the carrier and Virgin Holidays, the tour operator. “You need to have sustainable, good returns and I think we have a plan that if we continue to [do] the things we’re doing, it should get us to a sustainable model.”Virgin Atlantic Airways generates a majority of its revenue in the UK, and it has struggled with the fragile British economy, which has damped demand for air travel.The airline has also been heavily penalised by high fuel prices because many its long-range passenger jets – such as the Airbus A340 – have four engines. These aircraft consume more fuel than the new generation of widebody aircraft, led by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which have two engines.But arguably the biggest problem for Virgin was the start in 2011 of British Airways’ joint venture with American Airlines, where the two airlines collaborate on selling and scheduling their flights between the UK and the US.This made BA a far more powerful competitor on Virgin’s core transatlantic routes – particularly in the lucrative corporate market where business travellers appreciate the convenience of high frequency services between London and New York.Mr Kreeger, who grew up in Sacramento, California, knows all about the potency of BA’s transatlantic partnership – before he joined Virgin in February, he spent 27 years at American Airlines, including running its international operations.Virgin has responded by unveiling plans for a partnership with Delta, which in June bought a 49 per cent stake in the UK airline.The two airlines intend to co-ordinate their UK-US services in much the same way as BA and American Airlines do, in a joint venture that should start with annual sales of $3bn.By tying itself to Delta, Mr Kreeger believes Virgin has a big opportunity to increase revenue.He says the joint venture should enable Virgin to fly more Americans, as well as provide its UK customers with more destinations in the US by tapping Delta’s domestic route network.Mr Kreeger is optimistic the partnership will be approved by the US Department of Transportation this autumn, even though other regulators last week filed a lawsuit to try and stop the proposed merger between US Airways and AMR, American Airlines’ parent, because of concerns that reduced domestic competition will increase fares.“[The joint venture between Delta and Virgin] is good for consumers,” he says. “It’s going to provide a great competitive alternative to what’s out there.”The other big change to Virgin’s business model was the airline’s move into short-haul flying in April, when it started services between London’s Heathrow airport and Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.The move was necessitated by BA’s merger last year with BMI British Midland, because the latter airline’s short-haul jets had previously been an important source of transfer passengers at Heathrow for Virgin’s long-range aircraft.Mr Kreeger says Virgin’s short-haul services are progressing satisfactorily, but have “room to grow”.Meanwhile, the airline should be able to reduce one of its biggest operating costs – fuel – when it takes delivery of the first of 16 Dreamliners it has on order in September next year.The Dreamliner burns less fuel than current generation aircraft partly because it is lighter, and Mr Kreeger describes the aircraft as a “real game changer” – in spite of some initial setbacks including problems with its batteries.He says the Dreamliner will provide Virgin with some “modest growth opportunities”, adding the airline is interested in doing more flying to the US and Asia, as well as entering the Latin American market.
175;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-08-14T17:47:58Z;US airlines are ‘hyper-competitive’, trade group insists;Industry is ‘hyper-competitive’ Airlines for America insists;The airline industry remains “hyper-competitive” and airfares are a bargain, the US industry’s main trade body said a day after the US Department of Justice attacked the industry’s behaviour.Airlines for America was responding to warnings by Bill Baer, head of the DoJ’s antitrust division, that the US airline market was not functioning “as competitively as it ought to be”. The DoJ is seeking to block the proposed merger between US Airways and AMR Corporation, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines.“The airline industry has always been hyper-competitive and consumers have benefited, as airfare remains a bargain and has not kept pace with inflation over time,” the trade body said.Airlines for America said the DoJ’s complaint about the proposed merger had been “highly speculative” about airline’s pricing policies, which it claimed showed evidence of a lack of desire to compete.Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the DoJ’s stance against the merger signalled a “tougher line” on the airlines.“I think the concern is much broader than just this merger,” he said. “It seems to me the DoJ may be signalling a policy to take a much tougher line on the airlines, especially where consumers are involved.”The DoJ listed examples of a number of routes, including Miami to Cincinnati, where it said the biggest three traditional, full-service airlines – United Airlines, Delta and American – were not competing aggressively on price. US Airways – fifth-largest by sales behind the big three – and low-cost Southwest Airlines competed more fiercely with its advantage fares, however.The DoJ said it was vital to keep US Airways in the market competing with the other full-service airlines and that, if there were only three large full-service airlines, they would not want to compete with each other.Airlines for America said that consumers decided day by day what they were willing to pay.“Pricing in the airline industry is incredibly transparent to consumers,” it said.Over the past five years, the DoJ has approved three significant airline mergers – between Delta and Northwest Airlines, United and Continental and Southwest and AirTran.Airlines for America said the DoJ had found all of those would boost competition and expected the department eventually to conclude an AMR/US Airways merger would do the same.Delta Air Lines and United both declined to comment.
176;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-08-13T22:30:04Z;Department of Justice takes wind from under airlines’ wings;;As they negotiated their complex merger plan last year, Doug Parker and Tom Horton, the chief executives respectively of US Airways and American Airlines’ parent, were clear about a potential deal’s benefits.Both touted the advantages of a wave of consolidation over recent years that has cut the number of large carriers in the US market from eight to five. Both said the curtailing of previously ruinous competition had allowed airlines to operate more reliably profitably, earning far better returns for investors – and that their merger, which would leave only four big carriers, would improve matters still further.The suit that the US Department of Justice issued on Tuesday agreed with much of the two men’s analysis of the deal and past mergers, but with a crucial difference – the DoJ says the consolidation wave has served consumers poorly, costing them hundreds of millions of dollars extra annually. The suit quotes extensively from the men’s own claims about the deal.The looming battle between the DoJ, US Airways and AMR Corporation, American’s bankrupt parent, promises to revolve around that central point. The airlines are set to argue that the merger would improve service for customers while earning them only reasonable returns.Tom Horton told his staff in a letter that the company had worked hard at making that case to the DoJ.“We have maintained that the merger is complementary (only 12 overlapping routes), that it provides significant customer benefits and that it enhances competition,” Mr Horton wrote.However, Bill Baer, assistant attorney-general for the DoJ’s antitrust division, insisted both airlines were in a position to be “competitive, aggressive and successful” on their own and passengers would suffer if they merged.“We have no problem with airlines being profitable,” Mr Baer said. “What drives this challenge is the risk that consumers will be paying a lot more if these two airlines are allowed to combine.”Among the clearest examples of a market that might suffer in the event of a merger is an airport just across the Potomac River from the offices of the DoJ staff deciding on the merger’s fate. A merged new American Airlines would control 63 per cent of the nonstop routes served from Washington’s Reagan National Airport and 69 per cent of the take-off and landing slots.“By allowing control of that many slots, a merger would prevent other carriers such as Jet Blue from competing at national airport,” Mr Baer said.Yet Mr Baer made clear that the DoJ was unlikely to approve a merger if the parties simply came up with a plan to increase competition at Reagan Airport and other problem areas after a merger.Asked about why the DoJ had approved previous mergers – including the combination in 2008 of Delta and Northwest Airlines and the 2010 merger between United and Continental – Mr Baer said the DoJ had learnt more during its investigation of the latest request about the previous mergers’ effects.Those deals mean that the US domestic airline market is far more concentrated than the international markets where the two airlines also operate. The European Commission ruled on August 5 that the merged company would have continued to face robust competition on transatlantic routes, its most important international market.The European Commission approved the merger on August 5 with only minor conditions about control of landing slots at London Heathrow and the future of direct London to Philadelphia market.“As we look at the market as it’s functioning today, it’s not functioning as competitively as it ought to be,” Mr Baer said of the US domestic market.Such language suggests a change in climate for airline mergers after years when the DoJ largely accepted airlines’ pleas to be allowed to merge to benefit from economies of scale.The DoJ had made some “very strong arguments,” Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said.He doubted the airlines’ lawyers would succeed in combating the DoJ’s case.“There have probably already been negotiations, so I’m not optimistic,” he said.

London mayor Boris Johnson is proposing a four-runway airport in the Thames estuary, to cost the taxpayer at least £25bn.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Passengers can win when competition is allowed / From Mr Stewart WingateAirlines would leave Heathrow if push came to shove / From Mr Andrew Mitchell
178;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-07-25T19:00:18Z;Fuller aircraft and lower costs buoy United;;United Continental, the US’s biggest airline by revenue, confirmed the solid return to profitability of the country’s air carriers when it announced second-quarter net income boosted by fuller aircraft and declining fuel costs.United’s net income rose 38 per cent to $469m compared with last year’s second quarter, on revenue up 0.6 per cent to $10bn.The figures come a day after Delta Air Lines, the US’s second-biggest carrier, reported $685m net income for the quarter – compared with a $168m net loss last time – and US Airways reported $287m net income, down from $306m in 2012’s second quarter.Airlines are benefiting from the lower costs that many achieved through Chapter 11 bankruptcies over the last decade. A wave of mergers between carriers has also reduced competition and produced substantial synergies.During the quarter, United – which was formed through the 2010 merger between United and Continental Airlines – demonstrated the discipline in managing capacity that many observers believe the mergers have produced. It cut available seat miles during the quarter by 2.1 per cent, faster than the 1.7 per cent fall in revenue passenger miles for the quarter. As a result, 84.7 per cent of space on flights in the quarter was full, a record for the second quarter.Jim Compton, chief revenue officer, said the airline expected capacity to fall by between 0.25 per cent and 0.75 per cent over the year.“We continue to define a network to drive returns by introducing new services to meet demand and eliminating unprofitable routes,” he said.However, United’s operating expenses for the quarter fell only 1.4 per cent to $9.23bn despite a 10 per cent fall in fuel costs to $3.07bn, thanks to increases in most other costs. As a result, analysts on an investor call asked how the company intended to close the profit margin gap with its competitors.John Rainey, chief financial officer, said the company’s top financial priorities for the year were to operate more efficiently and meet its return-on-invested-capital target.“Our performance in the second quarter puts us in good position to achieve these goals,” Mr Rainey said.United particularly stressed improvements in its service reliability. The airline suffered severe service disruption at points during 2012, which helped to push the company into loss for the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year.The company said its 76.7 per cent on-time arrival rate in the second quarter was “competitive” given what it said was an unusually high incidence of bad weather in the quarter.“We are consistently running a reliable airline with good customer service and are now focused on becoming even more dependable and your carrier of choice,” Mr Compton said.Domestic passenger revenue was 3.8 per cent down on last year’s second quarter at $3.31bn. On international routes, revenue on the Atlantic was up 4.7 per cent, while it fell 5.1 per cent on trans-Pacific routes.Earnings per share increased 36 per cent to $1.21. Following the conference call, United’s shares fell 4.66 per cent to $33.34.
179;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta secures Virgin Atlantic stake;;Delta Air Lines finalised its purchase of a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic as the two carriers unveiled a code-share agreement on Monday that will enable Sir Richard Branson’s UK airline to offer customers a much bigger range of US destinations.Delta is paying $360m for the Virgin stake it is buying off Singapore Airlines, after the deal – first proposed in December – last week secured regulatory clearance in Washington and Brussels.The two carriers are now awaiting separate approval from the US Department of Transportation to start a joint venture coordinating their pricing and schedules on transatlantic routes, in a move that will enable them to provide stronger competition for a similar partnership between British Airways and American Airlines.Delta’s tie-up with Virgin, where Sir Richard retains a 51 per cent stake, should bolster the UK carrier on its core transatlantic routes.Virgin’s loss before tax and exceptional items widened from £98.6m in 2011-12 to £128.4m in 2012-13, which was blamed on the weak economy and last year’s Olympic Games, and it is seeking to return to profit in 2015.Craig Kreeger, Virgin’s chief executive since January, said the partnership with Delta would enable the UK airline to offer its customers a much broader network of destinations in North America. “It is a big part of our recovery plan,” he added.Delta, the second-largest US carrier by revenue, has invested in Virgin partly because of the UK carrier’s relatively strong presence at London’s capacity-constrained Heathrow airport – a key gateway from the US into Europe.Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, expressed confidence the planned joint venture with Virgin would secure clearance from the US Department of Transportation without the need for concessions.“We are confident given the opportunity to bring more choice and greater competition into a market already served by a much larger joint venture – namely the American Airlines and British Airways alliance,” he said.The code-share agreement between Delta and Virgin, which takes effect next month, is a business arrangement between the two airlines that means they jointly market some of their flights.One of the two airlines will operate a particular flight, but both will sell tickets for this route.Virgin will place its code on Delta routes, in a move that means the number of US destinations that the UK carrier can offer its customers will increase from 10 to 55.Delta, meanwhile, will put its code on Virgin routes, so that the Atlanta-based carrier’s customers will be able to fly from the US to Heathrow on 23 different daily flights, compared with nine currently.
180;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-06-16T21:15:21Z;Consolidation: Concentration of carriers puts collapse on Europe agenda;Lufthansa’s decision to suspend its dividend illustrates just how tough the market has become, says Andrew Parker;For investors in US airlines, a near-decade of consolidation is starting to bring tangible benefits. Last month, Delta Air Lines, the second-largest carrier by revenue, announced plans to issue a dividend this year– the first such payout since 2003.Contrast this with Europe where Lufthansa, the region’s largest carrier by sales, in February proposed suspending its dividend. European airlines are struggling with a prolonged economic downturn in many of their home countries, but Lufthansa’s move also underlined how cut-throat competition weighs heavily on the region’s carriers.In the US, consolidation that goes back to the merger of US Airways and America West in 2005 is set to culminate by the end of September with the expected tie-up between American Airlines and US Airways. The large eight airlines of 10 years ago are on course to become the big four, with reduced competition meaning that the remaining players have greater pricing power – the ability to raise fares after years of slashing ticket prices during market share grabs.This level of market concentration means that US airline consolidation is likely to be mainly done. In Europe, there is a case for more mergers because there are still far too many airlines, but it may well be that the region sees a series of carrier collapses rather than deals.Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG), which was created from the merger of British Airways and Iberia with the intent of becoming a leading industry consolidator, said last month that he saw no opportunities in the short to medium term.“It’s clear there are a lot of airlines in play,” he said. “Most of these are peripheral airlines that we can’t see adding any value to the IAG group – or, in all honesty, adding any value to pretty much anybody. So we don’t have any proposals to do anything.”The big European airline deals have already happened. Before the creation of IAG in 2011, Air France merged with KLM of the Netherlands in 2004, while Lufthansa combined with Swiss in 2005 and Austrian Airlines in 2009.These three large flag carrier groups are now busy restructuring their short-haul operations, some of which are lossmaking because of intense competition from low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet.The budget airlines show no sign of letting up in their quest to increase market share at the expense of the flag carriers – Ryanair placed an order for 175 narrow-body aircraft worth $15.6bn at catalogue prices from Boeing in March, and easyJet is expected to announce a large, single-aisle jet purchase soon.Against this backdrop, where Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are preoccupied with cutting costs rather than doing deals, even smaller flag carriers with a potentially valuable niche have struggled to attract buyers.The Portuguese government last December shelved the privatisation of Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, the country’s flag carrier and one of Europe’s leading airlines flying to Brazil, after only attracting one bid.IAG and Lufthansa decided against making binding offers, in spite of both having an interest in increasing their presence in the fast-growing Latin American market.Lisbon is expected to try to revive the privatisation, but even if TAP is acquired, such a deal could well be outnumbered by carrier collapses.Meanwhile, with many countries having foreign ownership rules that prevent airline consolidation at a global level, the most notable development over the past year has been the tie-up between Qantas and Emirates Airlines.This partnership – based on a codeshare arrangement and announced last September – is providing the Australian flag carrier with the opportunity to try to restore its international operations to profit by scrapping lossmaking flights. Qantas is flying to Emirates’ Dubai hub, where passengers can transfer on to the Gulf carrier’s wide range of flights to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.This agreement also highlights how the relatively young, state-controlled Gulf carriers are no longer viewed as enemy number one by longer-established airlines. After years of intense competition, some Asian and European carriers are forging deals with the fast-expanding Gulf airlines.Last October, Air France-KLM, which reported a €1.2bn net loss in 2012, unveiled a code-share agreement with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways. Later that month, the oneworld global airline alliance – led by British Airways and American Airlines – announced that Doha-based Qatar Airways was joining. It is the first of the big Gulf carriers to join an alliance.Lufthansa, the only large European flag carrier not to reach a deal with one of these Gulf carriers, has been considering the case for a partnership with Turkish Airlines, the fast-growing Istanbul-based carrier.“The combination of our two strong markets and a strong cultural fit …could make co-operation attractive if both partners can participate,” said Simone Menne, Lufthansa’s finance director.
181;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;IAG paves way for first dividend;;International Airlines Group on Tuesday paved the way towards a maiden payout to shareholders when British Airways, its UK subsidiary, struck an agreement with the trustees to its pension schemes.The deal would provide “the ability for British Airways to move to normal dividend payments over time,” IAG said. However, no timeframe was put on British Airways paying a dividend to IAG.Shares in the airline group, formed through the merger of British Airways and Iberia in 2011, closed down 3.8 per cent at 257p.IAG has previously hinted at the possibility of a maiden dividend in 2015, without making a commitment – and much could depend on the group’s contentious plan to turn round Iberia, which has been running up large losses.British Airways is generating earnings, although operating profit fell last year compared to 2011, and Keith Williams, head of the UK flag carrier, told analysts last November that the airline was seeking to put itself in a position to pay dividends by 2015.Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “The provisions of the agreement between British Airways and the pension trustees would certainly seem to clear the way towards IAG paying a maiden dividend.”He added that the May announcement by Delta Air Lines, the second-largest US carrier by revenue, to restart dividend payments this year for the first time since 2003 had raised investor expectations that IAG and Lufthansa should be generating enough cash flow to make annual payouts to shareholders.Lufthansa proposed suspending dividend payments in February as it announced plans to buy new aircraft.British Airways, like Lufthansa, has paid dividends in the past – the last one being in 2008.In 2010, British Airways agreed it would not pay dividends for at least two years after the UK carrier disclosed a £3.7bn combined deficit in its two defined benefit pension schemes at March 2009.The dividend move also came after the pensions regulator pressed British Airways to make sure IAG could not extract assets from the UK carrier at the expense of members of the two retirement schemes.The latest actuarial valuation of the schemes found a combined deficit of £3.3bn at March 2012, and British Airways is to make annual payments into the schemes worth £360m over a period to 2026, mainly to fix this hole.These payments are broadly in line with previous ones agreed between the company and the trustees, which were based on a £3.2bn combined deficit in the schemes at March 2010.British Airways will make additional payments into the schemes if its gross cash position exceeds £2bn. It stood at £1.7bn at March 31 this year.
182;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-05-16T16:46:34Z;Virgin Atlantic chief vows return to profit;;Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic’s new chief executive, on Thursday pledged to return Sir Richard Branson’s airline to profit in 2015 after it recorded losses for the second year running.Virgin Atlantic Limited – a group that includes the airline and Virgin Holidays, the tour operator – reported a pre-tax loss of £69.9m for the year to February 28, compared to £80.2m in 2011-12, but this performance was flattered by one-off items.Virgin Atlantic’s loss before tax and exceptional items widened from £98.6m in 2011-12 to £128.4m in 2012-13, though the long-haul airline blamed this on the weak economy and last year’s Olympic Games.Mr Kreeger, who became Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive in January after moving from American Airlines, said the Olympic Games had “severely dented” demand for business travel.“Despite these challenging circumstances, the enduring strength of the Virgin Atlantic brand has not wavered . . . Virgin Atlantic has a programme of measures going forward which I am confident will improve our financial performance considerably in 2013-14 and put us firmly on the road to a return to profit in spring 2015,” he added.For the past two years, Virgin has been grappling with tougher competition on its core transatlantic routes after British Airways formed a joint venture with American Airlines, although Sir Richard’s airline is striking back with a proposed partnership with Delta Air Lines of the US.Virgin Atlantic is hoping to secure regulatory approval for the Delta joint venture before the end of the year.Meanwhile, Virgin in March launched Little Red, its first-ever foray into UK short-haul flying, in an effort to secure passengers who will transfer on to its long-haul operations at Heathrow.Some analysts have questioned whether Virgin will develop the scale to run a profitable short-haul business, but the airline felt compelled into the move after losing transfer passengers from BMI British Midland, the carrier bought last year by International Airlines Group, British Airways’ parent.Mr Kreeger is also overseeing a £45m cost saving programme that is focused on making Virgin’s back-office functions more efficient, and could involve some job losses among the airline’s 9,580-strong workforce.Virgin Atlantic Limited reported revenue of £2.9bn for 2012-13, up 5 per cent on 2011-12, as the number of passengers carried by the airline increased 3.5 per cent to 5.5m.The group’s results – and those of the airline – were flattered by a £35.4m exceptional item that was previously a provision for a possible fine by regulators investigating alleged price fixing by Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific.Last December, the Office of Fair Trading said it would take no action in this case, which meant Virgin Atlantic Limited could reverse the provision in its 2012-13 profit and loss statement.
183;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta Air Line dividend promise signals robust financial health;;Delta Air Lines underlined its growing financial strength on Wednesday when it announced that it planned to resume dividend payments for the first time since 2003.The company, the US’s second-biggest airline by revenues, also said the dividend was part of a plan to return more than $1bn cash to shareholders over the next three years.The plan illustrates the rapid recovery in the health of many large US airlines in the wake of a series of mergers that have cut competition and encouraged financial discipline. Delta merged in 2008 with Northwest Airlines. Like all other large US legacy airlines, it also spent a period in the past decade – between September 2005 and April 2007 – in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Daniel Carp, the company’s chairman, said Delta’s financial performance and balance sheet had strengthened considerably over the past five years and it believed it was now in a position to begin returning cash to shareholders.The company, whose turnover is only marginally behind that of United Continental, the US market leader, will resume dividend payments with a 6 cent payment on September 10. The board has also authorised a $500m programme of share repurchases, to be completed by September 2016. The two measures together should return more than $1bn to shareholders over three years.“The board’s shareholder return programme makes a long-term commitment to our shareholders with the implementation of an ongoing quarterly dividend, while also providing flexibility to return additional cash to shareholders through the share repurchase programme,” Mr Carp said.The resumption of dividend payments comes after a sharp reduction in Delta’s debt. It expects to bring adjusted net debt, which stood at $17bn in 2009, down to $10bn this year. It expects to reduce the level further, to $7bn.As the airline market has grown more disciplined, airlines have found it easier to pass on to passengers and freight customers the increasing cost of fuel. Before recent mergers, during fuel price spikes, many airlines cut ticket prices to try to keep market share.The last big legacy airline not to have gone through a Chapter 11 restructuring and significant merger – American Airlines – entered Chapter 11 in November 2011. It is due to emerge from bankruptcy later this year in a merger with US Airways, its smaller rival.Richard Anderson, chief executive, said the company’s strategy had created a “solid financial foundation” for the company, as well as tremendous improvements in its fleet, facilities, products and technology and “top-notch operational reliability”.The company plans to make $2bn to $2.5bn in capital investments over the next five years, mostly on new aircraft. Delta, which has the oldest fleet of any large US airline, is awaiting delivery of 100 737-900ER aircraft from Boeing to replace its oldest, least efficient aircraft.“The capital deployment plan unveiled today furthers our commitment to becoming the airline of choice for our employees, customers and shareholders,” Mr Anderson said.
184;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-04-25T16:55:02Z;United Continental losses narrow slightly after capacity cuts;Airline bucks wider improvements in US industry;United Continental, the biggest US airline by revenues, said its losses only slightly narrowed from a year ago despite aggressive capacity cuts.The airline, which last year suffered severe reliability problems in June and July, reported a net loss of $417m, or $1.26 a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $448m, or $1.36 a share, in the same period last year, on revenue up 1.4 per cent to $8.72bn.A 12.1 per cent increase in salaries and related costs more than offset a 5.5 per cent fall in fuel costs, pushing operating expenses up 1.3 per cent to $8.99bn. This came despite a 4.9 per cent cut in available seat miles against the same time last year, including a 10.2 per cent cut on transatlantic routes.Jeff Smisek, United chief executive, conceded that it had been a “difficult quarter financially”.The company had nevertheless recorded its best first-quarter punctuality performance in more than a decade, with 81 per cent of flights arriving within 14 minutes of the scheduled time.“Our co-workers pulled together in the first quarter to significantly improve our operational performance and customer service despite challenging weather and high load factors,” Mr Smisek said.United’s results contrasted with those of Southwest Airlines, the US’s biggest low-cost airline. It announced first quarter net income of $59m, down from $98m in last year’s first quarter, on operating revenues up 2.3 per cent to $4.08bn. However, last year’s first quarter benefited from $116m of net favourable special items, a figure that fell to $6m in this year’s first quarter.Gary Kelly, chief executive, said the “significant year-over-year improvement” excluding special items resulted form record first-quarter revenues and a better-than-expected cost performance.Southwest’s performance reflected the same positive trend as the results on Tuesday from Delta Air Lines, which on Tuesday reported a net profit for the first quarter, normally the industry’s slowest.At United, the big capacity cuts drove up passenger revenue per available seat mile – a key airline metric – by 5.9 per cent, despite a 1.2 per cent decline in revenue passenger miles. Jim Compton, chief revenue officer, put that down partly to the improved operational performance.“We are encouraged by our unit revenue performance this quarter, and we are working hard to build on our overall revenue progress this year,” he said.The capacity cuts meant that costs per available seat mile rose 7.2 per cent. John Rainey, chief financial officer, insisted that the company was focused on operating more efficiently.“We are building an infrastructure to achieve our return on invested capital goals and generate long-term returns,” he said.The net income figure included $92m in special charges, including $70m in costs for the 2010 merger of United and Continental Airlines and $11m in costs for the grounding of United’s Boeing 787 aircraft over battery safety concerns. Special charges in last year’s first quarter were $164m.United shares had fallen 0.9 per cent by lunchtime to $31.12. Southwest’s shares had fallen 0.3 per cent to $13.38.
185;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-04-23T15:07:53Z;Delta cuts capacity to remain in black;;Delta Air Lines, one of the US’s two biggest airlines by revenues, warned of a fall in demand in March and expected unit revenues to fall 2 to 3 per cent in April, as it experienced the impact of a weakening US economy.Delta gave the warning on Tuesday as it announced that first-quarter net income was down from $124m to $7m, on operating revenue up 1 per cent to $8.5bn.However, Delta’s Passenger Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (Prasm) was up 4.1 per cent on last year’s first quarter, as the company successfully kept capacity tighter than revenue growth.Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, said the company was “taking actions” to mitigate the decline it had experienced in March. He blamed the expected declines in April on the sequestration spending cuts, as well as a decline in leisure travel.Nevertheless, Mr Bastian said that in the new, more consolidated US airline industry, airlines were far better at matching revenue and fuel prices than before. Many airline executives say that, before a recent round of mergers, airlines often felt pressed to cut fares to preserve volumes when fuel prices went up.“While we are seeing some revenue softness, we are also benefiting from lower fuel costs, allowing us to continue our path of margin expansion even in a sluggish economic environment,” Mr Bastian said.Delta’s projection came as US Airways, the US’s fifth-biggest airline by revenues, also announced its first quarter figures, showing an 8 per cent decline to $44m in net profit for the quarter compared with the same quarter last year, on operating revenues up 3.5 per cent to $3.38bn.US Airways is in the course of a merger with AMR Corporation, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, the US’s third-biggest airline by revenues, that will make the merged company a rival for Delta and United Airlines, the market’s two revenue leaders.Despite the headwinds, Delta was able to produce its strongest first-quarter financial and operational performance in more than a decade, according to Richard Anderson, its chief executive.Excluding special items – which include gains on fuel hedges and a $102m charge for the first quarter for “facilities, fleet and other items” – Delta’s net income for the quarter would have been $85m, against a $39m loss in last year’s first quarter at the same level.“This performance is proof that we are on the right path to making Delta the airline of choice for our shareholders, employees, and customers,” Mr Anderson said.The year’s first quarter, when leisure travel is at its slackest, is traditionally weakest for airlines.The 4.1 per cent increase in Delta’s Prasm resulted from a 2.5 per cent capacity cut in response to economic weakness. Total passenger revenue grew 1.4 per cent to $7.33bn.Revenue fell 6.8 per cent in the US regional business to $1.46bn, but capacity was cut 8.5 per cent. Revenue also fell 3.4 per cent on transatlantic services to $1.05bn, but capacity was cut 10.6 per cent.The strongest performer was the airline’s US domestic mainline network, where revenues improved 6.1 per cent to $3.4bn and capacity increased 1.2 per cent.Mr Bastian said that the continued Prasm improvements showed that the company’s investments in operations, product and service, along with its capacity discipline, had built a “solid revenue-producing foundation”.Delta’s shares rose 5.36 per cent to $15.95 in early New York trading. US Airways’ shares rose 3.29 per cent to $16.03.

Most of these carriers reported higher profits last year and some – such as Delta Air Lines – are planning to resume returning cash to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks.But why is this trend struggling to take hold in Europe? Like the US, the EU market has been consolidating – through mergers such as that between Air France and KLM, and British Airways and Iberia – but there are still far too many flag carriers, and profitable budget airlines led by Ryanair and easyJet are providing fierce competition on short-haul routes.Even EU flag carriers that are profitable are reporting falling underlying earnings amid the eurozone recession. Lufthansa, Europe’s largest carrier by revenue and one of the few to pay a dividend, cancelled its 2012 payout.Rigas Doganis, visiting professor at Cranfield University and a non-executive director at easyJet, says some of Europe’s small and medium-sized flag carriers could be doomed unless they can find protection inside a larger group.“They are too small to compete effectively in the long-haul markets against the big players, and too high cost to compete effectively in the short-haul markets against the low-cost carriers,” he adds.His statement highlights how Europe is likely to experience some high-profile airline failures as well as mergers, because consolidation of the EU aviation market has not delivered the level of market concentration found in the US.The wave of US mergers resulted in the top five carriers – United, Delta, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and US Airways – holding 82 per cent of domestic seating capacity last year, compared to 68 per cent in 2008, according to estimates by Deutsche Bank analysts and Diio Mi.One reason why Europe’s small and medium-sized flag carriers could struggle to have an independent future is they can no longer automatically count on state bail-outs.The European Commission is busy with several investigations into what could be illegal state aid for airlines that are partly or wholly owned Portuguese their home governments.They include Adria Airways of Slovenia, airBaltic of Latvia, Cyprus Airways and Estonian Air. Brussels is also analysing a rescue loan that LOT Polish Airlines obtained from the Polish government.Last year, Brussels ordered the Hungarian government to recover state aid from Malev, its flag carrier. Malev subsequently collapsed.Some European airlines do look to have secured their future through partnerships with deep-pocketed Gulf carriers. Air Berlin, Germany’s second-largest airline, is stronger after Etihad Airways, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier, became its largest shareholder last year and subsequently started providing loans.But other European airlines appear less wanted. In December, the Portuguese government shelved the planned privatisation of TAP, its flag carrier, after receiving just one binding offer.International Airlines Group and Lufthansa, which had expressed interest in TAP, did not make bids.These carriers’ increasing dominance is providing them with the opportunity to end the irrational practices of the past, when airlines would try to usurp each other by ramping capacity and slashing fares.The remaining big carriers in the US are wielding much greater market power – giving them the opportunity to cut capacity and raise ticket prices. This may be bad news for passengers, but investors are hoping US airlines are now an attractive proposition.Contrast this situation with Europe, where the top five carriers – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group, Ryanair and easyJet – held only 52 per cent of capacity on flights within the EU last year.The top five European carriers held 41 per cent of capacity in 2008, so market concentration has increased, but it is far behind the levels in the US. Profitability is also lower – European airlines had a combined net margin of 0.3 per cent in 2012, compared to 2.3 per cent at North American carriers, according to Iata, the industry’s global trade body.One important driver of consolidation in the US aviation market has been the country’s bankruptcy regime. US carriers have used the Chapter 11 procedure to cut their high operating costs.Brian Havel, director of the International Aviation Law Institute, says: “By using Chapter 11 to reject leases and renegotiate labour contracts, struggling airlines become more attractive targets for takeover.”This assertion is borne out by how US Airways pursued a merger with AMR, American Airlines’ parent, after it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011.The EU does not have an equivalent to Chapter 11, and the airline mergers that have occurred – led by the 2004 combination between Air France and KLM – are notable for how they subsequently failed to secure significant cost savings through rationalisation.The three big flag carrier groups – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG – are now belatedly engaged in thorough restructurings, and therefore are unlikely to do large acquisitions soon.But the biggest factor explaining why US airlines have consolidated far more than EU carriers is the simple truth that it is much easier to do mergers in a single country.Cross-border airline mergers are difficult in the EU, not least because many governments prize having an independent flag carrier.Mergers are also complicated because the industry is surrounded by antiquated ownership rules. Since the 1940s, carriers’ rights to fly into other countries’ airports are usually based on bilateral agreements between governments that require airlines to be “substantially owned and effectively controlled” by nationals of their own state.Last week, Siim Kallas, European transport commissioner, used a speech in Washington to make a fresh push for consolidation between European and American carriers, so they can compete more effectively against fast-growing Gulf and Asian airlines.He called for lawmakers to relax rules that prevent foreign companies owning more than 25 per cent of US airlines, but Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, says such reform is unlikely, because workers fear mergers with EU carriers would mean job losses.“I think the employees of the airlines are concerned about jobs in the weak economic setting, and I believe their voice will be – and is – heard loud and strong in Washington,” he adds.
188;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Investors brace for downbeat US earnings;;After pushing US stocks to record highs over the past five months, investors are set to focus on the message from companies as they start reporting first-quarter results.The country’s largest companies are expected to report lacklustre quarterly results, so Wall Street has rallied sharply since January on the basis that a stronger economy later this year will accelerate profit expansion.But a disappointing jobs report last week and lower forecasts from bellwethers of economic activity such Delta Air Lines and FedEx are raising the stakes.“Stock markets have had a nice run, but expectations have been for consistently lower earnings,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “Unless we see some improvement in companies’ forward guidance, earnings by themselves are not likely to become a catalyst for further gains.”Aluminium producer Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in the US after the market closed on Monday, following a multi-month rally marked by the S&P 500 eclipsing its all-time high last week.Analysts forecast earnings for America’s 500 largest public companies will grow 0.7 per cent for the first quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. That is a sharp drop from the 7.7 per cent expansion posted during the final quarter of last year, according to S&P Capital IQ. Only six out of the 10 major sector groups in the S&P 500 are expected to show earnings’ growth.For this quarter, telecoms companies, consumer discretionary and consumer staples are expected to post the strongest gains, according to S&P Capital IQ. In contrast, sharp declines are seen in energy and information technology.The Dow Jones Transportation Index, often considered a barometer for the economy and the trend of the broader market, has dropped 3.4 per cent since the start of the month.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, said last month that the package delivery company had experienced “very challenging” conditions in the quarter to February 28 as customers continued to select cheaper and slower services.But some investors see silver linings, with a few bright spots including a rebound in car sales, improvement in the housing market, share buybacks and a rebound in M&A activity.“The biggest beats should be in industrials and financials, especially those with capital goods and capital markets exposure,” said David Bianco, US strategist at Deutsche Bank. “Capital markets activity has been picking up, as has capital expenditure.”Analysts also say growth in certain overseas markets, such as Latin America, the low rate environment and a continued improvement in the overall US economy should also contribute to companies’ bottom line.

Uncle Sam tried to nudge revellers towards the door, in the name of deficit reduction – raising payroll taxes by 2 percentage points in January, and imposing across-the-board $85bn spending cuts, known as the “sequestration,” at the end of February. If March was last orders, it was a fine hurrah as the S&P 500 rallied 4 per cent.Now, though, we have reached first-quarter earnings season, so the lights are about to be turned on and the damage assessed. Delta Air Lines, in reducing Q1 guidance this week, attributed weaker than expected March revenue to the sequestration reducing government travel, as well as to customers staying home due to continued fare increases. Companies that have underperformed now have a tidy explanation. But excuses may not stop investors from leaving the party. Delta continues to project a profitable quarter. Ideally there will be more of that as companies report: the new-found attention to fiscal discipline will lead the market to switch the music to something more mellow, instead of rushing for the exits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in February that the austerity measures would not sink the economy into a recession this year, but rather would cut output growth by half, to 1.4 per cent. The next tea leaf to be read will be on Friday when the unemployment rate, projected to remain at 7.7 per cent, is released.The question now is whether the pain, even if limited, is worth it. As of now, the sequestration seems to have hit an unhappy trifecta: restraining a recovering economy, doing nothing to address long-term budget problems, and leading to the perverse symbolism of President Barack Obama returning a portion of his salary. He should have proceeded directly to the mall – or the Delta website – and spent the full amount.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

It cut growth forecasts for the first quarter by as much as a quarter, to 4-4.5 per cent.Delta blamed the slower than forecast growth on fewer last-minute bookings from government employees, making it one of the first US companies to directly link its fortunes to the forced $85bn in cuts, known as sequestration, which began on March 1.The airline continued to cut capacity in March, particularly on regional and international routes. But the higher ticket prices that the capacity reduction is meant to support also drove away customers.Lower than expected demand plus “temporary inefficiencies” stemming from new technology contributed to unit revenue growth slowing, Delta said.Shares in its rivals also tumbled, compared with a slight rise by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.While cuts to military spending due to sequestration were well flagged, the impact on civil aerospace was less so. Analysts said they expected the cuts could potentially reduce revenue growth in the airline sector by 2 per cent.Delta expects its profit margins for the three months to the end of March to be between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent, excluding restructuring and other one-off costs.
191;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-02-17T16:06:33Z;Virgin Atlantic weighs joining SkyTeam;;Virgin Atlantic is likely to join the SkyTeam global airline alliance following its far-reaching move to form a transatlantic joint venture with Delta Air Lines of the US, according to its chief commercial officer.In an interview with the Financial Times, Julie Southern says it will “probably make sense” for Virgin to become a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, although she stresses no final decision has been taken.Virgin’s willingness to consider joining SkyTeam, and its planned joint venture with Delta, highlight the sweeping changes facing Sir Richard Branson’s UK airline. It is contemplating an end to its much-cherished status as an independent carrier, as it pursues root-and-branch reforms of its business model.Sir Richard established Virgin Atlantic in 1984 to give British Airways a run for its money, and made a virtue of his airline being a free spirit in the aviation industry. Success was built on its quirky brand and friendly customer service.But Virgin has been forced to reassess its strategy after failing to stop British Airways creating a powerful transatlantic joint venture with American Airlines in 2011.Virgin’s planned partnership with Delta is its response to this joint venture, and Ms Southern says in her first interview since unveiling the deal last December: “Being able to compete with BA-AA is pretty important to us . . . As others join together, it’s not that we wouldn’t have had a future, but it would have been a more and more challenged future.”The three year delay in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner entering commercial service has been a “pain in the neck” for Virgin Atlantic, says Julie Southern, the airline’s chief commercial officer.This pain manifested itself in Virgin’s 2011-12 results, when it reported a £80.2m pre-tax loss, which was partly blamed on a 32 per cent increase in fuel costs.The 787 sets new standards in fuel efficiency for long-haul aircraft, and Virgin has ordered 16 of these twin-engine jets – but Boeing has pushed back the delivery timetable for the airline from 2011 to 2014.The 787 entered service more than three years late in 2011 due to technology challenges and outsourcing problems, and the grounding of the Dreamliner last month because of a safety scare about its batteries risks creating new delays with deliveries to airlines.Virgin is sticking to its Dreamliner order, but Ms Southern says: “It is a real pain in the neck that the Dreamliner has been delayed.”Virgin’s Dreamliners are due to replace some of the four-engine Airbus A340 aircraft in its fleet, which are less fuel-efficient than the 787.She goes on to say Virgin will now assess the case for joining SkyTeam. “It will probably make sense for us to do it . . . We will look at SkyTeam, and I suspect in due course you may see us joining SkyTeam, but we’ll only do it if it makes economic sense to the business.”SkyTeam could generate new sales opportunities for Virgin because the alliance provides a foundation on which to form code-share agreements between its 19 member airlines.SkyTeam could also make Virgin more attractive to its customers because business passengers get the chance to use the airport lounges of other airlines in the alliance, and redeem their frequent flyer points on these carriers.But there could be downsides – Virgin’s greatest strength is its brand, and this could be damaged if customers had a bad experience with other SkyTeam member airlines.“The real skill in this will be taking the commercial benefits that we can get through co-operation but keeping the brand vibrant,” says Ms Southern.Still, her immediate focus is on Delta, which plans to buy a 49 per cent stake in Virgin for $360m, as well as form the transatlantic joint venture.Virgin and Delta will pool revenues and profits in their partnership, as they jointly sell flights between the UK and the US, Canada and Mexico, in a move that will give more choices to customers.Virgin has six daily flights from London’s Heathrow airport to New York’s JFK and Newark hubs. By combining schedules with Delta, the two airlines can offer nine daily flights on this core transatlantic route – compared with the 12 jointly operated by British Airways and American Airlines.Ms Southern highlights how the partnership should provide Virgin with a huge source of new passengers – Delta’s US customer base.“We felt whilst we have a fantastic market presence in the UK . . . we clearly struggled to recreate that from the US point of sale,” says Ms Southern, who originally joined Virgin in 2000 as finance director after a similar role at Porsche’s UK business.She adds that Virgin, which carried 5.4m passengers last year compared with Delta’s 164.6m, will provide about 75 per cent of the seating capacity inside the joint venture. This reflects the limited scale of Delta’s operations into the UK, particularly at Heathrow.Beyond the Delta joint venture, the other big change to Virgin’s business model is the start of its first-ever short-haul operations next month – beginning with flights between Heathrow and Manchester airports.Virgin has been stirred into doing short-haul flying after it lost out to International Airlines Group, British Airways’ parent, in a bid battle last year for BMI British Midland.BMI was an important source of transfer passengers at Heathrow for Virgin’s long-haul flights, but it has now combined with British Airways.Ms Southern is hoping Virgin’s new domestic routes will provide a significant source of transfer passengers.She is honest enough to admit she is “very disappointed” not to be chosen to become Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive – Craig Kreeger, previously an American Airlines’ manager, took up the role this month.But she is not planning to leave. “Having led the Delta deal and brought that off, I’m very committed to bringing it to fruition now,” she says.
192;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-02-14T13:07:48Z;US Airways and AMR must deliver on merger;;The deal to merge US Airways and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, brings to an end a long, personal struggle by Tom Horton, AMR chief executive, to turn AMR round as a standalone operation. It also marks the start of a fresh struggle by Doug Parker, the new operation’s chief executive, to bring together the two airlines’ contrasting cultures.Mr Horton, a tall Texan with a blunt manner, took his company into bankruptcy protection in November 2011 vowing that the company would shed its outsize costs and obligations through bankruptcy quickly. He was initially dismissive of the approaches of US Airways, American’s smaller rival, suggesting its latest effort would be no more successful than its previous courtings of United and Delta Air Lines.“I’m not sure what’s in the water out there in Phoenix,” Mr Horton told Dallas Morning News in February last year, referring to US Airways’ Arizona base and its repeated merger efforts. “Maybe it’s the cactus.”He was forced to consider a merger far more seriously, however, because of its potential to increase the payout to the airline’s creditors compared with it emerging on its own.“When you’re in bankruptcy, the unsecured creditors control the future,” one person involved says.Mr Horton, 50, has also had to stand by as Mr Parker, 51, US Airways chief executive, takes the biggest step in his 25-year career in the airline industry. Mr Parker will move from running the US’s fifth-biggest carrier to one that will surpass United and Delta, the industry’s two giants, in annual revenues. Mr Horton will receive the consolation prize of serving – unusually for a large US company – as non-executive chairman, until the merged company’s first annual meeting in 2014.“I think fundamentally American failed to convince the interested parties that a standalone company was better than a merger combination,” says William Swelbar, a research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Centre for Air Transportation.Mr Horton projected, according to Mr Swelbar, that American could grow by 20 per cent by 2017, adding aircraft and routes. Many creditors were concerned that such an effort risked a return to the overcapacity and price battles that forced the industry into a decade of restructuring efforts after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.“For an industry and Wall Street community that believe capacity discipline is paramount for the airlines in order to stay profitable, I think that that was probably one of the biggest stumbles,” Mr Swelbar says.Yet both Mr Parker and Mr Horton agree on the essentials of why US airline mergers can be beneficial both for individual companies and for the industry as a whole. Mr Horton told the Financial Times last July that a series of restructurings in bankruptcy and mergers had combined to make the US airline industry “nicely profitable”.The priority that AA’s new chief has given to winning over American’s pilots is also a reminder of his experience in merging airlines“I think the US airline industry has a way to go to be more profitable,” he added. “It should be more profitable but I think the trajectory is good.”Mr Parker argued in a presentation in September to a transport conference run by Dahlman Rose, the investment bank, that consolidation and restructuring had vastly improved airlines’ profitability. At times of high fuel prices, he pointed out, airlines were now able to recover their higher costs from passengers. In previous spikes, prices had fallen as airlines struggled to fill empty aircraft.“There’s no question that the industry has pricing traction today that it has never had in the past and is being very successful in passing on the industry’s higher costs – primarily fuel – to the consumer,” Mr Swelbar says.Yet Mr Parker will also be acutely aware of the potential for the new, merged airline to hit substantial air pockets before it hits a comfortable cruising altitude. Mr Parker was originally chief executive between 2001 and 2005 of America West Airlines, the regional airline that in September 2005 took over the larger, then-bankrupt US Airways in a deal with strong similarities to US Airways’ planned takeover of AMR.“America West and US Airways definitely was not a success from an operations point of view,” says Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president of Avitas, an aviation consultancy. “They were not very good at integrating all the functions – and now they want to do the same to American Airlines.”Previous airline mergers have also stumbled over questions such as how the two airlines’ pilots fit into the complex seniority structures that determine pilots’ pay and promotion prospects.Mr Pilarski points to other problems mergers have encountered – including long-running disruption to the booking systems of United-Continental – and warns that Mr Parker faces a severe test.“He will finally get his big empire,” Mr Pilarski says. “But the bad news for him is that he will actually have to deliver.”
193;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-02-10T19:54:39Z;American and US Airways near tie-up;;American Airlines is putting the finishing touches to its merger with US Airways to create the biggest US carrier by revenues in a deal expected to be announced this week.Since August, AMR, American’s parent, has been engaged in merger talks with US Airways that would allow the enlarged group to overtake its rivals United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines.Two people close to the situation said a merger between AMR and US Airways – the third and fifth-largest US carriers by revenue – was close to being finalised.However, the parent of British Airways has declared it is “increasingly unlikely” to buy a minority stake in American as part of its planned exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Having last year raised the prospect of investing in American, International Airlines Group is now playing down the possibility of taking a minority stake, partly because it has not been encouraged to make such a move by the US carrier.AMR has also been attempting an ambitious restructuring – it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2011, in order to cut its high operating costs and large debt load.The airline’s progress in Chapter 11 was highlighted at its annual results last month, when it reported an operating profit of $107m, a marked turnround from a loss of $1.1bn in 2011.The boards of AMR and US Airways are due to convene this week to approve the merger terms. The main sticking points are mostly resolved, although one person familiar with the matter stressed there were still some outstanding issues.First, in what is expected to be an all-share merger, the division of ownership inside the combined company between AMR’s creditors and US Airways’ shareholders has been a bone of contention.US Airways was pushing for its shareholders to own 30 per cent of the merged entity, but AMR has been arguing that these investors were entitled to a smaller percentage.The likely final position could leave AMR’s creditors with 72 per cent of the combined company’s equity, with US Airways’ shareholders holding the remainder.Second, the senior positions at the new company have also been an issue. Doug Parker, chairman and chief executive of US Airways, was seeking the same two roles at the merged entity.However, Tom Horton, chairman and chief executive of AMR, is due to become non-executive chairman of the merged entity until the combined company’s first annual meeting in the spring of 2014 under one scenario being discussed – though the exact length of his tenure is still unresolved. Mr Parker would serve as chief executive.If a deal is finalised, the combined company would use the American name and have its headquarters in Fort Worth, where AMR is based.Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, said in August that the group would consider investing in American if it helped cement the US carrier’s place in the Oneworld global airline alliance that British Airways also belongs to.Some analysts expressed concern that American could defect to another alliance – after Delta, part of the SkyTeam global airline partnership, considered bidding for AMR.But the merger discussions between AMR and US Airways have been based on the idea that the combined company would remain in Oneworld.“If it [investing in American] was something American had requested of us [IAG], and was in the interests of our shareholders, it’s something we would have considered,” said IAG. “But it’s looking increasingly unlikely.”British Airways has been keen to see American remain in Oneworld because the two airlines have a strategically important – and lucrative – joint venture on routes between London and New York.The case for a merger between AMR and US Airways has been highlighted by the improvement in profitability at some other large US carriers that have done deals.Consolidation has enabled the remaining large airlines – United, Delta and Southwest Airlines – to abandon the industry habit of flooding the market with capacity and engaging in vicious price wars. Instead, some have felt able to raise fares.

The rise in gasoline prices also helped to drive crude oil prices higher. ICE March Brent rose to an intraday peak of $114.49 a barrel, the highest in three months. Nymex March WTI rose to $97.82 a barrel.“The Hess refinery closure, and particularly the short notice, has taken the market by surprise,” said Gareth Lewis-Davies, a commodity strategist at BNP Paribas.The price of European gasoline, which is not traded on exchange, also climbed according to market participants, in anticipation of European refiners meeting some of the shorfall in demand in the north-east region of the US.The closure of the Hess Port Reading refinery is the latest in a string of big oil company announcements of plans to sell or close their refineries in the US East coast. Last year, Delta Air Lines purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it sought to hedge its rising jet fuel costs.Hess has also shut down a big refining centre in the Caribbean, further straining gasoline supplies to the US.Although Hess’s Port Reading refinery produces only about 50,000 barrels a day of gasoline, it is critical for the supply of the New York area and thus has an outsize impact on the energy futures market of the city. The shortfall in gasoline in the New York area is not expected to be met from mid-western refineries, because pipelines flowing from the midwest to the New York area are running at capacity.Gasoline, or products for blending gasoline, could also be shipped to the New York region from refineries on the US Gulf Coast, but imports from Europe may be cheaper, analysts said.Shipments of crude and oil products within the US must be made by US-owned, crewed and flagged ships, increasing transport costs. European refineries produce more gasoline than is consumed on the continent, in part because demand in Europe has shifted towards diesel.The traditional simple measure of gasoline refining margins, known as the RBOB crack spread, has climbed $27 from $25 a barrel since the Hess announcement on Monday.
196;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-01-24T08:36:14Z;Delta’s oil refining efforts hit turbulence;Losses at Trainer refinery add $63m to airline’s fuel bill;Delta Air Lines’ oil refining venture is wobbling on take-off.The US carrier last year bought a mothballed refinery in a novel attempt to slash jet fuel costs by $300m a year.But in the first full quarter back in operation, losses at the Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery added $63m to Delta’s fuel bill instead.The results are in stark contrast to the rest of the US refining sector and will bolster sceptics who say an airline should stick to flying. The poor results came at a time of relatively steady crude oil prices, not the kind of hair-raising volatility that pushed refineries including Trainer to the brink in 2011.Fuel is Delta’s largest expense, totalling $12.3bn in 2012. The airline justified its $250m refinery investment not so much as a way to hedge crude oil prices – it can do that by purchasing futures – but to better manage the volatile premium which jet fuel maintains over the cost of crude.This premium, known as the crack spread, has been great for US refineries. Thanks to rebounding domestic crude production, less competition and robust exports of distillates – a fuel type which includes jet fuel – their profits are improving.This is even true at US east coast refineries that until recently depended on expensive imported crude. The region’s diesel (another distillate) crack spread averaged about $17 a barrel last year, the highest since 2008, Macquarie estimates.Airlines are generally on the losing end of this equation. The jet fuel crack spread has increased much faster than crude in recent years, and it cannot be economically hedged. Delta sought to capture the crack windfall instead of suffer from it. “Refinery profits will net into fuel expense,” it told investors last spring.As is now evident, however, refinery losses also add to fuel expense.Delta this week blamed the loss on superstorm Sandy, which knocked out east coast pipelines and tank terminals and crimped Trainer’s output. This current quarter Delta believes its new refinery will be “modestly” profitable. “We have become more certain of how prudent that investment is for our company,” Richard Anderson, chief executive, said this week.But in the glitch-prone US refining sector, surprises like Sandy are the rule, not the exception. Delta’s venture had another unexpected development when Jon Ruggles, a senior fuel executive who Platts said “drove the Trainer acquisition”, left the company about two months after the refinery reopened. The oil world will be on the lookout for more turbulence.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times.
197;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-01-22T14:41:38Z;Delta confirms return to US profitability;;Delta Air Lines, the world’s biggest airline by revenues, confirmed the rebound in US airline profitability when it reported net income for 2012 rose 18 per cent to $1.01bn on revenues that were up 4 per cent at $36.7bn.However, fourth-quarter net income fell to $7m from $25m on revenue that grew 2 per cent to $8.6bn, after $231m in special charges. The special charges included a $106m loss on the early retirement of some debt and $122m related to the company’s fleet restructuring, in which it has shed some of its least efficient aircraft and taken on other airlines’ MD 90 and Boeing 717 aircraft.The fourth-quarter figures included a $75m reduction in airline revenue as a result of October’s superstorm Sandy in north-east US. The storm also reduced revenue by $25m for the Trainer refinery, near Philadelphia, which Delta bought last April in an attempt to manage its fuel costs better.Fuel costs for the fourth quarter rose 18 per cent from 2011 to $2.39bn, while staff costs rose 7 per cent to $1.83bn.Despite rising fuel costs, the US’s surviving legacy airlines have experienced returns to solid profitability over the past year as a decade of bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings has finally started to produce results.Delta is the first listed operator among the legacy airlines to report its 2012 results. American Airlines, currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, reported a still stronger recovery last week.Richard Anderson, chief executive, said the December quarter “capped off” a successful 2012 for Delta, when it achieved strong financial results, industry-leading operational performance and across-the-board improvements in customer satisfaction.“We enter 2013 as a stronger airline, with initiatives in place to build on our 2012 success,” he said.Delta’s passenger revenue per available seat mile (Prasm) – the key measure of airlines’ unit revenues – was up 4.3 per cent overall in the fourth quarter, 5.3 per cent higher on domestic routes and 7.9 per cent on transatlantic routes, where Delta cut capacity 6.8 per cent. However, Prasm was flat on trans-Pacific routes and fell 1.4 per cent in Latin America.The company forecast overall Prasm for the current quarter would rise 4-6 per cent from the same quarter of 2012, although it said unit costs would increase 6-8 per cent.Ed Bastian, Delta president, said the company’s investment programme and its discipline about capacity had produced unit revenue growth faster than the wider industry for 21 consecutive months.“We have built strong revenue momentum going into the year with our customer-focused initiatives, corporate share gains, and capacity actions,” he said.
198;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2013-01-08T21:41:16Z;Virgin Atlantic taps American for chief;;Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic on Tuesday announced that Craig Kreeger, an executive at American Airlines, would become the carrier’s new chief executive.Mr Kreeger is to succeed Steve Ridgway next month, and his immediate task will be to finalise Virgin’s planned joint venture with Delta Air Lines on its core transatlantic routes.Virgin has been struggling to respond to British Airways’ partnership with American Airlines on transatlantic routes, but the proposed joint venture with Delta should put Sir Richard’s carrier in a stronger competitive position.Mr Kreeger is American Airlines’ senior vice-president for customers, responsible for rolling out products on its fleet, and Virgin selected him ahead of Julie Southern, the UK carrier’s chief commercial officer, who was regarded as the leading internal candidate to replace Mr Ridgway.Sir Richard said: “We are thrilled to welcome Craig to Virgin Atlantic – he is the right person to succeed Steve Ridgway at this dynamic and challenging time for our airline.”Mr Kreeger, 53, joined American Airlines in 1985 and spent six years in London as the executive responsible for the carrier’s international operations.He said he was “delighted” to join Virgin, adding that he had “always admired its laser focus on its people, its products and its customers”.While Virgin Atlantic – founded by Sir Richard in 1984 to take on British Airways on long-haul routes – has won plaudits for its customer service, some analysts have said it has looked subscale.Virgin reported a pre-tax loss of £80m for 2011-12, as high fuel costs and increased competition took their toll.Transatlantic routes are dominated by three joint ventures: British Airways and American Airlines, Lufthansa and United Airlines, and Air France-KLM and Delta.Three global airline alliances – Star, SkyTeam and Oneworld – have secured extensive influence over the past decade, and Virgin has not joined one of these entities.Among other things, Mr Kreeger is expected to resolve how Virgin’s partnership with Delta will sit alongside the US carrier’s joint venture with Air France-KLM, and whether the UK airline should join SkyTeam.Delta is proposing to buy a 49 per cent stake in Virgin from Singapore Airlines for $360m, but the transaction, and the partnership with Delta, must be approved by regulators.Mr Kreeger will also have to oversee Virgin’s ambitious plans to start its first short-haul operations in March by flying between London’s Heathrow airport and Manchester, followed by Edinburgh and Aberdeen in April.John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, said: “Notwithstanding they have achieved a great number of things, Virgin has been struggling in recent times. Therefore it makes sense to bring in a new leader from outside, with a fresh perspective.”
199;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-30T20:02:39Z;New York hubs reflect size of regional market;;New York is often cited by those who believe its two big international hub airports – JFK and Newark – offer a model for how London could resolve its airport capacity crunch.However, the differences between the two aviation markets mean the Big Apple is unlikely to provide a blueprint for London’s future.The presence of the two hubs close to New York reflects the vast size of the region’s air travel market. In this respect, London and New York are similar – both have large, affluent populations that want to fly. Significant volumes of business travellers regularly move between the financial centres in London and New York.Tim Ahern, an executive at American Airlines with responsibility for New York, says New York’s dual-hub system offers good choice to customers.American Airlines and its partners in the Oneworld global airline alliance use JFK as their hub, with passengers transferring off domestic, short-haul jets at the airport onto aircraft heading for long-haul destinations. United and its Star alliance partners have similar hub arrangements at Newark.“Each airport really is one hub for the very, very large alliance networks,” says Mr Ahern.It would be difficult, though not impossible, for London to replicate these arrangements because Britain only has one large network carrier engaged in hub operations – British Airways, the largest airline at Heathrow.Gatwick is interested in the possibility of attracting the Star or SkyTeam alliances to turn itself into a similar hub to Heathrow.But Heathrow argues that these alliances want to remain there. Star’s member airlines, for example, are preparing to move into Heathrow’s new Terminal 2, which opens in 2014. SkyTeam is led by Delta Air Lines and is seeking to increase its presence at Heathrow through a partnership with Virgin Atlantic.Whatever the merits of New York’s dual-hub system, there is general agreement that it faces one serious problem in common with southeast England – a general lack of capacity.Richard Barone, director of transportation programmes for the New York-based Regional Plan Association, says JFK and Newark are “slot-constrained” – both handling the maximum number of flights allowed under current regulations.That has led to calls for a single, large new hub airport located in New York bay or the Atlantic off Long Island.It is an option which, while never likely, has looked even more remote since October’s superstorm Sandy flooded low-lying areas around New York bay.Instead, Mr Barone expects the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owners of JFK and Newark, to push ahead with piecemeal improvements – in a similar fashion to Heathrow and Gatwick.
200;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-12T21:21:42Z;Delta set to resume paying dividends;;Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest airline by revenue, expects to start returning cash to shareholders during 2013, in the latest sign of the US airline industry’s rapidly improving financial health.Any return of capital to shareholders would be the first since Delta emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2007. It subsequently merged, in 2008, with Northwest Airlines.Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer, unveiled the plans during a presentation to shareholders at the company’s annual investor day on Wednesday, a day after Delta announced plans to set up a transatlantic joint venture with Virgin Atlantic and to spend $360m to buy Singapore Airlines’ 49 per cent stake in the UK-based carrier.Delta stressed during Wednesday’s presentations how important capacity at London’s Heathrow airport had been to its decision to form the joint venture with Virgin. Ed Bastian, the company’s president, said the joint venture would offer 23 daily round trips between Heathrow airport and North America.Eight of the top 10 markets for flights between the US and Europe originate in London.Delta this year had a 8 per cent share of the market between the US and Heathrow and Virgin had 16 per cent. British Airways has 43 per cent, American Airlines 16 per cent and United Airlines 14 per cent.Delta had reduced its adjusted net debt – its long-term debt plus its capital leases and debt from aircraft acquisitions, minus its unrestricted cash – from $17bn as recently as 2009 to $11.8bn at present, according to Mr Jacobson.The group expected to achieve its long-term goal of reducing the debt figure to $10bn next year. At that point, Mr Jacobson said, the focus would shift to distributing cash to shareholders.Many executives in the US airline industry say the industry’s financial health has been transformed over the past decade by a mixture of sharp cost-cutting and consolidation between airlines that has reduced once-cutthroat competition.According to a presentation by Richard Anderson, chief executive, total revenues of the eight largest US airlines between 2002 and 2004 averaged $75bn annually, compared with $120bn for the five biggest now.Average net losses for the eight between 2002 and 2004 varied between $3bn and $10bn annually, compared with $6bn net income at present for the biggest five.Delta expected to report $1.6bn in losses for 2012, compared with $854m for 2011, investors were told. Further improvement was expected for 2013.In April, Delta took the unusual step of buying an oil refinery– the Trainer refinery in Pennsylvania – to gain control of fuel costs.Delta said it expected to gain a 7 cents per gallon advantage in fuel prices next year as a result of the refinery acquisition.
201;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta’s Virgin deal to put pressure on BA;;British Airways faces stronger competition on its core transatlantic routes after Delta Air Lines on Tuesday unveiled plans to form a joint venture with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic for flights between the US and UK.Delta, the second-largest US airline by revenue, is also proposing to buy a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic for $360m from Singapore Airlines.The Delta deal is a fillip for UK-based Virgin, which has been squeezed on its key transatlantic routes after large European and US carriers formed three joint ventures to dominate what is the world’s most valuable long-haul market by revenue.The deal should also help Delta because Virgin is the fourth-biggest airline at London’s capacity-constrained Heathrow airport. Delta has a smaller presence at Heathrow compared with United Air Lines and American Airlines, but is keen to increase its share of business travellers flying between London and New York.Delta’s planned $360m payment for the 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic contrasts with the £600m that Singapore Airlines paid for the stake in 1999. Sir Richard’s Virgin Group owns the remaining 51 per cent of Virgin Atlantic.The proposed joint venture between Delta and Virgin Atlantic is due to start by the end of 2013 and must be approved by regulators.Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, said: “Our new partnership with Virgin Atlantic will strengthen both airlines and provide a more effective competitor between North America and the UK, particularly on the New York-London route.”Sir Richard, who founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, said the Delta deal signalled a “new era of expansion, financial growth and many opportunities” for his airline, which reported a pre-tax loss of £80m for 2011-12.Virgin has been reviewing its strategy after British Airways strengthened its position on transatlantic routes by forming a joint venture with American Airlines in 2010.Delta regards the planned joint venture with Virgin as complementing an existing transatlantic business it has with Air France-KLM for services between Europe and the US.The latest deal with Virgin intensifies the competition between the three big transatlantic alliances, which are led by Delta and Air France-KLM, British Airways and American Airlines, and United and Lufthansa.Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said the company would look at the case for joining SkyTeam, the global airline alliance of which Delta and Air France-KLM are leading members.On Monday, Sir Richard insisted he had no plans to relinquish control of Virgin Atlantic, and rejected predictions that the airline’s brand could soon disappear by Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, British Airways’ parent.Mr Walsh said he could not afford Sir Richard’s proposed £1m bet about Virgin’s continued existence, and suggested the wager should instead involve a “knee in the groin”.
202;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-10T17:07:13Z;Branson vows to hold on to Virgin stake;;"Sir Richard Branson on Monday signalled he is not planning to relinquish control of Virgin Atlantic, as Delta Air Lines of the US closes in on a deal to buy a 49 per cent stake in the UK carrier.Sir Richard’s Virgin Group owns 51 per cent of Virgin Atlantic, and Delta has been in talks to buy the remaining equity from Singapore Airlines, which paid £600m for the 49 per cent stake in 1999.A deal could be unveiled as soon as Tuesday, with Barclays analysts saying that the 49 per cent stake could now be worth between $200m and $300m.Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, has predicted that the Virgin Atlantic brand could disappear if Delta buys out Singapore Airlines.That prompted Sir Richard, who founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, to say: “Rumours have been spread in the press that I am planning to give up control of Virgin Atlantic and, according to Willie Walsh, who runs BA, that our brand will soon disappear. This is wishful thinking and totally misguided.”Sir Richard said he would pay £1m to British Airways’ staff should Virgin Atlantic disappear in the next five years. If Virgin survives, he added British Airways should pay £1m to his carrier’s staff.Delta’s expected investment in Virgin Atlantic could be accompanied by plans for a code-share agreement between the two airlines.However, Virgin, which reported a pre-tax loss of £80m in 2011-12, is interested in going beyond a simple code-share by forming a joint venture with Delta on routes over the North Atlantic.Virgin is heavily focused on services between the UK and the US, but it is being squeezed by three joint ventures on these routes. They involve Air France-KLM and Delta; British Airways and American Airlines; and Lufthansa and United.The airlines inside the three joint businesses co-ordinate their schedules so as to offer better services to customers, notably business travellers.David Fintzen, analyst at Barclays, said Virgin could provide Delta with increased access to London’s capacity-constrained Heathrow airport.He estimated Virgin had 3.4 per cent share of Heathrow’s take-off and landing slots, compared to Delta’s 1.3 per cent.Air France-KLM has been evaluating the case for buying part of Virgin Group’s stake in Virgin Atlantic, in a move that could enable the Franco-Dutch carrier to control the UK carrier in tandem with Delta.However, no decisions have been taken by Air-France KLM on whether to proceed with an offer for part of Virgin Atlantic’s equity.Air France-KLM said it was not part of the negotiations between Delta and Singapore Airlines about Virgin Atlantic. The Franco-Dutch carrier declined to comment further."
203;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-09T20:09:51Z;Delta and Virgin set to unveil tie-up;;Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic are preparing to announce a partnership on flights between London and North America as the US carrier moves to buy a 49 per cent stake in Virgin currently held by Singapore Airlines.Singapore Airlines and Delta are in talks over the stake sale and could announce an agreement as early as this week, said people close to the talks. Delta is planning to meet investors in New York on Wednesday, and is keen to lay out the strategic logic of such a move, including the transatlantic partnership.Virgin Atlantic is the second-biggest operator of transatlantic flights out of London’s Heathrow airport, with 19 flights a week between the US and the UK, representing about a quarter of total traffic between the two countries. Delta offers just 10 such flights.A combined operation would be better equipped to compete with the partnership between British Airways and American Airlines, which together operate as many as 50 flights between the US and the UK.Virgin and Delta would work first towards setting up a code-share agreement that would allow each to sell flights on the other carrier and share revenues from those tickets. But it is understood they envisage an eventual partnership along the lines of the AA-BA deal, including co-ordinated pricing and scheduling as well as sharing of costs and revenues on the flights in question. Any such deal would be subject to regulatory approval.Delta has a similar partnership with Air France-KLM. However, that tie-up still leaves it underexposed to Heathrow, the busiest airport by passenger numbers and one at which it is difficult for airlines to grow organically because of capacity constraints.Air France-KLM might look to buy a small portion of Sir Richard Branson’s 51 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic following any deal between Singapore Airlines and Delta, as a way of the transatlantic partners winning effective control over the airline.But people close to Virgin say such a move is not likely in the short term.Separately, Virgin has said it will contract out new short-haul services to Aer Lingus, which is set to man and operate four of its own Airbus A320 aircraft to serve Virgin-branded routes between Heathrow and Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester.The routes take advantage of nine of 12 Heathrow slot pairs that IAG, British Airways’ parent, was forced by regulators to sell after buying BMI, the second-biggest slot holder at the airport after BA. Virgin hopes the new routes will provide some of the feeder traffic to its long-haul network lost when BMI became part of Virgin’s arch-rival.
204;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-07T17:15:26Z;Delta eyes Singapore’s Virgin stake;;"The prospect of Sir Richard Branson getting a new partner at Virgin Atlantic re-emerged this week when Singapore Airlines said it was in talks to sell its 49 per cent stake in the carrier, which it bought for £600m in 1999.Delta Air Lines is the potential buyer, returning to the table after looking at the airline last year but deciding the price was too high.Should a deal be struck, Singapore will probably take a loss on a purchase that never quite panned out strategically and that has earned the Asian group a poor return on what it paid 13 years ago.Virgin’s appeal to Delta includes its slots at Heathrow, where the US carrier and its transatlantic partner Air France-KLM struggle to compete with rival partnerships between British Airways and American Airlines and Lufthansa and United.People close to the talks say a deal between Singapore and Delta could be followed by Virgin joining Delta and Air France-KLM in the SkyTeam alliance; or by Sir Richard selling 5-10 per cent of his majority holding to the Franco-Dutch carrier; or both.Regulators might baulk at Sir Richard selling part of his majority holding, however, since it would give Delta, the leading partner in the Air France-KLM tie-up, effective control of a European airline in contradiction of EU foreign ownership rules.Sir Richard has not said whether he is willing to sell. But his launch of a strategic review in 2010 suggests he recognises the challenges of an increasingly isolated and undersized Virgin Atlantic should he stick to the status quo."
205;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-12-03T19:19:47Z;North Atlantic venture eyes Virgin assets;;"Virgin Atlantic is looking at joining a north Atlantic joint venture between Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM as part of moves that could involve Sir Richard Branson relinquishing control of the UK airline.Delta is considering buying the 49 per cent stake in Virgin held by Singapore Airlines, and this transaction could pave the way to the UK airline joining the north Atlantic joint venture, said people familiar with the situation.Such a move could give Virgin a much stronger future, said analysts, who warned that the British airline founded by Sir Richard was being increasingly marginalised by the three joint ventures that now dominated north Atlantic air travel.Virgin has focused much of its efforts on passenger services between London and the US but these three joint ventures – between American Airlines and British Airways; Lufthansa and United; and Air France-KLM and Delta – will secure a 70 per cent share of the lucrative north Atlantic market this year, according to HSBC analysts.John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, said there was a strong logic to Virgin joining the joint venture between Air France-KLM and Delta. “Doing nothing is not a tenable position,” he added.Singapore Airlines confirmed Monday that it was in talks about selling its 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic, which it bought for £600m in 1999.Singapore did not identify Delta as the potential acquirer but one person familiar with the situation confirmed that the two airlines were in talks about the Virgin stake.One analyst, who declined to be named, said Singapore had realised that it did not wield significant influence at Virgin – and therefore he questioned what level of control the US airline would have.The answer might be found at Air France-KLM. It was considering the case for buying a stake of between 5 and 10 per cent in Virgin Atlantic, said another person close to the potential deal, who stressed no decisions had been taken.This person said the logic of any transaction involving Air France-KLM would be to secure control of Virgin for SkyTeam – the global airline alliance led by the Franco-Dutch group and Delta.Virgin is not a member of one of the three large alliances but is considering joining SkyTeam or Star – the latter is led by Lufthansa and United. Oneworld, the other alliance, is not seen as an option because its senior members include BA, Virgin’s arch-rival, as well as American Airlines.If Air France-KLM bought a stake in Virgin, it would purchase equity from Sir Richard’s Virgin Group, which owns 51 per cent of the UK airline.However, such a development would only happen if Delta were able to reach a deal with Singapore Airlines on its 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic.Air France-KLM had no appetite to buy a stake of more than 10 per cent in Virgin, added the person close to the matter. The group is the most leveraged of the big European flag carriers and is seeking to cut its debt. Air France-KLM declined to comment.Another analyst, who also declined to be named, questioned whether regulators would allow Virgin to fall in effect under the control of Delta, if this was aided by Air France-KLM. Under European Union aviation rules, non-EU companies are allowed to own up to 49 per cent of the voting shares of an EU carrier.Whatever the regulatory uncertainty, there is no doubting the scale of the strategic challenges facing Virgin, and this was tacitly acknowledged by Sir Richard when he embarked on a strategic review in 2010.He launched the airline in 1984 as a maverick challenger to BA between London and New York, and Virgin’s quirky customer service earned it a loyal following.But the creation of the north Atlantic joint ventures involving the big US and European carriers over the past decade has made Virgin look sub-scale. For example, while Virgin has four daily flights from London’s Heathrow airport to New York’s JFK hub, the joint venture involving British Airways and American Airlines has up to 12.And Virgin has found it difficult to expand eastward given the strength of the fast-expanding Gulf carriers.Delta looked at the case for buying a stake in Virgin last year but balked at the asking price.A deal may be more likely now because Virgin’s challenges increased when regulators this year allowed BA to combine with BMI British Midland, to strengthen the UK flag carrier’s grip at Heathrow.SkyTeam is the weakest of the three global alliances at Heathrow, so bringing Virgin inside the joint venture between Delta and Air-France KLM could be attractive to its existing members.Much could now hinge on Sir Richard’s willingness to relinquish control of his beloved airline.Virgin Group on Monday declined to comment, but Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said this year that Sir Richard was prepared to give up his position as controlling shareholder."
206;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta in talks to buy Virgin stake;;Delta Air Lines is in talks to buy Singapore Airlines’ 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic, reviving a deal long discussed in the airline industry, said three people familiar with the matter.Delta, which has been expanding at London’s Heathrow airport since 2008, looked at buying a stake in Virgin last year but baulked at the asking price.Singapore Airlines on Monday confirmed that it was in talks about a potential stake sale with “interested parties” that it did not identify.According to one person close to the deal, the US airline is now back in talks to buy it because of a more certain economic outlook and the lure of Virgin’s slots at Heathrow.People close to the deal said on Sunday the talks were at an early stage and could still end without an agreement.If the stake sale goes ahead, Air France-KLM, Delta’s partners in the SkyTeam Alliance, might then buy part of Sir Richard Branson’s 51 per cent stake in Virgin, these people said.Non-European Union companies are not allowed to control EU airlines, but Delta’s partners would be permitted to invest, so letting the alliance take a shared majority stake.People familiar with the matter said Delta would be likely to pay Singapore Airlines less than the £600m it paid for its 49 per cent stake in 1999.Sir Richard has been reviewing his options for Virgin Atlantic since at least 2010, when he appointed Deutsche Bank to look at choices for the airline, which faces growing threats from its bigger rivals.Virgin has been squeezed on its key North Atlantic service by British Airways and American Airlines, which formed a joint venture on the route, allowing them to co-ordinate fares and schedules. It was trumped in a bid to buy BMI British Midland this year by International Airlines Group, which owns BA and Iberia.Sir Richard is expected to support the deal on grounds that it would make Virgin Atlantic a stronger number two on US-UK routes.Delta and Air France-KLM declined to comment on the news, first reported in Britain’s Sunday Times.Virgin Atlantic said: “We are always talking to many airlines on a number of different matters, but we never comment on the details of these discussions.”A potential stake sale would come as Virgin looks for a new chief executive to replace Steve Ridgway, who says he plans to step down.In an interview with the FT this year, Mr Ridgway said Sir Richard was prepared to relinquish his status as the airline’s controlling 51 per cent shareholder.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in Singapore
207;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-10-29T21:09:25Z;Hurricane Sandy disrupts eastern travels;;Few transport links in the areas hit by hurricane Sandy look likely to start operating before Tuesday afternoon at the earliest.Most airlines were describing their services in the region as suspended until Wednesday, although United Airlines said in a statement that it was suspending services in the region for Monday and “early Tuesday”.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said when announcing a school closure for Tuesday that there was “no chance” public transit would be operating again in time to serve people that day. Amtrak’s services also remain suspended everywhere along the eastern seaboard from Boston to the Carolinas.However, the greatest risk remains that flood water might, as came close to happening during last year’s hurricane Irene, rise high enough to flood New York’s subway tunnels. The cleaning of delicate electrical equipment after such an influx would almost certainly take weeks, throwing the city’s key transport system into chaos.Airlines started cancelling flights into and out of the US northeast region on Sunday evening as cities braced for floods and high winds from Sandy, which is expected to make landfall in the next five to eight hours.According to FlightAware.com, nearly 14,000 Sunday and Monday flights had been cancelled by Monday evening. Airlines waived fees for people who had to change travel plans because of the grounded flights and offered free rebooking for those whose flights were still scheduled to take off but wanted to avoid the hassle of possible last-minute cancellations.In New York City, the timing of flight cancellations by carriers such as US Airways was determined by the city’s decision to start shutting down its mass transit systems at 7pm on Sunday, meaning passengers would have no way to get to and from the airport. “Even if we could get people to New York, the city’s basically shutting down,” said one European airline employee.Hotels from Boston to Washington were busy handling cancellations for guests who could not get to destinations in the northeast, extending stays for those who could not leave town, and booking rooms for transfer passengers stuck halfway home.In London, hotels were starting to fill up. “The lower categories are booked up but the higher rates are still available,” said the receptionist at the Sofitel at Heathrow. The lower-priced rooms typically cost £269 a night including VAT while the most expensive runs to £2,000 a night.“We’re fully booked. It’s not really normal for a Monday night,” said the receptionist at the Radisson Blu just north of Heathrow.US Airways said it would probably have to cancel close to 2,000 flights because of the storm, starting at 7pm on Sunday. The airline said it expected to resume flights on Tuesday, but noted that flooding and the storm’s duration could cause additional delays. It also said it would move aircraft from the hurricane zone to try to avoid damage. Repositioning those airliners after the weather clears could cause additional delays.George Hamlin, a transportation consultant, estimated that Sandy could cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s a disruption in terms of extra costs,” Mr Hamlin said. On top of lost flight revenue, airlines will probably have to pay their crew extra if they are stranded away from their home base.British Airways cancelled all Monday flights connecting London and east coast cities between Washington and Boston. The first cancellation was the airline’s 4pm Sunday evening flight from London City Airport to New York’s JFK. It has not decided yet whether to cancel Tuesday flights.European and US airlines were not the only carriers affected, with Etihad and Emirates among the first to cancel flights on Sunday. Cathay Pacific cancelled flights between Hong Kong and New York, followed in step by other east-Asian carriers.Meanwhile, the reservation desks at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which operates hotel groups such as Westin, Sheraton and Marriott International, said they had had a busy day. “I’ve had a lot of calls about New York properties today, a lot of people who are cancelling, a lot of people who come here because we have generators,” a Starwood reservations employee said.“People are really just frightened of the storm . . . They’re frightened of water levels and they’re frightened of losing power and they want to be somewhere where they’re safe.”Corporate spokesmen for Starwood and Marriott were not immediately available for comment on Sunday.
208;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-10-24T16:10:53Z;Delta and US Airways underscore recovery;;Net income at Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest operator by revenues, nearly doubled year-on-year in the third quarter, while net income at US Airways more than tripled, in the latest sign that the industry is returning to stable profitability.The improvements at Delta stemmed partly from a 23 per cent fall in fuel costs to $2.22bn for the quarter, which more than offset increases in some other cost areas such as aircraft maintenance. Operating costs fell 4 per cent to $8.62bn. Financing and other non-operating costs also fell 18 per cent to $256m. Net income consequently rose 91 per cent to $1.05bn, on revenue up 1 per cent to $9.92bn. Earnings per share rose 89 per cent to $1.23.Referring to the reduction in industry capacity that has followed a series of mergers between big carriers, Richard Anderson, chief executive, said the results reflected the industry’s improved structure and Delta’s consistent investment in the business.Many airline executives believe recent years’ mergers – including Delta’s 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines and the 2010 merger between United Airlines and Continental– have reduced harmful competition and allowed companies to improve profits.“We will continue on this path as we progress into 2013,” Mr Anderson said. “With a more stable financial foundation, we have moved our focus beyond short-term profit gains to positioning ourselves for long-term margin expansion, sustained profitability and shareholder returns.”Delta’s consolidated passenger revenue rose 1 per cent to $8.69bn, on yield – the revenue from each passenger – up 3 per cent. Capacity was down 2 per cent year-on-year. Cargo revenue fell 5 per cent to $14m, amid depressed conditions in the air cargo industry.For the fourth quarter, Delta projected operating margins of 4-6 per cent, against the 5 per cent achieved in last year’s fourth quarter.Net income at US Airways, the US’s fifth-largest carrier by revenues, showed a similar pattern of sharp improvement, rising from $76m to $245m, on operating revenues that rose 2.8 per cent to $3.53bn. Earnings per diluted share rose from 41 cents to $1.24. The net income figures were flattered by special items, including a $69m gain after a swap of slots with Delta at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and Philadelphia Airport. Without the special items, net income would have more than doubled from $95m to $192m.The results were the second-highest third-quarter figures in the company’s history, it said.Doug Parker, chief executive, said the company was setting records in all the areas that mattered to its passengers, including the number of flights completed, punctuality and baggage handling. The future revenue environment remained strong, he said.“As evidenced by these outstanding financial and operational results, US Airways is extremely well-positioned for the remainder of 2012 and beyond,” he said.The company gave no further information about its discussions with AMR Corporation, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, with which it is discussing a possible merger.
209;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-10-17T18:20:47Z;AMR downplays effect of disrupted flights;;AMR, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, survived the airline’s severe operational disruption in late September without a material effect on its financial performance, the company’s finance director has said.Bella Goren was speaking after AMR announced a net loss for the three months to September 30 of $238m, deeper than the $162m incurred in the same period last year, on revenue up 0.8 per cent to $6.43bn.The company, which is in a dispute with its pilots over changes to their contracts following its bankruptcy filing, was forced in September to cancel thousands of flights to overcome a slump in reliability. American, the third-largest US airline by revenues, blamed the problems on a spike in the number of pilots calling in sick for work and an increase in the number of reports of mechanical problems.The Allied Pilots’ Association, the union for American’s pilots, has insisted sickness levels have remained steady and that any spike in reported faults reflects what it says is the poor state of American’s fleet.AMR said that excluding the effects of reorganisation costs and special charges, it would have reported a $110m net profit, a $272m improvement compared with the same period of 2011. AMR sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 29 last year, weighed down by a cost structure far higher than its rivals’.Ms Goren said that as previously reported, American’s passenger revenue per available seat mile in September would have grown 4.4 per cent over the previous year without the month’s disruptions, against the 4 per cent actually achieved. But there had been offsetting savings in some variable costs from the flight cancellations, she said.There had been an impact from the disruption on American’s customers and staff, Ms Goren conceded. But she went on: “The financial impact on the third quarter was not material.”The effect on the present quarter was hard to predict, Ms Goren said, particularly because the network was running more smoothly.“We’ve had a couple of challenging weeks operationally, but we’ve seen a pretty notable improvement,” she said.American has asked the judge overseeing its bankruptcy to extend its exclusivity period – the time when it alone is allowed to put forward a restructuring plan – until January 28, from the end of December. The company has signed a confidentiality agreement with US Airways, its smaller, Arizona-based rival, to negotiate a potential merger.Ms Goren would say only that the company had made “tremendous progress” towards agreeing with creditors the terms of an eventual restructuring.Passenger yield – the average fare that each passenger paid – was up 3.5 per cent on the same quarter last year. American is currently improving its yield and other indicators far faster than rivals such as Delta and United Continental.
210;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-09-14T20:28:48Z;Georgia on my mind;Atlanta has family homes in the heart of the city, a facet few American cities can boast about;In the 1936 civil war novel Gone With the Wind, author Margaret Mitchell described Atlanta as a town built by “pushy …restless, energetic people”.Today Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia, is a sprawling metropolis. Its skyline is a mix of modern and postmodern buildings, punctuated by impressive skyscrapers, mainly the product of the city’s unprecedented economic growth of the past 15 years. The city hosts many Fortune 500 companies, including UPS, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines.Known as a “city of neighbourhoods”, there is no true city centre, with many residential areas and business districts having sprung up across the region. Atlanta is divided into 25 areas made up of 242 neighbourhoods. Interstate Highway 285 creates a 64-mile loop around the city, and Atlanta’s geography and real estate are divided between those inside and outside this perimeter. Those living inside trade off more expensive homes and higher taxes for a shorter commute.“Atlanta has lots of space – it just keeps on going,” said Sarah Kenagy, a proposal development co-ordinator at Care USA. “There are very few places in America where you can own a family home right in the heart of a city. Atlanta is one of them.”Kenagy owns a two-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Candler Park, about two miles east of Atlanta’s downtown business district. The neighbourhood, popular with those looking for true in-town living, features quaint bungalows and craftsman-style homes on tree-lined streets.For those who choose to live further out, a car is essential. Payson Schwin, a strategic marketing and business development manager at Ericsson, who lives in the Oakhurst neighbourhood, says: “Traffic is very bad and the metro doesn’t stretch to enough places. There isn’t a transit system that is good enough for the average commuter.”The US census shows that Atlanta’s population jumps 62 per cent during the day thanks to commuters. The Beltline, a 22-mile loop around the city connecting more than 40 neighbourhoods with walking trails, parks and, eventually, by either light rail or streetcars, was expected to improve connections, but the project has been dogged by funding issues that are likely to prolong congestion problems.Schwin chose to move to his four-bedroom, family home in the Atlanta suburb known for its arts scene, coffee shops and speciality stores, and for its good schools – the top priority for Atlantans.“In Atlanta you are limited by school districts,” he says. “You can get cheaper housing in other neighbourhoods, but I would like to have children in the future. Also, property values hold over time in neighbourhoods with good schools,” he said.Atlanta was one of the cities hit hardest during the housing market collapse that accompanied the financial crisis. Home prices are 30 per cent below their 2006 peaks and have only recently shown signs of recovery.Janice Quinn, an estate agent at Coldwell Banker, said: “Prices are stabilising. I deal a lot in the luxury market and while the number of showings I have are not the same as before, the buyers are still out there. Now is definitely the time to buy if you have the money.”Quinn says the highest demand is in Buckhead, Garden Hills and Dunwoody in the north, where there are good schools.Among Coldwell Banker’s listings in the area is 2081 Dellwood Drive, a $599,000 three-bedroom, three- bathroom family home, a short walk from Memorial Park. More expensive properties, such as 508 Peachtree Battle Avenue, a four-bedroom, four-bathroom renovated home with heated pool valued at $2.47m, are also listed.While the north of the city is fairly affluent, and the far east and far west mainly industrial, the south side has many lower-income neighbourhoods and the airport. Founded as a railroad hub in 1837 and originally named Terminus, the city is now an airline nerve centre.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport has, since 2005, been the world’s busiest airport by passenger traffic and number of landings and take-offs, serving 89m passengers a year. Residents in and around the neighbourhood joke that they have to “hold grandma’s picture from falling off the shelf every time a plane takes off”, which happens once every 10 minutes on average, day and night.The state has offered tax incentives to film, television and digital entertainment companies, which has brought individuals such as Neal Holman, an art director, to the city. Holman, who paid $355,000 for a three-bedroom 2,900 sq ft home in the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, said the city offered an affordable standard of living to its residents and spoke highly of its arts and restaurant scene.East Atlanta offers affordable, spacious homes with big gardens, while neighbouring Grant Park, one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, is known for Victorian-era mansions, cottages and early 1900s bungalows. At Keller Williams Realty, 512 Park Avenue, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Grant Park, is listed at $650,000.Until recently Atlanta placed little importance on the preservation of its historic architecture, and many venerable buildings were lost. Few structures survive that are older than the turn of the 20th century, with many buildings in the city’s skyline less than 30 years old. But while the city has antebellum roots, Atlanta looks and feels young and vibrant, a testament to its ability to reinvent itself.Despite the city’s constant upheaval and renewal, segregation between Atlanta’s black and white populations still remains. Atlanta is one of the US’s largest black-majority cities and has played a central role in the cultivation of black wealth, political power, education and culture.Peter Bade, agent at RE/MAX Metro Atlanta Cityside, said the city was still divided along income and colour lines. “Segregation is a hindrance to the city. The mindset of some people and lack of diversity in some neighbourhoods is not a good thing. But this is changing with time,” he said.……………………………………………………………..Buying guidePros● Climate● Relaxed pace of life● A well-connected airline hubCons● Good public-sector schools● Heavy traffic● Lack of diversity in some areasWhat you can buy for …$100,000 A one-bedroom condo$1m A three-bedroom home
211;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
212;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-08-31T17:42:30Z;American and US Airways step closer to deal;;AMR, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, took a step closer to a potential merger with US Airways on Friday when the two signed a confidentiality agreement as part of talks about a “potential combination”.The deal comes after Tom Horton, AMR’s chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the company would decide “within weeks” whether to pursue a merger, including the “attractive option” of a US Airways merger.Any merger of American Airlines – the US’s third-largest airline by revenues – and US Airways – the US number five – would create a new industry heavyweight rivalling market leader Delta and United Continental, the number two.The deal also signals a significant rapprochement between AMR and US Airways after AMR had appeared irritated by its smaller rival’s persistent, noisy campaign to promote the benefits of a merger.A joint statement from the airlines said they had signed a non-disclosure agreement under which they agreed to exchange “certain confidential information”.They also agreed, in close collaboration with AMR’s unsecured creditors’ committee, “to work in good faith to evaluate a potential combination”.Any deal would continue the consolidation of the US airline industry after the mergers of Delta and North-West Airlines in 2008 and United Airlines and Continental in 2010. Mr Horton in his FT interview attributed the revival of many US airlines’ profitability to the reduction in the number of competing airlines in the previously crowded market.AMR avoided having to seek bankruptcy protection during last decade’s wave of US airline bankruptcies. However, its persistently higher costs and lower profitability forced it into seeking Chapter 11 protection last November. It has since been working to trim its labour costs by introducing new contracts for staff members. Staff will receive shares in the new AMR after its emergence from bankruptcy.It is currently waiting for the bankruptcy court judge to rule formally on whether he will impose new contract terms on American’s pilots, who had rejected proposed new terms. The judge is expected to approve AMR’s request. All other staff groups have agreed to the changes.Mr Horton said in his FT interview that no decision had been made on whether AMR should undertake any merger with a rival before or after leaving bankruptcy protection. The two gave no indication in the statement how quickly any talks might conclude.US Airways’ shares rose 2.7 per cent to $10.68 by lunch time in New York.
213;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-07-25T20:15:09Z;Boeing: 11bn reasons to love Aeroméxico;;"Good news can come in pairs. Just ask Boeing. The plane-maker on Wednesday posted a 27 per cent increase in second-quarter net profit to $967m.The increase was boosted by commercial aircraft deliveries, the company said. And what better to confirm it than the announcement within hours of an $11bn order by Mexico’s Aeroméxico described by the Mexican transport minister, Dionisio Pérez-Jácome, as the biggest plane purchase by any company in the nation’s aviation history.Better still perhaps from Boeing’s viewpoint, the Mexican order will help its bid to beat plane deliveries by its rival, Airbus, this year.Aeroméxico has asked for 90 737 MAX 8 planes to be delivered from about a year from now and 10 787-9 Dreamliners to be received from 2018.The orders form part of a trend among international airlines that want to reduce costs, particularly in fuel. The revamped fleet should also allow Aeroméxico to roll out new routes.Aeroméxico’s main rival, Mexicana, ceased operations two years ago after filing for bankruptcy. But Mexico’s aviation industry overall is flying high, said Pérez Jácome.“In the first half of this year, the availability of seats per kilometre grew by 10 per cent year on year,” he added. Over the same period the increase in the number of passengers grew by 9 per cent to 27m passengers, Pérez Jácome said.US-based Delta Airlines took a 4 per cent stake in Aeroméxico for $65m just last month.Related reading:

214;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;American Airlines considers merger options;;American Airlines chief executive Tom Horton said in an internal letter that the company would explore a potential merger with another carrier, a move that could lead to further consolidation in the US airlines industry.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy last November and has been working to restructure itself. It has an 18-month “exclusive period” in which the company can determine its own plan of reorganisation and reject proposals from third parties.But Mr Horton said in his letter Tuesday that AMR had performed well in recent months, citing June results, which were released Monday.“It is at this juncture that it now makes sense to carefully evaluate a range of strategic options, including potential mergers, which could make the new American even stronger,” said Mr Horton.Other airlines are already circling AMR. US Airways, seen as the most serious, has already begun lobbying AMR’s unions and creditors. In May, US Airways began talks with TPG, the private equity group, about a possible joint bid for AMR. Combining AMR and US Airways would create the largest US airline.Other potential merger partners include Delta Air Lines, the country’s second-largest carrier by volume, and JetBlue, the discount carrier.“For many years, I have publicly been a proponent of consolidation as one path to a healthier US airline industry,” said Mr Horton. “We have assessed many possible combinations in the past, including, of course, an acquisition of US Airways. In fact last year I approached my counterparts at other airlines about the merits of possible combinations.”That process is set to begin in earnest, with people familiar with AMR’s plans saying the company intends to approach other airlines and ask them to sign nondisclosure agreements in the coming weeks.A tie-up between AMR and another major carrier would come on the heels of the merger of United and Continental, which created the biggest US carrier. Jeff Smisek, chief executive of United Continental Holdings, recently told the FT he supported a merger between AMR and US Airways.But people familiar with AMR’s thinking said it was not set on a merger and that it was also pursuing a restructuring plan that would keep the company independent.
215;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-06-26T20:26:46Z;United backs US airline consolidation;;United Continental Holdings, the largest US airline by revenue, is supporting more consolidation of the domestic market, saying it would not object to a merger between US Airways and American Airlines.Jeff Smisek, chief executive of United, told the Financial Times he would not urge regulators to block a tie-up between American and US Airways, even though it could weaken the global airline alliance that his carrier belongs to.He also launched a scathing attack on US lawmakers, accusing them of “doing their best to destroy” his industry, and contrasted this with the United Arab Emirates’ strong support for fast-growing Gulf carriers, which he described as a “significant” strategic threat.Although Mr Smisek complained about high aviation taxes and burdensome regulation, the US airline industry is starting to enjoy the benefits of consolidation.As well as the 2010 merger between United and Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines combined with Northwest Airlines in 2008 and Southwest Airlines bought AirTran last year. Major carriers are now seeking to improve their profitability by cutting seating capacity and raising fares.However, AMR, parent of American, filed for bankruptcy in November in order to reduce its high operating costs and debt load and is now being pursued by US Airways, the fifth largest carrier by revenue.“It would be a benefit to the US aviation business and its structure if there were to be a combination between American and another carrier – whether it is US Airways or someone else,” said Mr Smisek, whose airline markets itself under the United name.He predicted that a combination between American and US Airways would be a member of the oneworld global alliance. American is a leading member of oneworld and has a lucrative transatlantic joint venture with British Airways.Mr Smisek said it would be “regrettable” if US Airways left the Star global alliance that United also belonged to because of a tie-up with American but concluded that this setback was outweighed by the benefits of further consolidation.He added United was not interested in trying to merge with American because it would probably be a “difficult transaction” on anti-trust grounds, but he stressed his airline was “always interested in assets”.A combination between American and US Airways might have to divest assets to secure regulatory approval.Mr Smisek declared this was the most exciting period of his 17 years in aviation, because, following consolidation, managements were “focused on making money as opposed to market share”.He said much of the “heavy lifting” involved in his merger was done, although United has yet to conclude the important task of putting workers from its two predecessor companies on to the same pay and benefits.Mr Smisek anticipated that “this year” the company would finalise some joint collective bargaining agreements with trade unions, adding that negotiations were most advanced with maintenance staff and pilots.He is also looking to buy aircraft, with the current focus on narrowbody passenger jets to replace almost 100 ageing Boeing 757s.In September, United is due to receive its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and Mr Smisek said he would happily put this new widebody jet “head to head” with Emirates’ modern fleet.He claimed the Gulf carriers benefited from strong government support, including the construction of “magnificent” hub airports.“Emirates does benefit from a very enlightened aviation policy at the United Arab Emirates and we suffer from an unenlightened policy from the US government,” he said.One issue Mr Smisek is counting on US politicians to assist him with is the European Union’s emissions trading scheme, under which all airlines flying into the EU airports must pay for their carbon dioxide pollution.United was involved in mounting a legal challenge to the inclusion of non-EU airlines in the scheme but the case was rejected last December by the European court of justice.Mr Smisek said the scheme had become a “political issue”, noting strong resistance from China, India and Russia. “I would hate to see a trade war,” he added, referring to how China was blocking Airbus, the European aircraft maker, from finalising jet orders with Chinese airlines.
216;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-06-24T19:42:10Z;US airlines: the largest expense;Merger talk has provided some juice but the driver is fuel prices;Cheap food has long made Americans plump and happy. Can cheap fuel do the same for their airlines? So far this year, US airline stocks have jumped about 25 per cent and handily outperformed the broader market. Merger speculation has provided some of the juice but the real driver is fuel prices, which have dropped about 20 per cent since the start of April.The connection between fuel prices and airlines is fundamental. Fuel is the largest expense for most carriers at about 35 per cent of all costs. As a result, although fuel prices remain high by historical standards, equity analysts have begun to push up their earnings estimates for the sector, boosting them 8 per cent for both 2012 and 2013 in the past month.Not all airlines will benefit equally. Some carriers maintain hedges that cushion against fuel spikes but limit their ability to participate when prices fall. Delta Air Lines, for example, said that its hedge book pushed up its notional fuel price to $5.78 per gallon in May, when the spot price was about $3 on average according to the Argus US Jet Fuel Index.Even companies such as US Airways that are unhedged must recognise that, unfortunately, fuel prices are dropping for a reason: the economy, from the US to Europe to the emerging world, is soft and getting softer. So the cost benefits from fuel must be balanced against the potential for a drop in demand for air travel.Barclays estimates that if the economy is weak enough to deliver fuel prices that are $20 a barrel lower on average over the next 12 months, revenue growth would drop from 6 per cent to zero. Barclays still thinks that airlines would make more money under those conditions than as things stand today, but the correlations are hard to predict and US carriers might find themselves on a diet after all.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
217;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-05-14T09:41:02Z;Attack of the zombie refineries;Oil refining spreads tightening as plants are relaunched;The process of creative destruction sweeping the oil refinery industry has gone from top gear into reverse.Over the past year, refiners in the Atlantic basin from ConocoPhillips in the US to Petroplus in Europe shut down plants, removing 1.6m barrels of capacity at the peak in January. The closures triggered a recovery in the refining margin between crude oil and oil products, known as crack spreads, a favourite market for hedge funds.But the refining business cycle is now turning full circle, with many of the mothballed plants restarting under new owners, again putting pressure on crack spreads.“The refining outlook has rapidly shifted from the mass closures seen at the start of the year to a mass of restarts over the coming months,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan in New York.Evan Calio, oil refining analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, puts it more graphically: “Like villains in horror movies, refineries are hard to kill.”The restart of some refineries comes with the arrival of a new class of owners – from trading houses to airlines and private equity groups – seeking bargains.Oil traders Vitol and Gunvor bought plants owned by the bankrupt Petroplus in Cressier (Switzerland) and Antwerp (Belgium) with refining capacity of 68,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively. Furthermore, two other Petroplus plants – the 162,000 b/d Petit Couronne in France and the 220,000 b/d Coryton in the UK – are still working through temporal agreements in spite of the parent’s insolvency.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines has purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it seeks to hedge its raising jet fuel costs.Others are looking for further purchases. Carlyle, the private equity group, is in exclusive talks with Sunoco to buy a 330,000 b/d refinery in the Philadelphia area. And PetroChina has offered $350m for the 235,000 b/d Aruba refinery in the Caribbean owned by Valero.In total, about 1.3m b/d of refining capacity that was expected to be closed is now expected to return to the market.Earlier this year, closures boosted the traditional simple measure of margins, known as the 3:2:1 crack spread, significantly. In the US, it jumped to $26 a barrel, compared with a low point of $11 a barrel in early January and a five-year average of $14.7 a barrel. The restart of some refineries in the next few months could send crack spreads down againThe rapid turnround is raising eyebrows in the industry.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ watchdog, summarised the view of many in the industry saying: “While the refinery purchases surely make sense for the new owners …, and the restarts are good for employment, they do nothing to address the fundamental overhang in capacity afflicting the OECD”.Of course, some closed refiners are unlikely to restart, supporting crack spreads. For example, the massive 350,000 refinery in St Croix, Virgin Islands – owned by Hovensa, a joint venture between Hess Corp. of the US and Petróleos de Venezuela – will probably be mothballed.Still, industry executives believe that more refineries will need to close this year to rebalance supply and demand, particularly as oil companies in Asia and the Middle East continue to invest in new capacity.“We believe there’s still too much refining capacity in the US and western Europe,” Bill Klesse, Valero chief executive said earlier this month during a conference call with investors. “Some things die hard,” he added.This article has been ammended since original publication to ccrrectly identify Antwerp as a Belgian city
218;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta buys refinery to combat fuel costs;;Delta Air Lines, the second-biggest carrier in the world, has said it will purchase an oil refinery operation in Pennsylvania for about $150m in a bold move to tackle escalating fuel costs.Airlines have long been at the mercy of volatile fuel prices, which make up about one-third of their expenses, but for the most part they have responded by using financial tools, such as hedging contracts, to lock in prices or by cutting capacity to control costs.Delta said on Monday that moving into the oil refining business directly, a first for a US airline, would knock about $300m a year from its roughly $12bn fuel expense, all for a price equivalent to buying a single widebody aircraft.This “is an innovative approach to managing our largest expense”, said Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta. “This modest investment … will allow Delta to reduce its fuel expense and ensure jet fuel availability in the northeast.”In a presentation, Delta said it had been squeezed by rising jet fuel prices and limited availability of fuel on the US east coast, where shifting market dynamics have made refineries less profitable, leading the sector to idle, shut or sell about 50 per cent of capacity since 2010. Its fuel costs have gone up about $3.5bn between 2009 and 2011.Delta added that “crack spreads”, or the cost of converting oil into jet fuel, were rising even faster than the basic cost of crude. Such spikes are particularly painful for airlines as it is hard to hedge against crack spreads in a cost-effective manner.To tackle those problems, Delta said it would buy a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, through a subsidiary, for $150m plus $30m supplied by the state. The facility can refine about 185,000 barrels a day and after a $100m upgrade, will produce about 52,000 barrels a day of jet fuel.Delta said it had reached a multiyear deal to source raw materials from BP and then to exchange the non-jet fuel refined products from the plant with BP and partners for more jet fuel. In total, the deal will provide for about 80 per cent of Delta’s domestic jet fuel needs.ConocoPhillips placed the refinery on the market in late 2011 after choosing to idle the plant, citing “severe market pressure.” Conoco is in the midst of breaking itself up into separate exploration and production and refining and pipeline units.Analysts offered mixed views on the Delta venture. Some lauded its novelty while others questioned whether Delta has the expertise to run a complex business far removed from its core skills.On Monday, Delta took pains to address those concerns, saying that it had hired an industry veteran to run the plant and arguing that it would benefit regardless of whether crack spreads rose or fell. Delta expects to close the transaction and complete the plant upgrades by the third quarter of 2012.Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of Delta, said: “We expect the Trainer acquisition to be accretive to Delta’s earnings [and] expand our margins and to fully recover our investment in the first year of operations.”
219;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-04-25T16:17:36Z;Fuel costs dent Delta and US Airways;;Delta Air Lines and US Airways, two of the largest US carriers, reported small quarterly losses on Wednesday as higher ticket prices and fuller aircraft helped offset most, but not all, of a sharp increase in fuel costs.During the first three months of 2012, both airlines experienced about a 14 per cent increase in basic fuel prices, but were only able to push up fares and revenues by more modest amounts.Airlines have been struggling to keep pace with rising fuel costs for months, and last week a handful of US carriers, including AMR, parent of the bankrupt American Airlines, reported results that were dented by high fuel prices.On Wednesday Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, said the mix of cost and capacity discipline meant the company would be more than “solidly profitable” over the full year “despite higher fuel prices.”The International Air Transport Association estimates that the US airline sector will generate about $900m of profits in 2012 in spite of high fuel costs, thanks to improving consumer confidence and capacity restraint.For the first quarter, Delta posted a net loss of $39m, or $0.05 a share, compared with a $320m loss in the same period in 2011. Those numbers exclude $163m in one-off gains on fuel hedging contracts and the sale of landing slots.In total, for the three months to the end of March, Delta reported net profits of $124m, up from a loss of $318m in 2011, on revenues that rose 9 per cent to $8.4bn thanks to strong performance on its Atlantic and Pacific routes.Meanwhile, US Airways reported a first quarter net loss of $22m (or about $0.13 per share), excluding a $70m gain on slot sales. That compares with a net loss of $110m in the same period in 2011.Including all special items, US Airways swung to a net profit of $48m, or $0.28 per share, from a net loss of $114m, on revenues that climbed more than 10 per cent to $3.3bn.Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, said the company was positioned strongly for 2012 and beyond and was “encouraged with the overall strength in passenger demand.”In its earnings release US Airways said little more about its efforts to secure a merger with American Airlines. Last week US Airways secured the backing of American’s unions for the move but a deal faces significant obstacles.In early trading Delta shares, which have climbed by about 30 per cent over the year to date, slipped about 1 per cent to $10.44. US Airways shares were broadly flat at about $9.29. So far this year they have risen by more than 80 per cent on deal news.
220;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-04-20T16:28:57Z;American Airlines unions back merger;;American Airlines’ three biggest unions on Friday endorsed a plan to merge the bankrupt carrier with rival US Airways, ramping up the pressure on American’s top executives to re-evaluate their go-it-alone strategy.The Allied Pilots Association, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants and the Transport Workers Union, which represent about 55,000 employees at American, said the tie-up would save jobs, speed up restructuring and create a stronger airline.“This significant step represents our shared recognition that a merger between American Airlines and US Airways is the best strategy and fastest option to complete the restructuring of American Airlines,” the unions said.They added that they had already agreed the broad outlines of the contracts that would govern their members if the merger went ahead and that the deal would save about 6,200 jobs compared with American’s standalone plan.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for Chapter 11 in 2011 and earlier this year laid out a restructuring plan designed to return the airline to profitability by trimming $2bn from costs, cutting 13,000 jobs and boosting sales by $1bn.American executives have long resisted the idea that it must merge to survive, insisting that it can achieve much the same effect on its own by increasing departures by 20 per cent in five cities and using bigger regional aircraft and third parties.On Thursday, Tom Horton, chief executive of AMR, warned employees about “takeover speculation in the press fuelled by those who seek to serve their own agendas”.“Surprisingly, our competitors have even been encouraged by a few within our own ranks,” he added. “I believe the best way for us to achieve the best outcome for our company, our people and our stakeholders is to proceed quickly with our restructuring.”American argues that the timing of the news was designed in part to give unions some leverage with AMR. Next week the carrier will ask courts to let it tear up its existing labour contracts to reduce its cost burden.“We believe statements of non-binding support from union leaders for alternative proposals are no coincidence given the timing of the 1113 process [part of the bankruptcy code that allows companies to seek to modify employee agreements],” American said in a statement.“These statements do not in any way alter the company’s commitment to pursue our business plan or our focus on moving steadily through the court supervised restructuring process to create a profitable, growing industry leader.”However, the union moves remain unusual. Traditionally, unions have been some of the most stalwart opponents of airline mergers as they often result in capacity and job reductions and can lead to painful integration problems.“Working with US Airways, APA was able to achieve in just over a week far more than we had been able to achieve in more than five years of trying to bargain with AMR management,” said Dave Bates, APA president, in a letter to members.For its part, US Airways has made no secret of its interest in combining with American, pitching to AMR’s creditors and employees the idea that the pair should merge to smooth the reorganisation process and revitalise the carriers’ networks.A US Airways bid for AMR faces numerous technical and strategic hurdles. AMR currently has the exclusive, court-granted right to lead the restructuring process until September and can petition to extend that period for up to 18 months.That period could be cut short, but to do that the unions would have to convince the unsecured creditors committee, where they have three of nine seats, and then the bankruptcy judge that another party was offering a more credible restructuring plan.On Friday, Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, sought to reassure his own employees, writing to them that combining with American presented a “unique opportunity” to create a “pre-eminent airline”.At the same time, he noted that “to get to an actual merger, many more things must happen, including gaining the support of AMR’s creditors, its management team and its board of directors. But this is obviously an important first step along that path”.US Airways comes with plenty of baggage. It is still grappling with the legacy of a previous merger with America West Airlines that left its pilots locked in a protracted internecine court battle.Analysts point out that those deadlocked talks have effectively restrained US Airways’ labour costs, resulting in savings of up to $200m a year, which could evaporate if the carrier tried to integrate better-paid American Airlines workers.It has tried and failed in the past to take a run at a bankrupt carrier. In 2007, its hostile bid for Delta Air Lines collapsed after Delta’s management modified their restructuring plans to win over bondholders.In March, Scott Kirby, president of US Airways, told investors the company had learned from the experience that “we can’t do it alone . . . it’s important to have allies”.“In an ideal world,” he said, “[it is important] to have the company, the constituents of the bankruptcy, principally labour, on your side, and an outright hostile transaction won’t work. We still think that won’t work.”Holding together a coalition of unions may prove challenging, too. While American has spread its cost cuts across its work groups, different types of employees are in very different positions and could be affected very differently by a merger.Negotiations between the TWU and AMR management over conditions for ground service workers such as mechanics have proceeded cordially in part because other airlines outsource even more of their repairs than American’s proposals envisage.On Friday, Jim Little, TWU president, said in a letter to members that the union was pursuing a multi-pronged strategy and that while it was supporting a merger with certain conditions, it continued to negotiate with AMR and prepare for the court hearings next week.

Shares in LinkedIn are now up more than 68 per cent on the year.The S&P 500 materials, energy and industrials indices were all up more than 2 per cent on the day as rumours swirled through the market that Friday’s gross domestic product report from China would be stronger than expected.Among the top gainers on those sub-indices were coalminers Alpha Natural Resources, up nearly 10 per cent at $16.08, and copper and gold-miner Freeport-McMoRan, 5.9 per cent higher at $37.89.Overall, the S&P 500 made strong gains for a second straight session, adding 1.4 per cent to 1,387.57, but the benchmark index remains almost 2.5 per cent lower than its cyclical high achieved last Monday.Of the recent losses, Justin Waters at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors have been extremely skittish throughout this entire bull market due to the bad taste left in their mouths from the crash during the financial crisis.”But equities shook off a fresh jobs report that showed first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week to 380,000, the highest level in two-and-a-half months. The figure, which went up by 13,000 in the week to April 7, came in worse than analysts’ estimates of 359,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 12,986.58, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3 per cent to 3,055.55.Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Vix index of implied equity volatility, fell back below 20 after steadily rising over the S&P’s recent slide. The Vix was more than 14 per cent lower to 17.24.McKesson, the largest drug distributor in the US by revenue, said it had beaten its competitors to win an important government contract to act as the prime pharmaceutical supplier for the Department of Veterans Affairs.The initial two-year contract will allow the company to continue to supply more than 700 locations, including 270 medical centres, with drugs for veterans of the US military. The contract can be extended for up to an additional six years, making it worth as much as $31.6bn according to estimates.Shares in McKesson rose 3.9 per cent to $91.34 on news of the win.Elsewhere, Bed, Bath & Beyond edged up 0.1 per cent to $70.14 as the home goods retailer had its equity downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who said there was limited upside to shares at their present level.Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: “We calculate that Bed, Bath & Beyond’s market share declined in [its fourth quarter] for the first time this decade, and we expect a deceleration of top-and-bottom line growth in [its current financial year] and beyond.”Delta Air Lines, whose 2011 fuel costs were $11.8bn last year, was among the morning’s top risers, gaining 3.5 per cent to $10.26. The Atlanta-based US carrier could save up to 10 per cent a year on its fuel needs if it goes ahead with the purchase of an oil refinery in Pennsylvania, according to reports citing a person familiar with the discussions between Delta and ConocoPhillips.A deal, if completed, would be a unique effort by an airline to save on hefty fuel costs, which for Delta accounted for more than one-third of its annual spending.Better than expected sales in the first quarter by the personal computer industry helped shares in Hewlett-Packard gain 7.2 per cent to $25.10. The world’s largest maker of personal computers was among the day’s best performing equities after a report from Gartner, the researching firm, that said total global shipments rose 1.9 per cent to 89 million units in the first quarter.Groupon, the offers and daily deals website, rose 3.7 per cent to $13.56, moving away from an all-time low struck earlier in the week. Shares in the company are down more than 32 per cent from its debut price of $20 last November.Aluminium manufacturer Alcoa continued to add to its gains after reporting better than expected first-quarter results. Shares in the company rose another 2.7 per cent to $10.17.
222;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-04-08T22:47:17Z;Rivals push merger scenario for AMR;;In recent weeks AMR, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, has made the case to its creditors, customers and employees that it should remain a standalone carrier, using Chapter 11 to restructure its operations and position itself for future success.Behind the scenes, however, rivals have been pushing a different theory to many of the same constituents, arguing that AMR must merge with another US carrier as a way to revitalise its network and smooth the reorganisation process.Advocates present a long list of reasons for a merger. Foremost is the state of AMR’s domestic network, particularly on the US east coast, which appears to have lost traction with lucrative business customers following large airline deals such as the United-Continental tie-up in 2010.AMR accepts that it has work to do but sees organic growth at its hubs as the solution. The company plans to increase departures by 20 per cent in five cities and intends to use bigger regional aircraft and shift more flying to third parties to boost revenues and improve efficiency.Even so, observers worry that AMR may struggle to match its rivals. Unions are opposed to what they see as more outsourcing, and in New York the carrier is hampered by its JFK hub, where capacity constraints make it hard to add domestic flights.All of that, supporters say, points towards a merger with another US carrier with a large domestic network. Both Delta Air Lines and US Airways would fit the bill and are examining a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.Any deal would also have potential financial benefits. Previous large-scale airline mergers have produced revenue and cost synergies of up to $1.5bn. That is money that could be used to pay unsecured claims, boost profits and revamp AMR’s ageing fleet.A tie-up with Delta would give AMR heft in markets such as Los Angeles and Asia where it has a limited presence. But a deal would tear apart one of the three main airline alliances and would likely raise substantial antitrust issues.By contrast, a US Airways deal would alter, but not fundamentally reshape, the industry landscape. JPMorgan estimates that a tie-up would push AMR’s non-hub US domestic market share from fourth position on the eastern and western regions to second.Benefits would trickle down to AMR’s influential Oneworld alliance partners too. The grouping lags behind its peers in terms of scale and securing a defection from the rival Star Alliance would add dozens of new destinations in the eastern region.“US Airways and American, that’s potentially a positive development,” Willie Walsh, head of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, said in February after noting the regulatory hurdles to a potential Delta-AMR deal.“[However], I’m sure American would want to control that,” he added, “and they’re not very enthusiastic about the sounds that have come from Doug Parker [chief executive] at US Airways”.Certainly pulling off a transaction will be tough. In public AMR insists that it will only consider consolidation after emerging from Chapter 11. For now the carrier says it is “laser focused” on its own plans to cut costs by $2bn and boost sales by $1bn.AMR has also moved effectively to box out third parties. In March, the company secured an extended exclusivity period from the bankruptcy court, giving it the right to lead the restructuring until September. AMR can petition to extend that period for up to 18 months.The same month, the carrier offered a major concession to the US pension insurance agency in what observers described as an effort to appease an influential player that might otherwise have been tempted to ally with outside groups to secure a better deal.That may be for the best, says Adam Pilarski, with Avitas, the aviation consultancy. The last thing AMR needs, he says, is additional complexity on top of the challenging bankruptcy process.He adds that US Airways comes with plenty of baggage. The airline is still grappling with the legacy of a previous merger with America West Airlines that left its pilots locked in a protracted internecine court battle.Indeed, US Airways has its own imperatives for pursuing a deal. While the carrier has worked hard to become profitable, industry consolidation has left it stuck in the middle, “neither fish nor fowl”, says Mr Pilarski, “too big to be nimble like Allegiant Air, too small to be a global competitor.”Moreover, it is unclear who would run a combined carrier. “US Airways management would have to quit to make a deal with AMR work,” says one industry banker. “The social issues are solvable but I think they are solvable on AMR’s terms.”Bill Swelbar, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation, argues that there is something slightly artificial about the drumbeat of stories on consolidation, fostered by well-timed leaks, that imply AMR must merge with US or Delta or perish.“American has other options,” he says. AMR already plans to extend its code-sharing agreements with Alaska Airlines and JetBlue and either of those carriers, with their strengths on the western and eastern regions respectively, could make a handy merger partner.Mr Swelbar sees no reason why AMR can’t wait until it completes its restructuring process – and determines the viability of its new network – before looking for a partner. “The speculation is that this has to happen now, and I am not sure it does.”
223;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Pinnacle files for bankruptcy protection;;Pinnacle Airlines Corp, a US regional carrier which flies short haul routes for United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, blaming a mix of higher costs and problems integrating acquisitions.The company said it would use the Chapter 11 process to restructure its contracts with Delta and other customers, exit unprofitable business, cut its labour costs and refocus its fleet around more fuel efficient aircraft.“Quite simply, our current business model is not sustainable,” Sean Menke, chief executive of Pinnacle, said in a statement, pointing to the company’s fragile balance sheet, rising operating costs and repeated delays in integrating recent acquisitions.In 2007 and 2010 Pinnacle purchased two rivals, Colgan Air and Mesaba Aviation, as part of a broader wave of consolidation within the US regional airline industry, designed to respond to high oil prices and lower fees for service.But those moves have added integration expenses to Pinnacle’s costs, contributing to a run of losses at the airline. The company has more than 7,500 employees and operates more than 1,540 daily flights to 188 cities.After experiencing rapid growth in the past decade as mainline carriers chose to outsource their flying to third parties with lower costs, in recent years the US regional airline industry has come under increasing pressure.Typically regional airlines provide short haul capacity for larger carriers under long term contracts that reimburse them for variable costs such as fuel. But increasingly companies such as Delta and United have attempted to shift more financial risks to their suppliers.“Regional airlines have been forced to bid ever-lower rates and accept increasingly unfavorable contract terms to win the business of major carriers. These sacrifices have drained regional carriers,” John Spanjers, chief operating officer of Pinnacle, said in a court filing.In 2011 capacity flown by regional carriers declined for only the second time since the 1970s and US regional airlines lost about $0.5bn according to US regulators. Two of the biggest regionals, Pinnacle and American Eagle, a unit of AMR Corp, are now in bankruptcy protection.“The majors need the feed the regionals provide,” Helane Becker, with Dahlman Rose, wrote in a note to clients, “but the revenue reimbursement rates are currently below the regional airlines’ cost of providing the service.”In court documents Pinnacle said that it had assets of about $1.5bn and debts of about $1.4bn. Creditors include customers, a handful of airports and suppliers aircraft parts and maintenance services.Mr Menke said that the company had secured $74.3m of financing from Delta to help it restructure. About $44.3m of the funds will be used to repay an outstanding note held by Delta while the rest will support its operations.“Our objective is to emerge from this process as a stronger, more focused company, with a revised business model, a substantially improved cost structure and operating agreements that will position us for profitable growth in the future,” he said.
224;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-03-25T21:25:15Z;IAG weighs its north Atlantic options;;The owner of British Airways is close to appointing an adviser to help safeguard its north Atlantic joint venture with American Airlines.International Airlines Group, parent of BA and Spain’s Iberia, will use an adviser to help it evaluate options.The joint venture is in doubt because AMR, American’s parent, filed for bankruptcy in November to cut its debt load and reduce operating costs.Delta Air Lines and US Airways, American’s rivals, are considering bidding for AMR. TPG, a private equity firm with considerable experience in aviation, is also looking at the possibility of an offer.But any bids might not materialise for some time. Under bankruptcy rules, AMR could have 18 months in which to determine its own reorganisation plans and bat away proposals from third parties.IAG declined to comment.The BA owner reported a pre-tax profit of €542m for the year to December 31, underlining the fact that the carrier is benefiting from the strength of its north Atlantic partnership. The joint business involves co-ordinated flight schedules to offer a more frequent service, notably to business customers.BA and American are both members of OneWorld, a global airline alliance.However, IAG’s joint venture with American would be undermined if Delta, the largest US airline by revenue, acquired AMR.Delta already has a north Atlantic joint business, with Air France-KLM, and the two companies belong to SkyTeam, another global airline alliance.In February, Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said Delta was likely to struggle to secure regulatory clearance to combine with American, because the merged entity would be so large.However, a merger between American and US Airways, the fifth-largest US airline, would be “potentially a positive development”, Mr Walsh said. Such a combination would have a better chance of obtaining regulatory clearance than one involving Delta.US Airways is a member of the Star global airline alliance, and if it did merge with American, some people close to the situation said the combined entity would probably choose to be a OneWorld member.Another possibility for IAG would be to participate in a takeover of AMR led by a US company, such as TPG.Mr Walsh wants IAG to be a consolidator in aviation, but foreign ownership rules bar a non-US company from owning more than a 25 per cent voting stake in a US airline.In February he played down the idea of IAG buying a stake in AMR, saying: “We’re not looking to invest in American.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui and Helen Thomas
225;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Export finance issue divides Washington;;An obscure debate about export finance has erupted into an only-in-Washington political battle that pitches President Barack Obama against congressional Republicans, the business lobby against conservative campaigners, and Boeing against one of its largest customers, Delta Air Lines.The row is over an increase to the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank – the agency that provides credit guarantees for US sales overseas – which is nearing a $100bn ceiling.If an increase does not pass Congress, it could hand a windfall of extra business to exporters in Europe, China and Japan as the US shuts off guarantees for big ticket sales such as aircraft and those to riskier emerging markets.On Tuesday, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed for a four-year extension in the bank’s charter and an increase in the lending cap to $140bn. Any increase must also pass the House, where Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, is pushing for a shorter extension and an increase in the cap to only $113bn.The Obama administration sees ExIm as a tool in its drive to double US exports and it has expanded rapidly since the start of the financial crisis as private banks pulled back. ExIm says that it could hit a $113bn cap as soon as this autumn because it has a large pipeline of business.“While we here in the United States are wringing our hands, our competitors are licking their chops,” said Fred Hochberg, the chairman of ExIm and an Obama administration appointee. “At risk are 1,000 American jobs for each working day of the year.”But Mr Cantor’s office says his goal is to protect taxpayers from the credit risk brought by a rapid increase in the ExIm balance sheet while pushing for international reductions in export subsidies. “Under the Senate bill, the ExIm cap would go from $50-60bn in recent decades to $140bn a few years from now, and that is significant growth by any appreciable standard,” said an aide to Mr Cantor.Behind the policy battle is a vicious political and lobbying war. Conservative groups have rallied against ExIm, denouncing export finance as “corporate welfare” and “market-distorting subsidies”. Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth, which keep conservative voting scorecards that can make or break Republican politicians, have declared opposition to ExIm is a “key vote”.But members of Congress have to upset somebody because the US Chamber of Commerce, a leading business voice, has declared that on its scorecard the “key vote” must be in favour of ExIm. “Failure to reauthorise ExIm would amount to America’s unilateral disarmament in the face of other nations’ aggressive trade finance programs,” said the Chamber in a letter to the Senate.The vote on ExIm’s future has also stirred up a simmering row between Boeing, the single largest beneficiary of ExIm support, and US airlines which say their foreign rivals get subsidised finance to buy aircraft while they do not.Last November, the industry’s lobby group, Airlines for America, sued ExIm over a $3.4bn deal to support the sale of 30 aircraft to Air India. Delta Air Lines has complained of being forced out of the New York to Mumbai route.“Our position is that there’s no positive impact from a deal like Air India and that there’s potential harm to the airline industry,” said David Berg, general counsel of Airlines for America. Mr Berg says that the airline industry would like to see the cost of export credit brought up to commercial levels but it does not oppose the reauthorisation of ExIm.

228;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-03-05T17:38:18Z;IAG eyes luring Delta into Oneworld pact;;The head of International Airlines Group has insisted that it could prosper from American Airlines’ potential involvement in consolidation of the US carrier market.Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the Oneworld global alliance – which the group’s UK and Spanish airlines belong to – should be able to recruit Delta Air Lines if it combined with American, already a Oneworld member.It emerged in January that Delta, a leading member of the rival SkyTeam carrier alliance, is evaluating the case for bidding for AMR, American’s parent company.AMR filed for bankruptcy last November, and the possibility of it participating in industry consolidation after its planned restructuring has created uncertainty about the future shape of the global airline alliances.Asked if he thought a Delta-American entity could be persuaded to choose the Oneworld alliance instead of SkyTeam, Mr Walsh said: “Personal view – most definitely.“It is no secret that Air France-KLM needs to embark on some serious restructuring. They are facing a much bigger challenge than any of the other major European carriers through 2012, 2013, so …I have no doubt whatsoever that IAG would represent a much more attractive partner than Air France-KLM.”Air France-KLM reports its 2011 results on Thursday, and analysts are expecting an operating loss of €263m. In January the airline – the most leveraged of the three large European flag carriers – announced a new restructuring programme. Delta has an important transatlantic joint venture with Air France, under which the two airlines collaborate to provide services between Europe and the US. IAG has a similar joint venture with American.Analysts are divided as to whether regulators would allow a merger between Delta and American, given that the combined entity could become the dominant US carrier. But they said that if regulatory hurdles were overcome, any Delta-American entity would have to choose between the Air-France and IAG joint ventures, and between the SkyTeam and Oneworld alliancesAndrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, said that IAG had a “good chance” of persuading a Delta-American entity to choose Oneworld over SkyTeam. “IAG has also therefore got a good chance of drawing the Delta-American entity into its transatlantic joint venture,” he added.But Jarrod Castle, analyst at RBS, said that he believed a Delta-American entity would be most likely to stay with SkyTeam.Several analysts said that American may be more likely to pursue a merger with US Airways, the fifth-largest US carrier, than Delta, partly because the regulatory hurdles would be less difficult to overcome.
229;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-03-05T16:39:17Z;American eyes route out of bankruptcy;;American Airlines has always done things a bit differently. Decades ago the US carrier pioneered the concept of frequent flyer miles, developed the earliest computer reservation systems and was one of the first to adopt two-tier wages for its staff.It is perhaps no surprise then that after filing for Chapter 11 in November 2011, almost 10 years after many of its peers, in recent weeks American has laid out an unorthodox business plan to carry it through the bankruptcy process.While airlines have traditionally used bankruptcy to shrink to a profitable core, over the next five years American intends to cut costs by $2bn but also to increase departures from its key hubs by 20 per cent and boost its revenues by $1bn.“This, in my view, is a different kind of restructuring,” Tom Horton, the new chief executive of AMR, American’s parent company, told journalists after unveiling the strategy. “It’s not about shrinkage. It’s about renewal and growth.”The plans are certainly ambitious for a company that has spent 10 years searching in vain for a financial turnround. In 2011, American was the only major US airline to lose money, reporting a net loss of $2bn, including restructuring charges.In spite of their recent success, carriers such as Delta Air Lines are being parsimonious with new routes and new flights, choosing to hold down capacity in order to prop up their pricing power in the face of high fuel costs.Still, there are good reasons for American’s different approach. In the first place, while previous airline bankruptcies occurred en masse, this time American alone is in Chapter 11. If it scales back, its peers are more than able to step in.“In order to be relevant to the business traveller American needs to be in important markets. So you could argue that by growing with better, newer equipment AMR can become the carrier it once was,” says one industry banker.To win over high value-corporate customers and trim fuel costs, American plans to spend heavily on buying new aircraft and upgrading old equipment. The company has reaffirmed its 2011 orders for 460 new jets worth about $40bn at list prices.Then too, AMR, and the US industry, has already shrunk substantially. Virasb Vahidi, chief commercial officer at American, says the carrier has been slimming down for a decade, focusing its flying on Miami, Dallas, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.Indeed, Mr Vahidi argues that in some respects the company is too small, and has been missing out on profitable revenues because of restrictive labour contracts that limit the number of large regional jets it can use to feed its more lucrative international network.“Our best corporate customers demand that we have frequency of service in key markets because they want to fly when they want to fly. They don’t want to fly when we tell them to fly, so today … they get attracted to [competitors],” Mr Vahidi says.American estimates that correcting those problems could generate an extra $660m of revenues a year within five years, with the rest of the $1bn in targeted sales coming from international joint ventures and expanded domestic partnerships.Certainly, American has ground to make up. Since focusing on its five key hubs in late 2009, revenue growth per available seat mile flown at American has lagged behind its peers, trailing as much as 5 per cent in some quarters.Still, Hunter Keay, analyst at Wolfe Trahan, worries that it may be too late for AMR to respond effectively. At best, he says, the company can hope to match rivals, but not beat them, on schedule or pricing because of its financial frailty.For the moment, American is focused on its cost-cutting goals. Bill Swelbar, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation, says the carrier must find $2bn simply to catch up with average industry margins.In bankruptcy American will have room to force through changes to existing contracts if it can convince a court that such moves are necessary. It is targeting 13,000 job reductions and substantial concessions from the workers that survive the cull.That may be tough to achieve. Unions have described the plans as “draconian” and the pilots have sued to oppose them. At the very least, the process may further sour the work environment just as the company needs to win over customers.And if the company does stumble at all, its more profitable peers are ready to pounce. According to people familiar with the matter, US Airways, Delta and other investor groups are all exploring a possible combination with American once it emerges from Chapter 11 protection.
230;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-03-03T04:07:28Z;Exiled to the mainstream;Karl Jenkins is widely derided in serious musical circles for the overly tuneful and accessible nature of his work;In the middle of the 1990s, while the puerile battles of the Britpop bands were dominating headlines, a very different piece of music was worming its way into the public’s consciousness. It was less than a minute long and featured in a television advertisement for Delta Air Lines. Despite that less than promising provenance, it was almost radical in form. A choir sang meaningless syllables over a dense backbeat of percussion as aeroplanes floated in the heavenly skies. The piece was instantly memorable, and viewers demanded more. Its composer, Karl Jenkins, duly obliged, and the Adiemus phenomenon was born.Jenkins today holds a remarkable distinction. His record company quotes from a survey that describes him as the most-performed living composer in the world. Adiemus spawned five albums and his mass The Armed Man has been performed nearly 1,000 times in 20 countries since its millennium premiere. “That’s twice a week, isn’t it?” he asks me over coffee in a central London office. We take an age to do some primary school calculations. He is right. “I am critic-proof,” he says cheerily. “Whatever anyone says, it makes no difference.”The critics have indeed had lots to say. Jenkins is widely derided in serious musical circles for the overly tuneful and accessible nature of his work. Some of the dirtiest words in the English cultural lexicon – “fusion”, “crossover”, “Classic FM” – are regularly applied to his pieces. If he cares, he isn’t showing it.His new album, released later this month, is The Peacemakers, and it seems almost designed to attract further scorn. It is a choral work, featuring texts from, as Jenkins himself confesses, “the usual suspects”: Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela. What those choices lack in originality is compensated for by Jenkins’s unswerving idealism. He composed The Armed Man, he says, looking forward to a century of peace. The Peacemakers is a nudge to remind us to take the imperative more seriously.Jenkins, a burly but soft-spoken Welshman with a splendid handlebar moustache, says his music is both tuneful and explicitly spiritual, which he realises, in the context of 21st-century composition, places him out on a limb. Like a whole raft of composers of his generation – he is 68 – he became disillusioned with the strictures of the “dissonant, ugly” classical music that was in fashion at the time of his musical education at the University of Wales and the Royal Academy of Music.His commitment to a good tune is profound. “It is connected with nature. Pythagoras wrote about it. Tonality is a hugely important tool. I don’t think you can create emotional music without tonality.” The young composer turned towards jazz, and then jazz-rock, as a member of the highly influential Soft Machine. I was among those mesmerised by the band’s effortless cool and noodling improvisations.…But the group was riven by internal disputes and Jenkins moved to London, where a series of chance meetings led to a commission to write music for a Boots commercial in 1984. From interminable improvisations to 30-second soundbites – that must have been a culture shock? It was, he says, but reminds me that advertising was in one of its most creative periods, featuring directors such as Alan Parker, Ridley Scott and Hugh Hudson. The concision required by his new paymasters was attractive to him, at least initially.Ironically, it was making the Delta commercial that broadened his musical outlook far more than all those years studying harmonics and counterpoint. “They wanted something ethnic. So I did a lot of research, learning all about these pockets of musical culture which I hadn’t come across.” The result was a form of world music that swept the world.Jenkins says he is perfectly content to plough his own furrow, existing outside the realm of what is labelled “classical” music. But, I ask, how did that exile happen? “I really don’t know,” he replies, unconcerned. “I write accessible tunes, and people don’t like it. If you can’t write memorable tunes in pop or musical theatre, then you fail. But classical music got more and more difficult until there was nowhere left to go.”He says he is humbled by the responses to his choral music, many of them from those who have suffered bereavement, who find solace in his meditative works. “I have no ego. I know that compared to the masters, I am insignificant. I have always been a musical tourist. But I have made a lot of people sing who would not otherwise have sung. That’s my little contribution.”‘The Peacemakers’ is released on March 26 and receives its UK premiere at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, on May 19peter.aspden@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/aspden
231;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-02-23T15:39:10Z;Prioritising at business school;;The end of term is close and life is getting very busy. Exams, papers, projects, internships, and networking events – there is no limit to what I should be spending my time on.I was speaking to a friend about this challenge and he told me his business school mantra. He asks himself: “Will this help me achieve my MBA goals?” If the answer is no, then he does not do it.This is a simple but powerful insight, both for business school and beyond. It has an amazing culling effect, separating the wheat from the chaff. Understanding what your goals are and how you achieve them simplifies life and makes the whole experience more rewarding.The chief executive of Delta Airlines spoke to our class the other week about the power of saying no. He understands that time is his most limited resource and that it must be used wisely. As a result, he only attends certain events and limits speaking engagements. This gives him more time to engage with his employees, solve problems and spend time with his family.Before you can practise this lesson however, you need to know what those goals are. During the orientation weekend, our dean described the MBA experience as a three-legged stool: education, networking and job search. If you remove one of the legs, then the stool falls over and you won’t have a successful business school experience. There is a great deal of truth to this statement.However, the emphasis that each “leg” receives will differ over time. For instance, internships loom large during the second term of first year. This is a huge change from the first term when grades and meeting new people were the primary drivers. And from my talks with second year students I have discovered that networking is paramount both before and after landing a job.But this shifting emphasis must not distract you from the ultimate goal of business school. It is important to keep your goals in mind, whether it is finding a job in a new industry, broadening your network for future entrepreneurial ventures, or advancing your career with your previous employer.And if you are going to spend time on other projects (read: blogging for the FT), then make sure they are helping you to achieve your long-term goals.
232;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-02-08T11:31:49Z;BA to team up with Japan Airlines;;International Airlines Group and Japan Airlines on Wednesday announced plans for a joint venture that would seek to maximise the profitability of routes between Europe and Japan.JAL and British Airways, IAG’s UK subsidiary, want to create a partnership business that would co-ordinate flight schedules between Europe and Japan and share revenues.A number of airlines are forming joint ventures on their core routes because foreign ownership rules in many countries prohibit mergers between carriers.Such partnerships are more important than the three global airline alliances – Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star – because the joint ventures can combine their schedules to provide more daily flights to lucrative business customers. The alliances are looser arrangements aimed at promoting code-sharing between the participating carriers.However, the joint ventures have been subjected to intense scrutiny by regulators to determine whether they are adversely affecting passengers by limiting competitive pressure on ticket prices.On Wednesday, JAL asked Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for antitrust immunity so the airline can co-operate with BA on flights between Europe and Japan. IAG has also presented the joint venture plans to the European Commission.BA and JAL are both members of the Oneworld alliance, and Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, said: “We have very close links with JAL and look forward to enhancing that relationship further.“Despite the difficulties the Japanese aviation market has faced in recent years, we have great confidence in JAL’s business outlook and the overall market’s future prospects.”JAL filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation subsequently invested Y350bn in a revival plan for the airline, and it is now generating profits. A public offering and relisting could happen this year.Mr Walsh last year raised the possibility of IAG investing in JAL once it re-emerged from bankruptcy, although foreign ownership rules mean it would only be allowed a minority stake.IAG feared JAL could defect from Oneworld to SkyTeam, but it has decided to stick with its existing alliance.Masaru Onishi, JAL’s president, said: “JAL seeks to continue improving customer experiences all around, including through tighter cooperation with our quality partners as the industry liberalises.”JAL last year established a joint venture with American Airlines, the leading US carrier in Oneworld, on Pacific routes. All Nippon Airways – another major Japanese airline – has a partnership with United Continental on Pacific routes. ANA has a joint venture with Lufthansa on routes between Japan and Europe.US and European airlines have formed joint ventures on North Atlantic routes. Lufthansa collaborates with United Continental, Air-France KLM with Delta Air Lines and IAG with American Airlines.
233;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-02-06T21:26:16Z;Europe’s flag-carriers take a dive;;Europe’s leading low-cost airlines are thriving in the economic downturn but the region’s flag-carriers are finding it much tougher.Amid the European Union’s sovereign debt crisis, consumers and business people are saving money when travelling inside the European Union by flying with budget airlines rather than flag-carriers.The outcome is manifesting itself in industry results. Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost airline by revenue, last week raised its profit forecast for 2011-12 from €440m ($577m) to €480m. By contrast, Lufthansa, Europe’s largest flag-carrier by revenue, issued a profit warning last September. Air France-KLM, the second-largest flag-carrier, said in November it expected to report an operating loss in 2011.Furthermore, the low-cost carriers are well-placed to exploit the collapse of some of Europe’s state-backed airlines.Ryanair on Friday announced it would open an operating base in Budapest – just hours after Malev Hungarian Airlines, Hungary’s flag-carrier, ceased operations because its finances had become unviable.Ryanair was able to pounce after grounding 80 aircraft this winter in response to high fuel prices, and the Irish airline is putting four Boeing 737 jets into Budapest.“Grounding 80 aircraft this winter has provided Ryanair with the rapid response unit that can exploit market openings like this,” says Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham.Ryanair is also considering expanding services in Barcelona after the collapse this month of Spanair, a carrier based in Catalonia’s regional capital. Spanair ceased flying after failing to secure funds from the Catalonian administration.Analysts predict more airline failures in Europe because there are simply too many carriers.Most forecast Europe will be left with three large flag-carriers – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia. However, analysts are divided on whether Norwegian Air Shuttle, which last month placed an order for 222 aircraft, can join Ryanair and EasyJet in the top tier of European low-cost carriers.A combination of the deteriorating economic environment and high fuel prices is undermining some airlines. In the past, flag-carriers might have expected bail-outs from governments, but the Malev and Spanair cases show that budget-constrained administrations do not necessarily have the funds.Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, envisages a combination of airline collapses and industry consolidation after estimating that 21 of Europe’s top 40 airlines had a market share of less than 1 per cent in 2011 when measured by the number of seats they provide on the region’s short-haul routes.He highlights how the top five airlines in the US – Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United-Continental, American Airlines and US Airways – controlled 86 per cent of domestic seating capacity in 2011. By contrast, the top five in Europe – Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France-KLM, EasyJet and IAG – controlled just 45 per cent of intra-EU capacity.Mr van Klaveren says Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG will survive because they have profitable long-haul networks.“All of [Europe’s] second-tier legacy airlines are at risk,” he adds. “It is quite difficult to see how they will be viable in the long term.”Some second-tier carriers with a niche role may survive by combining with one of the three big groups.For example, IAG is interested in buying Transportes Aereos Portugeses, the Portuguese flag-carrier that is due to be privatised, because it has a strong long-haul network to Brazil.“[European flag-carriers] that do not have strategic relevance like Malev will be under extreme pressure,” says Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.
234;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-01-27T18:27:11Z;Brussels launches probe into airline alliance;;Brussels has stepped up its scrutiny of the partnerships that underpin the transatlantic airline business by launching an investigation on Friday into a joint venture between Air France-KLM, Alitalia and Delta Air Lines.The European Commission is examining “as a matter of priority” whether the partnership is harming the interests of passengers by limiting the competitive pressure on ticket prices for some key transatlantic routes.The Commission is already investigating a similar joint venture involving Lufthansa and United-Continental, although it has given regulatory clearance to a partnership between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia.The three joint ventures have assumed a dominant position on routes between Europe and the US, controlling three-quarters of north Atlantic seating capacity, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.The transatlantic routes are some of the most profitable in the world, and airlines participating in the joint ventures are combining their schedules to offer more daily flights, notably to higher-spending business passengers.The competition authority, outlining its probe into the joint venture between Air France-KLM, Alitalia and Delta, said: “The Commission will investigate whether the partnership may harm passengers on certain EU-US routes where, in the absence of the joint venture, the parties would be providing competing services.”The investigation narrows a previous inquiry, which the Commission closed formally on Friday, into SkyTeam, one of the three global airline alliances.Air-France-KLM and Delta are leading members of SkyTeam, and the Commission said their joint venture “represents the deepest form of co-operation within SkyTeam and aims at the alignment of the parties’ commercial incentives”.Air-France-KLM, Alitalia and Delta co-ordinate their transatlantic fares and share revenues and profits generated by the partnership.The Commission’s investigation into the joint venture between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia, concluded in 2010, resulted in the airlines relinquishing peak time take-off and landing slots at London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK airports, so that the rights could be reallocated to competing carriers.Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the joint venture involving Air-France-KLM and Delta may have to give up some slots at JFK, although he did not think the partnership was “at risk” because of the Commission’s investigation.Air France-KLM did not rule out having to make concessions to the Commission, but expressed confidence it would secure regulatory clearance for the joint venture with Delta.Delta said it was “confident” the airline would resolve “any concerns” the Commission had about the joint venture with Air France-KLM. Alitalia said it would co-operate with the investigation.

Excluding special items, the company reported net income of $109m, or about $0.30 cents per share.Still, revenues were resilient, rising about 6 per cent to $8.9bn as the company benefited from full aircraft and higher ticket prices. Average fares rose to $269.82 from $242.95 in the quarter compared to the same period a year earlier.Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of about $0.13 cents per share, excluding special items, on revenues of about $8.9bn. In pre-market trading United shares rose about 4 per cent to $21.22.“We made significant progress in 2011 building the world’s leading airline, while running a clean, safe and reliable operation,” said Jeff Smisek, chief executive of United said, and the company noted that it continued to proceed apace with the merger integration.In late 2010, United Airlines and Continental Airlines completed a $3.2bn all-stock merger creating the world’s largest carrier measured by revenues, and last year the companies reached an important milestone, receiving a single operating certificate from US regulators.In recent weeks, airline analysts have become more optimistic on the outlook for US carriers, pointing to their willingness to cut flights and raise prices to offset fuel costs and sustain profitability.On Wednesday, US Airways and Delta Air Lines enjoyed a notable share price bounce after the companies posted strong results indicating a mixture of careful capacity management and solid demand from both corporate and leisure travellers.On Thursday, United indicated that it would also maintain tight control over capacity in the coming year in an effort to mitigate the impact of rising labour costs and high oil prices. In the fourth quarter, fuel costs rose $660m compared to the previous year.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Excluding certain one-off items, such as gains on the sale of airport landing slots, net income more than doubled to $379m.Revenues meanwhile increased 8 per cent to $8.4bn compared with the same period last year, thanks to a solid domestic performance and particularly strong pricing and demand in the Atlantic and Pacific regions.“Delta people pulled together in 2011 to produce a solid profit, strong cash generation and the best operational performance in the industry for our customers,” said Richard Anderson, chief executive.“Looking forward to 2012, we will continue our commitment to sustained profitability and superior returns by growing and diversifying our revenues, while taking a disciplined approach to capacity, costs and capital spending,” he added.Delta shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $9.96Meanwhile, US Airways said that its earnings fell in the December quarter compared to the previous year, although the company remained profitable. Net income dipped to $18m from $28m on revenues that climbed about 8.5 per cent to $3.2bn.Still, management said the carrier had seen no sign that macroeconomic uncertainty was impacting its business and added that corporate demand remained strong. Investors cheered the positive comments, bidding the shares up 17.3 per cent to $7.52.In recent weeks insiders have identified Delta as one of several groups exploring a potential bid for AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, but on Wednesday the company batted away speculation.US Airways however confirmed that it had appointed advisers to examine its options. The company has a record of attempted and successful mergers but its chief executive said the carrier did not need to do a deal and ruled out any quick moves.Despite concerns about the debt crisis in Europe, airline analysts in recent months have become more optimistic on the outlook for US carriers, pointing to their willingness to cut flights and raise prices to offset fuel costs and sustain profitability.In the fourth quarter, both Delta and US Airways benefited from such moves, cutting capacity and squeezing more passengers on to their aircraft. Delta plans to cut capacity by up to 3 per cent in 2012 while US Airways will increase capacity by 1 per cent.“The industry is poised for earnings improvement in 2012, even amid an uncertain economic backdrop,” analysts at Barclays wrote recently. “Capacity reductions …were well timed and should offset concerns about potential revenue weakness.”Deutsche Bank expects the US airline industry to post a net profit of $180m and an operating profit of $1.1bn for the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as a net profit of $2.1bn and an operating profit of $6.3bn for the full year.

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company.

239;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-01-16T17:55:20Z;AMR takeover could put alliances in doubt;;The three transatlantic airline partnerships are set to be thrown into turmoil should AMR, parent of American Airways, be acquired by one of its rivals, industry experts are warning.AMR filed for bankruptcy in November to restructure itself, but last week it emerged that Delta Air Lines, the largest US carrier by revenue, is considering the case for making a bid for American’s parent.Analysts say that if Delta succeeds with a bid, and manages to clear the high hurdle of securing regulatory clearance, it will almost certainly have to choose between retaining its existing transatlantic partnership with Air France-KLM, or opting instead for one with International Airlines Group.IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has a joint venture with American that represents the European airline’s most important industry partnership.Analysts say a takeover of AMR could destabilise or – in a worst-case scenario – kill the joint venture between IAG and American.Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, says: “Were American to be taken over, all its commercial arrangements would be under review. There is no reason why that would not extend to the joint venture with BA and Iberia.”IAG’s joint venture with American was the last of the three transatlantic quasi-mergers to be finalised– in addition to Delta’s joint venture with Air France-KLM, United-Continental has a partnership with Germany’s Lufthansa – after being granted antitrust immunity by regulators in 2010.Last spring, BA and American began co-ordinating their schedules and fares on routes including those between London and New York, in a move that should particularly appeal to higher-spending business travellers.The three transatlantic joint ventures are designed to maximise revenue on lucrative long haul routes, and build on arrangements inside the three global airline alliances – Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star – that promote code-sharing between member carriers.As well as Delta, which is part of SkyTeam, it is expected that United-Continental and US Airways – the second- and fifth-largest US carriers, respectively – will evaluate whether to make offers for AMR. United-Continental and US Airways are both Star members.Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, says a Delta-AMR merger would face intense regulatory scrutiny, although he does not rule out such a deal securing clearance.He adds that a Delta-AMR group would be tempted to have a transatlantic joint venture with IAG rather than Air France-KLM, partly because of BA’s strong position at London’s Heathrow airport, Europe’s most important gateway to the US.Regulators would almost certainly object to Delta participating in two of the three transatlantic joint ventures.IAG – a Oneworld member – declined to comment, but said after AMR’s bankruptcy filing last November: “Our joint business … continues to operate as usual.”Two people familiar with IAG’s thinking express strong doubts that Delta will be allowed to buy American – also part of Oneworld – on antitrust grounds.IAG is hoping that AMR will restructure and emerge stronger from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, just as some of its rivals did in the previous decade.Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, says a merger between AMR and US Airways might have a better chance of securing regulatory approval than a Delta or United-Continental takeover of American’s parent.He adds that a AMR-US Airways combination would have a smaller US market share compared with a merger involving Delta or United-Continental.Any final decisions on bids for AMR are likely to be several months away. Under bankruptcy rules, AMR’s management has up to 18 months during which the company can determine its own restructuring plan and reject proposals from third parties.
240;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-01-15T17:15:21Z;Virgin plots a course through crowded airspace;;Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic airline has consistently punched above its weight since it was founded in 1984, emerging as a formidable competitor to British Airways, as consumers took to Virgin’s quirky brand and customer service.But analysts say Virgin is now at serious risk of being marginalised – and therefore in need of a new partner – because of a series of quasi-mergers between European and US airlines, and the growth of Gulf carriers.Last month, Virgin suffered a significant setback when International Airlines Group – parent of BA and Iberia – trumped Sir Richard’s airline in the bid battle for BMI British Midland, Lufthansa’s lossmaking UK subsidiary. The deal, if approved by regulators, will enhance BA’s already strong grip on London’s Heathrow airport at Virgin’s expense.Steve Ridgway, Virgin’s chief executive, insists he is unfazed by the challenges, and rejects suggestions that the airline is struggling to keep up with its competitors.“I think we were much more marginalised 25 years ago, when we had one or two aircraft, but having the network that we have now, and having the brand that we’ve created, and having the loyalty that we have, I think we’ve still got huge potential,” he says in an interview with the Financial Times.However, Virgin is having to adjust to a much-changed industry landscape. Regulators opened up Heathrow, Virgin’s main home airport, to more US carriers in 2008, but the most negative development has been the formation of a joint venture between BA and American Airlines on routes between the EU and the US.By co-ordinating their schedules and fares between Heathrow and New York’s JFK airport since last summer, BA and American are providing customers - notably higher spending business travellers – with an attractive service compared to competitors. For example, the two airlines have 11 daily flights from Heathrow to JFK, while Virgin has three.Virgin’s market share on the Heathrow to JFK route – measured by seating capacity – has dropped over the past five years, from 24 per cent in 2007 to 20 per cent last year, say Nomura analysts. Although there is some uncertainty around IAG’s joint venture with American – because the US carrier’s parent company last November filed for bankruptcy protection in order to restructure – both partners insist they are committed to their North Atlantic business.Virgin, meanwhile, has expanded its network beyond the US into Africa, Asia and the Middle East. But with Chinese, Indian and Gulf carriers increasing their flights to the UK, it underlines how Virgin’s opportunities in the east could be limited.Expansion opportunities for Virgin will be challenged further if IAG secures regulatory approval – without concessions – for its proposed acquisition of BMI, the second-largest holder of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow.Sir Richard recognised the seriousness of the strategic threats to Virgin in 2010 by launching a wide-ranging review of the airline.Mr Ridgway says Sir Richard is prepared to relinquish his status as controlling shareholder – he owns 51 per cent of the airline – and Singapore Airlines, which has 49 per cent, wants to sell.But so far, Virgin has not found a suitor. Delta Air Lines, which has been expanding at Heathrow since 2008, looked at Virgin last year but balked at the asking price, says one person familiar with the situation.Etihad Airways, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier, also considered Virgin last year but concluded it could not do a deal partly because of foreign ownership restrictions, says one person close to the matter.Mr Ridgway declines to discuss Delta or Etihad, but just as Virgin’s search for a new equity partner is proving protracted, so are its deliberations over joining one of the three global airline alliances.The Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star alliances enable member airlines to offer customers more destinations by code-sharing, as well as other benefits.Given BA is a member of Oneworld, Virgin is in talks about joining either SkyTeam or Star, but Mr Ridgway suggests Virgin will not make a final decision until the future of BMI is resolved.In the meantime, Mr Ridgway insists Virgin can prosper on its own. Like many airlines that benefited from the economic recovery in 2010, Virgin returned to profit. It recorded a pre-tax profit of £18.5m in 2010-11, compared to a loss £132m in the previous year.Mr Ridgway highlights Virgin’s gross cash position, which stood at £562.4m on February 28 2011. Deducting bank loans, Virgin had net cash of £520.8m.“We remain strong on our own,” says Mr Ridgway, before adding pointedly: “And we remain very attractive to potential partners in the future.”
241;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2012-01-12T20:17:39Z;Rival US airlines circle AMR in bankruptcy;;Potential buyers are circling AMR, the parent of American Airlines, to assess whether the bankruptcy of the US’s third-largest carrier presents a fresh opportunity for industry consolidation.People familiar with the matter said that Delta Air Lines had appointed Blackstone to help it consider a bid for American Airlines. However, they added that it was early in the process for would-be buyers to be considering a bid, with any concrete decision likely to be months away.Under bankruptcy rules, AMR’s management has an 18-month “exclusive period” in which the company can determine its own plan of reorganisation and can bat away proposals from third parties.After that period, or once AMR has filed its standalone plan with the court, creditors can propose alternatives, possibly in conjunction with potential buyers.Industry experts said they also expected United Continental and US Airways to look at the possibility of a bid for AMR.AMR filed for bankruptcy protection last November in an effort to reduce its debt burden and squeeze costs after losing ground to rivals for more than a decade.The airline shunned bankruptcy in the early 2000s when competitors reduced pension obligations and labour costs. It has also steadfastly sat out the subsequent wave of consolidation in the industry.The airline may generate interest from private equity groups. TPG is also in the early stages of looking at AMR, given its long history of investments in the airline sector, said people familiar with the matter. The private equity group invested in Continental Airlines in 1993, helping to turn the company round in a highly profitable investment for the group.Delta, AMR, Blackstone and TPG declined to comment. Delta Air Lines’ stock rose 3.8 per cent to $8.94 in afternoon trading in New York after the Wall Street Journal earlier reported Delta and TPG’s interest.Other airlines’ stocks also rallied, with United up 3.7 per cent and US Airways rising 2.5 per cent.Any tie-up between the remaining US airlines would be subject to intense antitrust scrutiny after a series of airlines mergers culminating in the 2010 deal between United and Continental.A Delta-AMR combination, bringing together the country’s second and third largest carriers, could meet considerable opposition from the Department of Justice.However, some industry experts said that the pair had limited overlap in terms of hubs, with the New York region presenting the most obvious problem. The pair also compete on the lucrative transatlantic route, although they predominantly fly from different cities.US Airways, the smallest of the US’s national carriers, has long been considered a logical merger partner for AMR and has been public in its support of further airline consolidation.Analysts at Wolfe Trahan last year said that US Airways offered attractive east coast assets for AMR, but said its fraught relations with its pilots union presented one problem.
242;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-12-16T19:03:15Z;Delta gains slots at NY’s La Guardia airport;;Delta Air Lines has unveiled plans to ramp up its presence at New York La Guardia and pip United Continental to the role of top operator of domestic flights across the city’s three main airports.Using 142 take-off and landing slots it won in a swap with US Airways for slots at Washington’s National Airport, Delta will add 100 new flights at La Guardia – a 60 per cent increase – and make it a hub.While capacity across the airline, the world’s second biggest by passenger traffic, is set to fall by between 2 and 2.5 per cent next year, the number of Delta flights in and out of New York will rise, with most of the expansion coming at the expense of routes to National Airport, said Richard Anderson, chief executive.The slot swap means Delta can grow at La Guardia without the airport experiencing more congestion. But by flying bigger aircraft than those used by US Airways, it should make available about 4m more seats a year.Delta already has a strong presence at New York’s JFK but expanding operations at La Guardia is an important part of its efforts to attract more lucrative business travellers. “A lot of people who fly out of New York really want to fly out of La Guardia” because it is closer to midtown, said Saranthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James.It had attempted a slot swap with US Airways a few years ago but was stymied by regulators concerned about the impact on competition at National Airport. New York, however, was not a sticking point. Gail Grimmett, who runs the airline’s operations in the city, said travellers should not expect price rises on the back of this move. “This is a very competitive market and we want to be the airline of choice for the people of New York,” she said.Delta’s plans at La Guardia, including spending $100m to expand terminals C and D and building a bridge between the two, could add to the woes of bankrupt carrier American Airlines, the incumbent number one at the airport. “If Delta and United Continental [with a strong presence at Newark Airport] are looking for corporate clients, that might be negative for American,” said Ms Syth.Delta is also gunning for American’s Latin American passengers. Like New York, Latin America is an area where capacity should grow in the coming year, Delta said on Friday.Shares rose 4 per cent to $8.95 in afternoon trading.
243;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-12-07T21:30:53Z;Delta takes a $100m punt on Brazil;;"In any other circumstances, an investment of $100m would rarely make headlines.But in today’s suffering airline industry, it can make all the difference, it seems. Delta Air Lines announced on Wednesday it was paying that much for about 3 per cent of the capital of Gol, a Brazilian low-cost airline, in a deal that also gives the US company a seat on the board.While Delta may end up benefiting from the bankruptcy of rival American Airlines, its domestic market still looks very bleak. After signing a $65m deal in August with Grupo Aeromexico, one of Mexico’s biggest carriers, it seems the company is now intent on finding its escape route from the crisis in Latin America.However, the irony is that in ‘booming’ Brazil, Gol is not doing much better. Thanks to a punishing fare war, Gol’s shares had fallen about 40 per cent so far this year – one of the worst performances on Brazil’s stock market.They rose as much as 9 per cent after the deal with Delta was announced on Wednesday morning.A daring deal between the developed and emerging world, or just two invalids banding together for strength perhaps?Here is the take on Gol from Edigimar Maximiliano at Brazil’s Bradesco bank:“We view this deal as very positive: (i) on the operating front, since it will represent the inclusion of Gol in Delta’s global platform; (ii) on the strategic front, since the price paid by Delta, a strategic investor, sets a realistic estimate of the “real” value of Gol’s operations from a competitor’s standpoint; and (iii) on the competitive front, since it ensures rational pricing, avoiding major threats to Gol’s primary market (domestic), considering that Star Alliance partnered with TAM, One World partnered with LAN and Delta Group is now partnering with Gol.”Related reading:

244;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-12-07T18:40:38Z;Delta Air Lines strengthens LatAm presence;Brazilian market has grown at breakneck speed in recent years;Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday that it would invest $100m in Gol Airlines, the low cost Brazilian carrier, in an effort to strengthen its presence in the fast growing Latin American market.Over the past few years Delta, the world’s second biggest carrier by passenger traffic, has made a number of efforts to expand in Latin America and to compete more effectively with American Airlines, the bankrupt carrier that dominates travel from the US to the region thanks to its powerful hub in Miami.In August, Delta signed a similar pact with Grupo Aeromexico, one of the biggest carriers in Mexico, agreeing to invest $65m in the company. Delta has also penned cross-selling deals with Aerolíneas Argentinas, the Argentinian flag-carrier.In return for its investment in Gol, Delta will gain preferred stock amounting to about 3 per cent of the company’s capital and a seat on the board. As part of a broader commercial alliance with Gol, Delta said the two companies would align their sales and loyalty programmes.Delta will also become Gol’s exclusive US partner, which could deal a blow to American Airlines. The third-biggest US carrier currently has a so-called code-share agreement with Gol, allowing it to sell seats on Gol flights and vice versa.For Gol, the investment comes at a welcome moment. Over the past 12 months the biggest domestic carrier in Brazil has been hurt by a punishing fare war that has eroded profitability. Analysts have warned that the airline is close to breaching certain convenants of its debt.“The deal helps us to strengthen our balance sheet and leverage position, which is one of our big objectives, and so allows us to stick to Gol’s concept of being a low-cost airline,” said Constantino de Oliveira Júnior, Gol’s chief executive.On Wednesday, Gol shares climbed as much as 9 per cent in early trading in Brazil. Since the start of the year, Gol’s share price has slumped about 35 per cent on Brazil’s stock exchange, underperforming the Bovespa index, which is down 14 per cent.Still, the Brazilian air transport market remains attractive. It has grown at breakneck speed in recent years thanks to the strength of the domestic economy and an expanding middle class eager to travel for business and for leisure.Analysts expect that trend to continue over the long term, spurred on by continued economic growth and a series of high profile sporting events. In three years' time the country will host the football World Cup and the Olympics in 2016.Barclays Capital advised Delta on the deal while Morgan Stanley advised Gol.
245;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-12-02T19:23:05Z;American Airlines in search of new horizons;;In 2003 American Airlines was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy when it pulled back. After securing substantial concessions from its workers, American said it would not follow its peers into Chapter 11 but would stand behind its obligations.“We are not out of the woods yet,” Gerard Arpey, the then newly appointed chief executive told his staff. “Working with our unions and all of our employees, together we will put American Airlines back on top.”Eight years later, that co-operative approach is in tatters. American Airlines, once the most prestigious brand in aviation, is working its way through the bankruptcy process it fought so hard to avoid and its workers face dramatic cuts to pay and benefits.“Simply put, their strategy didn’t work,” said Adam Pilarski, with aviation consultancy Avitas. “Certainly people said ‘they are honest while the others are all crooks’ but, while that may reserve them a better spot in the afterlife, in practical terms it didn’t help.”Indeed, hobbled by uncompetitive costs, restive employees and a fleet of gas-guzzling aircraft, American continues to lose money, while its rivals, which used the courts to restructure, have returned to profitability.“We fought the good fight,” Tom Horton, the new chief executive of American, said on Tuesday. “We worked honourably to avoid [Chapter 11] but we have to turn the page. Circumstances have changed and we have to make the company competitive.”In bankruptcy, American and its parent company AMR Corporation, will have greater latitude to rewrite labour contracts and tear up leases for older aircraft that are less fuel efficient.American could even move on the offensive, said Will Randow with Citigroup. He notes that on Tuesday shares in US Airways jumped as investors speculated about an eventual tie-up between the two companies.“US Airways has tried to bid for every US legacy airline either inside or outside of bankruptcy,” he said. “Mr Horton is much more open to the consolidation process than his predecessor, and he might even try to make a bid for US Airways himself.”Still, according to Gordon Bethune, who led a turnround at Continental Airlines in the 1990s, bankruptcy is not a panacea. “Bankruptcy will fix your balance sheet and give you a chance. But it won’t fix your company. If you are a shitty company you need to change.”On Thursday morning, Gerard Arpey, the former chief executive of American Airlines, started his new job: partner in Emerald Creek Group, a tiny, Texas-based private equity company that invests in real estate, particularly Californian farm land, writes Jeremy Lemer.The move is a stark change for Mr Arpey, who spent almost 30 years working for American Airlines until abruptly retiring on Tuesday, just as the company entered Chapter 11 protection.Mr Arpey will find at least one familiar face at Emerald Creek. The group is headed by Larry Kellner, former chief executive of Continental Airlines and Mr Arpey’s long-time business rival.In an interview, Mr Kellner said he had made Mr Arpey an off-the-cuff offer to work together some years back but the partnership had actually come together quickly in the last week or so.Mr Kellner, who has a background in real estate, expects Mr Arpey to take to the business quickly.He said: “Real estate is different from running an airline, but I have always believed in working with smart people with great integrity, and that is Gerard.”In the short term, he expects the biggest beneficiaries to be AMR’s competitors. “There will be some migration to Delta Air Lines and United because of the uncertainty at American. Fairly or not, passengers worry about their frequent flyer miles,” he said.Since Tuesday, shares in United and Delta have jumped more than 15 per cent, outpacing the S&P 500 index.Other beneficiaries may include partners such as Alaska Airlines and regional airline operators such as SkyWest, which will be able to provide more of American’s domestic flights if the company uses bankruptcy to jettison restrictive clauses in its labour contracts.But executives expect the global airline industry to benefit broadly as American retrenches. As supply comes down, airlines should be able to take advantage of limited demand by raising, or at least stabilising, prices.“For the industry, the bankruptcy is probably positive because there will be fewer seats flying around. It is one of these bizarre situations where on average this is a pretty good thing,” said Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, an aircraft leasing company.JPMorgan predicts that American will trim as much as 10 per cent of its flying, with cuts focused on markets such as Chicago and New York where rivals are strong.Gary Chase, at Barclays Capital, argues that the American bankruptcy filing, and the pain it is likely to impose on workers, may help other airlines cut better deals with their employees.“AMR is the high bar for labour costs among legacy carriers. If the company aggressively moves to reduce those costs, we believe carriers like United and Delta will experience less pressure on their own labour costs,” Mr Chase wrote to clients.But there are reasons for caution. Despite the sobering developments at American, relations between many airlines and their unions remain contentious. Just this month, pilots at United accused management of skimping on training and compromising safety, a claim the airline dismissed as “baseless”.Vicki Bryan, at Gimme Credit, a bond research company, says her peers may be too optimistic about industry prospects, pointing out that American has already launched cuts in fares to maintain market share.“Given AMR’s size and what will likely prove to be a long, messy restructuring process, its bankruptcy could have a prolonged and depressing effect on already precarious industry pricing and profits as travel demand continues to cool,” she wrote to clients.A faltering economic recovery could overturn any modest industry boost from the AMR bankruptcy. Air cargo volumes, widely seen as a leading indicator for passenger demand, have dropped about 5 per cent since June, according to industry figures.“We cannot ignore the facts. Airline data (has) weakened, and may weaken further, while airline news flow has also deteriorated. It is not all bad, but we would say it is definitely less good,” Rob Stallard of RBC Capital wrote in a note to clients.
246;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-11-29T21:56:03Z;AMR files for bankruptcy protection;;AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in an effort to shed its crippling debt burden and reduce its costs after losing ground to competitors over the past decade.Gerard Arpey, AMR’s long-serving chief executive, is also to retire, the company said.The filing ends of months of speculation about the future of the third-largest US carrier. Its shares have slumped after a run of quarterly losses even as its peers returned to profitability.American chose to forgo bankruptcy protection in the early 2000s while its rivals used the process to shed their pension plans and reduce structural costs, leaving it at a substantial disadvantage.Since then, companies such as United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have only increased their lead. The two American rivals have trimmed their fleets, redesigned their networks and leapfrogged American through big mergers and acquisitions.AMR said in a statement that the filing was difficult but necessary and would allow the company to become more competitive. The airline expects to continue normal operations throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.By seeking Chapter 11 protection, American hopes to force through a radical restructuring that it was unable to accomplish through negotiations with its workforce and unions. Bankruptcy courts have wide latitude to tear up and rewrite labour contracts and other agreements.Mr Arpey, who has worked for American for about 30 years, will be replaced by Tom Horton, the current president.American Airlines “fought the good fight”, Mr Horton said in an interview with the Financial Times, but admitted the company had failed to find a turnround solution short of bankruptcy.In recent weeks, American had been locked in furious talks with its pilots union in an attempt to wrestle down labour costs. But those talks failed to achieve a settlement, pushing the board to act.“The combination of our labour cost gap, the global economic turmoil and high and volatile fuel prices led our board to conclude that this was the time to get on with a full restructuring – when we have ample liquidity to get to a successful outcome,” Mr Horton said.In its bankruptcy filing the company said it had assets of about $25bn and liabilities of about $30bn. The company has about $4bn in cash that analysts said would be enough to finance it through the initial restructuring process.

Last month the Brent-WTI spread reached a jaw-dropping $28.Earlier this year refiner Valero bashed WTI as irrelevant, while Delta Air Lines largely dropped it as a way to hedge fuel costs. Last month the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index, which happens to be marketed by a CME Group subsidiary, said it will add Brent to its basket of futures for the first time.A key reason why WTI has lagged behind is a lack of pipelines that have prevented arbitrageurs from buying up high stocks of cheap crude around Cushing and sending them to the Gulf, closing the price gap in the process. So CME took the uncommon step of publicly congratulating the pipeline companies Enbridge and Enterprise Products Partners for their plans to reverse Seaway to run from instead of to Cushing.“We believe this new project will enhance the significance of our Nymex Light Sweet Crude Oil (WTI) benchmark,” the CME said.The pipeline reversal plan suggests that problems such as WTI’s severe discount are self-correcting. A $28-a-barrel discount is just too tempting for a trader, or a pipeline company, to pass up. As one oil derivatives dealer emailed me: “Finally the levee breaks.”Seaway’s own history illustrates the interplay of market forces and infrastructure. Built to move crude to Cushing, it converted to natural gas service in 1984 before being enlisted to carry crude again in 1996, according to a study CME commissioned last year. This is just the latest fix.
248;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-11-13T16:58:17Z;Airlines poor on ‘soft’ issues, says PwC;;Airlines are doing a poor job of keeping shareholders informed about a range of “soft” measures that can affect the bottom line, from carbon emissions to customer service and board diversity.The industry lags behind other sectors such as mining or oil and gas at consistent and relevant sustainability reporting, according to research by PwC, with fewer than four in 10 of the top 100 airlines by revenues issuing even the most rudimentary of reports.A study by the consultancy found that of those companies which do publish sustainability reports, none were considered “excellent” on criteria including clarity, reliability and “contextual consistency” – meaning readers would find it difficult, if not impossible, to compare one company with another.“The compliance commitment of the airline industry is very good,” said Klaus-Dieter Ruske, a PwC expert on transport and logistics, citing airlines’ ability to follow safety and other regulatory guidelines. “But they’re clearly behind in terms of reporting on sustainability.”Even carbon emissions, the measure most clearly linked to financial performance through fuel costs and emissions trading schemes, were poorly detailed in many of the 46 reports studied.“For those that do report fuel efficiency, the level of detail varies widely – and so do the definitions of how data is calculated,” wrote the report’s authors. They argued customers would struggle to choose an airline on the basis of fuel efficiency.The Global Reporting Initiative, a non-profit organisation, has already created a reporting standard for airport operators, and the European Commission’s inclusion next year of aviation in its emissions trading scheme (ETS) could add pressure for something similar for carriers. International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, said last week that ETS costs would reach €90m in the first year.The PwC study also found companies were inconsistent or lacking in transparency about gender diversity in management teams and on boards, about noise pollution, and about lost baggage, service disruption and customer complaints, in spite of evidence that these factors can have an impact on financial performance.Mr Ruske said the reports were all weak at making the data they did provide relevant to readers. “It seems they are happy with all the numbers they can produce, but you should know why you are reporting on those numbers. What do my stakeholders want? What are my peers doing? What do my shareholders want?”He said publicly listed airlines tended to do a better job than state-backed carriers. The highest quality reports, in PwC’s judgment, were issued by six airlines: Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, Chile’s LAN Airlines, Lufthansa, US budget carrier Southwest Airlines and the freight business UPS.
249;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-10-05T19:57:57Z;Headwinds on American Airlines’ horizon;;Management at AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, was all smiles in July as it announced one of the largest aircraft orders in history, which executives claimed would transform the carrier and help return it to profitability.Three months on, executives have returned to their day-to-day chores and the smiles have faded. Earlier this week, AMR’s share price slumped by a third in a single session before recovering strongly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday.Regardless of the short-term instability, analysts and industry experts are doubtful about the medium and long-term outlook for what was once the world’s largest and most profitable carrier but one that has in recent years fallen behind its peers.In 2010, American was the only network carrier in the US to lose money and Wall Street analysts expect the airline to repeat this feat this year and next. Forecasts suggest American will lose $1.1bn in 2011 and $484m in 2012.To be sure, all airline stocks have been pummelled as the risks of a double-dip recession in the US and slowing global economic growth have risen, triggering investor concerns that businesses and consumers will cut back on air travel.Despite a better than expected September, some analysts have begun to trim their outlooks. Jamie Baker, with JPMorgan, now expects revenues at US airlines to grow only 0.5 per cent in 2012, down from a rate of 10 per cent.The NYSE Arca Airline index of leading US and international carriers has fallen 40 per cent, while AMR shares have dropped about 66 per cent.Observers worry that should the worst occur, AMR is particularly vulnerable. After avoiding bankruptcy in the early 2000s when many of its peers used Chapter 11 to shed debt and cut employee benefits, American remains stuck with large debts and high costs.“We are very concerned about the global slowdown and the potential for unit revenue to stagnate next year,” said Bill Warlick of Fitch Ratings. “Given American’s cost position, that would translate into another year of operating losses and cash bleed.”In 2012, American must fund about $1.8bn of maturing debt. “That is a big number and when you add in the fact that it will have negative free cash flow in 2011 and probably in 2012 as well, it doesn’t look like it adds up,” said Mr Warlick.The carrier’s weak cash flows could also make it challenging to fund its orders for up to 900 aircraft, including options, announced in July, although the company points out that it has already secured substantial funding commitments from the manufacturers.American insists that bankruptcy is neither a goal nor a preference and most analysts see it as a remote possibility. The company points to its recent success in borrowing more than $700m against certain aircraft assets, and it expects to end the third quarter with about $4.7bn in cash on its balance sheet.Executives also argue that AMR is steadily creating the building blocks for better operational performance. Moves to focus traffic on “cornerstone” cities, develop joint ventures and match capacity to demand will pay off, although it will take time. Recent declines in the price of oil also help.On the issue of new labour contracts, the airline is finally making progress thanks to new and more co-operative union leaders. American estimates that labour deals cost it about $600m to $800m more than its rivals.Still, the options for the company are limited. Hunter Keay, an analyst with Wolfe Trahan, argued in a recent note to clients that AMR’s management faced an unenviable “Catch-22” situation.“Shrinking the network further would probably lead to the loss of corporate contracts to an aggressive Delta, but growing the network or recapitalising the current fleet means a heavy capex burden – either way we see downside for the stock,” he wrote.A bankruptcy, while unlikely, could prove a “useful tool” to American by helping it to address labour and debt issues, said Bill Swelbar, a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation.But bankruptcy would bring its own problems. Since much of AMR’s debt is secured against assets and is of a type that would be hard to reduce, the hit to the airline’s reputation would be substantial and the move could poison improving relations with workers.As a result, the airline will have to plot a delicate course between several unappealing options. “American really is a classic ‘dammed if you do and dammed if you don’t’ company. I really would not want to be AMR’s chief executive,” said Mr Swelbar.
250;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-10-03T13:48:24Z;Airlines urged to throttle back on seat capacity;;Investors will this week start poring over details of how many passengers were carried by European airlines in September, in an effort to understand how much the deteriorating economic environment is hurting the companies’ performance.In what could be a portent for much of the industry, Lufthansa, Europe’s largest airline by revenue, last month issued a profit warning after disappointing sales in August and lower than expected bookings for September and October.Some analysts are now saying that leading European flag carriers – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines Group – should be responding to evidence of falling demand for their services by abandoning plans to increase seating capacity. These analysts say European airlines should follow the example of their US peers and reduce their costs by cutting capacity.Airlines are braced for revenue pain because air travel is closely correlated to economic growth. When gross domestic product slows or declines, passenger traffic usually assumes a similar trajectory.Last month, the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for this year and next, citing the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the weak economic situation in the US. The IMF reduced its eurozone growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012 to 1.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Similar forecasts have led analysts to predict that European flag carriers will see a fall in demand for business – so-called premium – travel, particularly on long-haul routes over the north Atlantic. “We expect the weakening global economy to reduce demand for long-haul premium travel,” says Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. “Given the low margins of the industry, small changes to revenues can have very significant impacts on profitability.”This is a particularly acute problem for the European flag carriers because, unlike low-cost airlines, they derive almost 50 per cent of their revenue from business passengers.The risk of falling demand for business travel has been apparent for months. Air freight traffic – an important indicator of global trade – declined in May, June and July, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airlines’ main representative body.So how are Europe’s leading flag carriers responding to the worsening economic picture?None of them has announced plans to lower operating costs by reducing seating capacity, which could involve grounding aircraft, cutting flight frequencies and dropping routes. Cutting capacity should also give airlines greater pricing power on their remaining services, and therefore the opportunity to raise fares.So far, the flag carriers have just reduced their plans for capacity growth. Lufthansa was planning for growth of 12 per cent this year, but cut the target to 6 per cent in July, and then 4 per cent after the profit warning.Air France-KLM, Europe’s second largest airline, said last week it had reduced its planned capacity growth for the winter to 3.4 per cent. It did not disclose the previous growth target.IAG – Europe’s third largest airline and owner of British Airways and Iberia – has stuck to its plans for capacity growth of 7-8 per cent in 2011. In July it said it was reviewing the case for lower capacity growth this winter.The three companies’ stance is in stark contrast to Europe’s leading low-cost airline and US carriers. Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost airline by revenue, is cutting seating capacity this winter by grounding 80 aircraft.United Continental, Delta and US Airways have announced capacity cuts in the second half of this year in response to high fuel prices. Last month, Delta said it would cut capacity next year by 2-3 per cent, adding that it would be prepared for a recession.Four analysts said European flag carriers should be cutting capacity. Geoff van Klaveren, at Deutsche Bank, said: “Given the deteriorating economic outlook we believe that European network airlines need to actually cut capacity to improve their dismal operating margins. Simply trimming capacity growth is wholly inadequate in our view. There is still too much focus on empire building rather than shareholder value.”One analyst said it was easier for the US airlines to reduce capacity because the market had consolidated, and the remaining large carriers were broadly pursuing the same strategy. Another analyst said some European airlines feared that if they dropped routes, rivals led by Middle East carriers would step in and provide alternative services.Whatever the challenges associated with cutting capacity, the case for curbing expansion is growing. Iata said last month that European airlines would see their combined net profit fall from $1.4bn this year to $300m in 2012, because of the eurozone economic crisis.
251;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-09-18T19:54:25Z;BA faces €50m bill for carbon emissions;;British Airways faces a bill of nearly €50m, the highest of any airline, when carriers around the world are brought into the European Union’s carbon emissions trading scheme next year, a new study estimates.But BA and other large European carriers will face a relatively smaller burden than their rivals in the US and China, because they should get an average of 81 per cent of the carbon allowances needed under the scheme for free. The Chinese and American carriers will only get an average of up to 64 per cent, says the report by Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, the energy research firm.The airline industry’s total bill is expected to be €1.1bn ($1.5bn) at today’s carbon prices, the study says. The whole sector may only make a $4bn profit this year, the International Air Transport Association has forecast.“Compared to airlines’ annual fuel bills, these additional costs are minor, but compared to profits they are considerable,” said Andreas Arvanitakis, Thomson Reuters Point Carbon associate director. “The question is how much of the cost can be passed to passengers and cargo clients.”The findings come amid a fierce row over the EU’s move to make any airline flying into and within the bloc pay for pollution.US airlines have taken legal action against what they say is an “astonishing” step, and Chinese complaints have prompted warnings of a trade war from European aircraft-maker Airbus.Airlines have been exempt from Europe’s six-year-old cap and trade scheme, the world’s largest, which forces big polluters to pay for their carbon emissions above certain limits.Carriers will now have to surrender allowances, each equal to one tonne of carbon dioxide, to cover their annual emissions. A portion will be allocated for free but heavy polluters will have to buy more allowances, now trading for about €12 each.The exact number of free allowances each airline will get will not be known until official figures are published this month. But Point Carbon’s calculations, based on the latest public data, offer an early picture of how airlines’ competitive positions may be affected.The €50m bill BA faces amounts to €1.66 per passenger, much more than the €0.14 expected for Delta, its US rival on the lucrative London-New York route, says Peter Hind of the RDC Aviation consultancy, whose data are used in the Point Carbon study.BA said: “Any estimates of the shortfall in our carbon allowances are just that – an estimate. Our own analyses of the costs of the EU ETS to our business are commercially confidential and we would not speculate as to the costs to other airlines.”Italy’s Alitalia faced a bigger bill than Air France, because “its fleet is not as efficient as Air France’s and their planes are not as full, either of passengers or freight”, Mr Hind said.Overall, Europe’s big international airlines should get an average of 81 per cent of the allowances they will need for free, slightly more than budget rivals, Ryanair and Easyjet.But the top five Chinese airlines, including Air China and Taiwan flag carrier China Airlines, will get an average of 63 per cent, while the bigger US airlines will get an average of 64 per cent.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
252;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-09-12T12:31:45Z;Challenges mount for Bostock;;Three years after leading his company through an ill-starred romance with Microsoft, Yahoo non-executive chairman Roy Bostock is facing a second big challenge to his behind-the-scenes stewardship.The retired Madison Avenue advertising executive was thrust back into the spotlight this week after firing Yahoo chief executive Carol Bartz without having her successor in place. Tim Morse, Yahoo chief financial officer, will take the reins as interim chief executive during a search for a permanent replacement.Ms Bartz had not been out of the job two days when activist shareholder Daniel Loeb, who had quietly bought up 5.1 per cent of Yahoo’s shares, gave the board a series of demands, including that Mr Bostock also be shown the door.Mr Loeb, who runs $8bn investment group Third Point, said he had been speaking to a number of technology and media industry veterans that could better serve as Yahoo directors if Mr Bostock and some of his allies were willing to go quietly. If not, “we are prepared to propose a slate of directors at the company’s annual meeting next year should it become necessary”.Such investors fault Mr Bostock, 70, for hiring Ms Bartz in the first place, for keeping her so long while the stock traded sideways, and for rejecting a Microsoft takeover bid for nearly triple the $16bn Yahoo shares are worth now.Mr Bostock told the Financial Times he wants a new strategic plan and a chief executive who can do more with Yahoo’s large base of users. The group said on Friday it had hired bankers Allen & Co and UBS to advise on future strategy.A former Duke University American football player who once aspired to play the sport professionally, Mr Bostock is said by associates to be tough to the point of stubbornness. “He does not back down from a confrontation if it is deserved,” said James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, where Mr Bostock is a director.Yet his best career moves have been negotiated deals, careful compromises that rewarded him with a personal fortune. He engineered a series of sales of his advertising businesses that kept him employed as the industry consolidated, capped by the 2002 sale of Bcom3 Group to Publicis for $3bn.Indeed, Mr Bostock’s first response to the broadside from Mr Loeb was conciliatory, in contrast to Ms Bartz’s direct and sometimes profane public comments.“The Yahoo board recognises the critical challenges facing the company and appreciates constructive input from all shareholders,” the group said.Mr Bostock has used both bluster and bonhomie to navigate crises in the past. At the same time as the Microsoft talks were foundering, he chaired Northwest Airlines and steered it into the arms of Delta for $2.6bn.Perhaps reflecting his lack of Silicon Valley experience, Mr Bostock until now has been less of a forceful internal presence at Yahoo, according to several people who dealt regularly with the board.One ex-executive said Mr Bostock has to take the blame for presiding over “one of the great dysfunctional boards of all time”.“He has overstayed his welcome,” the executive added.But corporate governance expert and former Yahoo critic Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said investors should give Mr Bostock credit for dismissing Ms Bartz.“Anytime a board terminates a CEO on performance-based issues, we have got to give them their due,” Mr Elson said. “That is a tough decision to make.”This article has been amended since original publication
253;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-08-25T19:44:50Z;Delta orders $8.5bn-worth of Boeing jets;;Delta Air Lines, the second-largest US carrier by revenues, on Thursday ordered 100 Boeing narrow-body jets worth more than $8.5bn at list prices, giving the US aerospace company a welcome boost after a series of setbacks.Last month Boeing was forced to split a large order from American Airlines with its arch-rival Airbus, part of Europe’s EADS, and was hurried into announcing a plan to upgrade its best-selling 737 family of narrow-body aircraft rather than building an all new small jet.Since the start of the year, Airbus has been gaining momentum in the lucrative narrow-body market thanks to its new A320neo model. The jet is about 15 per cent more fuel-efficient than older models thanks to the addition of improved engines.“This should relieve some fear of market-share loss to the A320neo from traditional all-Boeing operators, but upcoming orders remain a focus,” Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.But Mr Spingarn added that over the year to date, Airbus is still well ahead in the race for orders, having racked up 995 net orders, of which most are for narrowbody aircraft, while Boeing has secured 276 net new orders, 62 per cent of them for narrowbodies.Boeing said the contract was not a “must win” order. “All of the campaigns we enter into are important and competitive. The 737-900ER offered a solution that addressed Delta’s renewal effort by providing reliable, fuel-efficient aircraft in the required time frame.”Fuel efficiency is a particular priority for airlines. Fuel costs constitute about 40 per cent of total airline operating expenses and high fuel prices have dented the fragile recovery that the sector has enjoyed since the global downturn.Still, the Delta order provides an interesting contrast with the American Airlines order in July of more than 900 jets, counting options. While American boosted the size of its order during negotiations, Delta’s purchase shrunk from its original plan envisaging an order of up to 200 aircraft.Airlines have come under increasing pressure from investors to scale back their growth plans and control capacity as the global economy has stalled, raising concerns about the willingness and ability of consumers to absorb oil-inflated prices and continue flying.Delta said that it would take delivery of the fleet of 737-900ER aircraft between 2013 and 2018 as it retires older jets. Typically airlines receive substantial discounts from list prices when they place large orders.“A key component of Delta’s strategy is making prudent investments for the future while maintaining our financial and capacity discipline,” Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, said in a statement. The jets are up to 20 per cent more fuel-efficient per seat than those they replace.Delta said that a staggered delivery profile and committed financing for the aircraft would allow the company to maintain its capital expenditures at between $1.2bn and $1.4bn a year over the next three years and still reduce its net debt.However, investors appeared unconvinced. At one point on Thursday, Delta shares slipped more than 5 per cent to $6.88. Over the year to date the shares have lost almost half its value, as part of a broader sell off of airline stocks.
254;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-08-23T17:10:01Z;Challenge to keep Brent oil a world benchmark;;The growing acceptance of Brent crude oil as the world’s most important oil benchmark faces a growing challenge – its output is declining rapidly.The problem of dwindling reserves has been known for years but the North Sea crude’s strengthening ascendancy over West Texas Intermediate, its US counterpart, has prompted the industry to seek urgent solutions.The big problem for WTI is that the price of its yardstick has dislocated from others, plunging last week to a record discount of more than $26 a barrel against Brent, down from just $2 two years ago.This severe dislocation in the WTI market has prompted companies such as Delta Air Lines to abandon WTI in favour of Brent.Yet “Brent has its own weaknesses”, says Bassam Fattouh of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and author of the report An Anatomy of the Crude Oil Pricing System.“The main problem is the secular decline in production and the risk of squeezes associated with low volumes of production,” he adds. That decline has been recently exacerbated by outages at a key North Sea oilfield.Platts, the pricing agency, has proposed a series of measures, both short-term and long-term, to increase the liquidity of the benchmark. The agency, a unit of New York-listed McGraw-Hill, is the de facto regulator of the physical Brent market. But the proposals face industry opposition.The changes would impact on the multibillion-dollar Brent market of physical, forward, swaps, futures and options contracts.According to Houston-based consultants Purvin & Gertz, Brent and its associated derivatives are the benchmarks for as much as 65 per cent of the world’s crude trade.Oil companies such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total and trading houses such as Vitol, Glencore and Phibro are the largest players in the market.But the adjustments would also affect investors such as pension funds, as Brent is a key part of commodities indices such as the popular S&P GSCI. Although the benchmark continues to be known as “Brent”, it is a basket of several crude streams from the North Sea.As output fell, the Brent crude was combined with Ninian crude in 1990, creating the so-called Brent blend. In July 2002, Platts broadened the Brent contract with the inclusion of two other regional streams: Forties and Oseberg. Ekofisk was added in June 2007, creating today’s Brent benchmark, also known as BFOE.Platts intends to extend reforms. Its first proposal is to widen the number of days that the reporting agencies look at to estimate the price of the benchmark on the spot physical market, or Dated Brent.At the moment they look at transactions made during a 12-day window – the so-called 10-21 days forward period. As production of the BFOE basket has dropped from 1.6m barrels a day five years ago to 875,000 b/d recently, the number of Brent cargoes traded during that short window has almost halved.Platts has proposed enlarging the window from next January to 16 days, lengthening the assessment to a 10-25 days forward period. “The move would increase the number of cargoes of Brent that we include on the assessment by a third, boosting the liquidity of the benchmark,” says Jorge Montepeque, director of markets at Platts.Yet the change would create its own problems as it would weaken the link between the physical Brent market and the derivatives market, which for historical reasons is based on a 15-day forward period. The London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange says it is consulting with the industry. Oil traders would prefer that Platts and ICE altered their methodology at the same time.If not, says a senior Brent trader, “the divergence between the physical and the derivatives market would be too great”.Shell has written to Platts asking it to delay any change, saying in a letter that the adjustments in the BFOE system and Brent futures “should be concurrent and during the first quarter of 2013”.But lengthening the window would not resolve the underlying problem – oilfields behind the BFOE basket are mature and output is irremediably declining.For that reason, Platts is charting a more ambitious solution: broadening the basket to include, for the first time, crude from outside the North Sea.Mr Montepeque says Platts needs to act “way before there is a problem”, which he says will occur when output drops below the 500,000 b/d mark.Industry watchers believe that early next year the agency will propose adding one or more North Sea streams to the BFOE basket, such as Statfjord. Beyond that – maybe in around 2015 – industry watchers say Platts would consider adding streams from outside the region but of similar high quality and low sulphur, including crude from west and north Africa and central Asia.“The ultimate goal is to sustain a Brent benchmark even if North Sea production declines to minimum levels,” says Mr Montepeque.
255;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-08-10T15:47:04Z;Virgin Atlantic warns on tough year ahead;;Faltering consumer confidence is threatening to compound an already difficult trading environment for Virgin Atlantic, the airline’s chief executive warned on Wednesday.The cautionary tone from Steve Ridgway came as the long-haul carrier controlled by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group reported a return to profit in its financial year to the end of February.The carrier, which is 51 per cent owned by Virgin and 49 per cent by Singapore Airlines, made a pre-tax profit of £18.5m ($29.8m), against a loss of £130m in the 12 months to the end of February. Revenues rose 13 per cent to £2.7bn.The airline’s financial performance was hit by last year’s closures of European airspace due to the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano as well as the chaos caused by heavy snow at Heathrow airport, Virgin’s main base, in December, which cost the airline a combined £40m.“Since the turn of the year, market conditions have become tougher,” said Mr Ridgway, although he said demand for business class across the Atlantic remained strong. He added that recent turmoil in the markets and the riots in the UK would not help consumer confidence, while all airlines continue to struggle with high oil prices.Mr Ridgway said there was “nothing to report” from a review of the business conducted by Deutsche Bank last year. He said as long-time advisers, Deutsche Bank had been asked to look at how the recent wave of consolidation among larger US and European airlines would affect the business.Arch-rival British Airways merged with Spain’s Iberia earlier this year not long after the two carriers had also had a transatlantic joint venture with American Airlines cleared by regulators. Mr Ridgway had long campaigned to prevent the tie up and he said that view had not changed but now that the deal was in place Virgin would continue to compete for customers.Mr Ridgway refused to comment further on the review amid speculation that Sir Richard may look to sell the airline to a bigger rival, such as Delta Air Lines. Singapore Airlines has made it clear that it is looking to sell its 49 per cent stake in the carrier at some point.
256;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Congress compromises on FAA dispute;;Congressional leaders agreed to end a partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Authority but failed to address a broader disagreement over labour union rights that is expected to bubble up again in September.Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said that a bipartisan compromise that had been negotiated between the House and Senate would reinstate 4,000 FAA employees and put more than 70,000 construction workers back on the job after the FAA stalemate stalled billions of dollars in infrastructure projects and cost the federal government about $300m in lost tax revenue. The announcement eased fears that the FAA would remain in a state of limbo until early September, when lawmakers reconvene in Washington.“This agreement does not resolve the important differences that still remain. But I believe we should keep Americans working while Congress settles its differences, and this agreement will do exactly that,” said Mr Reid.The standoff was seen as yet another example of dysfunction in Washington following the tense negotiations over an increase in the debt ceiling.The Senate is expected to pass legislation on Friday that would extend funding for the FAA until September 16, when the issue will be raised again. The bill, which was passed in the House before lawmakers left on holiday this week, contains cuts in subsidies to rural airports, including some in the states of senior Democrats such as Mr Reid of Nevada. Republicans have charged that the Senate’s failure to pass the law until now was linked to efforts by some lawmakers to protect the subsidy.According to one person familiar with the matter, Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, helped broker a deal when he said he could use his waiver authority to review the proposed cuts.Democrats have denied that the standoff was related only to the so-called Essential Air Service subsidy. They claimed that Republicans’ broader aim was to put pressure on Democrats to weaken a new labour rule that would make it easier for airline workers to unionise. Mr Reid singled out Delta Airlines as the chief culprit behind the campaign, although the US airline denied the charge.“It really was about some members of Congress letting their egos get in the way,” said Mr LaHood in an interview on MSNBC.
257;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-08-03T23:47:48Z;Obama calls for end to FAA stalemate;Government deprived of $1bn in tax revenue;Barack Obama has called on lawmakers to end a stalemate over funding for the US Federal Aviation Administration as congressional Democrats, still bruised from the debt ceiling deal, tried to ratchet up pressure on Republicans by claiming that an anti-union manoeuvre was at the heart of the impasse.“This is a lose, lose, lose situation,” the president said. “This is an example of a self-inflicted wound that is unnecessary.”Congress’s decision to leave the capital for a five-week holiday without passing routine legislation to fund the FAA because of the complexity of the dispute is expected to cost the federal government $1bn in lost tax revenue by early September.Ray LaHood, transportation secretary, said the FAA shutdown had furloughed 4,000 federal aviation workers and left 70,000 construction workers unemployed who would otherwise be engaged on $11bn worth of airport infrastructure projects across the nation now stalled.Republicans have claimed that Democrats are objecting to a bill passed by the House of Representatives to reauthorise the FAA because it cuts subsidies for commercial airline service to small rural airports, including some in the home states of prominent Democrats such as Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, of Nevada.Democrats have countered that the standoff has little to do with the rural subsidy and is instead an attempt to to neuter a new labour rule that would make it easier for workers to unionise at Delta Air Lines and other transportation companies.“The issue is the labour issue: an anti-worker agenda of one airline, Delta Air Lines. That’s what this is all about, and that’s what the Republicans of the House have said,” said Mr Reid.The partisan fighting seemed even more bitter in the wake of the debt-ceiling agreement.Democrats appeared to be more resolved than ever not to give in to Republican demands, a sign, some Washington insiders said, that the party was itching to toughen up because of the perception that Democratic lawmakers had been rolled over too many times.John Boehner, the Republican House speaker, showed no signs of blinking and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not passing the House legislation and leaving “tens of thousands of workers in limbo”.Delta denied it was leading a secret anti-labour campaign, as some Democrats suggested. “The fundamental issue, which is included in the extension, is over the funding of Essential Air Service markets,” it said, referring to the programme to provide subsidies for rural airports.
258;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
259;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-07-28T16:44:33Z;Companies embrace the F word;;Most people think of Facebook as a place to check out photos from last weekend’s party. But increasingly, the social network is becoming a destination for buying airline tickets, nappies and soap.Procter & Gamble, Levi’s and Delta Air Lines are among a growing number of companies experimenting with building Facebook storefronts and forging into what is now being called ‘f-commerce’.The actual number of people shopping on Facebook is still so low that most companies see the move as a way to study consumer behaviour more than a moneymaker. But some experts believe f-commerce could eventually overtake some established e-commerce companies.“I think Facebook and Amazon will be squaring off as the two e-commerce titans in the future,” said Bob Pearson, author of Pre-Commerce and former head of social marketing for Dell.About $5bn worth of physical goods are sold on social networks today, according to research from Booz&Co, with the social commerce market expected to grow to $30bn globally by 2015.A growing crop of start-ups, including Milyoni, ShopIgniter and 8thBridge have been securing millions in venture capital investments in recent months in the race to become the leader in the Facebook storefront business.But some analysts are sceptical that people will want to enter their credit card information on a site where they’ve logged on to socialise.“Most users are just not willing to go to Facebook to buy something,” said Jed Williams, an analyst with BIA/Kelsey. “There’s more evidence that Facebook – the recommendation engine and the social graph – can be a conduit to commerce. But direct commerce, there’s not as much compelling evidence that that has stuck yet.”
260;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta profits hit by high fuel prices;;Delta Air Lines, the second-biggest US carrier by revenues, reported lower second-quarter profits on Wednesday as higher ticket prices and extensive cost saving measures only partially offset a sharp increase in fuel costs.Despite a modest if uneven economic recovery and surprisingly resilient consumer and business demand, airlines have seen their profits dip in 2011 as rising oil prices have outpaced their ability to pass on costs to customers.“High fuel prices are putting significant pressure on the industry, but the benefits of Delta’s strategic actions and the dedication of Delta employees are evident in the solid profit we produced despite more than $1bn in higher fuel expense,” Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, said in a statement.At Delta, in the June quarter income fell to $198m from $467m in the same period last year, generating $0.23 earnings per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2010, as the 39 per cent increase in fuel expenses took its toll.Higher revenues from increased prices, strong demand in the Latin America region and fuel surcharges helped offset some of the damage. Sales increased 12 per cent to $9.2bn, although the fallout from the March disaster in Japan trimmed revenues by $125m.In response to the jump in fuel prices Delta said it would cut capacity in the fourth quarter by up to 5 per cent, one point more than previously announced. By reducing the number of seats and flights airlines hope to be able to raise prices and lower costs.In addition the company said that it had would retire older, fuel-guzzling aircraft and would consolidate 1.2m square feet of facilities in Atlanta and Minneapolis. Delta said that 2,000 employees had accepted voluntary redundancy.“We have seen unit cost growth from not only high fuel prices, but also maintenance volumes and revenue-related expenses,” Hank Halter, chief financial officer at Delta, said in a statement. “We are moving aggressively to stem this cost growth.”In pre-market trading, Delta shares, which have lost about a third of their value since the start of the year as fuel prices have ramped up, slipped about 2 per cent to $7.90.
261;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-07-22T21:35:46Z;American Airlines charts its future;;"When Gerard Arpey joined American Airlines in the 1980s as a financial analyst, his arrival coincided with an aircraft-buying spree that would turn the carrier into one of the world’s largest.Thirty years on and Mr Arpey, now chief executive, has just penned a deal that will in one fell swoop retire many of those same aircraft and chart a course for the US airline for decades to come. On Wednesday, the 52-year-old executive ordered more than 900 jets – counting options – in a deal worth nearly $40bn, badgered a supplier into developing a more fuel-efficient aircraft and stole a march on its main rivals.Appearing at a news conference surrounded by local dignitaries and top Boeing and Airbus executives was a rare turn in the limelight for someone peers describe as a modest family man, quiet, thoughtful, and even a little cerebral.Since taking the top job in 2003 – his predecessor was ousted for negotiating a lucrative bonus plan even as he extracted heavy concessions from workers – Mr Arpey has worked tirelessly to save money, cut debt and repair relations with employees, though to little avail.He sold the company’s executive art collection and replaced it with photos of American aircraft, but net debt remains above $11bn. He set up joint leadership councils with unions, but the monthly meetings are sparsely attended.Still, the symmetry of the aircraft order is fitting for Mr Arpey, who has spent his entire career at the airline, progressing from lowly analyst through the financial planning department before becoming chief operating officer in 2002.He has jet fuel in his blood. His father was an airline executive and, as a student, Mr Arpey loaded bags for Delta Air Lines. In his spare time he flies a small Piper aircraft, although steering an airline through fuel spikes and recessions leaves little enough of that.American in 2011 is a far cry from the carrier it was in the 1980s. Avoiding insolvency in the early 2000s has left it trapped: unable to reduce its debts or fix its labour problems until it makes money – and unable to make money without less debt and lower labour costs.Then, the airline was spending to grow; now it is spending to survive. Mr Arpey and its team are gambling that, by replacing the old fuel-guzzling fleet and charting a path to growth, they can cut costs and win over disgruntled workers.“This is something they had to do. With a 300lb jockey, even Sea Biscuit couldn’t win a race,” says Gordon Bethune, who led a turnround at Continental Airlines in the 1990s. Still, Mr Bethune worries that solving entrenched labour problems will be hard.A chorus of analysts also remain sceptical.“We understand that American’s fleet (and brand) are tired, but this announcement represents a ton of new capital being put into a failing business model,” one analyst wrote, demanding instant dividends.Mr Arpey is well aware of the urgency. His office window looks out on the runways at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and he winces when he sees American aircraft stuck in holding patterns because of bad weather, and burning expensive fuel.But his preference, and strategy, is for the long term and the big picture. He has focused traffic on “cornerpost” cities, signed joint ventures, and ordered jets that will reduce costs as they enter the fleet. But it will take time to see results.Whether American gets that time is a moot point. In the second quarter, the company again lost money, increased its debt load and generated less revenue growth than its peers."
262;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-07-22T18:03:36Z;No queues please, we’re military;There seems to be a darker undercurrent to the airline boarding privileges extended to US armed forces personnel;"Whenever I pass through an American airport these days, I feel a frisson of transatlantic culture shock. That is not down to the size of the sodas, the overcrowding of economy class or the intrusive airport security. The issue is the armed forces.In Europe these days, it is relatively rare even to see anyone in military uniform, far less to venerate them in symbolic terms. US airport crowds, however, are often dotted with fatigues and it is common to hear the airport tannoy declare that “members of the military and their families” can get access to special lounges while travelling. Most striking of all, airlines such as US Airways, American Airlines and Delta routinely allow armed forces personnel to board the aircraft before anyone else, even ahead of first class.Sometimes this privilege only extends to those in fatigues, but it increasingly covers anyone carrying a military card. (When one airline recently refused to let members of the military in civilian dress board first, this sparked complaints, because defence personnel now often travel without uniforms to deter terrorist attacks.) Either way, the message is clear: even if money, power and platinum points can buy much in America, when it comes to boarding planes, the military goes first.Is this a good thing? The first time I noticed it – on an American Airlines flight – I thought it definitely was. Nobody can doubt the sacrifices recently made by military families; a Washington Post database calculates that US fatalities from Iraq and Afghanistan now top 6,000. Offering a few airport lounges thus seems the least that anyone can do. Indeed, it puts a country such as Britain to shame. (While British Airways recently donated some club class sofas to an army airport in Cyprus, nobody has implemented a system to let soldiers routinely queue-jump; most of the time the armed forces are ignored by civilians, or viewed with a vague embarrassment.)However, on reflection, I am also starting to see a potentially darker undercurrent to these boarding announcements. In the first few centuries of American history, it was assumed that armies should be disbanded between wars, since America was a civilian, citizen-run state. During the second world war that idea changed, and since then the military complex has become powerful, pervasive – and permanent.Defenders of the military insist this is an inevitable consequence of an unstable and dangerous world, where the US in effect acts as a global policeman. However, critics beg to differ. Henry Giroux, one of the founding scholars of critical pedagogy in the US, for example, recently wrote a thought-provoking essay in the online magazine CounterPunch, deploring the creeping “militarization” of American society. “The culture of organized violence is one of the most powerful forces shaping American society, extending deeply into every aspect of American life,” he thundered. “There can be little doubt that America has become a permanent warfare state,” he added, citing peace studies data showing that “the USA’s military spending accounted for 43 per cent of the world total in 2009, followed by China with 6.6 per cent, France with 4.3 per cent, and the UK with 3.8 per cent.” Recent figures from the Concord Coalition, the non-partisan group that advocates fiscal discipline, show defence spending represented 20.6 per cent of the US federal budget in 2010, third only to health and social security.Most Americans would probably dismiss Giroux’s diatribe: CounterPunch is a radical leftwing publication and US culture and politics are imbued with a sense of respect – if not profound reverence – for the military. But even if some of Giroux’s arguments seem over-egged, his points deserve debate.One thing that worries him, for example, is the growing military influence in US higher education. (Not only is the army providing scholarships for students, but it is also recruiting on campuses and funding academic programmes as other sources of finance dry up.) Another is the role of the military in diplomacy, where, as Ronald E. Neumann, a former US ambassador recently said, there has been a “progressive militarization of American foreign policy over the past 20 years”. (According to Neumann, the Department of Defense got $750bn in this year’s budget, while the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development received just $50bn. And while the state department and USAid performed over 90 per cent of development work a decade ago, by 2008 the military was doing half of it.)But the biggest source of Giroux’s concern is the social silence. “In spite of how much military expenditures drain desperately needed funds from social programs, the military budget is rarely debated in Congress or made a serious object of discussion among the public,” he points out, correctly. Perhaps this will now change. America is being forced to cut its debt and opinion polls suggest that public support for the Afghan war has collapsed. But don’t bet on this happening any time soon – or not while most Americans take the status quo so completely for granted that they never even notice those military airport lounges.gillian.tett@ft.com"
263;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-07-20T22:56:58Z;Watershed deal for carrier and industry;;It is not every day that an airline makes the largest order of jets in history, cajoles a supplier into developing a new aircraft type and steals a march on its main rivals, but on Wednesday American Airlines did just that.Flanked by top executives of Boeing and Airbus, a beaming Gerard Arpey, chief executive of American Airlines, trumpeted the landmark purchase agreements as a “watershed for our company and for the airline industry”.In total, American agreed to buy more than 900 aircraft, counting options, including a combination of current and next-generation models from the US and European manufacturers.Within five years it will go from having one of the oldest fleets in the industry to one of the youngest.Adam Pilarski, with Avitas, the aviation consultancy, argues that the orders could not have come sooner.“This is a bold move and a way for them to come back because they have seen their position slipping away for years,” Mr Pilarski said.After avoiding bankruptcy in the early 2000s, American has been hobbled by higher labour costs than its peers and a fleet of oil-guzzling aircraft. It has slowly dropped down the rankings and is now the third-largest US airline by revenues. While its competitors have returned to profitability since the economic crisis, American remains lossmaking.With one swoop, American hopes to address many of those points, building on recent moves to consolidate its network around “cornerstone” hubs, spin off its regional airline business (announced on Wednesday) and develop lucrative joint business deals with airlines such as British Airways.American’s new aircraft will be up to 45 per cent more fuel efficient than the aircraft they replace, helping to reduce its costs.In economic terms, executives say the deal was a “no-brainer”, particularly given the $13bn of lease financing the company extracted from its suppliers.At the same time, American argues the jets will give the company valuable flexibility. “As fuel prices keep going up, we can accelerate replacement,” says Tom Horton, president of American Airlines. “If economic conditions improve, we have the choice to grow efficiently.”Executives also see the aircraft order as a way to help break log-jammed contract negotiations with unions.By laying out a clear pathway for the airline to grow, they hope to win productivity concessions from pilots and other workers.As a side benefit, the American deal may undercut its US rivals, such as Delta Air Lines, which are also in the market for new aircraft.“Right now it is not easy to get many planes. Airbus and Boeing were already oversold and now come 460 (firm) orders that will make it much more difficult,” Mr Pilarski said.Still, for some analysts concerns linger. Bill Warlick, with Fitch Ratings, argues that as with many elements of American’s strategy, “the economic benefits [of new aircraft] are meaningful but they are long term”.On Wednesday, American reported second-quarter results that underscored just how far it still has to travel to regain profitability.Revenues rose about 8 per cent to $6.1bn in the three months to the end of June, but the company lost $286m, or $0.85 per share.Shares in AMR, American’s parent company, held roughly steady at about $4.92.Will Randow, with Citibank, worries that a big order may tempt American to increase capacity and gain market share rather than focus on making money, and that the deal may still stress the company’s balance sheet.Aircraft leases will allow American to avoid big upfront payments, but Mr Randow says that rating agencies view such deals as a form of debt – because the airline is obligated to make future payments – and hence as adding to the company’s leverage.Net debt was $11.9bn at the end of June, compared to the company’s market capitalisation of $1.8bn.Indeed, despite the order Mr Pilarski argues that American has plenty of work left to do.“American has to think about transforming not just the hardware, but the software. Shiny new aircraft don’t help you much if you have the same-old not-always-great customer service and business decisions,” he said.

On Monday, the index traded as high as at 21.50, indicating an elevated level of market stress.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent to 12,385.16 with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also in negative territory, down 0.9 per cent at 2,765.11.This week, 106 S&P 500 companies will release earnings results, with 26 financials reporting, led by Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo due on Tuesday. Shares in BofA were down 2.8 per cent at $9.72, Goldman was down 0.6 per cent at $129.33, while Wells was down 1.1 per cent at $26.88.Analysts expect financials will see earnings decline 22.3 per cent, down from a forecast rise of 18.9 per cent a month ago, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Excluding BofA, estimated earnings for financials are actually seen rising 12.5 per cent, but that is significantly lower than expected a few months ago.Greenhill was unchanged on the day at $51.00. The US investment bank rushed to release strong second-quarter earnings ahead of schedule on Sunday. The company sought to calm investor fears after the departure of its third managing director.Discount retail broker Charles Schwab closed down 0.3 per cent at $14.97 after reporting earnings that beat estimates, as revenue generated by client advisory increased.Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth is set to rise 7.1 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, according to FactSet, including BofA’s expected loss. That sets the S&P up for its first single-digit earnings gain after six quarters of double-digit results.“We have seen a modest downward revision to the 2011 S&P 500 consensus earnings per share estimate, due in part to Bank of America’s lowered guidance and lower oil prices,” said Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.“The 2012 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate has fallen a slight 0.5 per cent from its mid-June peak, but remains lofty in our view at $113. We continue to believe that first half 2011 estimates are achievable, but the second half is a concern,” added Mr Parker.Traders were also watching ongoing negotiations in Washington over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling before a deadline of August 2. Last week, S&P and Moody’s each warned that a failed debt payment by the US Treasury would result in a downgrade of the triple A rating of the US.“Until we get some announcement that there is a debt deal here in the US, the market will also be dominated by European debt worries and the low volume that is causing more of a volatile situation. Shortly the market will begin to divorce itself from these issues as earnings season has been good,” said Peter Cardillo, chief economist with Avalon Partners.The S&P energy sector was down on Monday even as earnings mostly beat expectations, closing down 0.4 per cent.Halliburton, the oilfield services provider, closed up 0.1 per cent at $53.12 despite the company releasing earning results that beat estimates before the opening bell. Its second-quarter profit increased as higher crude prices led to more spending on exploration and production, with net income rising to $739m or 80 cents a share.Out of 44 companies reporting second-quarter earnings by Monday morning, 31 had beaten expectations, with earnings on average outpacing forecasts by 8.9 per cent, according to S&P Valuation and Risk Strategies Research.IBM closed down 0.2 per cent at $175.28. The company beat estimates, releasing positive second-quarter earning results after the closing bell.On the media sector, News Corp skidded 4.3 per cent at $14.96 at closing. The company is still in the spotlight as the UK phone-hacking scandal continues to unravel and the group faces possible legal challenges in the US. On Monday, shares in News Corp kept plummeting. Mr Murdoch and his son James are due to appear before a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday.With Delta Air Lines at the helm, down 4.1 per cent at $8.06, shares of major US airlines tumbled to one-year lows on Monday amid expectations that travel will slow down in the autumn.Elsewhere, LinkedIn dropped 6.9 per cent to $102.44 as JPMorgan Chase, one of the underwriters of the company’s initial public offering, downgraded its rating from “overweight” to “neutral”. The social network focused on job seekers began trading in May and its shares have risen 47 per cent since June 24.
265;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Aircraft makers struggle to fill back-orders;;US airlines contemplating a splurge of spending on new aircraft may struggle to secure the jets they want, according to senior industry executives, as record backlogs at leading manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus squeeze out new orders.Since the start of the year a number of US airlines have begun to examine their fleets, spurred by high fuel costs. American Airlines is in private talks with manufacturers to buy several hundred jets, while Delta Air Lines has publicly asked makers to pitch for a fleet of up to 200 aircraft.Still, US carriers have left it late to begin re-fleeting. Airbus and Boeing are ramping up production as fast as they can, aiming to produce more than 40 of their workhorse single-aisle aircraft every month by 2012 and 2014 respectively.And while they are eager to win extra business, record order books mean that production slots are limited. Bernstein Research estimates that at current rates it will take Airbus and Boeing between seven and eight years to work through their backlogs.Industry experts expect US airlines to replace as many as 2,000 aircraft in the next few years as they retire their ageing fleets of MD-80s and Boeing 757s. That would represent several years of output at Airbus and Boeing.Kostya Zolotusky, managing director of capital markets development at Boeing Capital, says financial markets are better than they have been in years, giving US airlines the opportunity to purchase new aircraft without straining their still fragile balance sheets.“The challenge for US airlines is that order books are full,” he says. “In the 1980s, US airlines made 50 per cent of our order backlog. In 2001, they were still a large proportion. Now only 20 per cent of the backlog comes from North America.”Another industry executive puts it more bluntly, arguing that “US legacy carriers have assumed that when it came time for them to re-fleet, manufacturers would simply drop everything, but that is not going to happen given global demand”.For airlines, waiting for new aircraft could be costly. High oil prices make running older, less fuel efficient, aircraft expensive and while airlines are profitable for the first time in years that may not last, given the highly cyclical nature of the industry.A spokesman for American Airlines declined to comment on the company’s fleet plans but said that “historically, we have been able to order and receive previous aircraft deliveries in very favourable time periods”. Delta declined to comment.Adam Pilarski, with Avitas, the consultancy, argues that US airlines still command considerable attention from the manufacturers, by virtue of the size of their installed fleet, and argues that US airlines have room for manoeuvre.Order books, he says, are never as solid as they appear, allowing makers to shift earlier deliveries to important customers, and carriers can always lease aircraft in the short term. New entrants to the single aisle market, such as Bombardier, offer additional capacity.But Mr Pilarski notes that now may not be the best time to order, given that the main manufacturers are effectively sold out. “You have to be careful right now not to buy at the top of the market and overpay.”
266;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-06-24T21:42:40Z;Sharp losses for technology sector;;Risk assets took another beating in the final session of a volatile week on Wall Street, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharp losses after disappointing earnings from some of the key players in the industry.Micron Technology, the chipmaker, saw the deepest losses on the S&P 500, falling 14.5 per cent to $7.21 after reporting a 92 per cent drop in earnings late in the previous session.Oracle, the business software and hardware giant, fell 4.1 per cent to $31.14 after reporting lacklustre growth in its hardware segment. The losses came despite a 36 per cent rise in overall fourth-quarter earnings.These losses helped weigh on the technology sector, which was down 1.8 per cent, the worst performing on Wall Street.Other cyclical sectors also suffered as investors continued to worry about the uncertain situation in Europe and were mostly reluctant to buy in case of bad news over the weekend.The industrial and financial sectors were down 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. Among those stocks to lose ground were General Electric, which fell 2.2 per cent to $17.97, and Morgan Stanley, which declined 0.6 per cent to $22.21.These losses left the S&P 500 down 1.2 per cent to 1,268.45, a loss of 0.2 per cent over the week, leaving it on track for its worst month of losses in a year.The declines came despite some slightly better than expected economic data. The session saw GDP growth for the quarter revised up to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This was an improvement, but still a far cry from the 3.1 per cent GDP growth posted in the fourth quarter of last year.Durable good orders also rose by a stronger-than-expected 1.9 per cent in May on a rebound in demand for transportation equipment.“The economic data were a little better, but there was so much uncertainty going into the weekend that investors were reluctant to buy into the markets,” said Jeff Cleveland, senior economist with Payden & Rygel.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent to 11,937.30, leaving the index down 0.6 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower to 2,652.89 on Friday, but still up 1.4 per cent over the week.In deal news, Williams, a natural gas group, launched a $4.9bn cash bid for Southern Union in an attempt to break up an already agreed deal between the target and Energy Transfer Equity.The prospect of a bidding war left shares in Southern Union up 16.9 per cent to $39.92 and ETE down 5.6 per cent to $43.03. Williams was down 2.3 per cent to $28.55.Airline stocks suffered substantial losses in the session led by United Continental Holdings, which fell 8.5 per cent to $23 after providing a disappointing guidance. Delta Airlines declined 4.9 per cent to $9.45 while Southwest Airlines lost 0.4 per cent to $11.36.Airline stocks pared all of the gains that has been won in the previous session on the sharp drop in the oil price.The week on Wall Street began upbeat as investors bought into a depressed market that had seen nearly seven straight weeks of losses.But sentiment reversed on Wednesday after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference, which then set the tone for the rest of the week.The markets reacted badly to news that the Federal Reserve had cut US growth forecasts, raised inflation estimates and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.Sentiment throughout the week was also weighed on by concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which absorbed much of the interest and attention of traders.“The 800 pound gorilla is still the uncertainty over Greece,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Financial stocks were some of the worst performers of the week, weighed on by these concerns.Bank of New York Mellon was down 6 per cent over the week to $24.64 while SunTrust Banks fell 4.5 per cent to $25.

A fresh proposal was later submitted from John Borghetti, who became Virgin Blue chief executive last year.The department concluded that the revised proposal would result in sufficient benefits to the public without hurting competition.It is rare for the Department of Transportation to reverse a decision. The change of mind follows intense lobbying by Australia’s top diplomats in Washington, who argued the tie-up would promote competition with Qantas and United Airlines, the dominant carriers on routes between the two countries.Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, said the US government’s decision would allow the airlines to expand their respective networks. “Both airlines worked very hard to provide the Department on Transportation with the required documentation,” he said.John Borghetti, chief executive of Virgin Blue, said the link with Delta was central to its plans to build a global network of airline partners. It has already struck deals with Air New Zealand and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad. However, it has yet to strike a deal with an Asian carrier.“The alliance will also be very positive for tourism in Australia as there will be a clear incentive … to promote their product to a whole range of additional cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico,” Mr Borghetti said.Shares in Virgin Blue, which is rebranding to become Virgin Australian Airlines, rose more than 6 per cent to 33 cents by lunch time in Sydney.
268;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-05-03T13:50:16Z;Japan quake slows airline industry’s recovery;;Growth in air travel will remain depressed during the second quarter of the year as the impact of the Japanese earthquake, the unrest in Africa and the Middle East and the high oil price weighs on demand.The warning from the International Air Transport Association came as it revealed that the quake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear catastrophe in Japan combined with political unrest in many Arab countries, had cut air traffic by 2 percentage points in March.Air passenger traffic fell by 0.3 per cent in March, compared with a month earlier, although cargo demand grew 4.5 per cent month-on-month.“The profile of the recovery in air transport sharply decelerated in March,” said Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of Iata. Compared with the same month in 2010, March traffic grew by 3.8 per cent – against the 5.8 per cent growth year-on-year recorded in February – falling well short of the 8.6 per cent increase in capacity.The Asia-Pacific carriers were hardest hit with a traffic loss of more than 2 per cent, while the US and European airlines saw traffic fall by 1 and 0.5 per cent, respectively. Domestic air travel in Japan – the world’s third-largest market after China and the US – slumped 22 per cent in March.Airlines have cut capacity to Japan in the wake of the crisis as travellers avoid the country. Delta Air Lines, the second-largest US airline by revenues and one of the largest international operators into Japan, said the crisis in the country could cut up to $400m from profits this year.Iata expects continued economic growth to support the recovery in air travel in the second half of the year but Mr Bisignani warned the high price of oil – now around $120 per barrel – remained the “big uncertainty”.The high price of oil is hurting airlines’ bottom lines around the world, with fuel accounting for almost a third of airline operating costs, and they are responding by cutting capacity.Mr Bisignani said that while strong demand for companies was helping boost higher-margin business class travel, leisure travellers were “putting off flying because of the impact of high oil prices”.● Air crash investigators have retrieved the second of two black boxes from the Air France jet that plunged into the Atlantic in 2009 after flying through a heavy storm front. “They appear to be in a good state,” said Jean-Paul Troadec, head of the BEA, the French air crash investigator that has been probing the accident that killed all 228 people aboard a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.The voice and data recorders could provide investigators with vital clues to what caused the crash of the twin-engined Airbus A330.
269;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-05-02T16:55:39Z;Hard-pressed airlines move to cut capacity;;Air passengers face the unhappy prospect of higher fares and crowded aircrafts as airlines around the world try to fend off the impact of rising fuel prices and other uncertainties.As many carriers report their first results for the year, a clearer picture is emerging of the financial toll of jet fuel prices soaring to more than $3.30 a gallon – 45 per cent more than a year ago.In the US, all but one of the five leading airlines have posted a first-quarter loss. The exception was the Dallas-based budget airline Southwest, though it suffered a 55 per cent drop in year-on-year profit as a result of high fuel prices.Richard Anderson, Delta Air Lines chief executive, warned last week that high fuel prices were “the new norm for the industry”. Delta, the second-biggest US airline by traffic, posted a $318m net loss for the March quarter.More weak sets of results are expected in Europe in the coming weeks as the region’s six largest airline groups report their financial performances amid Middle East unrest that has pushed up oil prices.In Asia, meanwhile, carriers are grappling with rising fuel costs and the effects of natural disasters that hit Japan, Australia and New Zealand in the space of three months.Japan’s All Nippon Airways last week reported a quarterly net loss of Y14bn ($172.7m) and said the effect of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, plus the increase in oil prices and uncertainty about the global economy, meant it was delaying its profit forecasts for the financial year ending March 2012.Yet, even though oil prices have jumped to levels last seen in 2008, with airline share prices plunging, economic conditions today are far more favourable and the industry is in much better shape.Critically, demand has been strong enough for airlines to raise fares repeatedly this year, especially for the all-important business-class passengers.“So far, airlines have been able to pass through a very large portion of fuel price increases [to passengers],” says Ray Neidl, senior aerospace specialist at Maxim Group in New York.The question is how long this can continue. “The big worry is that eventually the higher fuel prices will curtail the global economic recovery,” he says. “That’s [airlines’] greatest fear.”Given the prospect of faltering demand, many carriers, especially in the US, are scaling back seats. “They have no choice. They can’t really handle $3-plus per gallon jet fuel,” says Helane Becker, aviation analyst at Dahlman Rose, a US investment bank. “The bottom line is that in order to be profitable they have to reduce capacity.”These reductions mean that if oil prices start to fall, the industry should be in a strong position to reap the benefits. But pessimism is evident: the latest quarterly survey of airline business confidence by the International Air Transport Association, the industry body, reports a “significant deterioration” in profit expectations for 2011.“The bulk of respondents now expect the level of profitability to fall this year, driven largely by a significant increase in fuel costs,” Iata says.Airlines’ differing ability to cope with rising fuel prices is already evident at Europe’s International Airlines Group, parent of newly-merged British Airways and Spain’s Iberia.BA has raised fares three times in less than four months thanks to a strong recovery in demand for its high-yielding business-class seats.But as Deutsche Bank analyst Geoff van Klaveren points out, Iberia has not been able to follow suit. This is partly because it increased capacity on its long-haul routes to Latin America, he says, and also because it faces stiff competition in its home market from Ireland’s Ryanair, Europe’s largest budget airline.“I think the US airlines have done a great job of being very reactive on fuel and immediately scaling capacity back,” says Mr van Klaveren, adding that he is worried about what lies ahead in Europe if fuel costs continue to rise.“Fuel costs are already higher now than the average through the whole of 2008, so if things stay as they are, airlines will have to cut capacity on routes that cannot support higher pricing.”
270;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-05-01T20:41:12Z;Embraer predicts uncertain outlook;;The outlook for the international airline industry remains uncertain amid a volatile political situation in the Middle East, high oil prices and uneven global economic growth, says Frederico Curado, chief executive of Brazil’s Embraer.Standing by the aircraft manufacturer’s forecast of a relatively subdued 5 per cent revenue growth in 2011, Mr Curado said a boom in emerging markets was being offset by gloom in the developed world economies.“Since the financial crisis, the recovery has been very unbalanced,” Mr Curado told the Financial Times. “We have regions such as South America [and] Asia – they have rebounded in a much more robust way than, for example, the US and Europe, which are still very important, large markets.”The world’s third-largest commercial aircraft maker, Embraer had a tough first quarter, with deliveries falling 32 per cent compared with a year earlier, led by its larger executive jet segment. Concern over the fall was partially offset by an increase in its backlog of firm orders to $16bn from $15.6bn in December. But first Embraer and the rest of the industry will have to overcome geopolitical and economic headwinds.More than two months of conflict in Libya and unrest elsewhere in the Middle East helped push oil prices up 30 per cent to $127 per barrel last month, a two-and-a-half-year high. Delta Air Lines and US Airways reported losses in the first quarter as oil prices dragged on earnings.Embraer is also struggling with a weak dollar, which is driving up costs in local currency terms in Brazil compared with revenues.“It’s an organic growth, not much expansion and even the replacement of aircraft is being as postponed as much as possible,” said Mr Curado. He predicted Embraer’s revenue would rise from about $5.4bn to $5.6bn in 2011.Embraer received a boost recently from the visit of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to China. This resulted in an order worth up to $1.4bn for Embraer’s midsized E-190 commercial jet and permission to begin assembling a corporate jet in China.Mr Curado said there was a need for more such two-way trade of value-added products between Brazil and China, which is now the biggest trading partner of Latin America’s largest economy.Trade is currently skewed towards Brazilian exports of natural resources in exchange for cheap Chinese manufactured goods.“There are controls in China, they have licences, they have the ability to limit foreign direct investment, so one way or another, this has to find a balance,” Mr Curado said. “Otherwise, we will just increase the imbalances we already have today.”
271;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-04-26T20:43:28Z;Industrials lift Wall Street;;The S&P 500 index jumped to a multi-year high after promising consumer confidence data and a range of strong earnings reports from leading industry names, such as Ford Motor, 3M and UPS.Shares in Ford rose 0.8 per cent to $15.66 after the carmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $2.55bn, its highest profit for the period in 13 years and a 22 per cent advance on a year earlier. Its 61 cents of earnings per share in the quarter, up from 50 cents a year earlier, was also well above the 46 cents estimated by analysts.3M gained after the industrial group reported a 16 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.The stock was up1.9 per cent to $95.94. George Buckley, 3M’s chief executive, said that demand for materials used in the screens for tablet computers was “going up like a rocket ship. And we are the supplier to those folks”. But he added that disruptions from the Japanese earthquake would hit earnings by 10-13 cents per share this year.United Parcel Service also recorded gains after one of the world’s largest package delivery companies managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter. UPS reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share and sending shares in the company up 0.9 per cent to $74.30. The logistics group, which is often regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast.Cummins jumped 7.6 per cent to $116.39 after the maker of truck engines reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled. The well-received results left the S&P industrial sector up 1.8 per cent, the best performing sector on the S&P.Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.8 per cent to $111.94 while General Electric gained 1.1 per cent to $20.10, as both stocks benefited from the generally higher sentiment in the industrial space.These gains helped the benchmark S&P 500 index close 0.9 per cent higher at 1,347.24, its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.9 per cent to 12,595.45 while the Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 2,847.54, a 3½-year high.Also lifting sentiment in the wider markets was news that the US consumer had become slightly more optimistic in April, according to data from the Conference Board.The research group said that its index of consumer confidence increased to 65.4 in April, up from a revised 63.8 in March as more Americans said they expected their incomes to rise in the near future.On the negative side, the Richmond Federal Reserve reported weaker manufacturing activity and US home prices fell by 3.3 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices. The fall in house prices was not unexpected.Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said that now “rest period” in the markets was likely over the coming months, with the S&P ending the quarter only very slightly higher from here.Results from Coca-Cola were the only big disappointment of the session, as the company’s first-quarter earnings per share came in a penny short of Wall Street estimates. In spite of this, net income at the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues rose 18 per cent from the same period last year to $1.9bn, or 82 cents a share.It also reported a rise in sales around the world in spite of rising commodity prices and political turmoil. Still, the earnings miss left the stock down 1.2 per cent at $66.93.Shares in Netflix fell 9 per cent to $228.91 after a disappointing earnings outlook. Investors focused on this, in spite of the company reporting net income at the top end of expectations. The DVD subscription and film streaming service said it added more than 3m subscribers in the quarter.Delta Air Lines jumped 11 per cent to $9.99 after the airline’s first-quarter earnings and revenue beat expectation. The world’s largest airline by market value still reported a loss, however, due to higher fuel costs.Emulex, the chipmaker, fell 6.2 per cent to $9.71 after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.
272;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-04-26T19:32:26Z;Fuel costs drag US airline earnings;;Higher fuel prices dragged first-quarter earnings from Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group, highlighting the strain that the lofty oil price is putting on the fragile airline sector.But despite the headline losses, both companies’ earnings beat expectations and share prices jumped throughout the airline sector.Delta, the world’s largest airline by market value, reported a $318m loss in the first quarter, or 38 cents per diluted share, driven by the $610m impact of 30 per cent higher fuel prices.This was still better than the 50 cents per share loss expected by analysts from the quarter, however, and Delta’s stock soared 9.7 per cent to $9.87.The Atlanta-based company also reported revenues up 13 per cent from the same quarter last year at $7.75bn, ahead of the $7.61bn expected, as demand for air travel continued to rebound from the recession. Passenger revenue grew by 13 per cent while passenger revenue per available seat mile rose increased by 7.3 per cent.Delta also vowed to fight back against the higher fuel prices, which threatens to undermine a delicate recovery in the airline industry.Earlier this year, American Airlines, the third-largest US carrier, and Delta estimated fuel prices could add about $1bn to their costs if they remained at the current elevated levels in 2011.The company said it would attempt to pass on the fuel costs to its passengers, retire inefficient aircraft and reduce capacity on its worst-performing lines in the coming quarters.“Fuel is the biggest challenge facing this industry and Delta is actively reducing capacity, implementing fare actions, hedging our fuel needs and attacking our cost structure in order to offset fuel’s impact on our earnings,” said Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive officer.Other factors in Delta’s loss included winter storms and the earthquake in Japan, which hurt revenue by $90m and $35m respectively.Elsewhere in the sector, US Airways also extended its losses, losing $110m in the quarter, or 68 cents a share, as its earnings were also weighed down by higher fuel costs. But again analysts were expecting a loss of 72 cents a share, and the company’s stock was up 5.4 per cent to $8.73.Revenue for US Airways was up 12 per cent to $2.96bn, but this was slightly short of the $2.94bn expected by analysts.
273;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;CME-linked index looks at tracking Brent;;A leading commodity index marketed by CME Group is to look into tracking benchmark European crude, potentially draining billions of dollars from the exchange operator’s flagship energy contract.Supervisors of the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index will consider adding Brent crude to the basket of 19 futures contracts tracked by about $77bn in assets.Crude oil makes up 16.5 per cent of the index.The proposal would likely shift more oil trading volume, and investor money, to Brent, the main rival to CME’s own benchmark oil futures contract.The only crude type now in the index is West Texas Intermediate, the blend that has lagged behind Brent by $10 or more this year as a glut has grown at the contract’s US delivery point.WTI is mainly traded on CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent is chiefly traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit of IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Nymex May WTI settled at $109.92, down $2.87 a barrel, and ICE May Brent closed at $123.98, down $2.67 a barrel.“If they do a reshuffling in January 2012, they are going to have to buy Brent and sell WTI,” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, a consultant in Switzerland.CME has defended the benchmark in newspaper advertisements and videos and pointed out that open interest in WTI futures reached a record last month. However, traders from the Saudi state oil company to Delta Air Lines have lost faith in WTI as a pricing tool.CME owns 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes, which markets the commodity index. The index handbook this month said a supervisory committee “intends to consider whether storage and delivery characteristics of crude oil” would make an “allocation to Brent crude oil in the index appropriate” in 2012. The handbook cited a research note by the International Energy Agency titled: US WTI Price Structure Collapsing Under Weight of Surplus Inventories.CME told the Financial Times that commodity indices “make weighting decisions in accordance with transparent policies and rules. And, while we can’t comment on the prospective changes, we respect those processes and believe adherence to transparent and clear rules is sound policy.”
274;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-04-01T20:22:04Z;FSA is in dire need of remedial action;;Guillaume Rambourg’s ‘victory’ this week was as hollow as they come.A year after the Financial Services Authority launched an investigation into events at Gartmore, the fund manager where Mr Rambourg worked, the City regulator quietly terminated the probe without taking any formal action against him.During the intervening period, the trail of destruction was remarkable. Gartmore has been sold at a huge discount to its 2009 initial public offering price, dozens of staff have lost their jobs and Mr Rambourg has been left to pick up the pieces of his career.It is far from the first time that an FSA investigation, kicked off with briefings in Canary Wharf about suspected wrongdoing, has evaporated.Since the Conservatives announced in opposition that they would abolish the FSA in its current form, hiving off its crime-fighting functions into a separate agency, the regulator’s enforcement officers have resembled hyperactive detectives.Could another example shortly be upon us? Last month, the first anniversary of an even higher-profile probe (the arrest of executives from firms including Deutsche Bank and Exane BNP Paribas) passed by almost unnoticed. The men are suspected of being part of an allegedly sophisticated and wide-ranging insider trading ring. Yet people involved in the FSA’s investigation say those arrested have since had interviews with the regulator repeatedly postponed. Some have apparently been told that they will not be spoken to until this summer at the earliest.In the FSA’s defence, large insider trading cases are complicated beasts. Margaret Cole, the regulator’s head of enforcement, has undoubtedly helped to professionalise the ragtag band of investigators she inherited. And it is often the case that while the FSA has good reason to suspect malpractice, the evidence is simply not there to justify prosecution.Yet other than retaining the FSA’s crime-busting activities within the new Financial Conduct Agency, the government has still to outline its proposed remedies for the division’s consistently below-par performance.A system where suspects must be charged within a certain period of time or have an investigation dropped might help.Even if that is seen as unworkable, the status quo, involving lengthy investigations and a poor prosecution record, is unsatisfactory.Whose move next?There is just over a week left until we know whether Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered will be packing their suitcases, ready to desert a denuded City of London.That is the erroneously black-and-white depiction of the Independent Commission on Banking’s interim report, which will be published on April 11.It will be a crucial document, but to suggest that it is anything other than an opening gambit in the chess game between regulators and bankers misses the point.Suggestions that Treasury officials are seeking a peace deal between the ICB and major lenders to avoid triggering an exodus of Britain’s universal banks have rightly been dismissed.In fact, the interim report will suggest the opposite. I understand that the commissioners have concluded that UK-based banks account for a relatively low proportion of economic activity in the City.Their report will go on to say that ring-fencing banks’ retail operations is therefore unlikely to trigger the economic disaster predicted by the industry.Another frenetic round of lobbying is about to get under way.Glencore prospectsAttempting to identify the chairman who will steer Glencore, the commodities trader, through its $60bn stock market listing has become a popular City pastime.The governance challenges enmeshed in Glencore’s on-off merger discussions with Xstrata, the mining group in which it is the biggest shareholder, make it a challenge even for the hardiest boardroom stalwarts.People close to the company say the new chairman will be announced alongside its intention to float.The appointee is unlikely to be Rodney Chase, an early frontrunner for the job. People close to the company this week played down the suggestion that Mr Chase’s US citizenship became an obstacle because of the extraterritorial nature of certain US legislation.Nonetheless, my hunch is that Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s chief executive, will not be welcoming an American as chairman. One person who has just become available, and who knows the commodities sector well, is Ken Costa, who stepped down this week as the chairman of Lazard International.Flight control . . .Has SkyTeam, the alliance involving Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines, just secured an advantage in the battle for control of Virgin Atlantic?I understand that Eduard van Wyk, one of the senior bankers advising Virgin at Deutsche Bank, is defecting to Goldman Sachs, the SkyTeam consortium’s adviser on a potential bid.Mr van Wyk is on gardening leave until June, by which time Virgin is likely to be clearer about the route forward. Unhappily for SkyTeam, however, I am told that Mr van Wyk will not be working on the mandate because of Goldman’s internal rules on conflicts of interest.Mark Kleinman is City editor of Sky News and writes a blog at www.skynews.com/kleinman.mark.kleinman@ft.com
275;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-03-28T19:35:24Z;Delta Air Lines shifts fuel hedges out of US benchmark;;Delta Air Lines, one of the world’s largest carriers, has shifted almost all its jet fuel hedges away from US crude in the latest sign that the benchmark has run into trouble as a tool to manage energy costs.Delta and other US airlines have traditionally purchased contracts for US benchmark crude oil to hedge volatile jet fuel costs. Jet fuel is refined from crude oil and usually tracks its price.But this year the US crude benchmark, known as West Texas Intermediate, has lagged behind the 27 per cent rise in jet fuel, creating difficulties for US airlines. The rise in Brent, a European benchmark, has been more in line with the jet fuel trend.“We’ve needed to restructure our hedge position,” Ed Bastian, Delta president, told a conference last week. The airline spent $7.6bn on fuel and related taxes in 2010.“WTI, which is the instrument that many of us hedge in this market, has dislocated from Brent in terms of pricing.”The US benchmark has sold at a rare discount of $10 per barrel to Brent for most of this year as a glut developed at the Oklahoma delivery point for WTI crude futures traded on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange.With supplies pouring in from the US and Canada, analysts said the disparity of WTI with Brent and other grades might persist until pipelines reconnect the landlocked delivery point with waterborne markets along the Gulf of Mexico. This could take years.US airlines seeking long-term protection against oil price swings have tended to favour crude oil to refined products because the market is more transparent and heavily traded. Delta uses a combination of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap and option contracts to manage fuel costs.Mr Bastian said Delta had “converted, over the course of the last 45 days, nearly all of our WTI positions” to Brent or heating oil.JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America have also raised concerns about the discrepancy between WTI and jet fuel.Energy exchanges are trying to take advantage of the shift. IntercontinentalExchange, the main Brent futures venue, on March 14 launched futures contracts that track the spread between heating oil, a jet fuel proxy, and Brent. ICE cited “requests from US-based market participants”. On Monday CME listed a similar contract.
276;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-03-22T16:47:28Z;Quake dents Pacific air travel demand;;The ongoing natural and nuclear disaster in Japan is hurting international airline profits and denting demand for travel far beyond the Pacific region, according to senior airline executives.Airlines have been scrambling to cope since a massive earthquake struck the northeast of Japan two weeks ago, triggering a nuclear disaster that has discouraged tourism and caused widespread disruptions to commerce.On Tuesday Ed Bastian, president of Delta Air Lines, the second largest US airline by revenues, said at a conference that disruptions caused by the unfolding crisis in Japan could cut up to $400m from profits this year. Delta’s net income for 2010 was $593m.Other carriers are less exposed to Japan but the disaster has still dented demand. US Airways, which has no routes to Japan, said on Tuesday that total bookings slid about 20 per cent the day the earthquake struck and remain depressed.“It’s psychological more than anything, as people deal with the uncertainty of supply chains around the world,” Scott Kirby, president of US Airways, the fifth largest US airline by revenues, said at the same conference. “I think it will be a temporary effect.”The setback in Japan comes as airlines are struggling to cope with a surge in fuel prices that has added to their costs. In response, carriers have been pushing through ticket price increases, cutting capacity and retooling their fuel hedging strategies.Ripples from the disaster in Japan have added another layer of complex problems. Flights to Japan have been departing with empty seats while outbound services have been packed after several European governments warned their citizens to leave.At the same time, European carriers such as Lufthansa have rerouted flights away from Tokyo to the south of the country in order to avoid airborne radiation particles, while other airlines have rescheduled crews so they don’t have to spend nights in the capital.In a recent report, the International Air Transport Association warned that the combined effect of the crises could be “major slowdown” for airlines in Japanese markets and that the market was unlikely to recover before the second half of 2011.Japan makes up about 6.5 per cent of airline traffic and the market is worth about $62.5bn in 2010, more than 10 per cent of total industry revenues. US airlines are particularly exposed as US-Japan travel represents about 17 per cent of revenues from the area.Speaking in New York, Mr Bastian said that the company had been hit hard by the disaster in Japan because it was the biggest US carrier into Japan and had a “massive” investment in infrastructure there.Mr Bastian said that Delta would cut capacity to and from Japan by between 15 and 20 per cent in order to respond to the drop off in demand and that it was expecting a profits hit of between $250m and $400m in 2011.But he added that while “a number of airlines [are] starting to pull out of Tokyo. We will not pull out of Tokyo. We’re staying in Tokyo … we will be and continue to be an active participant in the rebuilding of that marketplace.”Analysts at JPMorgan estimate that Delta generates about $2.5bn from routes to, through and from Japan, while United Airlines generates about $1.4bn of its revenues there.Beverly Goulet, treasurer of American Airlines, said at the conference on Tuesday that her company was operating a full schedule and had seen only a “modest” revenue impact from the disaster so far but was monitoring the situation.American, she said, intends to go ahead with its plans to start a joint venture with Japan Airlines on April 1 that will combine their transpacific businesses and allow them to coordinate prices and schedules.Analysts at Citigroup estimate that European flag carriers generate about 5 per cent of their revenues in yen.

Areas of expansion could include kitchenware, school equipment, toys and pet supplies. Ocado is expected to source most of the goods directly, although it could work with John Lewis on some products.Mr Belsham is the third director to leave Tesco this year, as it undergoes its biggest management transition in 14 years with the retirement of Sir Terry Leahy and appointment of Philip Clarke as chief executive.

278;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-02-25T20:39:15Z;Virgin needs merger to secure flight path;;Not for the first time in his career, Sir Richard Branson may be approaching the end of the runway.Four months after hiring Deutsche Bank to carry out a strategic review at Virgin Atlantic, the number of parking stands available for a suitable merger looks limited.Unlike the occasion in 1999 when a deal to sell almost half of his company to Singapore Airlines (for what turned out to be a bumper price) was proposed on a restaurant napkin, the Virgin founder will this time be pressed into more formal negotiations.Sir Richard does hold some important cards. Virgin Atlantic’s ownership of 3 per cent of Heathrow’s landing slots is attractive to the SkyTeam Alliance led by Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines, which has been working with Goldman Sachs on a takeover proposal for several months.Similarly, Virgin’s transatlantic routes would be a useful addition to the Star Alliance (of which Singapore is a member), which could be re-engineered by Lufthansa to use its BMI subsidiary as a feeder network for Sir Richard’s airline.The third alternative for Virgin would be to agree a deal with one of the major Gulf-based carriers. Etihad, of Abu Dhabi, has expressed publicly an interest in extending its relationship with Virgin Blue in Australia, which would help it fulfil a desire to create a global brand.Alternatively, Sir Richard might eschew a full merger or sale of Virgin Atlantic in favour of joining one of the major alliances. That, though, would risk diluting the Virgin brand while not providing the expansion capital required for an independent carrier to compete with a new wave of aviation industry powerhouses.There may also be another, nuclear, option: selling to British Airways’ new parent company, International Airlines Group, an idea cheekily raised this week by Willie Walsh, its chief executive.Even if that idea repels Sir Richard, sitting out the next wave of airline mergers looks like the least viable option if he wants to secure Virgin Atlantic’s long-term future.Value investor?The notion that UK taxpayers extracted a bargain from their rescue of Royal Bank of Scotland is not among the readily quoted axioms of the banking crisis.Two-and-a-half years after it took place, though, there is a good chance of it becoming true.The bank’s participation in the Asset Protection Scheme (APS), designed to provide state insurance for £280bn of toxic loans, has thus far been a welcome contributor to Treasury coffers, costing RBS more than £2bn in fees.Talk, however, of an early exit from the APS looks misguided. RBS emphasised this week the economic benefit it believes it derives from its continued involvement, particularly given that its membership is already funded until next year.Could there, however, be an alternative solution to managing the £195bn of loans still insured through the APS?I am told that Stephan Wilcke, chief executive of the Asset Protection Agency (which administers the APS), has in recent months discussed with Treasury officials the idea of establishing a separate RBS ‘bad bank’.The structure of such an entity is unclear, although people familiar with the idea say it would have been run by Mr Wilcke.It could have had advantages: by removing the entire non-core division from RBS’s books, it would allow an instant acceleration of the clean-up of the bank’s balance sheet.That said, a new bad bank would require a fresh government guarantee, which would set alarm bells ringing in Brussels and Whitehall.For that reason, among others, the proposal is understood to have been rejected by the Treasury.RBS’s gradual self-erosion of its vast non-core empire marches onwards.Die another dayAs the proud home of the James Bond film franchise, the studios at Pinewood are accustomed to staging dramatic exits. Is Michael Grade, chairman of Pinewood Shepperton, about to join the ranks of characters such as Oddjob, Scaramanga and Jaws?Unenthused by Pinewood’s share price performance since its 2004 flotation, some investors, including Crystal Amber, which owns nearly 28 per cent, wish that were so.Yesterday, the shares closed at 142p, compared with the listing price of 180p. Pre-tax profits have fallen by about 50 per cent since Pinewood’s first year as a public company.Nonetheless, those close to Lord Grade of Yarmouth say he is more likely to audition to replace Daniel Craig as 007 than he is to voluntarily end his 11-year stint at the helm of Pinewood.That is despite the increased demands on his time as one of David Cameron’s newly-ennobled peers and position as chairman of Ocado, the online grocer.I am told that, contrary to recent suggestions, Crystal Amber has not reversed its position on Lord Grade and is continuing to press the company to identify a successor.A positive set of annual results next month might go some way towards strengthening the position of Peel Holdings, the company’s other major shareholder, which continues to support the former ITV chairman.Nevertheless, Pinewood’s annual meeting in June looks like offering the scene for a battle of which even Bond in his Sean Connery heyday would have been proud.Mark Kleinman is City editor of Sky News and writes a blog at www.skynews.com/kleinman.mark.kleinman@ft.com
279;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-02-03T23:58:07Z;Fuel price forces Delta to cut growth plans;;Delta Air Lines on Thursday said it would trim the number of seats and aircraft it plans to fly in the first quarter of the year as it fights to offset a recent surge in jet fuel prices that threatens to undermine a fragile recovery in the airline industry.The move is one of the first by a leading airline to cope with the rise in oil prices and will reassure airline shareholders that companies are prepared to take steps to tackle the issue and preserve profit margins.“I know the number one thing on all your minds is fuel prices I can assure you, it’s the number one thing on our mind as well … we’re taking action on it,” Ed Bastian, President of Delta, told investors at an airline conference in New York.Delta shares on Thursday rose more than 1.59 per cent to $11.53, shares in AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, climbed about 2 per cent to $7.18 and shares in United Continental Holdings, the parent company of the now merged United Airlines and Continental Airlines, adding about 3.5 per cent to $25.63.Earlier this year, Delta, the second-largest US carrier by revenues, and American Airlines, the third-largest US carrier, estimated fuel prices could add about $1bn to their costs if they remained at the current elevated levels in 2011.Mr Bastian said Delta would cut its capacity growth plans from its previous guidance of 5 per cent to 7 per cent, to between 3 per cent and 5 per cent, although some of that was due to recent bad weather.He pointed out first-quarter operating margins were on track to meet the company’s target of 1 per cent to 3 per cent – in line with the first quarter 2010 results in spite of a $400m increase in the price of fuel.During recent earnings calls Delta and a number of leading US airlines said they would raise prices to soften the effect of rising oil prices and noted that they would also make operational adjustments, such as grounding inefficient airplanes, to reduce costs.But analysts were concerned that most companies stuck to their earlier forecasts for moderate capacity growth in 2011. Greater supply of seats in the market makes it more difficult for airlines to fill airplanes, increase prices and cover fuel costs.In 2008 a run-up in the price of jet fuel triggered huge losses in the global airline industry. Carriers eventually cut capacity and analysts noted that the moves helped them survive both the short-term shock and the later economic crisis.“This time round airlines are being much more proactive, rather than reactive, which can only be good for the industry,” said Bill Swelbar, a research engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Airlines have some room for manoeuvre on fuel. They have better balance sheets after a solid year of profitability in 2010, some are taking delivery of new more fuel efficient aircraft and many have created breathing space with hedging contracts.At the same time, rising demand for travel as the global economy gradually improves, has allowed the industry to charge higher prices. Mr Bastian noted that in the last 45 days the industry had increased fares four times and had launched another hike on Thursday.
280;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-31T15:21:17Z;US airlines;Taking off again, but there may be turbulence ahead;After a horrible 2009, US airlines have surged back. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Continental and US Airways have all reported either jumbo profits for 2010, or significantly narrowed losses. And the good times look set to continue. Barclays Capital expects the US airline industry to earn about $9bn in operating profit in 2011, slightly higher than last year’s record.The bad news is that one key cause of the profit boost is not likely to last long. This reporting season, chief executives have been quick to thrust their capacity management capabilities into the limelight. The industry’s revenue per mile rose almost one-third in the past 12 months as 82 per cent of seats on North America’s planes carried paying passengers. That is a higher proportion than in any other region in the world, according to the International Air Transport Association, and was enabled by last year’s meagre 3.5 per cent increase in capacity, measured in available seat kilometres.However, limiting supply growth to drive ticket prices up and costs down creates a prisoner’s dilemma. There are short-term profits to be made by being the first to add seats on busy routes. In this super-competitive industry the temptation will be too great to resist, sooner rather than later.Even before then, fuel price inflation could slash profits. The economic recovery is gradual but – even before Egypt took the headlines – the price of oil has been rising fast. Morgan Stanley estimates that with jet fuel at $120 per barrel (up from the current $110), Delta could lose one-third of its net earnings, United and American more than half, and US Airways significantly more. The least worst off – a 14 per cent drop – would be Southwest and Alaska Air. The latter of these two trades below its peers yet has a robust earnings outlook.

281;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-18T21:33:30Z;Gains in materials and industrials lift Wall St;;Shares in Apple lost ground after Steve Jobs, chief executive officer, announced that he would be taking a medical leave of absence.The world’s second most valuable company fell 2.3 per cent to $340.65, helping to lead the S&P technology index down 0.5 per cent to 461.47.Mr Jobs said in an e-mail to employees on Monday, when the markets were closed for Martin Luther King Day, that the Apple board had granted him medical leave so he could focus on his health.He did not specify what medical issue has prompted his departure, but it has raised fears that his pancreatic cancer has returned.The last time Mr Jobs said he was going on a leave of absence due to health concerns back in early 2009, shares in Apple fell 2.7 per cent over the day, recovering from much sharper losses in early trading. Shares in Apple were down by as much a 6.5 per cent in early trading, but towards the end of the session losses were pared as investors turned their focus towards first quarter earnings figures. Apple was expected to report earnings of $5.39 a share, well ahead of the $4.80 per share predicted by Apple’s own guidance issued in October.IBM closed up 0.4 per cent to $150.65 on expectations that it would also post strong results after the market close. IBM was expected to post a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $4.08.Financial stocks slid after Citigroup posted below-forecast quarterly earnings on Tuesday morning.The third-largest US bank reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.31bn, or 4 cents a share, which was lower than many analysts had forecast due to $1.1bn in charges related to tightening of the bank’s credit spreads.The earnings were a dramatic improvement from the same period a year ago when the bank lost $7.6bn, or 33 cents a share, but analysts polled by FactSet Research had forecast earnings of 8 cents a share.Shares in Citigroup fell 6.4 per cent to $4.80, dragging on the wider financial sector. The S&P financials index was down 0.8 per cent to 223.68 with Bank of America also losing ground, falling 1.6 per cent to $15.Citigroup’s disappointing numbers follow strong results from JPMorgan Chase on Friday, which raised hopes that all the major US banks would see blockbuster fourth-quarter results. JPMorgan reported net income of $1.12 a share, a 48 per cent increase on the same quarter last year and in excess of analysts’ forecasts of $1 a share. JPMorgan was down 0.4 per cent to $44.75.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Goldman Sachs fell 0.2 per cent to $174.68, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session following news over the weekend that the bank had scrapped an offer to its wealthy clients in the US to participate in a $1.5bn investment in Facebook.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,295.02, as losses from financial and technology stocks were pared by gains in the materials and industrial sectors after positive manufacturing data from the New York region. The Empire State index, which measures the pace of manufacturing activity in the New York-area, increased to 11.92 in January, beating December’s 9.89 and close to the median forecast of 12.50.The index is watched by investors for providing some indication of moves in the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index, to be released later this week, and the ISM manufacturing index. “While not one of the most reliable indicators on a month-by-month basis, today’s report is nonetheless another positive signal regarding manufacturing activity,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,837.93. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent to 2,765.85.In other economic data, the National Association of Home Builders said its housing market index remained flat, which was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.In the materials sector, Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metal manufacturer, rose 5.4 per cent to $60.97 while AK Steel Holding was up 0.5 to $14.93. The S&P materials index was up 0.6 per cent to 242.87.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar, the manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 2.8 per cent to $96.23 while the S&P industrials index was up 0.6 per cent to 311.88.Boeing helped to lead the industrial index higher, rising 3.4 per cent to $72.47.
282;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-18T19:55:13Z;Air fare rises to offset higher fuel cost;;Rising oil prices are a growing burden for the airline industry but efforts to pass on higher costs to passengers should help sustain the fragile recovery under way since late 2009, according to executives at the second-biggest US airline.“The biggest issue we are facing is the steep run-up in fuel prices since September,” Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, told investors on Monday. At today’s prices, fuel could add $1bn to Delta’s costs in 2011.Over the past two years, airlines have struggled back to profitability thanks to a moderate global economic recovery, a strong rebound in demand for travel and higher ticket prices.On Monday, Delta reported fourth-quarter net income of $19m, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $25m, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Profits slightly undershot analyst estimates but sales outperformed, rising 14 per cent to $7.8bn.Delta shares fell 5 per cent to $12.12 on the news.Analysts expect US airlines as a group to post net profits of $400m when they report earnings this week and next, the seventh fourth-quarter net profit in 25 years. But in its most recent report, the International Air Transport Association noted that while airline profit cycles usually last between seven and 10 years, “2011 may see smooth upward progression being interrupted as oil and jet fuel prices rise”.The association is expecting airline net profits to dip from about $15.1bn in 2010 to about $9.1bn in 2011 as fuel prices move from $79 a barrel to an average price of about $84 a barrel.Airlines have room for manoeuvre. Many have locked in lower prices through hedging, and a more efficient use of aircraft provides opportunities for savings to offset higher oil costs.Delta plans to cut another 100 aircraft, mainly inefficient 50-seat regional jets, from its fleet over the next 18 months in addition to the 100 or so it has dropped in the past two years.If airlines keep a tight hold on supply and the economy remains on track, Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank expects the industry to “recapture much of the fuel increase via higher air fares”.In the past month, US airlines have raised prices for domestic fares three times and on international routes most airlines increased premium rates by $50 just before Christmas.If oil prices settle in the mid-$80 range, analysts at JPMorgan argue the industry could still “support record profits”. But if they reach $100 to $120, airlines will be pushed into survival mode.
283;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-17T21:10:11Z;Branson considers reducing airline stake;;Sir Richard Branson says he is looking reluctantly at selling down his controlling stake in Virgin Atlantic, the airline he founded almost 27 years ago, to ensure it survives mounting competition from larger rivals.Virgin hired Deutsche Bank last year to review the UK-based airline’s options after US authorities agreed to allow rivals British Airways and American Airlines to run their transatlantic businesses jointly in spite of strenuous opposition from Sir Richard.“We realised for the long-term stability of Virgin Atlantic we needed to look at an alliance partner, and whether it is purely an alliance or more than an alliance we’re completely undecided,” said Sir Richard.“My preference would be to keep control of the airline,” said the billionaire entrepreneur, whose Virgin Group has a 51 per cent stake in the carrier, with the remaining 49 per cent held by Singapore Airlines.“Since the competition authorities in their wisdom have allowed these mega alliances, in order to protect Virgin Atlantic long-term …we’re now going to have to make sure we have the firepower and strength to survive the next 50 years.“Obviously, Virgin Atlantic has been a bit of a baby to me. We’re obviously very attached to the airline but equally I want to be sure she’s still around in 50 years’ time.”Delta Air Lines of the US has been mooted as a potential buyer but Sir Richard said that there were a number of interested parties and “we’ll see how discussions go”.Sir Richard was speaking in Toulouse where one of his more recent start-ups, Virgin America, announced 60 firm orders, as opposed to memoranda of understanding, for Airbus’s best-selling A320 jets.Thirty of the jets ordered by the San Francisco-based low-cost airline, in which Virgin Group has a 25 per cent stake, will be A320 NEOs, a new version of the single-aisle workhorse with next-generation engines that Airbus says will make it 15 per cent more fuel-efficient than existing models.That added efficiency will allow Virgin America to start flights from the west coast of the US to Hawaii, said David Cush, the airline’s chief executive.The 60-jet deal is worth $5.1bn (£3.2bn) at list, or advertised, prices though airlines frequently negotiate substantial discounts and Sir Richard said he was “sure” this had been the case with Virgin America.Sir Richard, who was getting about on crutches after a skiing accident, said he believed the fuel efficiency of the aircraft was critical to the industry’s future and Airbus’s US rivals at Boeing needed to follow suit.“If Boeing don’t match it they are out of business in the small-jet market,” he said, adding he believed it would do so.
284;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Airbus edges ahead of Boeing in orders;;"Airbus claimed victory over its older US rival Boeing on Monday in the battle to supply airlines with passenger jets after revealing a fresh order from Virgin America, the low-cost US airline founded by Sir Richard Branson.San Francisco-based Virgin America said it would buy 30 Airbus A320 NEO planes, a revamped version of the manufacturer’s best-selling A320 narrow-body aircraft.The airline will also buy 30 existing model A320s in a deal worth around $5bn at advertised prices, although in reality airlines frequently negotiate much lower prices.Virgin America became the second airline in less than a week to order a batch of the aircraft, which together with Boeing’s similarly-sized 737 make up 44 per cent of commercial planes in service.The flurry of last-minute deals saw Airbus notch up 574 net orders in 2010, Airbus revealed on Monday, compared with Boeing’s 530.Airbus also beat Boeing’s delivery numbers, handing over a record 510 jets last year against the 462 delivered by the US manufacturer.Net orders, or booked sales minus cancellations, are an indicator of potential performance and the two manufacturers, who together dominate the global market for large passenger jets, watch each other’s order and delivery numbers closely.Airbus has outpaced Boeing every year since 2003 in terms of the number of passenger jets delivered but its record on orders has been more uneven.The move comes six days after the Indian budget airline, Indigo, said it would buy 150 of the A320 NEO jets as part of a $15.6bn deal. The new aircraft, which Airbus plans to fly from 2016, which will have new generation engines the group says will make them up to 15 per cent more fuel efficient than existing models.Sir Richard, who was in Toulouse for a ceremonial signing for the jets, said: “Our business can no longer ignore climate change and advances like the NEO are not only good for the climate and bottom line but ultimately they are good for the health of our industry”.David Cush, Virgin America chief executive, said the greater range on the new aircraft would allow Virgin, which now has 34 Airbus jets in its fleet, to fly from the west coast to Hawaii for the first time.The two A320 NEO deals bolster Airbus’s arguments that it made the right decision late last year to re-engine its A320s. The Toulouse-based manufacturer and Boeing had both spent months trying to decide whether to replace the engines on their biggest-selling planes, or spend more money developing an entirely new aircraft.Both face mounting pressure from ambitious aircraft manufacturers in Canada, China and Russia who plan to bring rival single-aisle jets to market as early as 2013.Boeing still has not said what it will do, but has been outwardly dismissive of Airbus’s NEO, saying it will be expensive and complex.While Virgin America and Indigo’s orders are a welcome sign of the airline industry’s recovery and a boost for Airbus, both were already customers of the European manufacturer.Analysts will be much more impressed if Airbus can use its new jets to win market share from airlines that have traditionally been Boeing customers.The first big test could come in the US, where Delta Air Lines has just revealed it may order 100 to 200 narrow-body jets to replace aircraft in a fleet that includes some of the oldest jets in the American industry.Delta traditionally bought Boeing jets but inherited Airbus aircraft when it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008.“Airbus has a big opportunity coming up with the NEO,” said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the US consultancy, Teal Group.“Indigo isn’t a market share shift; they’re an Airbus carrier. The real test is when you use a new product to go after the other guy’s market share and Delta is the golden opportunity for that.”"
285;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-06T22:19:35Z;BA warns of £50m bad weather costs;;"British Airways will take a dent in its income of at least £50m because of the snow that caused travel chaos in its home airport of Heathrow in the week before Christmas, new figures show.BA traffic volumes for December fell by 8.3 per cent compared with the same month in 2009, after a large fall of snow closed one of Heathrow’s two runways for more than three days, stranding thousands of passengers in one of the year’s busiest holiday weeks.BA said it thought the weather problems would cost it about £50m in the third quarter and there would be “some small additional impact” in January because of cancelled return journeys.The fresh financial blow comes after BA, which has only just started returning to profit after two years of heavy losses, suffered extra costs from a series of cabin crew strikes, bad weather and the disruption that followed the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull in April 2010.Investors had been expecting the poor figures, however, and shares in BA closed more than 4 per cent higher at 300.2p. Analysts noted that traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in December, compared with a 9.6 per cent slide in economy.In addition, so-called premium traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in December, compared with a 9.6 per cent decline in economy seat traffic.However, the December traffic decline brings to a halt three months of steady increases in BA’s passenger numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the distances they fly.The airline had seen its traffic volumes rise from September after suffering large declines as a result of the volcanic ash disruption in April; strike action in March and May and severe weather problems in January last year, when traffic fell 7 per cent.Some of the airline’s rivals have seen much healthier passenger figures.Ryanair, Europe’s largest budget airline in terms of revenue, said its passenger numbers rose 2 per cent in December, as measured by the number of booked seats, compared with the same month a year earlier.But larger intercontinental airlines such as BA are expected to keep reporting losses as a result of poor winter weather on both sides of the Atlantic.In the US, Delta said on Thursday that December’s bad weather in the US and Europe had reduced its net profit for the fourth quarter by about $45m (£29m) from previous expectations.The December figures brought to a sharp halt three months of steady increases in BA’s monthly passenger numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the distances they fly.Separately on Thursday, BA said it had signed contracts to buy Rolls-Royce engines for up to 61 new wide-body passenger jets, including at least 12 A380 superjumbos, in the first deal the UK engine maker has signed since one of its engines blew apart on a Qantas A380 in November.The BA order is worth up to $5bn at advertised prices and the manufacturer’s shares rose slightly on what some analysts described as reassuring news, given the Qantas incident.But others said they expected little impact from an order first announced in 2007. “More important would be a new win” from an airline that had not chosen an engine for the A380, said Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners."
286;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2011-01-06T00:58:30Z;Sabre move escalates American Airlines row;;Sabre Holdings on Wednesday jumped into the battle between American Airlines and the companies that distribute its tickets, saying it would raise the prices it charges the carrier to facilitate transactions.Privately held Sabre, which provides flight data to travel agencies, added that it would end its contract with American in August, a month earlier than planned and would display American’s tickets less prominently on its systems in the meantime.The moves represent a significant escalation of the row between American and the third party intermediaries that distribute and sell its products and suggest that the carrier’s efforts to cut its distribution costs could end up backfiring.The dispute could make it more difficult for customers to buy American’s tickets. In 2006, the last year that Sabre released public reports, it had deals with travel agencies at more than 50,000 locations in 113 countries.At present, most airlines rely on three main global distribution systems, which pull together data from multiple carriers and pass it on to online and bricks and mortar travel agencies. In 2008, about $81bn, or 64 per cent, of US airline tickets were sold through GDSs.The set-up provides the airlines with access to an enormous range of customers, but they must pay the GDSs – about $3.10 according to the companies – for each flight segment booked. In 2009, such charges cost American roughly $300m.To reduce those costs, American has been pushing for agents to connect directly with its own computers to book tickets when their contracts come up for renewal. Such moves would cut out the middleman.In December, American pulled its fares from Orbitz.com, a popular comparison website, after failing to agree a new deal. At the start of January, Expedia, another online travel agent, fell out with the carrier.The online travel agencies and their supporters have accused American of undermining consumer choice and transparency and by making it more difficult for travellers to compare prices.Self interest also plays a role. A direct connection would reduce the commissions they receive from the GDSs. Many online travel agents are owned by GDS groups. For example, Sabre owns Travelocity.“This is broader than a specific contract dispute,” said Chris Kroeger, senior vice president of Sabre Travel Network. “We have observed American’s actions and statements and it has become clear that they intend to impose an unproven, costly and unnecessary system onto the public.”In a strongly worded statement American condemned the moves as “punitive actions” that were “discriminatory and patently inconsistent with [Sabre’s] contractual obligations and its professed goal of ensuring full transparency for the benefit of consumers and travel agents.”While few carriers have been as aggressive as American, many share its aversion to paying the GDSs. During contract negotiations in 2006, several airlines used the threat of adopting alternative distribution systems to extract discounts from the GDSs.“Over time the industry will evolve more to the model of other industries where people pay us for our content rather than us paying them to take our content, because our content is very rich,” Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta mused in 2009.For American, the conflict with Sabre and its peers is likely to escalate before it recedes.Its contracts with the two other leading GDSs, Amadeus and Travelport, also expire in 2011. Still, investors in the third-largest US airline by revenues appeared unfazed by the developments. Shares in AMR Corp, American’s parent company, climbed 6.1 per cent in afternoon trading to reach $8.60.Sabre was bought by private equity groups, Silver Lake and TPG, in 2007 and is privately owned. It was originally part of American Airlines but was spun off in 2000.
287;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-28T17:57:09Z;High winds add to delays at US airports;;Travellers stranded by storms on the US east coast faced lengthy delays in getting home from their Christmas holidays as high winds caused further cancellations at crucial hubs and airlines struggled to find room on crowded aircraft.Since Sunday, leading US airlines have cancelled more than 6,000 flights after heavy snow showers barrelled up the eastern seaboard, shutting airports and ruining schedules from Tampa, Florida to Manchester, New Hampshire.On Tuesday, key airports limped back into action but strong winds blew snow back on to the tarmac and made take-offs and landings difficult.By midday, Delta Air Lines had cancelled another 200 flights, mostly in the northeast. Meanwhile, JetBlue, one of the largest providers in New York, had cancelled close to 140.All three major New York airports were open on Tuesday morning, but John F. Kennedy International and Newark International were both experiencing average flight delays of over five hours according to the Federal Aviation Administration.Continental Airlines warned its passengers to expect delays and cancellations because of blowing snow and gusty winds on the east coast and poor weather conditions and reduced visibility at airports elsewhere in the US.Dealing with the backlog of stranded passengers promises to be a long and complex process, given the ongoing disruptions and the success that airlines have had in recent months filling aircraft.JetBlue told its customers on Tuesday that “scheduled flights are at full capacity and customers looking to purchase a ticket [in New York and Boston] may not be accommodated at this time.”A spokesman for the company said that it could take up to five days to accommodate all of its customers, adding that it was “working closely with the airports to ensure the smoothest possible return to normal operations”.“The problem for the airlines is getting staff and aeroplanes in the right locations,” said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. “Once that happens, they will start to work through the backlog.”Most airlines extended their policies of waiving rebooking fees for passengers affected by the snow storms, with Southwest among those offering refunds for unused tickets, giving limited respite to frustrated travellers.At the same time, American Airlines and US Airways recalled booking agents from holiday and instituted mandatory overtime policies in order to cope with the volume of calls from customers.The storms, which dropped more than 18 inches of snow in the northeast, left people digging out of steep snowdrifts, disrupted air, road and rail travel and dented the prospects of post-holiday retail sales.

We might see technology pick up, as there are elements of a real cyclical recovery here.”But airline stocks were largely unaffected after the snow kept many aircraft grounded, with the S&P 500 airlines index rising 0.4 per cent.AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, added 1.4 per cent to $7.89, Delta Air Linesgained 1.8 per cent to $12.45 but US Airways nudged down 0.4 per cent to $9.87.Financials, which have risen 10.8 per cent since the start of December on the back of hopes for an improved economy in 2011 and a steepening of the US Treasuries yield curve, edged up further.The S&P 500 financials sector added 1 per cent on Monday with AIG soaring 9.3 per cent to $59.39, the most in the S&P 500.The bailed-out insurer signed $4.3bn worth of credit agreements, seeking to replace government finance with private funds.The shares have gained 42.7 per cent in the past month as the group put together plans for paying back the US government.Goldman Sachs rose 1.3 per cent to $169.83 after the bank adopted a provision in its executive pay scheme that will reward senior staff on their ability to meet long-term performance goals without encouraging “imprudent risk-taking”.Electric carmaker Tesla Motors fell 15.1 per cent to $25.55 after the expiration of a 180-day lock-up period following its initial public offering, but it remained higher than the IPO price of $17 per share.Shares in casual dining chains slipped after a newspaper story suggested that they could fall 20 per cent or more if the expectations for 2011 earnings are not met.Chipotle Mexican Grilllost 2.5 per cent to $222.56 and Panera Bread, a bakery chain, was down 1.2 per cent at $102.86.
289;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Aircraft financing deal reached;;After 12 months of talks, officials say they have reached agreement on a groundbreaking deal that will significantly raise the cost of financing new passenger jets for many of the world’s best-known airlines.The new pact on export credit financing, negotiated by the European Union, the US and eight other countries through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is expected to be formally approved next month and introduced on February 1.It follows frantic last-minute lobbying from airlines such as Ryanair, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg’s Cargolux, which claim the pact is based on “arbitrary” policy-making and will create a “bonanza” for banks.Boeing and Airbus, the world’s largest aircraft makers, have also been lobbying in recent days, claiming the arrangements could dampen demand for their passenger jets and could lead to production cuts.But the agreement will probably be welcomed by airlines in Europe and the US, including Lufthansa, British Airways and Delta, which have been unable to make use of the guarantees export credit agencies offer carriers such as Ryanair and Etihad to support commercial loans for aircraft purchases.It also ends what critics say has been a market distortion that has inflated aircraft production during the global recession.The deal will mean airlines using export credit agencies such as the US Export-Import Bank or France’s Coface to help finance their passenger jets will face fees linked much closer to market rates.Following lobbying last week by Airbus, negotiators agreed quarterly adjustments of these fees will not lead to rises of more than 10 per cent from the rate set in the previous quarter, officials familiar with the negotiations told the Financial Times.It has also been agreed that existing, more generous export financing rules will effectively be kept in place or “grandfathered” for aircraft due to be delivered up until the end of 2012, to protect financing arrangements already negotiated.Aircraft grandfathered in a previous 2007 deal, including some of Airbus’s A380 superjumbos, will be “great-grandfathered” in the new agreement, though small financial penalties will be applied.The Aviation Alliance lobby group, which includes Ryanair and other airlines that have long used export credit financing, said the grandfathering should have been extended for at least three years through 2013, and warned they would keep fighting.“If this deal goes through we will be trying to have it overturned because it is cartel pricing,” said Howard Millar, Ryanair finance director.The text of the agreement, which includes a February 1 starting date, is still subject to final clearance from governments in the US, the European Union and eight other countries that have been party to the talks. This is expected by January 20.But officials close to the negotiations said on Tuesday that the resolution of final sticking points such as the grandfathering clauses meant agreement had effectively been reached.
290;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-20T23:06:06Z;Position limits proposal under private scrutiny;US regulator changes tack over restraints on commodity speculation;A US regulator has changed procedural tack as it considers new restraints on commodity speculation after a public meeting on the measures ended without a vote last week.The so-called position limits proposal, which would cap investor holdings in 28 commodities from oil to palladium, is now being circulated privately among the five commissioners of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, people familiar with the process said. If a majority sign off, the plan will be released for public comment without another meeting.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, unexpectedly adjourned a meeting last Thursday before a roll call on position limits could be taken. He said the proposal needed to “ripen” but said the matter remained pending.Position limits are one of the more controversial initiatives required by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed last July. Lawmakers directed the CFTC to pass rules limiting traders’ size in energy, metals and agricultural commodities traded on and off exchanges.Companies including CME Group, the exchange operator, and Morgan Stanley, the bank that is one of the world’s major energy traders, have raised concerns about strict new limits.The CTFC aired a draft proposal that would have set speculative limits at 25 per cent of deliverable supply for spot commodity contracts. Staff at the CFTC estimated that at most 70 traders in agricultural commodities, six in base metals, eight in precious metals and 40 in energy contracts would be affected by the new spot-month limits.The plan would phase in limits for later-dated contracts only after data on off-exchange derivatives exist, sparking concern from Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner, that the commission is moving too slowly.“I continue to make the case that we should fully utilise our existing authorities during the interim period of time before limits are implemented. Congress told us to implement now,” he said.“Despite much discussion in our public meeting about what we would do in the interim, I’m still not convinced there is any agreement. That’s unfortunate. Until I know what we are going to do in the interim, I won’t be supporting the existing position limit proposal,” he said.Last week Spencer Bachus and Frank Lucas, Republican congressmen who in January are to become chairmen of the House financial services and agriculture committees, respectively, urged regulators to avoid “overly prescriptive” position limits and said they would consider delaying deadlines in the Dodd-Frank law.Companies including exchange operator CME Group and Morgan Stanley, the bank, have warned against strict limits, while Delta Air Lines has encouraged them.The discussions come as commodity indices climb to the highest levels since October 2008.Cotton surged by the exchange-set limit as mill demand remains strong and merchantswere out of the market, said Andy Ryan of brokers FCStone. “There’s no natural selling in cotton today,” Mr Ryan said.ICE March cotton rose by 2.7 per cent to $1.5412 a pound, close to the nominal $1.57 record reached on November 10. Prices implied by options markets were bid at $1.5775 a pound before trading halted.Oil fluctuated. Nymex January West Texas Intermediate, was up 79 cents to $88.81 a barrel.ICE February Brent rose $1.07 to $92.74 a barrel.
291;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-16T22:43:59Z;Airbus in plea over export financing;;Airbus has made a last-ditch appeal to Germany, France and the UK to water down an export financing deal that would make it more expensive for many airlines to buy the aircraft maker’s passenger jets.In a move that puts the Toulouse-based manufacturer at odds with some of its biggest airline customers, Tom Enders, chief executive, wrote earlier this week to governments in each country urging them to modify the impact of an international agreement being discussed in Paris on Friday.Airbus has plants in all three nations.A draft of the new agreement shows airlines that finance their jets with support from export credit agencies, such as France’s Coface or Germany’s Euler Hermes, face a rise in the fees they pay for guarantees provided for commercial loans taken out for jet purchases.The fees, which would vary according to an airline’s credit profile, would be adjusted quarterly in an effort to make them more reflective of market conditions.Mr Enders said Airbus, a unit of the EADS aerospace and defence group, wanted any quarterly movements in the fees to be capped to make sure they did not rise more than 10 per cent from the rate set the previous quarter.He also urged the governments to make sure current, more generous export financing rules, be kept in place or “grandfathered” for aircraft due to be delivered up until December 2012 at the earliest.In a further sign of the controversy surrounding the new rules, Ryanair, Emirates and other airlines in a lobby group that use export guarantees, were on Thursday night preparing to write a separate letter urging the higher fees not to be applied to aircraft delivered within the next three years.Export credit guarantees have been a boon to many airlines, especially during the recent credit crisis when commercial loans became expensive and scarce, leading export credit financing to soar to record levels. However, airlines based in the home countries of Airbus and its US rival, Boeing – including Delta, Air France and British Airways – cannot get such financial support to buy their jets.They have lobbied for it to be made more expensive to end what they say is a damaging market distortion that gives an unfair advantage to fast-growing rivals such as Emirates and Ryanair.This is what officials negotiating the new export financing agreement at the Paris-based OECD’s headquarters over the past year have done.Airbus said there were several problems with the draft under discussion in Paris this week which would make it “unworkable” for airlines.If the agreement is approved as it stands, “there is a danger it could produce a degree of nervousness in the market as to how much financing is going to cost”, Airbus said, adding that this could cause problems in the event of another credit crisis or major market disruption.“In the past it [export credit financing] was seen as more of a port in the storm, providing a stable form of funding at a reasonably predictable cost,” the company said.“In the case of another crisis, with extreme hikes in rates clients may choose not to take aircraft and that could cause production cuts and resulting job losses.”
292;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-14T23:47:52Z;Chinese carriers lift global airline profits;;China is driving the largest airline earnings seen in the Asia-Pacific region, the aviation industry’s leading trade group said on Tuesday, as it sharply upgraded forecasts for 2010 global profits to a record $15.1bn.The International Air Transport Association figure is the largest profit the industry has recorded and almost double the $8.9bn collective profit forecast only three months ago.The improvement follows a “remarkable” turnround in the third quarter, prompted by a return of profitable business travellers and continued growth in air-cargo revenues, said Iata, which has also boosted its estimates of 2011 profits to just over $9bn, up from the $5.3bn it forecast in September.Asia-Pacific carriers remain the world’s star performers and are predicted to contribute nearly half the industry’s global 2010 profits – $7.7bn – the largest the region has ever produced.“We are also seeing big shifts in where the money is,” said Giovanni Bisignani, Iata’s chief executive, who pointed out that Air China is now the world’s biggest airline by market capitalisation, at $20bn, followed by Singapore Airlines at $14bn, Cathay Pacific at $12bn and China Southern at $11bn.As in previous Iata forecasts, the performance of European airlines still lags behind the rest of the world in a reflection of the region’s weaker economic performance. Airlines in this part of the world are expected to produce collective profits of just $400m in 2010, falling to $100m in 2011, Iata said, up from earlier estimates of a loss for the current year.Mr Bisignani said that Europe’s $400m profit was “peanuts” considering that it was only four times larger than Africa’s profits, yet its industry was 13 times the size of Africa’s.“The same is true for the Middle East airlines,” he said. “They will make $700m this year, almost double the Europeans, but on a quarter of the revenues.”North American carriers have improved their profitability and are expected to earn $5.1bn in 2010.The industry’s $15bn-plus 2010 profits are well above the $12.9bn profit made in 2007, before the world plunged into a deep recession that saw the industry make collective losses of $16bn in 2008 and $9.9bn in 2009.But airlines still suffer “pathetic” margins and the industry is nowhere near returning even half the cost of capital, Mr Bisignani cautioned.“A 2.7 margin does not represent a party,” he told reporters at the association’s global media day in Geneva.www.ft.com/airlines
293;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-14T22:58:47Z;Old guard faces battle on jet finance;;There are more than 40 pages in the draft international aircraft financing agreement that officials from the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere are due to finalise in Paris this week.Filled with legal and financial jargon, the document does not make easy reading, starting with its title: Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Civil Aircraft.But the new international system of export financing rules that it sets out lies at the heart of what is fast becoming one of the most significant aviation battles in years: the growing competition between older flag carriers in the US and Europe, and newer rivals such as Dubai’s Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad.Until recently, global aviation rules locked such newcomers out of the world’s biggest aviation markets in North America and Europe. But spreading deregulation has allowed them steadily to become a noticeable presence in their rivals’ backyards.In the UK, for example, the hulking form of an Emirates A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, is a familiar feature not just at Heathrow airport in London, but in regional cities such as Manchester, where the airline opened a new superjumbo service earlier this year.The prospect of Emirates using the 90 superjumbos it has ordered to transform the long distance international market in the way that Ireland’s budget carrier Ryanair has remodelled short-haul flying, has alarmed many established airlines.But they have become even more irate after seeing Emirates, Ryanair and many other profitable airlines accessing export credit agency support that they themselves could not use because of the so-called home country rule, which prevents airlines in Boeing and Airbus countries from getting ECA backing.The issue became more heated after the credit crunch saw government-backed export support swell to record levels – and become cheaper than commercial loans.Emirates and Ryanair have formed a lobby group to argue that while they have used ECA financing for some of their fleets, it is not as cheap as some claim, they still use commercial financing for many jets, and older airlines should not blame this for problems in their own businesses.They said they would happily see an end to the home country rule, but insist ECA support should be maintained as it is.They have been up against a formidable lobbying effort, however.British Airways joined forces earlier this year with eight other European airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, and 15 US carriers, including American Airlines, Delta and Southwest. They argued a new aircraft financing deal being negotiated through the OECD should address what they described as severe “market distortion” by imposing higher ECA fees and lower loan-to-value ratios.The draft of the new agreement shows the lobbying has partly paid off: upfront minimum fees for ECA financing have been raised according to airlines’ credit ratings, ranging from 7.74 per cent for carriers with strong ratings, to as much as 14.77 per cent for CC to C-rated carriers. Loan-to-value ratios have been lowered.These measures effectively blunt the impact of the home market rule, which is not formally part of the OECD negotiations, making it less of an issue.The 24 airlines did not get all they wanted. They had argued for a cap on export credit volumes, for instance. But officials shied away from such a step as they tried to steer a course that would end what one person familiar with the negotiations described as the “gravy train” of cheap export credit financing in the credit crunch, while keeping ECA financing available for the emerging market airlines it was always intended to support.In essence, the new agreement, which replaces an older one signed in 2007, tries to make the cost of ECA financing expensive enough to encourage financially strong airlines to use commercial lenders, but not so unattractive that it could hurt all airlines.All of which means this week’s meetings at the OECD’s Paris offices, where the draft agreement is due to be finalised, are likely to be one of the aviation world’s most closely watched events in some time.
294;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-12-14T05:22:58Z;JCPenney links with Facebook on webstore;;JCPenney, the mid-priced US department store, has become the first leading US retailer to launch online shopping fully integrated with Facebook, the social networking site, in a move that reflects the intense interest among retailers in Facebook’s potential to deliver sales.A new JCPenney webstore allows Facebook users to browse selected inventory and categories and make purchases without leaving the site, while also posting comments and recommendations to other friends on the Facebook network.The retailer has 1.3m registered Facebook “fans”. Tom Nealon, who heads JCPenney’s digital initiatives, said the new application would “encourage social integration and user contribution as our customers shop”.JCPenney is using a platform developed by Usablenet, whose other web products are used by about 180 online and bricks and mortar merchants, with about a quarter of them to use its platform to open similar Facebook stores by the first quarter of next year.Jason Taylor, head of global product strategy for Usablenet, said that Asos, the UK online fashion retailer, also hoped to open its own Facebook site by the end of the year.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods company, launched a similar Facebook e-commerce store in October, using a platform run by Amazon’s web services business. 1-800-Flowers, the online florist, began allowing Facebook users to complete transactions last year, and, in August, Delta Air Lines began offering ticket sales via the Facebook site.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, has made online inventory available on Facebook for comments and search, but directs users to its own site for transactions.Most retailers have so far largely focused on using Facebook as a tool for cultivating loyal customers, through special coupons, online sweepstakes and other offers.Stores have also created links to Facebook from their e-commerce sites that allow customers to share images or comments with their friends, in the hope that this will lead to future sales.Mr Taylor argues that the emergence of e-commerce business within Facebook will provide retail marketing executives with firmer data on which to determine future marketing spending.“One of the things that JCPenney recognises is that they are doing lots of things, but without the key numbers on revenues that are coming through Facebook, it is hard to move the investments forward,” he says.Earlier this year, Facebook also launched a new Facebook Deals service with several retailers, including Macy’s and Gap, aimed at attracting customers to stores by offering discounts to users who register their presence in a physical store.In a separate commerce initiative, Facebook also offers users and small businesses a marketplace feature for buying and selling products, that functions as an online classified service backed by users’ Facebook profiles.
295;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-11-25T19:03:51Z;Airline financing rift deepens;Fight over attempts to curb export credits;"Ryanair and Emirates have taken the unusual step of joining forces with eight other airlines as a multibillion-dollar row over aircraft financing starts to split the world’s ­largest airlines into two rival camps.The Irish budget airline and Dubai’s Emirates normally shun industry alliances. But on Thursday they revealed they had teamed up with carriers such as Etihad of Abu Dhabi, Korean Air, Norwegian and Australia’s Virgin Blue to block what they say are dangerous attempts to curb the use of export credit agency backing for passenger jet purchases.“The real concern for us is how quickly this is moving, so we’re stepping up our efforts to try to get more airlines on board to start lobbying against it,” said Howard Millar, Ryanair finance director.The new Aviation Alliance group is pitting itself against 24 US and European airlines, including Delta, British Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa.This latter group of airlines say it is not fair that an informal agreement known as the home market rule prevents them from obtaining export credit support to buy their aircraft on what they say are the “significantly cheaper” terms available to their rivals such as Emirates, Ryanair and others.The home country rule, which dates back to the 1980s, prohibits countries where Boeing and Airbus aircraft are built – the US, Germany, France, the UK and Spain – from providing export credit agency backing to their own airlines to help them buy aircraft.The issue has become increasingly contentious since the credit crunch, when export credit support ballooned to unprecedented levels as banks and other traditional sources of aircraft financing retreated.Willie Walsh, BA’s chief ­executive, lashed out at the ­situation two months ago, ­saying it amounted to Europe “ funding the expansion of ­Emirates”.BA and the other home country airlines want the home market rule to be scrapped; export credit support levels capped at 20 per cent of aircraft deliveries and the price of export credit financing raised.The Aviation Alliance airlines say they would be happy to see the home market rule abolished, but argue caps and higher fees could be disastrous in another financial crisis.“There would be certain airlines who simply couldn’t finance aircraft without this facility,” said Jim Callaghan, Etihad’s general counsel.The issue is coming to a head in talks on a new set of global rules due to be finalised by the end of this year through the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Negotiators have been focusing on raising up-front fees for export financing, according to people familiar with the situation, but it is not clear if the home market rule will be scrapped."
296;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-11-03T17:31:18Z;Walsh picks out five rivals ‘in play’;;The head of British Airways has identified five European carriers that are likely to come up for sale in the next few years as industry consolidation continues in the world’s second largest aviation market.Speaking at an investor conference in New York, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, highlighted SAS Group, Finnair, Aer Lingus, TAP Portugal and BMI (part of Lufthansa), as airlines that could be “in play” in the near future.Lufthansa recently expressed an interest in SAS of Sweden.The airlines, which are spread throughout Europe and have revenues ranging from a few hundred million euros to about €5bn, have all struggled to break even during the downturn and face significant competitive pressures.BA has long considered itself as a potential consolidator in Europe – earlier this year the company finally inked a merger with Iberia of Spain– but Mr Walsh was careful to say that he was only interested in BMI for certain.“There will be opportunities for further consolidation,” he said. “Not all of these airlines would be attractive to us. Some of them would make sense in a BA context some would make sense in an IAG [the holding company for the merged BA and Iberia] context.”Still, the comments will focus speculation that BA plans to make further mergers and acquisitions a core part of its strategy. In September Mr Walsh said that he had drawn up a list of 12 candidates to buy or merge with after completing the Iberia deal.For airlines recovering from a run of crippling oil prices in 2008 and then the global recession in 2009, consolidation has become the strategy of choice, promising greater scale and financial strength in an increasingly competitive international market place.Continental Airlines and United Airlines, both of the US, agreed to merge in May in a deal that created the world’s largest carrier. Meanwhile Lan of Chile and Tam of Brazil proposed a tie-up in August that would reshape the Latin American market.Mr Walsh said that BMI would make sense for his company, because of the extensive portfolio of landing slots the company holds at Heathrow airport. “If Lufthansa [BMI’s parent company] are looking to sell BMI we would be interested in acquiring it.”The BA chief executive added that the holding structure that he had established with Iberia was “scalable” and designed to allow further acquisitions to be made even where political considerations might require that the target retain its own brand.Earlier this week, BA reported record second quarter operating profits and a pre-tax profit of £158m for the six months to the end of September, suggesting it was finally on the recovery track after two long years of losses.But analysts will be keen to see the benefits of the BA-Iberia before giving their blessing to further consolidation. And the results of those airlines that have joined forces so far have been mixed.Delta Air Lines, which merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, has performed little better than its peers when measured on operating margins excluding the impact of fuel – a key industry measure - according to research by JP Morgan.Indeed for the moment Mr Walsh said that BA would play a passive role for now.“We are not intending to do anything [but] we have had … lots of phone calls from companies who are looking for a partner,” he said. “So there is no question that consolidation will continue within the industry.”

Revenue at its commercial aeroplane division took off, outweighing a dip in defence sales. The shares jumped 3.4 per cent to $71.36.United Technologies benefited from increased sales in its aerospace division, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines.The industrial conglomerate beat analysts’ expectations and raised its profit forecast for the current fiscal year, but the shares, which have risen 7.4 per cent in the past two months, edged up 0.4 per cent to $73.92.Airlines, which had suffered during the recession as consumers and business travellers cut back on air travel, have seen earnings rise strongly as passengers have returned. The S&P 500 airlines index added 3.4 per cent.“I think it has been an extraordinary period of discipline for airlines, it’s not been an easy period to run them,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, who added that he thought the revival in earnings was sustainable. “The planes are packed, they’ve removed excess capacity and improved revenues.”William Green, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that airline growth was being driven by international rather than domestic US travel and that legacy airlines were better positioned to take advantage of this trend than their newer competitors.Delta Air Lines joined Boeing in posting a profit when the year before it had reported a loss. Higher international demand lifted sales and the airline said it expected to remain in the black in the current quarter. Its shares surged 10.9 per cent to $12.97.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, also moved into the black, posting its first profit in seven quarters and beating expectations. The shares climbed 12.6 per cent to $7.34.US Airways jumped 7.4 per cent to $10.84 after flying fuller planes helped the carrier post record-beating profits.Financial stocks, which lagged the indices during most of the session as Morgan Stanley reported its earnings and concerns about the potential costs of the foreclosure crisis persisted, recovered by the closing bell.The S&P 500 financials index advanced 1.1 per cent.Low trading volumes and a writedown on a stalled casino project led to Morgan Stanley posting a quarterly net loss of $91m.

298;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Shares in US airlines take off after recovery in demand;;Shares in US airlines rose sharply after three of the largest carriers reported estimate-beating results that showed a continued recovery in demand for air travel and sparked optimism over the outlook for the industry.Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group on Wednesday outperformed analyst expectations while American Airlines, the laggard in the group over the past few quarters, returned to profitability for the first time in about two years.Delta shares rose 11 per cent to $12.97, US Airways shares climbed 7 per cent to $10.83 and shares in American’s parent company AMR Corp added 8 per cent to $7.03. For the year to date, the Bloomberg US airline index is up about 25 per cent.Glenn Engel, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, expects the US airline industry to report record quarterly profits for the three months to the end of September of about $2.4bn. That compares with a loss of $260m in the same period a year ago.During the global recession airlines were hit hard as holidaymakers stayed at home and businesses slashed corporate travel budgets. But since the middle of last year, passenger traffic has recovered.At the same time airlines were quick to cut capacity and slow to bring it back allowing them to raise their prices. With fuller planes and more business travellers taking to the skies, carriers have quickly returned to profitability.Bill Warlick, of ratings company Fitch, said that airline financials were in relatively strong shape. The better operating performance had allowed carriers to pay down debt while mergers had created fewer, stronger companies.As a result, he said, “there should be a more sustainable capacity growth path that will allow the US industry to counter inevitable demand and fuel price shocks more resiliently through the next cycle”.At Delta Air Lines, the world’s second-largest carrier by revenues, sales jumped 18 per cent to about $9bn when compared with the third quarter of 2009 while net income swung from a $161m loss in 2009 to a $363m profit.Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, said the revenue gains exceeded expectations thanks to strong international growth. The company expects solid revenue gains over Christmas and forecasts its “first profitable December quarter in a decade”. Meanwhile, US Airways said revenues climbed 14.9 per cent to $3.2bn in the third quarter generating a record net income of $240m. That compares with a loss of $80m in the same period last year.American said sales climbed 14 per cent to $5.8bn. The carrier reported net income of $143m after reporting a loss of $359m in the third quarter of 2009. Buoyed by the results American said it would expand its presence in Los Angeles.In spite of the positive news, analysts and airline trade organisations have cautioned that with economic growth modest at best and carriers set to increase capacity over the next several months, the outlook for airlines still remains fragile.
299;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Boeing upbeat on demand for civil aircraft;;Global demand for commercial aircraft is recovering faster than the industry expected, while airlines are starting to spend again on after-sales servicing in what will be “a prolonged recovery”, according to Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft maker.“Both passenger and freighter markets [are] rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated,” Jim McNerney, chief executive, said on Wednesday. He said the growth was fuelled by increasing air travel across the world, although he stressed that emerging markets continued to show the strongest recovery.His remarks came as Boeing reported third-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street’s expectations and raised its outlook for the year, citing strong demand for commercial aircraft.Over the 12 months, global airlines have recovered sharply, benefiting from a modest economic recovery, fuller aircraft and higher ticket prices.Delta Air Lines, US Airways and American Airlines, three of the US’s biggest airlines, all reported strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, helping to spark a surge in share prices for the sector.Mr McNerney credited commercial carriers for not overexpanding as demand for air travel began to recover last year, a strategy he said was paying off as global economic growth remained uncertain.“While the growth has begun to moderate . . . yields remain strong due to the disciplined capacity management by the airlines over the past few years,” he said.The demand is helping Boeing rebuild its commercial order book after a year in which its deliveries far outweighed orders. The manufacturer booked 263 net orders last year and delivered 481 aircraft, while so far this year, it has booked 422 net orders – a figure it projects will exceed its expected 460 deliveries by the end of the year.To meet what it expects is a longer-term trend of rising demand, the Chicago-based company last month announced its third recent increase in the production rate for its 737 single-aisle aircraft to 38 per month by 2013.Mr McNerney said there were also important signs of growth in demand from airlines for after-sales business, such as interior upgrades and conversions.However, the Boeing chief also cautioned that the company’s military unit could come under continued pressure as US defence spending entered an era of “significant fiscal restraint”.Boeing earned net income of $837m or $1.12 per share in the third quarter, compared with a net loss of $1.56bn or $2.23 per share in the same period last year. Analysts had been expecting about $1.05 per share.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer in New York
300;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-10-08T18:19:06Z;Oneworld lands deal to shift balance of power;;"British Airways and its colleagues in the Oneworld airline alliance really pushed the boat out at a get-together for senior executives in London last week. Literally.The barge used for Winston Churchill’s funeral was hired to take a party of about 20 up the Thames for a waterborne dinner, followed by a private tour of the Tower of London. Then it was back to bed at the five-star Langham Hotel in the city centre.“This was a bit of a special one because it’s been such a colossal year for the alliance,” said Oneworld.Indeed, the past few days alone have been eventful for the Oneworld airline alliance as three of its leading members – British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia – launched a joint transatlantic business that has taken more than a decade to pull off.And it is clear the deal will prompt many changes in the industry, both for airlines and their passengers.First, there is the financial impact on the three Oneworld carriers.When the chief executives of each airline launched the venture in London on Wednesday, they declined to specify its effect on costs and revenues.Willie Walsh, BA’s chief, said any savings would be “not in any way the same degree” as the €400m ($556m) in annual synergies the airline has forecast for its planned merger with Iberia, due before the end of this year.But analysts believe the new business offers substantial financial benefits.Andrew Lobbenberg of RBS has estimated a benefit to BA alone of up to £180m-£230m ($287m-$366m), once the joint venture is fully established.That assumes the airlines will increase revenues by flying fuller, and therefore more cost-efficient, aircraft (because they can now co-ordinate their schedules) and reduce costs by consolidating operations in areas such as sales and administration.This is obviously good news for the airlines. But not necessarily for passengers, say critics such as US congressman James Oberstar. He says every time alliance airlines form such joint businesses, competition declines and fares are more likely to rise.Ahead of the Oneworld move, he warned the US-European market would be “locked down” by the alliance and its two rivals, the Star group, led by United and Lufthansa and SkyTeam, headed by Delta and Air France-KLM.What does seem certain is the balance of power between the three groups is likely to shift as a result of the Oneworld joint venture.The three have only been around since the late 1990s but have grown to the point that, by Oneworld’s measure, they account for more than two-thirds of global airline capacity.Unlike many other industries, airline mergers are hobbled by a web of ownership restrictions operating unevenly around the world.European Union laws, for example, allow BA to merge with Iberia, but US foreign ownership limits prevent a similar tie-up between BA and American Airlines.Alliance membership can be the next best thing, if accompanied by so-called antitrust immunity approval from competition authorities.Star and SkyTeam alliances already have this immunity for flights between the US and Europe, long the world’s two most profitable aviation markets. Regulators effectively blocked Oneworld airlines’ attempts to get it for years, but allowed it earlier this year.This ended Star and SkyTeam’s transatlantic advantage over Oneworld.Elsewhere, it should help Oneworld as the three alliances jostle for new entrants from fast-growing countries in Asia and Latin America where again, ownership restrictions often prevent outright mergers.“We are in a period of land grab,” says Sudeep Ghai of Athena Aviation in London, a consultancy that concentrates on airline alliances. “The Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are a high priority for all alliances where they are all working on filling their white spots [areas where an alliance lacks members].”Russia is still a white spot for Star; Latin America and India for SkyTeam, and mainland China for Oneworld.The next big fight is likely to be in Latin America, where Chile’s Lan Airlines, a Oneworld member, is planning to merge with Brazil’s Tam, which is in Star. Analysts say the new group, Latam, will have to choose one alliance, which could have big implications.“Since Latam will be by far the biggest and dominant carrier for South America, that traffic area will be dominated completely by either Star or Oneworld. The other alliance will lose out completely,” says Athena’s Michael Kanacher, a former Star Alliance general manager in the Asia Pacific."
301;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-10-01T14:32:24Z;UAL and Continental complete merger;;United Airlines and Continental Airlines completed their $3.2bn all-stock merger on Friday, creating the world’s largest carrier measured by revenues.Shares in the combined company, United Continental Holdings, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday and rose about 1 per cent to $23.66, under the ticker UAL.Overall the new carrier will have revenues of about $35.4bn in 2011, according to analysts, and about 80,000 employees. It will operate about 5,800 flights every day, serving 371 airports around the world.The merger leapfrogs Continental and United into the top spot as the world’s biggest carrier, overtaking Delta Air Lines, which claimed the position in 2008 after merging with Northwest Airlines.Since that merger, a wave of consolidation has swept the global airline industry as managements have turned to scale and size to combat volatile oil prices and a deep recession.The two companies have skipped through the usually complex antitrust regulatory process since they announced their intention to merge in May, obtaining approval from the European Commission in July and the main US authorities in August.But executives expect the integration process to take up to a year and half as the two companies align schedules, work rules and procedures and apply for a single operating licence from the Federal Aviation Authority.Until then the operating subsidiaries, United and Continental, will continue to work separately and customers will continue to interact with their old airline brands and the old websites and kiosks.“We have been moving quickly but thoughtfully on our integration planning, and I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made. We have a lot of hard work ahead,” said Jeff Smisek, formerly chief executive of Continental, who will lead the new company.One of the most important outstanding issues for the new management team will be securing a new contract with its pilots. Analysts estimate it will cost the company about $400m to bring the contracts into line, and note that discussions over the outsourcing of flying to third parties may yet cause severe friction.As part of the merger terms, Glenn Tilton, chief executive of United, will become chairman of the combined board – a 16-member team that includes six independent directors from each of the original companies as well as two union representatives.United and Continental predicated their merger on the basis that they could extract synergies of between $1bn and $1.2bn, of which about $300m to $400m should come from costs savings.Analysts have been more sceptical. In a note to clients, Jamie Baker of JPMorgan said that in the Delta merger, the most recent example of a big tie-up, he could not find evidence for the $1.5bn in synergies claimed by management.“Our analysis shows that Delta operating margins, excluding fuel and associated hedging, have been roughly identical to the industry … since the merger,” he said, cautioning investors against applying “lofty multiples” to the UAL synergy targets.
302;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-09-28T00:12:39Z;Southwest acquires AirTran for $3.4bn;;Southwest Airlines has agreed to buy rival AirTran in a deal that values the Florida-based low-cost airline at $3.4bn.The move by Southwest is the first example of consolidation between two large US low-cost airlines and marks a departure from the Dallas-based airline’s usual strategy of organic growth.Southwest, the originator of the low-cost airline model that has spawned imitators around the world, put its aggressive organic growth strategy on hold during the worst of the economic downturn.The deal will give Southwest a foothold in Atlanta – AirTran’s hub and also the busiest airport in the US – and put pressure on Delta Air Lines, which is also based at the city’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport. Delta shares closed down 2.65 per cent to $11.39.The deal also boosts Southwest’s presence in Washington DC, New York, and Boston and will for the first time see it move into international markets. AirTran has services to the Caribbean and Mexico.“The acquisition of AirTran represents a unique opportunity to grow Southwest Airlines’ presence in key markets we don’t yet serve,” said Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive.“We think of ourselves as a growth company and we’re trying to make it happen.” He also signalled that Southwest was looking at further international expansion.Southwest’s cash and stock deal offer amounts to roughly $7.69 a share, a 69 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price, valuing AirTran’s equity at $1.4bn. Including AirTran’s debt and aircraft leases, the value of the transaction is $3.4bn.Last year Southwest failed in a bid to buy Frontier Airlines out of bankruptcy, hampered by employee opposition.Kevin Crissey at UBS warned the deal was “not good news for the industry” because it could see Southwest start to grow again. Analysts worry that additional capacity could undercut fares just as airlines return to profitability.Monday’s deal comes hard on the heels of regulatory approval of the merger between Continental Airlines and United Airlines, which would create the world’s largest carrier by revenues.Consolidation has gathered pace in the industry, as the economic downturn hit passenger traffic.In the year to June 30, Southwest had revenues of $11.2bn, while AirTran had revenues of $2.5bn. Together, the companies employ about 43,000 workers and have 685 aircraft.The combined company will be based in Dallas and operate under the Southwest brand.Shares of Southwest closed up 9 per cent to $13.35, while shares of AirTran closed up 61 per cent to $7.34.
303;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-09-27T20:01:26Z;Southwest / AirTran;Remarkably, an airline combination that makes sense for both sides;There’s more to having money in the bank than sleeping soundly. While most of the industry flirted with failure during the past decade, Southwest Airlines produced decent profits largely because it could afford to hedge fuel costs well in advance. From 2001 to the peak for oil prices in 2008, hedging benefits were equivalent to nine-tenths of operating profit. Now that the budget airline is running out of room to grow domestically, it can comfortably afford to buy smaller competitor AirTran.The attraction is Atlanta, the busiest airport in the country, AirTran’s main hub and the last big destination missing from Southwest’s network. Adding this piece should generate demand from existing Southwest customers who will have the option to fly to Atlanta, and provide an opportunity to steal share from Delta, responsible for three-quarters of the airport’s traffic. AirTran also flies Boeing 737s, the same aircraft favoured by Southwest, while its smaller 717s can be used to open up smaller cities as Southwest destinations.Perhaps remarkably for a deal stuck at a share price two-thirds higher than Friday’s close, the combination also makes sense for both sides. AirTran has recently struggled to expand its network, and shareholders get half of the $1.4bn consideration in Southwest stock, giving them the option to share in the merger’s success. The price, with the assumption of $2bn in net debt and capitalised aircraft leases, does work out to nine times prospective earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rents. But even achieving half the $400m in annual synergies targeted by 2013 brings that multiple down rapidly.Furthermore, Southwest can continue to expand cheap point-to-point flights and experiment with international flights using AirTran’s infrastructure in the Caribbean and Mexico.

304;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-09-15T01:31:05Z;International standards on workers’ rights;;From Mr Tom Porteous.Sir, Contrary to the authors’ assertion ( Letters, September 8), Human Rights Watch analysed European companies’ anti-union practices under international standards, not under European Union directives.In particular, the international standard requires non-interference by employers in workers’ exercise of freedom of association. Our report documented how European employers interfered with workers’ organising. This was legal under weak US labour laws but a violation of International Labour Organisation norms.Furthermore, Ronnie L. Goldberg and Randel K. Johnson mis-characterised a recent ILO decision involving Delta Air Lines and its “Shred It!” campaign against flight attendants trying to unionise. The ILO committee on freedom of association was very critical of this tactic and concluded that “the active participation by an employer in a way that interferes in any way with an employee exercising his or her free choice would be a violation of freedom of association and disrespect for workers’ fundamental right to organise”.Tom Porteous,United Kingdom Director,Human Rights Watch,London N1, UK
305;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-09-10T16:29:48Z;Airline caterer serves up halal-only menu;;"The airline meal is heading for an unexpected transformation, as the world’s largest independent aviation caterer looks at making most of its dishes halal, or compliant with Islamic dietary laws.“My aim is to make our large hub operations halal compliant,” said Guy Dubois, chief executive of Swiss-based Gategroup, whose Gate Gourmet division customers include Delta, Cathay Pacific and British Airways. Its first dedicated halal kitchen will open soon at London’s Heathrow airport.“If I produce everything according to halal standards, I will reduce complexity and increase cost effectiveness,” he said. “It isn’t driven by social or religious considerations.”Halal dishes cannot contain pork or alcohol and any meat in them must be from animals killed by a cut to the throat so they are drained of blood.Airline caterers have long made such meals in smaller parts of their kitchens, but Gategroup believes it will be the first company based in a country without a big Muslim population to switch to making its main kitchens halal.Demand for halal meals has grown in recent years thanks to the rapid expansion of airlines from Asia and the Middle East, such as Emirates of Dubai and Etihad of Abu Dhabi.“Our demands for halal products are pretty astounding,” said Tim Clark, president of Emirates.Emirates and Etihad use a smaller Austrian-based caterer, Do & Co, at Heathrow, while many other all-halal carriers use Gategroup’s rival, the industry market leader LSG Sky Chefs, a unit of Germany’s Lufthansa group. It has had a dedicated halal kitchen at Heathrow for 12 years but has no plans to turn its larger kitchens halal.That may be a relief to animal rights groups, some of whom complain that halal slaughtering is crueller than standard abbatoir methods because animals are not always stunned before slaughter.But for the $12bn airline catering industry, the more pressing concern is the added complexity and costs of halal meals, which must be made, stored and transported separately from non-halal or “haram” (forbidden) food.Care must be taken to ensure kitchen cleaning products contain no alcohol, for instance.The large industrial dishwashers that caterers use have to be drained and disinfected after washing equipment from a western airline before they can wash an all-halal airline’s utensils, a process that takes up to four hours.Storing halal food separately also takes up valuable space, which is “a major inefficiency”, said Peter van Niekerk, the head of Gategroup in the UK.The company’s new £2m ($3m) halal facility at Heathrow is much smaller than the main kitchen, but Mr van Niekerk sees obvious cost benefits in what he calls an “inversion”, where the larger area becomes halal and the smaller one non-halal.“We are at the moment competing for some more halal business and when we make that, the scale tips,” he said, adding that Gate would consult widely with existing customers such as BA and Cathay, “to just manage perceptions and manage such a transition”.BA told the Financial Times it had not yet discussed the move with Gate Gourmet and had no plans to change its menus.Gategroup’s Mr Dubois said: “Today, halal food is a special meal, but I can see a time where pork chops are the special meal and all the rest is common.”The rules governing halal food● “Halal” means permissible in Arabic, whereas “haram” means forbidden. Under Islamic dietary laws, consumption of pork and alcohol are forbidden, as are animals with talons, fangs, or tusks.● Halal meat is killed in accordance with Islamic laws. The animal’s throat is slit with a sharp knife and it is left to bleed out to improve the quality of the meat by making it safer.● There is disagreement among Islamic authorities on the details of the slaughtering – including whether an animal is killed by hand or using mechanical methods and whether it can be stunned first (some say it is acceptable if the animal does not die before its throat is slit).● The Tasmiya and Takbir, a ritual prayer meaning “by the name of God, the Greatest”, is always recited during a slaughter.● Halal and haram food must be stored and prepared separately. Carcase meat and meat in unsealed packaging cannot be transported on the same vehicle as pork products.● No alcohol-based chemicals can be used to clean areas where meat is prepared.● Muslim Jurists are debating whether cloned animals can be labelled halal.Sources: UK Halal Corporation; Halal Islamic Centre Aachen, Germany; Gategroup"
306;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-08-17T17:14:05Z;Airlines start lining up for Africa take-off;;The football World Cup is over, the vuvuzelas have been consigned to the dustbin and fans have turned their attention from Africa to Brazil, host of the 2014 contest. But for one group at least, the continent remains in sharp focus: international airlines.According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines increased the amount of flying capacity to and from Africa by 8.6 per cent over the year to the end of June compared to 2009, more than any other region except for the Middle East.Over the next three years Iata forecasts that the number of passengers travelling to and from Africa will rise at a compound annual rate of 6.5 per cent, making it one of the fastest growing regions in the world.While US and European airlines have been cautiously adding capacity to Africa for years, the drive has picked up in intensity in recent months, leading industry executives to talk of a new “scramble for Africa” as airlines position themselves for the future.Executives point to high growth levels that suggest an increasing need, and ability to pay, for travel by air. Africa’s real gross domestic product was $1,600bn in 2008, having grown 4.9 per cent per year since 2000 – more than twice as fast as in the 1980s and 1990s.Much of that can be put down to Africa’s large mineral reserves – which have become a focus of fast-growing Asian economies. Traffic between Asia-Pacific and Africa is forecast to grow at 9 per cent per year over the next decade according to some estimates.US and European airlines are also boosting their connections to resource-rich regions. In June, Delta Air Lines started a service between Atlanta and Accra and aims to add services to Liberia, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Kenya in the near future.Lufthansa, Europe’s biggest airline group and a key provider to Africa, has ramped up its connections, adding two new services in west and central Africa and expanding several more since 2008. The group now has 222 flights a week to 33 destinations in Africa.A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute, entitled Lions On The Move, suggests that the economic foundations of Africa’s recent success are broader and therefore will have more “staying power”.Natural resources accounted directly for only a quarter of Africa’s GDP growth over the decade while “the rest came from other sectors, including wholesale and retail, trade and transportation, telecoms and manufacturing”.Indeed, Airbus, the European aircraft maker, predicts the recent aviation ramp-up will be sustained. Over the next 20 years the amount of filled capacity on flights between Africa and other parts of the world will grow at 5.6 per cent each year, albeit from a low base.“There is a lot of money in Africa right now,” says Glen Hauenstein, head of network planning at Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest airline by revenues. “GDP is small in absolute terms but it is rapidly expanding as political stability spreads.”In this newly competitive environment, US airlines are playing catch-up. While European carriers have offered direct services for decades, non-stop flights from North America to Africa have traditionally been limited, and slumped after the industry recession following the September 2001 terrorist attacks.Mr Hauenstein says Delta began experimenting with flights to Africa in 2006 with a connection between its hub in Atlanta, Georgia, and the tourist destination of Johannesburg in South Africa, via Dakar, Senegal.The success of that route has led Delta to try others, with an emphasis on west and sub-Saharan Africa where avoiding European connections can save US travellers time.Part of the problem was aircraft technology, says Greg Hart, vice-president of network strategy at Continental.Until the Boeing 777 was developed in the mid-1990s, many destinations in Africa were too far from the US for direct connections, and even then the 777 was too big to make some routes profitable. With the arrival of Boeing’s much delayed 787, due around the turn of the year, Mr Hart says that many airlines will for the first time have the right aircraft for the job. Continental plans to connect the energy capitals of Houston and Lagos with a service starting in November 2011. Still, considerable obstacles must be overcome.According to a 2009 World Bank report on Africa’s aviation infrastructure, while the continent is fairly well served by airports, lack of taxi-ways and terminal facilities and “inadequate” air traffic control systems are limiting capacity growth.Safety is another concern. Last year, Africa had the worst record of any region, according to Iata statistics. While most problems relate to aircraft operated by local airlines, several reports have blamed Africa’s weak regulatory oversight, which raises wider issues.In response, airlines have worked closely with government authorities and spent time and money to upgrade local infrastructure for their new services. Continental will help to upgrade the electrical facilities in Lagos airport to receive the Boeing 787.In spite of those hurdles the airlines remain confident that the efforts will pay off. “The 787 is going to be the pride of our fleet and we are going to put it into Africa. That speaks volumes of our level of interest,” says Continental’s Mr Hart.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

308;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-07-20T22:37:23Z;United Airlines’ profits surpass expectations;;United Airlines, the third-biggest US carrier by revenues, reported second-quarter profits that beat expectations as it took advantage of a sharp rebound in passenger and cargo traffic to pack its aircraft and charge passengers more for tickets.The results came as the International Air Transport Association released its June survey of airline finance chiefs showing a marked rise in confidence. Executives now expect demand to grow strongly in the next 12 months, helping them to secure better pricing and even to hire more workers.Since the end of 2009, airline carriers have seen a fitful return to profitability as the global economy has tentatively emerged from recession, giving leisure and corporate customers the need and the ability to fly again.Last month, Iata revised its previous 2010 industry financial forecast, predicting a $2.5bn profit rather than a loss of $2.8bn.United’s results for the three months to the end of June echoed many of those themes. The company generated net income of $273m, up from $28m in the same period in 2009, producing earnings per share of $1.29, compared with $0.19 last year.Excluding mark-to-market gains on certain hedging contracts and other one-off items, United reported earnings per share of $1.95, beating consensus estimates for earnings per share of $1.75.The results were driven by soaring revenue that jumped more than 28 per cent to $5.1bn. Passenger revenues from the Pacific region and Latin America were particularly strong, growing 52.4 per cent to $789m and 63.4 per cent to $118m respectively.Cargo revenue rose 57 thanks to increasingly strong demand worldwide, especially in Asia.On Monday, Delta Air Lines also swung to a second-quarter profit after more than two years of losses, although a cautious outlook statement and comments about increasing capacity disappointed investors, sending its shares down sharply.However, United said that its capacity would be flat this year and in midday trading its shares rose 5.6 per cent to $22.37. Over the year to date, United shares have risen more than 60 per cent, boosted by operating results that have outperformed its peers.“The United team continues to execute,” said Glenn Tilton, chief executive and chairman of UAL Corporation, United’s parent company. “This strong performance builds momentum that we take into our planned merger with Continental Airlines.”If approved by regulators the combination, announced in May, would create the world’s largest airline. The move would also cap a nearly five-year turnround since United emerged from a contentious bankruptcy in 2005.The two airlines said on Tuesday that they had reached an in-principle transition agreement with their pilots’ unions. Mr Tilton said the move was “an important step forward”, although the tough work of negotiating a new contract remains.In a letter to employees, Kathryn Mikells, United’s chief financial officer, noted that the company was generating 6 per cent more revenue from every passenger it flew per mile on one of its aircraft than it did two years ago.“With this quarter of strong earnings, we have a platform we can build on to get where we need to be, which is long-term sustained profitability,” Ms Mikells said.
309;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-07-20T14:21:35Z;Passenger rebound boosts United Airlines;;United Airlines, the third biggest US carrier by revenues, recorded second-quarter profits that beat expectations as it benefited from a sharp rebound in passenger and cargo traffic, allowing it to fill its planes and raise ticket prices.For the three months to the end of June, United generated net income of $273m, up from $28m in the same period in 2009, producing earnings per share of $1.29 compared with $0.19 last year.Excluding mark-to-market gains on certain hedging contracts, United reported earnings per share of $1.95, beating consensus estimates for earnings per share of $1.75.The results were driven by soaring revenue which jumped more than 28 per cent to $5.1bn.

Over the year-to-date, United shares have risen more than 60 per cent, boosted by operating results that have consistently outperformed its peers.”We are pleased to report a significant net profit improvement in the quarter along with excellent operational results across the company,” said Glenn Tilton, chief executive and chairman of UAL Corporation, United’s parent company.“The United team continues to execute across our critical operating, service and financial metrics and this strong performance builds momentum that we take into our planned merger with Continental Airlines later this year.”If approved by regulators the merger, announced in May, would create the world’s largest airline. The move would also cap a nearly five-year turn around since United emerged from a contentious bankruptcy in 2005.In a letter to employees, Kathryn Mikells, United’s chief financial officer, noted that the company was generating 6 per cent more revenue from every passenger it flew a mile on one of its aircraft than it did two years ago before the recession.“With this quarter of strong earnings, we have a platform we can build on to get where we need to be, which is long-term sustained profitability,” Ms Mikells said.Beneath the headline numbers however there were a few less positive trends. Operating expenses rose 20 per cent to $4.7bn, driven largely by a sharp rise in fuel costs but yields, a key measure of ticket prices, were up only 18.2 per cent.The results came as the International Air Transport Association released its June survey of airline finance chiefs showing a marked rise in confidence. Last month Iata re-wrote its 2010 industry financial forecast, predicting a $2.5bn profit rather than a loss of $2.8bn.
310;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-07-19T21:33:09Z;Wall St rebounds in early trade;;Wall Street opened higher early on Monday, bouncing back from Friday’s drop with renewed optimism ahead of a week of earnings reports.Less than an hour after the opening bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,071.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent to 10,161.77 and the Nasdaq was 0.9 per cent higher at 2,197.77.Ahead of the opening bell, futures were higher as investors took stock of last week’s hefty declines. They shrugged off more disappointing data on the US housing market, which showed that homebuilder confidence fell to its lowest level since April 2009 this month.John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities, said investors were viewing last week’s selling as an overreaction in light of the fact that all but three of the 23 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported since the start of earnings season have beaten analyst forecasts.The second quarter earnings season continued with Halliburton, the oil services company, pushing up 5.5 per cent to $29.01 after it beat expectations, reporting a rise in profit in its second quarter as onshore drilling gains made up for the halt to new wells in the Gulf of Mexico.In contrast, Delta Air Lines fell 9 per cent to $10.67 after the airline’s second quarter revenue came in below expectations. It reported a second-quarter profit compared with a loss for the same period the year before, as the airline was buoyed by a greater demand for travel and higher fares.Elsewhere, McMoRan Exploration Co, the copper miner, recorded a net loss of $21.7m for the second quarter, or 23 cents a share, compared with $100.6m, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. The company’s revenue rose 11 per cent and beat estimates. The stock was down 4.7 per cent at $10.27.Earnings from IBM and Texas Instruments after the closing bell will likely set the tone for the technology sector on Tuesday.Among bluechips, Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, rose 1.8 per cent to $62.99 after it announced an order from Emirates airline for 30 Boeing Co. 777-300ER aircraft, valued at $9.1bn.A couple of deals also boosted sentiment in early trading.Handset maker Motorola’s US-listed shares were up 2 per cent to $7.65 after it agreed to sell its wireless network assets to Nokia Siemens Networks for $1.2bn.Shares in ATC Technology Corporation surged 39.47 per cent to $24.31 after the company agreed to go private in a $512.6m deal.US-listed shares in BP fell 3.8 per cent to $35.69 after it was reported that oil may be seeping from the Macondo well in spite of the newly-installed containment cap holding back most of the leak.Shares in AIG rose 1 per cent to $35.28 after it agreed a $725m settlement with a group of Ohio pension funds to settle a six-year-old class action lawsuit over allegations of securities fraud. The insurance company also appointed Mark Tucker, former head of the UK’s Prudential, executive chairman and chief executive officer of AIA, its Asian arm.
311;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-07-19T21:00:48Z;Earnings provide lift against Europe debt fears;Positive results help stocks and Treasury yields inch higher;Monday 23:00 BST. Traders were cautiously optimistic at the end of the session, pushing risky assets higher as markets struggled for direction throughout a choppy day.The FTSE All-World equity index was down 0.1 per cent, but core bond yields, though still depressed, are slightly higher on the day, and the euro and oil are a bit stronger.Activity in Asian trading was curtailed by Tokyo’s closure for a public holiday, while European markets were beat up following reminders from the periphery that the road to fiscal stability is long and difficult.But the S&P 500 in New York was up 0.6 per cent, buoyed by continued support from company earnings. Halliburton, the oil-services giant, said profits were up 83 per cent, though it warned of future disruptions related to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.Bulls could only do so much, however, restrained by news from the critical housing sector that US homebuilder confidence has hit a 15-month low.”Housing has been and will remain an anchor around the neck of the US economy,” said Tom Porcelli, US market economist at RBC Capital Markets. “Housing tends to lead recoveries and its knock-on effects, like the spending associated with filling those houses, are momentum generators. Our sense is what’s left of this recovery will have to continue with no help from the housing sector.”The second-quarter earnings season now moves into its second week, during which 122 S&P 500 companies will report – tech giants IBM and Texas Instruments reported after the closing bell. Both reported growth in sales and revenue. IBM missed sales expectations, however, though the company said that it was not seeing any slowdown in business spending.But already the feeling is growing that the recent deterioration in macroeconomic data, notably the lack of help from housing, means the forecasts from chief executives of current trading carries ever greater heft than the backward-looking top and bottom lines.And if that hadn’t made investors sufficiently cautious, government budget stress has made an unwelcome return.Hungary’s failure to agree a fiscal strategy with the International Monetary Fund and European Union has revived worries about eurozone exposure to struggling eastern European states, while a Moody’s downgrade of Ireland also reminded investors of the tough battle still being fought even by those seen as more willing to bite the austerity bullet.Friday’s coming revelation of the eurozone bank stress test results can only heighten the anxiety.It should be noted, though, that there are some more wholesome nuggets on which bulls can chew. Philips, the Dutch electronics bellwether, has exceeded earnings expectations and, crucially, raised its margin forecasts. Delta Air Lines missed expectations but still reported growing earnings and revenue on a pick-up in flier demand.The $1.7bn private equity purchase of Healthscope, the Australian hospital chain, and the Nokia Siemens mobile venture’s proposed deal to buy Motorola’s mobile infrastructure assets, are the latest in a line of deals that illustrate the improved health of capital markets and show that value can be discerned by some operators.Overall, however, relatively low volumes, with traders still a bit too anxious – the Vix index of US market volatility was still elevated, at 26 – to put on big positions, have left markets searching for direction. Correlation between risky assets and stock sectors has not been strong. That’s likely to be a theme for the summer.● Forex. The euro retreated from its recent highs following the Ireland downgrade and news out of Budapest. The wave of buying pushing up the single currency of late supported it. The euro rose 0.1 per cent versus the dollar to $1.2946.That could be interpreted as showing that forex traders are more concerned about the relative economic health of the US against the eurozone – as illustrated by a narrowing of bond yield differentials. However, the safe-haven impulse prevailed, as the dollar index, measuring the buck against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, was up 0.1 per cent.But the fact that the euro was up 0.4 per cent against the yen to Y112.40 – a cross that would be expected in more cautious times to move lower – suggests traders were becoming somewhat inured to tales of eurozone woe. For the time being, at least.The Hungarian forint is down 2.6 per cent versus the euro since Friday’s close.● Debt. Credit traders appear more worried about the eurozone’s fiscal condition than their currency cousins. Spreads for sovereign debt considered more likely to default are widening. Credit default swaps – which track the cost of insuring debt against non-payment – are higher. Moody’s downgrade of Ireland has pushed CDS on Dublin’s debt up 17 basis points to 265 basis points, according to Markit. Hungarian CDS are up 55 basis points at 377 basis points.The more timid mood is helping keep Treasury yields near recent lows. The 10-year US note, nevertheless, made a more decisive late move, up 5 basis point at 2.97 per cent.● Europe. Bourses tracked Wall Street’s extra losses and opened lower. A pick-up in S&P 500 futures, the euro’s stoic display and some bid chatter then saw stocks move into positive territory, before relapsing again. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is down 0.6 per cent. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.2 per cent, with BP again proving a drag, but miners reversed the negative sentiment towards the sector seen in Asia.Dublin fell 1 per cent and Budapest lost 2.9 per cent on the Moody’s and IMF news respectively.● Commodities. In choppy trading oil was up 0.6 per cent at $76.49 as traders prepare to switch over to the new September contract.Metals were mostly higher following heavy falls last week but this is not sufficient to keep the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index in the black. The benchmark was down 0.4 per cent.Gold was down 0.7 per cent at $1,184 an ounce, having earlier hit a two-month low of $1,177 with traders citing the removal of risk premium – though that appeared contradictory to the broad trend elsewhere.● Asia. The FTSE-Asia Pacific index fell 0.9 per cent as the region absorbed the sharp fall in New York at the end of last week and fretted about the impact on exports of a struggling US consumer. Sydney, in particular, suffered from those lower growth fears, with miners in the cross-hairs. The S&P/ASX 200 closed down 1.5 per cent.However, falls were tempered among later-closing markets after Shanghai put in a strong afternoon performance as soothing comments about policy and economic prospects from premier Wen Jiabao encouraged “bargain” hunting. The CSI was up 2.1 per cent, helping Hong Kong to trim its losses to 0.8 per cent.
312;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Pick-up in air travel lifts Delta to profit;;Delta Air Lines, the world’s biggest carrier by revenues, swung to its first quarterly profit in more than two years on Monday, as the company benefited from rebounding demand for travel, filling its planes and raising ticket prices.Still, the results narrowly undershot analyst estimates for revenues and profits and the company’s shares slid more than 10 per cent in early trading before recovering to $10.93, down 7 per cent.Since the end of 2009 carriers have seen a fitful return to profitabilityas the global economy emerged from recession, giving leisure and corporate customers the money and the reason to fly again.Airlines have also been aided by relatively low oil prices, a large part of their costs, and an unusual industry wide restraint that has kept capacity down and helped companies to improve their pricing power.For the three months to the end of June Delta generated net income of $467m, up from a loss of $254m in the same period a year ago, on revenues of $8.2bn, up 17 per cent on the same period in 2009.Delta earned $0.55 per share in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $0.31 per share in 2009. Excluding special items, such as $46m relating to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta made $0.65 cents a share, narrowly missing analyst estimates.Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, hailed the results as the “best” in a decade and said they were “proof that our plan has positioned us well as the economy begins its recovery.”A key measure of ticket prices rose 16.7 per cent compared with a year ago while costs rose only 5.4 per cent , helping the company to generate an operating margin of 11.4 per cent, 10.6 percentage points better than a year ago and the highest in 10 years.Delta, which is the first of the leading US airlines to report second-quarter results, said on Monday that it expected an operating margin of 10 to 12 per cent in the third quarter and would increase domestic and international capacity.“We are seeing strong improvements in these early stages of the economic recovery and believe there’s room for more revenue growth,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s president. “We anticipate double-digit year-over-year unit revenue gains for the September quarter.”Still, analysts pointed out that with costs expected to be flat, management guidance implied that passenger revenues per seat flown a mile would be about 13 per cent in the third quarter, lower than many estimates.For the full year, analysts expect Delta to report $1.2bn in net income on sales of about $31.6bn.
313;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-07-05T14:39:51Z;Alitalia joins transatlantic accord;;Alitalia, Italy’s relaunched flag-carrier, on Monday entered the transatlantic joint venture between Air France-KLM and Delta as executives from the airlines reported improvements in traffic numbers.Rocco Sabelli, Alitalia’s chief executive, called the agreement “an important development in Alitalia’s departure plan” since it was rescued from bankruptcy in early 2009. He reiterated that the airline aimed to break even on an operating basis by the end of 2011, a year later than originally planned.“Alitalia is a great brand, an iconic brand,” enthused Delta’s Richard Anderson at a Rome press conference. He said its inclusion, with Rome’s Fiumicino as an extra European hub, and its entry into the large Italian market, would give the group the “largest and most expansive transatlantic network alliance” with a market share of 26 per cent, generating an annual $10bn in revenues.Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive of Air France-KLM said the company, which bought a 25 per cent stake in the new Alitalia, would be ready to discuss an increase in capital with the airline’s Italian shareholders if that was necessary.Mr Sabelli said he had no intention of asking for extra funding and said Alitalia currently had €500m in cash and credit lines.Explaining an apparent writedown in Air France-KLM’s valuation of its stake in Alitalia, Mr Gourgeon said this was an accounting figure based on net book value but that he regarded the airline’s strategic value in line with the more than €300m that Air France-KLM paid in 2009.Mr Gourgeon said the three pillars of the transatlantic joint venture were the sharing of decisions, capacity and results. Growth was returning, he said.Mr Sabelli forecast positive results for Alitalia in the second half after a “good improvement” in the first half over 2009. But he warned that the “road is long, and uncertainties remain”.Mr Anderson forecast the European airline market to continue to go through a process of consolidation based on the three major players – Air France-KLM, British Airways and Iberia, and Lufthansa. He said traffic and demand in the US was up “very significantly” year-on-year. Unit revenues were up by more than 20 per cent last month compared with June 2009.

Initial jobless claims rose to 472,000 last week, higher than the average 455,000 forecast by economists. Looking forward to the upcoming earnings season, Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research said results will suffer from more difficult comparisons than in recent quarters.He added: “The market is increasingly susceptible to shocks from earnings results.” At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent to 1,027.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to 9,732.46 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.4 per cent to 2,101.36.Financials was the S&P 500’s worst performing sector as a group of large-cap banks had their earnings estimates cut at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.The broker cited “client inactivity” generally and lower investment banking revenues as significant risks to earnings.Morgan Stanley was down 0.5 per cent to $23.09 as its second-quarter earnings-per-share estimate was cut to 58 cents from 89 cents. JPMorgan’s earnings estimate was lowered to 70 cents from 77 cents, sending its shares down 1.3 per cent to $36.08.Goldman Sachs’ earnings estimate was cut to $1.76 per share from $3.57. Its shares retreated 0.1 per cent to $131.14. Citigroup rose 0.5 per cent to $3.78, shrugging off a reduction to its earnings-per-share estimate to 2 cents from 4 cents. Separately, the Treasury Department said it had cut its stake in the bank to 18 per cent after selling 1.1bn shares since May 26. Sales to date have produced $10.5bn of proceeds for the US taxpayer.US-listed shares in Toyota were 0.2 per cent higher at $68.33 even as the carmaker said it would recall about 270,000 Lexus cars after it discovered that a key component in their engines was susceptible to cracking, a problem the company said could cause the vehicles to stall. News of the defect in some of the Japanese company’s most expensive models was a further embarrassment after its high-profile recalls this year.Apollo Group, the owner of the biggest for-profit university by enrolment in the US, was one of the session’s best performers as it gained 2.1 per cent to $43.34. It forecast profit of $1.30 per share in its fiscal fourth quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.20.Delta Airlines, the world’s largest airline by market value, declined 0.3 per cent to $11.72 after it said it would sell its Mesaba regional airline unit to Pinnacle Airlines for $62m and its Compass unit to Trans States Holdings for $21m. Pinnacle was up 5.5 per cent to $5.74.

316;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-06-12T15:31:54Z;Pilot strike grounds Spirit Airlines;;A strike by pilots at Spirit Airlines grounded all flights by the ultra low-cost carrier on Saturday in the first walkout of its kind to hit the US airline industry in almost five years.Talks between Spirit and the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents the 500 or so Spirit pilots, failed to bridge the gap between the two sides after continuing late on Friday.The pilots want wage rises to bring their salaries to the industry standard but management is offering a more limited deal.The strike comes amid heightened tensions in the airline industry. As the economic outlook improves, workers keen to recoup lost ground after a decade of declining wages are increasingly butting against management determined to keep costs down.In total some 30 US airlines are in talks arranged by federal mediators. Meanwhile, in Europe, British Airways and Lufthansa have already experienced high-profile prolonged strike campaigns.A deadline for a deal imposed by federal mediators on Spirit Airlines ran out at midnight and was followed by the walkout in the absence of intervention by the US president, who has a final say under the legal provisions that govern airline labour relations.Captain Sean Creed, head of the Spirit ALPA warned on Friday that the union was prepared to strike for “as long as it takes”, effectively stopping all operations. He added that the action would be a warning to managers throughout the industry against trying to use federal rules to delay signing deals.Captain John Prater, president of the national ALPA, said the union had built up a $60m strike operations fund and was prepared to “go to the mat”. Alpa’s 53,000 members stood behind the Spirit pilots and had voted to provide them strike assistance should the walk-out be prolonged, he said.He echoed Capt Creed’s comments that the action was meant to send a clear message to the rest of the industry “not to play with fire”.“Those managements that work with us will do better than those that chose to fight us,” he said.The spokeswoman for Spirit said on Friday the airline remains committed to “reaching a fair and equitable deal that ensures the long-term stability and growth of the company”.The last US passenger airline to be hit with a strike was World Airways, a Georgia-based charter and cargo company, back in January 2006. In 2005, Northwest Airlines, now part of Delta Air Lines, endured a mechanics strike that lasted 416 days.Spirit mainly flies leisure travellers to Florida – whose tourism industry has now been affected by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico– and South America. It is known for its aggressive marketing and cost control. It has the second lowest labour costs in the industry, according to official data, and has been profitable throughout the recession.The company is owned by Indigo Partners and Oaktree Capital Management, two private equity groups.Earlier in the year, Spirit unveiled a fee for carry-on bags that do not fit under seats, triggering a wave of criticism from consumer groups, regulators and politicians in Washington.
317;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Airlines try to get merger off the ground;;When Jeff Smisek and Glenn Tilton, the chief executives of Continental Airlines and United Airlines, testified before the Senate antitrust subcommittee this week on the proposed merger of their two companies they painted a compelling vision.Their merger would create a global airline combining complementary networks, better able to protect jobs and important local routes.Sitting beside them, however, two consumer advocates took a dimmer view.The tie-up, they said, would lead to reduced service, higher prices on important routes and make the industry more, not less, vulnerable to strikes and shocks.The gap between the two viewpoints highlights the surprising fact that even after decades of consolidation there is little consensus about its benefits or even clarity about how it is supposed to work.Since 2000 alone, there have been three big mergers in the US, most recently between Delta Air Lines and Northwest, but the US carriers have managed to make more than $15bn of operating losses.In making their case, Continental and United argued that this time would be different. The pair expect the greater “scope and scale of their network” to win $900m of extra business a year.Put in plain English, they are gambling that expanded schedules at key airports and enhanced package deals will make their offering more appealing to high spending, globe-trotting corporate clients.The trouble is that “revenue is a zero sum game”, according to Don Carty, who ran American Airlines when it bought the bankrupt Trans World Airlines in 2001. “You can’t count on revenue synergies because implicitly you are taking revenues from someone and they will have a strategy to take them back.”With additional revenues looking challenging, the analyst community is banking on domestic capacity cuts to make the sums work. Kevin Crissey, with UBS, is typical when he writes that: “We’d be surprised if they weren’t approaching 10 per cent.”The companies’ reluctance to talk about capacity reductions is understandable, Mr Carty says. “It is really all about politics …If [they] start talking about capacity drawdowns, somebody is going to get upset.”Reduced flying, Mr Carty says, means fewer jobs for workers, disgruntled unions and pressure on state politicians to ask awkward questions at congressional hearings and pester the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the merger.For the regulators, it would raise concerns about higher prices. But recent academic research suggests that competition from low-cost rivals and the transparency of online booking sites keep prices in check even when airlines merge.Instead, trimming capacity relies on the unspoken idea that big-spending business customers are travellers of necessity. When seats are cut, the number of corporate passengers tends to stay the same, meaning that low-fare leisure travellers are displaced. Costs go down and average fares go up.But even a reduction in domestic capacity may not help as much as hoped.While traditional airlines such as Continental and United cut flights in the recession and have pledged to remain disciplined, low-cost carriers have maintained their positions and have every reason to add more capacity when demand returns.If they do, they will be able to undercut rivals and take market share at the expense of legacy airlines, says Michael E. Levine, a former senior airline executive who teaches at New York University School of Law.“At best, United and Continental are talking about $1.2bn from synergies, or 5 per cent of total revenues …not much of a margin for error.”
318;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Top US legacy airlines launch peak fares;;The five biggest US legacy airlines are charging passengers extra for flying on peak days as they seek new ways to take advantage of improving demand.American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways have all introduced surcharges ranging from $10 to $30 for one-way domestic flights on almost every day between June 10 and August 22.The charges represent a departure for the major carriers, which have experimented with a range of fees as they struggle to find a formula for profitability after years of losses due to high fuel prices and the recession.“Instead of hiking all fares across the board, they are picking specific departure dates when they know their planes are already full and people will pay a premium,” said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com, a price comparison website.In February, for example, Delta added a $50 one-way surcharge for travel to most of its city destinations to coincide with the heavy travel associated with the Super Bowl weekend.Surcharges for things like travelling on busy days are particularly attractive for airlines because, unlike specific fare increases, which must be implemented route by route, one rule change affects a swathe of fares.According to an analysis by FareCompare.com, American Airlines introduced the surcharges on a limited number of busy holidays in September 2009 after a series of traditional price rises failed to stick.The practice was quickly adopted by its peers and has expanded, with airlines adding more days and charging higher amounts for peak travel to the point where almost the whole summer season is covered.For the most part, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines, have refrained from using peak travel surcharges.The moves come as airlines work to capitalise on growing demand. In April passenger revenues rose for a fourth month, according to the Air Transport Association, a lobby group. The ATA expects passenger traffic to improve this summer compared with last year.Unlike bag fees and other ancillary charges, which are filed under a different category, the peak travel surcharges are rolled into the basic price and so are largely invisible.Mr Seaney said the fees were in some respects useful to passengers. In effect, airlines are for the first time telling customers “exactly which days to avoid the hassle of flying from or to packed airports”.
319;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-05-18T21:44:58Z;Low oil prices fail to cheer airline sector;;"US airlines were complaining only in April that the impact of rising oil prices could hinder their recovery.At Delta Air Lines’ first- quarter results presentations in April, Ed Bastian, the president, offered investors a stark warning about the price of fuel. Oil, he said, had overtaken the fragile economy as the company’s “ biggest concern”.Echoing those sentiments, the Air Transport Association, using forecasts from an independent energy consultancy, noted that this summer jet fuel prices were likely to be about 20 per cent higher than last year.Fast forward four weeks. The price of oil is down sharply, amid worries about the eurozone economy and surplus inventory. After reaching a high this year of $89.58 a barrel on May 3, benchmark Brent crude has since fallen $15.US crude has fallen even more rapidly; on Tuesday it closed below $70 a barrel for the first time since December .For an industry that vividly remembers 2008, when soaring fuel prices forced some of the largest airlines to the brink of bankruptcy, the drop off should be a welcome relief. A penny increase in jet fuel costs the industry $170m to $190m a year.“Should oil continue to track below recent levels, we would expect this to trigger positive earnings revisions,” William Greene, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to investors. “At a minimum, the pullback in oil should improve sentiment for airlines.”Tancred Lidderdate, a senior economist with the Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, says that if the recent drop in prices is sustained it could reduce jet fuel prices by about 20 cents per gallon or about 10 per cent. However, executives remain wary.Far from cheering the lower fuel prices, airlines and other fuel intensive industries worry that they are a further sign that volatility has returned. The CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index has jumped by a third in May after gliding to 2010 lows last month.Whipsaw price movements, says Tom Horton, chief financial officer at American Airlines “point out the unpredictability of the industry because as sure as everyone was saying that [fuel was a key threat] oil prices were dropping $10 a barrel.“All of us are cautious, because even as we are seeing the economy improve we are concerned that a corresponding rise in oil prices could act as a restraint on our financial performance.”George Cultraro, head of oil trading at Barclays Capital, adds: “Consumers [such as airlines, railways and ship owners] like stable markets more than they like markets that are down three dollars in a day.”To cope with the volatility most airlines hedge their fuel needs, buying financial products, such as contracts that give them the right to purchase oil at a fixed price in the future and other derivatives in an effort to hold their costs steady.Those techniques reduce a company’s exposure to high oil prices but can also limit the gains when prices drop. Morgan Stanley notes that JetBlue, the US budget airline, has about 10 per cent of its 2010 fuel needs hedged such that the lowest price it can pay is $74 regardless of market moves.American, Delta and Hawaiian Airlines have similar “floors” in place.At present only US Airways and Allegiant Air among US carriers are completely unhedged, meaning that they will secure the whole benefit of declining prices, although conversely they are vulnerable to a spike in prices.Moreover, experts note that even when airlines do hedge, extreme volatility like the recent drop in oil, tends to keep them out of the market because if miss-timed, certain positions can quickly deteriorate and lead to expensive margin calls.In late 2008, Southwest Airlines was one of a number of carriers that suffered because oil fell so sharply that their hedging strategies backfired, forcing them to post collateral with their counterparties and pay to settle some hedge positions.With those missteps in mind, many airlines have adopted more cautious strategies this time round, layering on hedges gradually and, when volatility picks up, waiting on the sidelines to get a better idea of the direction of the oil price.While oil’s decline has piqued the interest of the big oil consumers, few have taken the opportunity to hedge. “Hedgers have not been aggressively buying into this drop,” says Chris Thorpe, managing partner with oil options dealer Hudson Capital Energy, which serves manufacturers, refiners and other crude consumers."
320;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-05-10T22:13:47Z;Labour rule change opens airlines to unions;Number of votes needed is lowered;US labour officials have approved a key rule change that could make it easier for workers to form unions at airlines and potentially raise costs for carriers that are currently non-unionised.After an extensive review the National Mediation Board, the body that oversees airline labour negotiations, on Monday authorised changes that would in effect lower the number of votes required to form a new union.The decision could have profound effects at carriers such as Delta Air Lines and JetBlue, where unions have traditionally struggled to gain a foothold, leaving the carriers with relatively lower labour costs and more flexible contracts.The NMB notified carriers that it intended to change the rules last year giving airlines ample time to prepare a response. On Tuesday the Air Transport Association, an industry lobby group, said it would seek a judicial review.“We continue to believe the National Mediation Board does not have legal authority to implement this rule, one that undoubtedly will lead to more labour discord,” the ATA said in a statement.The ATA said that members including Delta Air Lines, Federal Express, JetBlue Airways and United Airlines would participate in the case.Under long-established rules, workers who wish to form unions have been required to gain a majority of the entire class or craft of workers at a given company in order to win the right to bargain collectively.The changes approved on Monday mean that “no-shows” will no longer be counted as votes against the union and workers will now be allowed to organise if they win a simple majority of the employees who turn up to vote.“This change to its election procedures will provide a more reliable indicator of employee sentiment in representation disputes and provide employees with clear choices in representation matters,” the NMB said in its decision.Edward Wytkind, President of the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO, said that the rule change would force affected companies to leave behind “unfair elections and voter suppression campaigns that flourished under the old rules”.Experts argue that the NMB has taken a more labour friendly approach since the election of Barack Obama, who tilted the make-up of the three-person board by appointing a former union organiser to the panel this year.Airline shares were largely unaffected by the news, rising strongly along with the broader market. Delta shares added about 5 per cent to $12.28 in midday trading while JetBlue shares rose almost 7 per cent to $5.69.For Delta the decision could trigger a long-delayed showdown with its unions. The Association of Flight Attendants has been waiting for the rule change before holding representation elections affecting almost 35,000 employees.The AFA represented Northwest Airlines flight attendants until Northwest merged with Delta in 2008.The rule will be published in the federal register on Tuesday and will go into effect 30 days later, in mid-June, barring any legal protests.
321;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-05-07T19:59:29Z;United and Continental fail to land Tokyo slots;;"US aviation authorities have tentatively awarded Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines and American Airlines four hotly contested daily slots at Tokyo’s Haneda airport, spurning efforts by United and Continental Airlines to gain greater access to Japan.In a preliminary order released on Friday, the Department of Transportation allocated one slot to Hawaiian for a Honolulu-based service; two slots to Delta for flights from Los Angeles and Detroit; and one slot to American for a New York-Haneda route.The awards leave Continental and United, which are currently pursuing a merger, without direct benefits from the recent moves to open up air travel routes between Japan and North America as part of the open skies deal agreed in December.Continental and United are currently allied with All Nippon Airways, which already has extensive operations at Haneda.That agreement was a watershed in Japan-US aviation relations, easing barriers to passenger and cargo services and giving companies such as American, which had previously been shut out of directly serving Tokyo, access to the Japanese market.Slots, or the right to take off and land, at Haneda are highly sought after because the airport is far closer to central Tokyo than the international hub at Narita, making it more appealing to business travellers in particular.Historically, authorities have largely only allowed domestic flights at Haneda since Narita opened in 1978, but under Japanese government plans developed alongside the open skies agreement, the airport will open to international traffic later this year.Still the award marks only a partial victory for American, Hawaiian and Delta. Delta had asked for permission to use all four available slots, an aggressive move designed to offset the impact of open skies on its dominant position in Asia.Analysts have argued that the end of Narita’s monopoly on international travel will dilute the leading position Delta achieved in Japan through its 2008 merger with NorthWest Airlines, long the beneficiary of special access rights to Japan.Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta, praised Ray LaHood, secretary of transportation, noting that the DOT decision would “increase competition and enhance customer benefits on flights between the United States and Haneda Airport.”American and Hawaiian originally applied for two slot pairs. Mark Dunkerly, president and chief executive of Hawaiian, said he was delighted with the award but would ask the DOT to “reconsider granting Hawaiian a second daily round trip.”Explaining its tentative decision, the DOT said it had tried to improve the geographic web of connections between the US and Japan, increase competition and spread out the slots fairly.The DOT awarded Hawaiian a slot pair because it was a new entrant and would enhance competition. Delta received two pairs because it offered the greatest increase in capacity between LA and Detroit and Tokyo.American was provisionally awarded the key New York-Tokyo slot because it is part of the Oneworld alliance, which is currently understrength in Asia compared with Star Alliance and Sky Team, two competing alliances.The three airlines will have to start their services within 90 days of October 31, 2010, and if the slots are not used for any 90-day period the rights revert to the DOT.The other carriers now have about ten days to launch objections.In late afternoon trading Continental shares rose about 1 per cent to $18.72, United shares added about 1 per cent to $18.07, and Delta shares were broadly flat at $11.75.Shares in AMR Corp, American’s parent company, fell about 1 per cent to $6.67 while shares in Hawaiian Holdings, the parent company of Hawaiian, slipped about 1 per cent to $6.88."
322;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-05-04T08:47:12Z;Airline merger;After Continental and United, there are few natural pairings left;The US government has an abusive relationship with its airlines. They are loved enough that foreign buyers must keep out, but not so much that there is a coherent industrial policy or even clear rules under which a dysfunctional and serial loss-making sector might be rationalised.At least the imminent combination of Continental with United Airlines to create the world’s largest carrier will probably be approved by a politicised Department of Justice, because the two airlines have relatively little overlapping infrastructure. A marriage, after the pair faltered at the altar two years ago, will combine complementary networks rather than strip-out costs. Continental is strong in South America and across the Atlantic, while United brings the west coast and routes into Asia. Both will hope to increase ticket sales.Removing duplication of central costs would still be material, however. Conservatively assume $300m in annual savings (about a third of that targeted by Delta and Northwest). While it is hard to estimate a tax rate for a company as infrequently profitable as Continental, taxed at 30 per cent and capitalised that would be worth $2bn, or 30 per cent of their combined market capitalisation. Gaining approval to combine from the DoJ and Federal Aviation Administration can take two years, however. Holding on to savings in a market as competitive as air travel is far from guaranteed.Yet such pressures also make consolidation essential. Delta-Northwest now has the most efficient cost structure of the legacy US carriers, and is starting to win market share. The problem is that after Continental and United, there are few natural pairings left while international mergers remain impossible. And even if there were, this is a regulated industry where just swapping airport landing slots can be problematic. Prospects for dropping routes and cutting unnecessary hub airports remain dim.

323;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;United and Continental announce merger;;UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and Continental Airlines announced on Monday a merger of the two US carriers, a move that in one sweep creates the world’s largest airline and threatens to reshape the domestic and global industry.Based on where each company’s shares ended last week, the combined entity would have a market value of about $6.8bn, or $8.3bn on a fully diluted basis.In terms of passenger traffic, the pair will overtake Delta, which merged with Northwest Airlines two years ago, as the global leader, and relegate American Airlines to a distant third place in the domestic US league table.The merged airline will have combined revenues of about $29bn based on 2009 numbers and unrestricted cash of about $7.4bn.It will serve more than 144m passengers a year, flying to 370 destinations in 59 countries.Bankers for the two carriers expect the deal to deliver between $1bn and $1.2bn in net annual synergies by 2013, including between $800m and $900m of incremental annual revenues and between $200m and $300m in net cost synergies.One-time restructuring costs will total about $1.2bn spread over three years.The deal adds to the momentum behind consolidation within the global airline industry.Executives are increasingly turning to scale as a way to respond to long-standing problems of over-capacity.“You can see a clear trend whether it is in Europe, in Asia or in the US. Having the scope and scale to develop a large presence in the key business market segments is absolutely crucial to succeeding in the industry,” said Jeff Smisek, Continental’s chief executive, who will lead the combined company.Analysts and executives expect more routes and better pricing options to make the combined company a forceful presence in the key business markets that provide much of the profits for airlines.That will add to the pressure on carriers like American Airlines and US Airways, which have been left without an obvious partner in the consolidation dance.US Airways was in talks with United about a potential merger until Continental intervened.American has said it is more focused on developing international alliances.After weeks of intense discussions, the boards of both companies met on Sunday and approved the deal, which will see Continental shares exchanged for 1.05 United shares in an at-the-market stock swap.United shareholders will end up with 55 per cent of the company’s stock and Continental’s shareholders will receive about 45 per cent, including certain convertible securities.Glenn Tilton, chairman and chief executive of UAL, will serve as non-executive chairman of the company until the end of 2012, when he will be succeeded by Mr Smisek.The deal requires regulatory approval but is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2010.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Howrey advised United and Lazard, while Morgan Stanley, Jones Day, Vinson & Elkins and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer acted for Continental.
324;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Marriage of inconvenience for jilted rivals;;"“I’m much prettier,” joked Jeff Smisek, the man who will become the chief executive of the enlarged United Airlines following its merger with Continental Airlines.Aesthetics aside, Continental’s chief executive was echoing yesterday what many analysts and observers have expressed about the airline industry’s latest dating round.The conventional wisdom has been that Continental, with its Newark hub in the New York area and international reach, was a better partner for United than rival US Airways.But for US Airways, which started talking to United about a tie-up last summer only to see its potential suitor agree another match within the past three weeks, the deal is a bitter blow.US Airways would be left as a distant fourth behind the new United, which becomes the largest airline globally, followed by Delta and American Airlines in an industry that increasingly relies upon scale.Continental and United came close to uniting two years ago. In 2008, the companies were close to announcing a merger when Continental walked away, concerned about the financial and operational risks involved. Yesterday’s announcement has its roots in the success of Delta’s 2008 deal with Northwest.In an industry pummelled by terrorist threats, soaring oil prices, low-cost rivals and an economic slump over the past decade, the legacy carriers now need expansive route maps to compete for lucractive travel contracts from corporate clients.Delta, in its first-quarter earnings call last month, suggested it had won an estimated $100m in new corporate business as a result of the carrier’s post-merger footprint.In theory, consolidation should benefit all the carriers by reducing capacity and improving pricing power. According to Kevin Crissey, an analyst with UBS, Continental and United are likely to cut their combined domestic capacity by 10 per cent or 2 per cent of total industry capacity.“[That] should provide a supportive pricing environment next year. This is good news for all of the major airlines and we believe shares should move importantly higher,” Mr Crissey said.But the tie-up between United and Continental will put pressure both on Delta as well as on those that risk being left behind as the industry consolidates.Over the past month, as speculation about a deal increased, shares in Delta and American have fallen by about 15 per cent.American, which already had a sizeable footprint, has sat out the rounds of merger talks both this year and in 2008. Never having been through bankruptcy, the carrier is handicapped by its high labour costs.American has instead pursued international alliances and anti-trust immunity with the likes of British Airways and JAL. These help boost revenues but do little in the near term to reduce costs. US Airways, meanwhile, must wait to see which, if any, of the industry leaders shows interest in bolstering its US network through a deal with the smallest of the legacy carriers.Glenn Tilton, chief executive of United and a leading proponent for industry consolidation, is said by some to eye adding US Airways to the combined entity in the future.But people close to the deal yesterday argued the domestically-focused carrier would add little to the enlarged United, adding the new company’s management see more opportunity to grow overseas.Others say that American and US Airways are a natural fit – in spite of
the difficulties that each carriers’ labour unions would present to a potential deal."
325;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-05-01T03:56:00Z;US airlines could yield $1bn merger benefits;;UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and Continental Airlines estimate that combining the two carriers could generate about $1.1bn in cost savings and revenues.A deal could be announced as soon as Monday as, after the negotiations hit trouble a week ago, the two parties this week moved closer to sealing their merger, agreeing that Continental shares would be exchanged for 1.05 United shares, according to people close to the talks.The companies’ boards have yet to approve the deal but were meeting on Friday to discuss the proposed transaction.People close to the discussions suggested that putting the two companies together in a stock swap could yield more than $1bn of synergies, of which about $200m would be cost savings, net of additional costs associated with renegotiating labour contracts.Such benefits are crucial to the rationale of airline transactions and would provide value to both parties’ shareholders in a deal that has been negotiated without a premium.United had a market value of $3.6bn on Friday, while Continental’s market capitalisation was $3.1bn.United and Continental have little overlap in their domestic or international routes – a factor that may ease approval from antitrust regulators but which limits the potential for cost cutting.Moreover, unlike the last time the pair held merger discussions in 2008, they are now members of the Star Alliance and have formed a transcontinental venture, which means certain revenue benefits may have already been realised.Joining the two carriers’ networks should enable the combined company to compete more effectively with Delta, the current industry leader, for the travel budgets of large companies.The apparent success of Delta’s 2008 merger with Northwest helped prompt the airlines to start talks again about consolidation, two years after Continental abandoned a proposed deal with United at the 11th hour.Delta this month suggested, when reporting its first-quarter earnings, that it had picked up $100m of market share in corporate travel in the past 12 months.Delta’s management also struck a more optimistic tone when discussing the recovery in corporate spending than rival Continental.Gary Chase, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a research note this month: “We believe consolidation will be a material positive for the entire industry.”
326;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-04-21T21:59:41Z;Fuel prices widen American Airlines’ loss;;American Airlines posted a wider than expected first-quarter loss on Wednesday, squeezed by higher fuel prices and “lingering weakness in the economy” that restrained passenger growth.The results raise the possibility that a rebounding economy may end up hurting carriers if it forces raw material costs up faster than it restores consumer confidence or travelling.In a letter to staff discussing the results, Gerard Arpey, chairman and chief executive of American’s parent company AMR, struck a sombre tone.“To say the year has gotten off to a challenging start is … an understatement,” he said pointing to earthquakes in Haiti and Chile and the “unprecedented disruption” of the company’s European operation due to volcanic ash.In the first quarter American’s net loss climbed to $505m, 35 per cent more than in the same period a year earlier. The company lost $1.52 per share, up from $1.35 in 2009. Excluding special items, it lost $1.36 – more then analysts expected.AMR shares slid 6.2 per cent to $8.03 in midday trading.On Tuesday Delta Air Lines, the world’s biggest airline by passenger numbers, also warned about the dangers of rising fuel prices but gave a more upbeat assessment of the outlook, noting that it expected to achieve a profit in the second quarter.Mr Arpey said the “disappointing result” showed American was “regrettably far from our goal of sustained profitability” and attributed the loss to rising fuel prices that added more than $200m to its costs.“While we don’t necessarily expect a repeat of 2008’s skyrocketing oil prices …the fact remains that fuel represents a big unknown that will impact our bottom line in the months to come.”His comments come as American wades through protracted negotiations with its main unions. The company says its labour costs remain uncompetitive, while workers insist on “restorative” contracts to make up for past wage cuts.In the first quarter, Mr Arpey noted that non-fuel costs rose by more than 5.5 per cent.Still, there were bright spots. Revenues rose 4.7 per cent to $5.1bn, yields – a key measure of prices – increased by 3.7 per cent, and American filled more seats even as it reduced capacity.During the first quarter American also secured Japan Airlines as part of the OneWorld alliance and received tentative approval for an immunised trans-Atlantic tie-up with British Airways and Iberia Airlines.Net debt meanwhile edged down from $11.5bn to $11.4bn, although total debt climbed from $14.4bn to $15.5bn, and the company ended the quarter with $5bn of cash.“While we made significant progress in improving revenue performance in the first quarter …we were simply unable to overcome the challenges of the global economic environment coupled with once-again escalating fuel prices,” Mr Arpey said.“[But] I am confident that our overall strategy …will position us for long-term success.”

The average analyst estimate was $4.14 per share.AIG, the troubled insurer that lost $2bn insuring collateralised debt obligations, including $6bn worth of Goldman’s, is considering pursuing Goldman to recoup some of those losses.The rest of the financials sector was higher as investors appeared to shrug off worries that the action against the bank would impact the wider sector.JPMorgan rose 1.1 per to $45.88 and Bank of America climbed 1.2 per cent to $18.61.Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $4.97 as the bank’s target price was raised at UBS to $5 from $3.75.IBM, the world’s largest technology services provider, lost 1.9 per cent to $129.69 in spite of the company raising its full-year earnings guidance and reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by an 18 per cent rise in consulting-
services signings.First-quarter profit was $1.97 per share from $1.70 per share a year earlier, compared with average analyst expectations of $1.93 per share.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, shed 0.1 per cent to $63.19 after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 9.5 per cent to 48.18 cents per share.Delta Air Lines dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.16 after the airline reported mixed first-quarter results with lower-than-expected revenues but a drop in losses from previous quarters.The largest carrier by passenger numbers lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, in the quarter to March, compared with a $794m, or $0.96, loss in the same period the previous year.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.85bn, helped by rising fares, more bag-checking and fuller planes, but fell short of analyst forecasts of $7bn.Coca-Cola lost 1.5 per cent to $54.47 as the soft drinks company reported quarterly results that missed average analyst estimates, hurt by a decline in North American sales volumes. Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37.

He said volatile fuel prices were now the “biggest concern”.His comments came as Delta, the world’s largest airline by passenger numbers, reported mixed first- quarter results, undershooting revenue estimates but reducing its losses over previous quarters.Delta is the first of the major US airlines to report first-quarter results and said on Tuesday it expected to return to “solid profitability” in the second quarter.Analysts said revenues had recovered strongly in the first quarter and expected 2010 to be a better year for airlines as the recession eases.In 2008 soaring fuel prices pushed a clutch of US airlines into bankruptcy as they were unable to raise their fares to cover the extra costs.Fuel is one of the industry’s biggest cost items. The price of US crude oil has risen by 5 per cent since the start of the year to $83.45 per barrel.In the first three months of the year, Delta spent $2.23 per gallon of fuel. But it expects to pay $2.37, a 4 per cent increase, in the second quarter even though it has hedged almost 50 per cent of its expected consumption.For the moment, however, oil prices remain “manageable” according to Jamie Baker, an analyst at JPMorgan. Mr Baker recently increased his 2010 earnings estimates for most US airlines on the assumption that revenue growth would offset oil it remained below $91 a barrel.In the three months to the end of March, Delta lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, compared with a $794m, or $0.96 per share, loss in the same period in the previous year, as the economy improved and corporate travellers returned.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.9bn, short of the forecasts of $7bn. February storms cost the company $65m in revenues, while cargo revenues fell 5 per cent.Delta merged with Northwest in 2008 and has generated about $1bn in annual synergies, including $200m in the latest quarter, the company said.The success of the integration is seen as the litmus test for consolidation in an industry plagued by overcapacity. Recently, United Airlines began separate, exploratory talks with both Continental Airlines and US Airways about a possible merger.“We are encouraged by the improvements we continue to see in the revenue environment. We expect the positive revenue trends to continue and to be solidly profitable in the June quarter,” said Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive.

331;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-04-16T15:28:32Z;Volcanic disruption;Economic impact of Iceland’s eruption may prove insignificant;"Pandemic flu, blizzards, volcanic eruptions: Mother Nature seems resolved to hurl grit (or fine ash) into the turbine blades of economic recovery. Disruption to international air traffic caused by a rather different Icelandic blow-up from the one 18 months ago is already the most serious since 9/11, and may outstrip it. A Sydney-based consultant, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, forecasts that if the disturbance extends even three more days, it could affect 1m passengers, and cost airlines $1bn in lost revenues. Yet as with other recent natural phenomena, the overall economic impact may ultimately prove insignificant.The airline standstill will cause severe inconvenience to countless families and businesses. But from an economic standpoint, it will lead to a temporary upsurge in hotel bookings, and localised leisure and retail spending as stranded passengers fill their time; rail and bus services are also benefiting. Telecoms and teleconferencing companies are profiting from business travellers working remotely. Unlike the heavy winter snows in Europe and the eastern US, closed airspace does not shut down factories, or prevent commuters reaching work. And despite initial concerns that the harsh winter would harm first-quarter growth, or even pitch some economies back into recession, January’s lost activity seems to have been made up for subsequently.A disturbance on this scale will, however, cause widespread pain to airlines – and not just European ones. United Airlines and Delta cancelled 100 lucrative transatlantic flights on Thursday alone; flights from Asia and Latin America were also affected. Many airlines do not buy insurance against flight cancellations due to high premiums – though at least they do not have to pay compensation to passengers in cases of force majeure. Yet worryingly, the last time Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 1821, it continued more than a year. The airline industry is barely profitable at the best of times. Months of sporadic disruption is the last thing it needs.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyMuch of the UK and Europe remained a no-fly zone on Friday after a vast cloud of volcanic ash from Iceland forced authorities to impose one of the most extensive bans on commercial flights since world war two.About 17,000 flights were due be cancelled on Friday and Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control agency, warned of ‘significant’ further disruption of air traffic on Saturday.Britain’s airspace remained largely closed to all but emergency flights until at least 0700 (0600 GMT) on Saturday, aviation officials said. All airports in northern France, including Roissy-Charles de Gaulle outside Paris, which is the busiest airport in continental Europe by passenger numbers, will also remain closed until 0600 GMT. on Saturday Officials at Germany’s Frankfurt airport, continental Europe’s second busiest, said flights were suspended from 0600 GMT on Friday."
332;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-04-07T23:20:17Z;United and US Airways resume merger talks;;US Airways and the parent of United Airlines have resumed talks about a merger between the two carriers, returning to a possible combination that the pair last discussed in earnest two years ago.Sources close to the situation suggested that the improving US economy had emboldened the airlines to think again about ways to consolidate the sector.Although the two sides are not thought to be close to finalising deal terms, negotiations could move quickly given the history of merger discussions between the companies.Glenn Tilton, chief executive of United, and Doug Parker, head of US Airways, have been the US industry’s most vocal proponents of consolidation to remove excess capacity from the beleaguered airline industry.Although the groups have intensified talks in recent weeks, the discussions – which were first reported by the New York Times – are in their early stages and a deal still may not materialise, sources added. Representatives for US Airways and United declined to comment.The rekindled talks come almost two years after United shelved talks with US Airways, conceding in May 2008 that the costs of integrating two complicated operations might have overwhelmed a carrier already reeling from record fuel prices.While United itself had been spurned by Continental Airlines a month earlier, executives from the Chicago-based carrier had remained in discussions with Continental over a marketing alliance.United and Continental eventually forged such an agreement, winning immunity US antitrust laws to create a transcontinental partnership with Germany’s Lufthansa.Delta Air Lines’ 2008 agreement to merge with Northwest Airlines was expected by industry executives and their advisers to trigger a wave of deals that consolidated the industry. Record fuel costs and a severe recession intervened, however.US Airways is the smallest of the five legacy US airlines groups by revenue.A merger with United would help the combined company shed unprofitable routes and excess costs. In 2008, the airlines had targeted about $1.5bn in synergies, a figure that would have exceeded the potential deal’s purchase price.United was also concerned with US Airways’ looming obligations to pay for new aircraft, and with elements of its labour contract that would have granted pilots a significant pay increase following the merger. The need to reach agreement with the pilots’ unions could again prove a stumbling block to a deal.
333;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-04-07T18:25:04Z;Strike fears cloud horizon at US airlines;;US airline executives surveying the chaos at European airports in recent months could be forgiven a dose of complacency. In contrast to the disputes that led to strikes at Lufthansa and British Airways, US labour relations have been relatively tranquil of late.After five years without any strikes at a big US carrier, the situation in the US looks set to change. In the last few weeks, the flight attendants’ union at American Airlines followed its counterpart representing ground workers in asking federal mediators to release them from supervised negotiations – the first step towards strike action.The moves reflect a tougher stance by labour more broadly within the industry. “It is a tinder box,” says John Prater, who heads the Air Line Pilots Association which represents 53,000 members at 38 US and Canadian airlines and is currently negotiating more than 15 separate labour contracts.“There is nothing wrong with a strike once in a while. It clears the air …It is truly the market-based system for showing what your labour is worth. And we are not shy about taking a strike action although we will do everything we can to find a working solution.”The improving economic outlook is dismantling an uneasy consensus between labour and management, according to analysts. In the past decade, the US airline sector has undergone a wholesale restructuring. Workers took large wage cuts to sustain an industry reeling from the effects of the 9/11 attacks and remained quiescent when fuel prices soared and the economy tanked.Now, with airlines on the road to profitability, they want payback, while management is seeking to keep costs under control amid concerns about the sustainability of any economic recovery. The last strike at a large US carrier was in 2005 when mechanics walked out at Northwest Airlines, which has since merged with Delta Air Lines.“Relations are probably about as intense as I can remember,” says Bill Swelbar, a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation. “Employee expectations are much greater than management’s ability to pay.”“These are the first contracts to be negotiated since the restructuring,” he said, noting that in the past workers have regained what they had previously conceded. “Labour thinks that past practice will prevail but management is in a position where it knows it absolutely can’t afford to write the cheque.”Nowhere is that dilemma more visible than at American Airlines where contract negotiations with the pilots, flight attendants and ground workers are well underway and the unions are pushing for “restorative contracts” to make up for the $1.8bn in wage and benefits cuts they took in 2003 to keep the company afloat.“This is a get back contract not a give back contract” says Captain Lloyd Hill, the outgoing head of the Allied Pilots Association, American Airlines’ pilots union, which is separate from Alpa, the union that represents most other US commercial airline pilots.The APA is pushing for a 53 per cent pay rise, which the company calculates would have increased its wage and benefits expenses by about $700m in 2009, a jump of more than 10 per cent. American’s management team, in contrast, is eager to secure further labour efficiencies to buttress what it sees as a fragile recovery. The team points out that unlike many of its rivals, American avoided bankruptcy earlier this decade, leaving the carrier with high staff costs compared to its peers. AMR, American’s parent, reported a net loss of $1.5bn last year.Fraught contract negotiations must also contend with structural changes in the industry, which threaten to take work away from staff at some legacy airlines. These include the rise of international alliances and the increasing use of regional airlines, which have lower cost bases, to operate domestic services on behalf of the big network carriers.Management at Continental Airlines recently offered pilots improved pay in return for a deal that would allow the company to outsource the flying of aircraft with between 50 and 76 seats – mirroring deals that many of its rivals already have in place.The union is considering the offer, though it rejected a similar deal five years ago. “To be a furloughed pilot under a contract that offers $500 an hour does not put bread on the table,” says Jay Pierce, head of the local union chapter.More broadly, battle lines are being drawn up around the next wave of outsourcing of jobs, focusing on aircraft with up to 90, and possibly 100 seats – a key growth segment. Mr Prater says Alpa will oppose any contracts that allow “more outsourcing of larger airplanes”.Further stirring the pot is the National Mediation Board, the body that oversees airline labour negotiations, which is considering rule changes that would effectively lower the number of votes required to form a new union and make it much easier for unions to organise.This could have profound effects at carriers such as Delta Air Lines, where unions have traditionally struggled to gain a foothold, leaving them with relatively lower labour costs and more flexible contracts.Set against that are the restrictions placed on airline unions seeking to use strike action by the Railway Labour Act, which governs airline labour relations. Unions must be granted a release by the NMB, something it is loath to do because it smacks of failure, explains Don Maliniak, formerly labour relations lawyer at Federal Express, who now works for the Atlanta practice of Littler Mendelson.The combination of complex bureaucratic hurdles and a beleaguered Democratic majority which is unlikely to look kindly on any disruptions to the economy, could push labour conflicts out into the medium term, according to Mr Maliniak and other experts. However, he warns that management will have to tread carefully. “The situation in Europe almost foreshadows what could happen in the US. If the economy turns and the legacy carriers return to profit the question is how do you spend those profits? If they go on executive bonuses [and not broad wage increases or investment] there will be hell to pay.”

Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport and Haneda.Delta’s plans are the most ambitious. The world’s largest airline by number of passengers has applied to operate non-stop services between Haneda and Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles and Honolulu.Establishing a position at Haneda is important for Delta because the end of Narita’s monopoly on international travel will dilute the leading position it achieved in Japan through its purchase of NorthWest Airlines, long the beneficiary of special access rights to Japan, in 2008.“Enabling Delta to enter Haneda is critical to advancing airline competition in Tokyo, particularly considering the strong presence that the Star and Oneworld alliance carriers already enjoy,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice-president for network and revenue management.

The world’s largest airline has applied to create nonstop services between Haneda and four US cities including Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles and Honolulu.Establishing a position at Haneda is particularly important for Delta because the end of Narita’s monopoly on international travel will dilute its leading position in Japan achieved through its 2008 purchase of NorthWest Airlines, long the beneficiary of special access rights to the country.“Enabling Delta to enter Haneda is critical to advancing airline competition in Tokyo, particularly considering the strong presence that the Star and oneworld alliance carriers already enjoy at this important and tightly controlled airport,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice president for network and revenue management.In recent months Japan has been a high profile battleground for US airlines hoping to tap into the fast growing markets for leisure and business air travel in Asia. Just last week, American trumped rival Delta in convincing Japan Airlines, the bankrupt carrier, to remain as its key Asian partner rather than defect to a rival alliance.JAL and American have applied to the DoT for permission to coordinate fares and schedules, and the Japanese government has insisted that it won’t sign the final open skies treaty without approval of the tie-up.The DoT will now review the various competing applications and decide on the allocation of slots.
337;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-02-16T00:28:53Z;United remains keen on consolidation;;"The head of United Airlines has hinted at the benefits of renewing merger talks with Continental Airlines, saying the market had judged in favour of rival Delta’s takeover of Northwest.“The market capitalisation of Delta is approximately twice the combined market capitalisation of United and Continental,” said Glenn Tilton, chairman and chief executive of Chicago-based United.“The investor seems to have spoken. The market seems to have suggested that scope and scale in a global business are important,” he told the Financial Times.However, Mr Tilton, a prominent advocate of airline consolidation, played down the prospect of an imminent renewal of merger talks between United and Continental, which ended in 2008 amid soaring fuel costs and fading cash reserves.Jeff Smisek, president of Continental, has since said that he was “very pleased” to remain independent but would review that position if Delta’s takeover of Northwest resulted in higher earnings and tougher competition.“I think my counterpart [at Continental] has spoken and I think he’s been pretty clear,” Mr Tilton said. “So I accept that as their position and we’re taking full advantage of our partner relationship.”Merger talks between United and Continental ended in April 2008. Continental then left the SkyTeam alliance headed by Delta and Air France, and joined United in the rival Star Alliance.Delta merged with Northwest later in 2008, creating a group with a market capitalisation of $9.5bn, compared with a combined market value of just under $5.5bn for United and Continental.Mr Tilton said he believed there would be another big airline merger within the next two years but declined to be more specific.Mr Tilton, who spent more than two decades with the Texaco oil group before joining United in 2002, has been an outspoken critic of the web of international legal barriers to global airline consolidation.He has stepped up his campaign in recent speeches, including one to the Aviation Club in London last week in which he said the airline industry had been marked by “our systemic failure to earn our cost of capital and achieve any level of consistent financial resilience”.Comparing consolidation in other industries, he said: “Italy’s Fiat owns Chrysler. India’s Tata Motors owns Jaguar. Lenovo, a Chinese company, owns IBM’s PC business. Each is the product of mergers; each is the beneficiary of cross-border capital flows, and each demonstrates a corporate commitment to expand the reach of its business.“Yet similar cross-border ownership is not permitted in the airline business. The bilateral system prevents cross-border consolidation, keeping the industry financially handicapped.”"
338;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US Airways, Delta airport swap deal stalls;;Delta Air Lines and US Airways could walk away from an innovative deal to swap airport landing slots after US aviation authorities tentatively approved the moves but demanded that the companies sell some slots to competitors.In a joint statement Delta and US Airways expressed their “disappointment” in the preliminary ruling and warned “that if this order is implemented as proposed the transaction will not go forward.”The original deal was intended to allow Delta, the world’s largest airline, to increase its presence in the lucrative New York travel market and give US Airways additional bulk in its Washington, DC airport where it is a more substantial player.But the Federal Aviation Administration said that “while the proposed transaction has a number of benefits, a grant of a waiver in its entirety would result in a substantial increase in market concentration that would harm consumers.”To “counterbalance the potential harm”, the FAA said it would only approve the deal if the two airlines sold 14 slot pairs at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and 20 slot pairs at New York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to competitors.Under the deal, announced in August of 2009, US airways was to give US Airways 42 slot pairs at DCA and in return receive 125 slot pairs at New York’s LaGuardia Airport.Slots are valuable commodities because they give an airline the right to land and take off at a given airport at a particular time. In congested areas such as New York and Washington, DC, slots are limited.Experts said that the approval was positive for both airlines allowing them to rejigg their portfolio of routes and concentrate in the regions where they were most likely to generate returns.But they warned that the concessions had alterted the relative attractiveness of the deal.Bill Swelbar, a research engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation, noted that US Airways will have to give up about one third of the slots at DCA it had been hoping to get hold of while Delta will have to give up only 16 per cent of the slots it was targeting.“Based on what the FAA is offering, the question is do the two airlines still consider this to be a dollar for dollar swap?” Mr Swelbar said.The two companies said that the FAA’s proposal “would negatively impact the consumer and economic benefits created by the proposed transaction” and said they would review the decision “to determine our next steps.”For Delta, the deal would have doubled its size at LaGuardia airport and allowed it to challenge Continental Airlines’ status as the biggest carrier in the New York area. Continental runs a key international and domestic hub at Newark airport.US Airways would have slimmed down in New York but grown in Washington and gained access to airports in Tokyo and Sao Paulo, Brazil from Delta’s slots in DCA. Last year it said that the deal would add $75m a year to its bottom line.Competitors and the general public now have 30 days to comment before a final decision. Delta said it would also use the comment period to express its views to the FAA.
339;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-02-09T17:31:51Z;Rebuff to Delta as JAL sticks with American;;American Airlines has fended off an attempt by Delta to draw away Japan Airlines, its biggest Asian partner, protecting a vital link to China and other markets in the region.JAL said on Tuesday that it would remain in American’s OneWorld alliance and apply for permission from antitrust authorities in Washington to deepen its ties with the US group.The carriers plan a venture to co-ordinate schedules and share revenues on trans-Pacific routes.Delta had been trying to draw JAL, which declared bankruptcy last month as part of a government-sponsored restructuring, into a similar arrangement in its SkyTeam alliance.Delta and American had both offered hundreds of millions of dollars in support to the Japanese carrier.The stakes were highest for American, which stood to lose a component of its Asian operation to its largest rival.American funnels many passengers headed for China and other parts of Asia on to connecting JAL flights at the Japanese carrier’s hub at Narita airport in Tokyo.Immunity from antitrust rules became possible in December when the US and Japan signed an “open skies” agreement.Japan’s other big carrier, All Nippon Airways, is pursuing antitrust immunity for a venture with United Airlines and Continental, its US partners.According to people close to the situation, the final decision to stick with American was made by Kazuo Inamori, the founder of the Kyocera technology group, who was brought in by the government last month to oversee a planned three-year restructuring at JAL.He became executive chairman on February 1.The choice ran counter to the wishes of Japan’s transport ministry and some JAL executives, who favoured switching to Delta for its larger network and big business in Japan.Atlanta-based Delta has hubs in Tokyo and Seoul.Analysts said that pairing with Delta would have allowed JAL to retrench further, for example by eliminating overlapping routes or selling off valuable airport berths in Japan.But it could also have reduced JAL to a supporting role in a relationship dominated by the US group.Before JAL filed for bankruptcy, Delta had offered to inject $500m of new equity and another $500m in asset-backed financing, and to pay for the cost of switching alliances.American countered with an offer to invest up to $1.4bn in partnership with TPG, the US private equity group.The offers were in effect voided by the bankruptcy, which wiped out JAL’s equity and put it into government hands.
340;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-02-07T23:02:17Z;Airports: Aviation policy starts to spread its wings;;When Japan Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection last month, many blamed the government’s passion for building airports.Japan has nearly 100 fully fledged civilian facilities – too many, critics say, for a mid-sized country with a shrinking rural population, world-beating inter-city rail and next to no private aviation.Operating near-empty flights to obscure destinations cost JAL billions of yen over the years, yet managers held off cutting routes for fear of angering officials in Tokyo.Now Japan’s Democratic Party government – elected last year and currently supporting JAL’s revival effort with Y900bn ($10bn) of taxpayers’ money – has promised big changes to aviation policies. The benefits could radiate well beyond JAL, with foreign visitors expected to be among the winners.The crux of the shift is a renewed focus on the greater Tokyo area, home to some 35m people, or more than a quarter of Japan’s population, and the country’s primary international gateway. The capital has for years seen its air links neglected, even as those of rural precincts flourished. By common consensus it has fallen behind other big Asian cities such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.Some of Tokyo’s flaws have long been obvious to travellers. Narita, its international airport, sits amid rice fields 60km north-east of the city. First-time visitors expecting to be whisked to their hotels by high-speed bullet train are inevitably let down: the distinctly un-bullet-like shuttle takes an hour to reach Tokyo station, just south of the central Imperial Palace, and a full 90 minutes to get to Shinjuku, the teeming business and entertainment district on the west side of town.Catching a domestic connection is no more convenient. A three-decade-old policy allocates virtually all international traffic to Narita and most local flights to Haneda, the older, larger airport nearer the city centre. Getting from one to the other means a 75-minute bus ride or a longer, multi-transfer trek on the trains.It is little wonder that many Japanese living outside Tokyo have given up using the capital as an international hub. Many now fly from regional airports to Seoul and catch onward flights from there – to the benefit of South Korean carriers and the loss of JAL and All Nippon Airways, Japan’s second-largest airline.Access is only part of Tokyo’s airport problem. Narita and Haneda are too small to meet demand, which is growing, as Asian countries become richer and send more tourists and business people to Japan. The number of visitors to the country rose 60 per cent to more than 8m between 2002 and 2008, in spite of the fact that many foreign carriers were shut out of Narita for lack of landing slots.According to a study published last year by the Nippon Foundation, a think-tank, the combined demand at Narita and Haneda could grow from 100m passengers a year today to 170m in 2030. International traffic is projected to account for 110m of the total, three times the present level.The situation is due to improve somewhat over the coming year. Beginning in March, Narita’s capacity will increase by 10 per cent, or 20,000 take-offs and landings a year, following extension work on one of its two runways.A faster train link is also close to completion. Its operator says it will shorten the journey to the eastern edge of the city centre to 36 minutes, though most passengers will have to transfer from there to reach their final destinations.Haneda is receiving a more extensive boost, with the addition of a fourth runway, set to open provisionally in October and to be in full operation by March 2011. Built by extending the seaside airport further into Tokyo bay, the runway will boost Haneda’s capacity by a third, from 303,000 flights a year to 407,000. Crucially, half the new slots are to be allotted to international flights.The expansion projects at both airports were approved by the previous, Liberal Democratic administration. But the new government is planning a more radical rethink of Tokyo’s airport set-up. Seiji Maehara, transportation minister, has promised to scrap Narita’s monopoly on international flights and to turn Haneda into Japan’s dominant aviation hub.Previous efforts to internationalise Haneda had run into fierce resistance from transportation bureaucrats, whose commitment to Narita is rooted in the long and sometimes bloody struggle to build it. In the 1970s, leftists and local farmers, angered by what they saw as the government’s heavy-handed appropriation of land for the project, fought pitched battles with police over its construction.However, lingering local resistance to the airport – a few taxiways still veer around farmhouses owned by the most stubborn holdouts – makes it impossible to expand very much.Haneda was already absorbing some of the overflow, with flights to South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and parts of mainland China permitted in recent years, although the transport ministry set rules designed to preserve Haneda’s domestic status.International flights are classed as special charters, can only operate during off-peak hours and have been restricted to destinations within 2,000km of Tokyo – equivalent to the most distant domestic airport.It is this sort of pretence that Mr Maehara has promised to end.Motoshige Itoh, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied Japan’s aviation policies, says the change could pave the way for even larger-scale expansion, including the addition of a fifth runway that he believes could boost capacity to 683,000 flights a year.“That would bring us close to meeting the expected growth in demand,” he says.Some obstacles remain. JAL executives worry that a shift to Haneda would further handicap the carrier against ANA, which began life as a domestic-only carrier and has better infrastructure at Haneda.American carriers, such as United and Delta, worry that splitting international traffic between two airports would jeopardise their regional connections and dilute the benefits of the recent “open skies” deregulation deal between Tokyo and Washington.Incumbent airlines fear creating room for low-cost regional carriers such as Malaysia-based Air Asia, which could drive down fares.Despite these hurdles, the day when stepping off a flight in Tokyo feels as smoothly efficient as riding a bullet train is looking a little closer.

The results were worse than expected and it warned that it would make another loss in the current quarter. Its shares slumped 11.8 per cent to $49.61.A last-minute sell-off in the financial sector also helped to send the market back into the red.After opening lower, the S&P 500 spent most of the session in positive territory but eventually closed 0.4 per cent down at 1,092.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,194.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,203.73.“Traders are trying to get their heads around a mixed bag of data,” said Mike Shea, managing partner at Direct Access Partners.He said the US Federal Reserve had also introduced uncertainty into the market after saying it was considering adopting a new benchmark interest rate to replace the one it has used for the past two decades.“Traders don’t like uncertainty and right now that’s what we’ve got,” he said.However, the Vix index, which tracks market volatility via option prices, dropped 5.1 per cent. The index surged last week after new banking regulations and China’s initial announcement of tighter monetary policy rattled Wall Street. Energy stocks also suffered on Tuesday as investors feared China’s moves to cool economic growth could stall economic recovery.But Peabody Energy mitigated the sector’s losses, helping to push the S&P 500 energy index into positive territory by midday. Peabody’s profit had slumped almost 70 per cent in the last quarter as a result of lower coal prices but the results were better than expected. The shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $46.13.Apple also helped to lift the market and boost confidence in the technology sector after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Record sales of iPhones and Mac computers contributed to a 50 per cent rise in profit. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $205.94.EMC, the world’s largest maker of data storage equipment, also beat quarterly estimates and gave a better outlook for this year than analysts had been expecting.Meanwhile, VMware, a software company majority-owned by EMC, also topped estimates. Shares in EMC rose 4 per cent to $17.61 while VMware jumped 12.6 per cent to $47.29.But Verizon Communications weighed on the sector after announcing plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs at its fixed-line business this year. The telecommunications company posted worse-than-expected quarterly results , pushing its shares 1.7 per cent lower to $30.17.Johnson & Johnson, the diversified healthcare company, also raised concerns about the state of the US consumer after issuing a disappointing forecast for this year. While the group reported better-than-expected quarterly results, it said lower taxes had helped to boost the bottom line. Its shares edged 0.7 per cent lower to $62.79.Airlines were in focus after Delta Air Lines’ bigger-than-expected quarterly loss but it also said it had seen higher demand from corporate customers.The carrier’s rivals, Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines, both beat quarterly estimates last week. Shares in Delta dropped 1.4 per cent to $13.15, dragging down Continental 3.6 per cent to $19.25. However, Southwest rose 2.6 per cent to $11.61.
342;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Delta sees brighter skies ahead;;Delta Air Lines, the largest carrier by passenger numbers, on Tuesday offered a more optimistic outlook for 2010 in spite of posting a greater-than-expected quarterly loss, saying it hoped an improving economy would spur demand.The positive tone echoed better-than-expected results from US airlines last week. Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines both said they saw better corporate travel trends and delivered improved quarterly profits.Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, said “2009 was one of the most difficult years [for the] airline industry and we are glad it is behind us. While we are disappointed to report a loss, we are encouraged that revenue and demand trends improved throughout the quarter.”The company said that, with high-spending corporate travellers beginning to return to the skies and domestic and transatlantic travel picking up, it expected to see revenues per available seat – a key industry measure – increase in each month of 2010.Delta also hopes to increase its $4bn ancillary revenues from baggage charges and its maintenance and repair organisation by about $500m in 2010 as a result of price rises and higher demand.“The revenue commentary is encouraging,” said Garry Chase at Barclays Capital. “The release points to a strong close to 2009 and continued improvement in pricing.” But Mr Chase noted that much of the improvement in 2010 would be due to flattering comparisons with the recession-hit 2009 numbers.The company made a net loss, excluding special items, of $225m, or 27 cents per share, in the fourth quarter to the end of December. This was slightly worse than analysts’ expectations of a loss of 24 cents per share, but a $285m improvement on the same period a year ago.Revenues fell 12 per cent to $7.8bn in the quarter compared with the same period in 2008 as a result of the tough economic environment and sharp cuts in capacity designed to improve pricing power.For the full year, Delta made a net loss of $1.2bn, down from a net loss of $8.9bn in 2008. Full-year revenues grew from $22.7bn to $28bn, boosted by the merger with Northwest Airlines, which was completed at the end of 2008 and catapulted Delta to the top of the industry, with a workforce of 75,000 people.Delta said merger synergies would be crucial to improving the company’s performance in 2010. The company has secured $700m of benefits so far, with a further $600m targeted for 2010 as its single reservation and yield management system is rolled out.Other priorities for 2010 include securing an alliance with Japan Airlines. Delta is trying to lure JAL away from its partnerships with American Airlines and the OneWorld alliance to its SkyTeam group.
343;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-22T22:59:35Z;New chief’s old group urged to fly to JAL’s aid;;Japan Airlines’ new chief executive will not start work at the bankrupt carrier for another week, but already he is pulling in new customers: workers at his former company, Kyocera, who have been encouraged to fly JAL.Makoto Kawamura, the Kyocera chairman, used a morning address to the electronics maker’s staff on Thursday to drum up business for his former boss, Kazuo Inamori, who has agreed to oversee JAL’s three-year restructuring process.JAL filed for court protection on Tuesday after piling up more than Y2,300bn ($25bn) of gross debt, making it one of Japan’s biggest corporate failures.Passenger defections to All Nippon Airways, a local rival with a younger fleet, have compounded damage from the economic downturn.Mr Kawamura’s request added a twist to a long-standing practice among Japanese companies where staff are asked to buy a company’s products during a downturn. Such campaigns are as much designed to foster company solidarity as to boost sales.After global car sales plunged in 2008, managers at Toyota solicited pledges from their peers to buy new cars.Last January, Toshiba’s president urged employees to buy plasma televisions and other Toshiba goods. Monetary targets were assigned based on seniority and pay.Kyocera has about 20,000 employees in Japan and 40,000 more worldwide.The company said Mr Kawamura’s request was intended as “moral support” and was not binding. Mr Inamori, aged 77, founded Kyocera in 1959 and remains one of Japan’s most revered entrepreneurs.He will need all the help he can get to turn round JAL. Under the three-year restructuring plan imposed by the government in return for Y900bn of financial aid, JAL is to eliminate 15,700 jobs – about a third of its workforce – sell non-core businesses and withdraw from 31 unprofitable routes.It will also ask bankers to forgive Y730bn of debt and plans to retire its entire fleet of 37 Boeing 747-400 wide-body jets, ageing and fuel-thirsty aircraft that have become too expensive to fly.The former state-owned carrier expects to lose Y265bn at the operating level in the year to March 30.One of Mr Inamori’s first decisions will be whether to retain JAL’s partnership with American Airlines and the OneWorld alliance or defect to Delta and its SkyTeam group, both of which are wooing the Japanese carrier.
344;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-20T22:18:05Z;AMR reports loss on weak demand;;AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, set a cautious tone for fourth quarter earnings in the sector as it reported a slightly wider than expected loss but hinted at a nascent revival in international business travel.“The fuel crisis of 2008 was replaced by the worst recession in decades, which hurt travel demand severely, and tight capital markets,” said Gerard Arpey, AMR chairman and chief executive.The economic outlook in 2010 was also “uncertain” he said. But he pointed to the company’s success in “bolstering liquidity” through substantial fund raising activities and its efforts to cut capacity over the year, as positive signs.AMR ended the year with about $4.9bn in cash and total debts of about $16.1bn compared to $15.1bn in 2008.Thomas Horton, chief financial officer of AMR, noted that lucrative long haul business travellers were beginning to return. In the last two months of 2009, revenues from that segment were higher than in 2008 after hitting bottom in May and June.In comments outlining AMR’s long term future, Mr Arpey said he expected to receive regulatory approval for a controversial tie-up with British Airways, Iberia, and other Oneworld Alliance members, in the “near future.”Critics argue that allowing BA or American to share revenue and coordinate schedules will hurt consumers because of the airlines dominant share position at London’s Heathrow Airport, the world’s most important international gateway.At the same time Mr Horton acknowledged the stakes involved should the company lose its partnership with Japan Airlines, the bankrupt carrier which is considering an alliance with rival Delta and its SkyTeam group.JAL’s defection could cost AMR as much as $100m in revenue a year and would have a significant strategic impact as well, limiting American’s access to the increasingly important Asian markets.AMR is the first of the six largest US airlines to report fourth-quarter results. Only Southwest Airlines, the low cost domestic carrier, is expected to make a profit as the impact of the global recession continues to take its toll.Still analysts expect 2010 to be a better year for airlines as the recession eases and passengers fly more, albeit tempered by steadily rising oil prices.AMR echoed that sentiment saying that it would increase total capacity by 1.3 per cent in 2010 after cutting it by 7.2 per cent in 2009. The bulk of the increases will come from international routes, with AMR adding 3.2 per cent to international capacity.“In absolute terms the revenue numbers were terrible but compared to where we were two quarters ago things are getting much better,” said Kevin Crissey with UBS. “In this market, less bad is good.”AMR shares, which have gained about 11 per cent over the last month, climbed almost 5 per cent to $8.48.Excluding exceptional charges and non-cash tax gains, AMR lost $1.25 per share in the three months to the end of December compared with consensus estimates for a loss of $1.22 per share average, and a $0.79 per share loss, excluding exceptional items, in the same period of 2008.Revenues fell 7.4 per cent to $5.1bn in the fourth quarter and dropped 16.2 per cent to $19.9bn over the full year. In 2009 as a whole AMR made a net loss of $1.5bn - better than a $2.1bn loss in 2008 thanks to a 34 per cent drop in fuel prices.Beneath the headline numbers the picture was mixed. The rate of revenue declines narrowed between the third and fourth quarters and AMR boosted its supplementary revenues from baggage charges and the like by 6.8 per cent.But the company noted “more aggressive pricing industry-wide” and said it expected fuel price to jump from $2.01 per gallon in 2009 to about $2.42 per gallon in 2010.
345;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-19T15:58:52Z;Airline succumbs to self-inflicted wounds;;"“I’d like to take a pistol and shoot every JAL executive of the last 20 years,” says Hideo Fujiwara, an otherwise gently spoken 72-year-old.The former pilot flew for Japan Airlines for 34 years but will see his monthly pension shrink by 40 per cent to Y140,000 ($1,546) as a result of its bankruptcy, announced on Tuesday.“It’s not about the money, it’s about dishonest management,” Mr Fujiwara says. “JAL was unprofitable but executives thought nothing of taking Y100m retirement bonuses.”JAL’s problems are indeed mostly self-inflicted. Like many Japanese groups, it expanded recklessly in the 1980s, buying resorts, golf courses and shopping malls that plunged in value when the country’s real estate bubble popped the following decade.Management has often been fractious: one chief executive quit in 2005 after a series of safety lapses scared away passengers; another was forced out in a boardroom rebellion the following year.Yet other elements of JAL’s story are familiar to airlines worldwide. A cluster of external shocks during the past decade – from September 11 through Sars, to soaring fuel prices and the global financial meltdown – have left it battered. Government handouts are the only reason it did not follow US carriers such as United and Delta into bankruptcy sooner.“JAL has always put off making hard decisions,” says Motoshige Itoh, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo.Osuke Itazaki, a veteran airline analyst in Tokyo, says the restructuring plan being imposed on JAL by the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, a state-backed corporate rehabilitation fund, should put JAL on a sound financial footing.Analysts say that the government, meanwhile, is to blame for more than just excessive coddling. It has deepened JAL’s profitability problems by forcing it to operate near-empty flights to rural airports, many of them built as pork-barrel public-works schemes.“The state’s responsibility [for JAL’s problems] is large,” says Seiji Maehara, transport minister, who has promised a freeze on new airport construction.The restructuring plan being imposed on JAL by the ETIC should put it on a sound financial footing, says Osuke Itazaki, a veteran airline analyst in Tokyo.JAL is to cut 15,700 jobs, or a third of its workforce, sell dozens of non-core businesses and demand that creditors write off Y730bn of its more than Y2,300bn of gross interest-bearing debt.Retirees have already accepted an average 30 per cent reduction in pension pay-outs, and current workers’ benefits will fall by half.“The question,” says Mr Itazaki, “is whether things like management culture, strategic direction and quality will improve. Simply fixing JAL’s finances won’t solve those problems.” Even if things go well, the airline is likely to be eclipsed by All Nippon Airways, its more agile domestic rival, in the next several years.The government has named Kazuo Inamori, the 77-year-old founder of the Kyocera technology group, to oversee the turnround effort as JAL’s next chief executive, replacing Haruka Nishimatsu, a career JAL insider who formally resigned on Tuesday.One of Mr Inamori’s first decisions will be whether to retain JAL’s partnership with American Airlines and the OneWorld alliance or defect to Delta and its SkyTeam group, both of which are wooing the Japanese carrier.“This is a huge decision that could determine the future of JAL,” says one official involved in the restructuring effort.The decision, expected in the next few weeks, will say a lot about the sort of airline JAL managers and the government expect to emerge from bankruptcy.Delta – whose approach is favoured by the transport ministry and many JAL executives – already has big hubs in Tokyo and nearby Seoul, unlike the more Atlantic-focused American.That could allow JAL to retrench even further, say analysts, for example by eliminating overlapping routes or selling off valuable airport berths in Japan. But it could also reduce JAL to a supporting role in a relationship dominated by the US group – a far cry from its days as Japan’s proud flagship carrier."
346;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-18T19:56:04Z;JAL woes set to reshape alliances;;It has been nearly five years since an airline of the size and stature of JAL went bankrupt.But the expected bankruptcy on Tuesday of the largest airline in the world’s second largest economy has little to do with the last round of prominent failures, many of which took place in the US in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.Rather, JAL has become an embarrassing casualty of the aviation recession sparked by the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which has so far claimed only much smaller carriers.“It is a very strong indication of how the recession has picked off a victim – the biggest victim so far,” says aviation consultant Doug McVitie of Arran Aerospace.The September 11 attacks also led to a severe recession in the aviation industry which, by September 2005, had resulted in four of the top US airlines entering bankruptcy protection – United Airlines, US Airways, Northwest Airlines and Delta.But some claim the latest industry downturn has been even worse.The International Air Transport Association, the industry’s leading trade body, has estimated that the world’s leading airlines lost $16.8bn in 2008 and expects the 2009 figure to be $11bn, taking combined losses to $27.8bn.That compares with the $24.3bn lost in 2001-2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and it prompted Giovanni Bisignani, IATA’s director general and chief executive, to declare last year that “this industry is in a massive crisis”.The association’s outlook for 2010 suggests losses are likely to continue, though at a much less dramatic pace. IATA originally forecast losses of $3.8bn this year but revised this in December to a $5.6bn global net loss.This does not necessarily mean that JAL is the first of many failures. As many analysts have pointed out, JAL has benefited from generous backing from the Japanese government, which has bailed out the struggling airline repeatedly over the past nine years.This has meant the carrier has not been forced to produce the same sort of cost cuts and efficiencies that others in tougher environments have had to undergo. As Mr McVitie puts it: “JAL has been in more of a time warp than other carriers that have had to face more competition.”Despite JAL’s problems, even as it barrelled towards bankruptcy, it has been ardently wooed by two of the largest US airlines: Atlanta-based Delta, and American Airlines, headquartered in Dallas, Fort Worth.Each have offered at least $1bn worth of financial support to the loss-making JAL, which is in the Oneworld airline alliance that also includes American Airlines, British Airways and Cathay Pacific. American wants to ensure JAL stays in Oneworld. Delta wants it to defect to its SkyTeam alliance, which includes Air France-KLM in Europe, and Korean Air and China Southern in Asia.The third of the big three groups is the Star Alliance, which has United and Continental in the US, Lufthansa in Europe and, in Asia, ANA of Japan and Air China.If JAL abandons Oneworld for SkyTeam it would leave Oneworld with just one large member in Asia, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific. This would mean both Star and SkyTeam were stronger in mainland China and Japan, two of the most critical markets in the region. It would also hurt American’s position on lucrative transpacific routes.“It is a major compromise of American Airlines’ operations, there is no question,” says Professor Brian Havel, director of the International Aviation Law Institute at DePaul University in Chicago. “There is a real risk that the Oneworld network could fall apart.”Professor Havel adds that one positive aspect of JAL’s financial woes is that it appeared to finally prompt the Japanese government to conclude a so-called “open skies” agreement with the US late last year. Such pacts are aimed at easing restrictions on flights between the countries signing them, but can potentially pave the way for much deeper alliances between each side’s major airlines.In Japan, Prof Havel said JAL’s rivals at ANA had been lobbying for such liberalisation for many years but nothing had happend until JAL headed for bankruptcy. “Now the Japanese government has reoriented its entire policy by signing Open Skies,” he said.Dr Kostas Iatrou, an airline alliance specialist at Athens-based AirConsulting Group, said JAL’s defection from Oneworld, should it happen, would certainly leave that alliance at a disadvantage compared with its rivals at SkyTeam and Star.“I can’t say it’s the biggest example of a defection, but it is certainly important,” he said.
347;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Crunch time for Japan Airlines;;Japan Airlines is expected to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday, as speculation intensifies over which of its two US suitors, Delta Air Lines or American Airlines, will be chosen to aid its rehabilitation.Seiji Maehara, Japanese transport minister, said on Friday that Tuesday would be “X day” for JAL – the day a state-controlled corporate turnround body announces a plan to rebuild what is still Asia’s largest carrier by revenues, in spite of massive debts.The first step in that process is a “pre-packaged” bankruptcy similar to that employed last year by General Motors, according to people familiar with the situation. JAL lost more than Y130bn ($1.4bn) in the six months to September and is more than Y1,400bn in debt.A bankruptcy filing would make JAL, the country’s flag carrier which was founded in 1951, one of Japan’s largest corporate failures. The current record for a non-financial company is held by the Mycal department store group, which folded in 2001 with Y1,550bn in liabilities.The government has pledged to keep JAL flying during its court-protected restructuring. The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, which was given the task of formulating a rescue plan in October, is expected to provide some Y300bn in new capital and to arrange a Y600bn credit line for the carrier.JAL was privatised in 1987 but fell into trouble when Japan’s stock and property bubble burst at the start of the 1990s. Its problems were exacerbated by the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the Iraq war, the Sars epidemic and the 2008 financial meltdown.JAL’s strong links to China and other Asian destinations have nevertheless made it an attractive ally for US carriers.The Yomiuri newspaper reported at the weekend that JAL executives had accepted a proposal from Delta to leave American Airlines’ Oneworld alliance and join Delta’s rival SkyTeam grouping. Representatives from all three airlines said talks were ongoing.Such a move would be a heavy blow to American, which relies on code-sharing and feeder traffic from JAL to bolster its otherwise sparse Asian network, as well as to Oneworld, which includes British Airways.Delta, the largest US carrier, already operates a large hub at Tokyo’s Narita airport and is believed to have the support of officials in the Japanese transport ministry. American, for its part, has argued that a Delta-JAL tie-up would be too dominant on US-Japan routes and could be blocked by US regulators.
348;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-12T15:57:53Z;JAL wins approval to cut pensions by 30%;;Japan Airlines on Tuesday finally won the two-thirds of support it needs from its retirees to sharply cut their pensions, while speculation that the struggling carrier would soon file for court-backed restructuring reached new heights, sending the shares down its daily limit to a record low.JAL plunged 44.8 per cent to Y37 amid worries that court-approved restructuring that is similar to Chapter 11 in the US could render the shares worthless. A local report said that the airline, which is widely held by individual investors, may be delisted from the stock exchange.The carrier said that 67 per cent of its existing retirees, or 5,991 out of 8,936 already retired employees, had now agreed to the requested 30 per cent cut in pension pay-outs. Under Japanese law, companies must win the support of two thirds of those affected by cuts.Last week, the airline won approval from 91 per cent of the 15,742 existing employees on the same pension scheme that was introduced in 1992, after the company was privatised. The scheme includes about a third of JAL’s workforce.The agreement should significantly help JAL, whose pension-related obligations account for more than a quarter of its Y1,400bn ($15bn) in interest-bearing debt. It is also seen as crucial for the lossmaking airline’s future as well as being a key demand of bankers who have been asked to forgive several hundred billion yen in loans.The state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation is getting closer to finalising a restructuring plan for JAL that involves prepackaged court-backed restructuring, including a Y300bn ($3.3bn) injection from the fund, a person familiar with the situation said.The three commercial banks that are the main lenders to JAL have broadly agreed to restructure JAL while keeping it flying, Seiji Maehara, transport minister told reporters on Tuesday. He was not specific about what that restructuring entailed. However, local reports said that the banks have accepted the court-backed plan.“The day of decision on whether to support a restructuring plan is drawing closer and closer, and I hope for the cooperation of all those interested in the big objective of restructuring JAL while keeping its planes in the air,” said Mr Maehara.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama told reporters earlier on Tuesday that “in general” shareholders did bear some responsibility.It would be an unprecedented move for the government to allow JAL to file for court-protected restructuring and would draw a clear distinction between the four-month old administration led by the Democratic party of Japan and the previous one, led by the Liberal Democratic Party. Under LDP rule, the government bailed out JAL three times with about Y270bn since 2001.Peter Tasker, from Arcus Research, said: “[If JAL does file for court-protected rehabilitation] the new government would be making a statement that the sacred cows of the LDP are no longer sacred.”American Airlines officially increased the amount it and partner, TPG, is prepared to invest in JAL, and said it would guarantee $300m of additional revenue over three years. The ETIC does not want capital from either American or Delta for now, a person close to the situation has said.Speaking to reporters at the prime minister’s official residence, Kazuo Inamori, the 77-year-old founder and chairman of Kyocera who has been mooted as a possible new chief executive for JAL, said he would meet an official from ETIC on Wednesday and ”listen” to their explanation.
349;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-10T19:20:09Z;Tokyo rejects external funding for JAL;;The state-backed fund in charge of making Japan Airlines’ restructuring plan does not want either Delta or American Airlines to inject capital into the struggling carrier for now, a person familiar with the situation said.The possible rejection comes amid widening expectations for the airline to file for court-led rehabilitation, similar to Chapter 11 in the US, within the next couple of weeks.It is thought that the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation might want to avoid any potential complications a capital alliance with one of the US-based airlines could bring to the restructuring process. The ETIC could not be reached for comment.The person familiar with the situation said, however, that the potential for a business tie-up with one of Delta or American remains.American and Delta are tussling to partner JAL and benefit from its Asian routes, particularly as a long-awaited “open skies” agreement between Japan and the US is likely to be completed this year.American already has a partnership with JAL through the OneWorld alliance, making the Japanese airline the backbone of American’s Asian business, which gives it more to lose than Delta.American increased last week the amount it was prepared to invest in JAL along with its financial partner, private equity firm TPG, a person close to the situation said.The plan that the ETIC is shaping for JAL involves the airline filing for prepackaged court rehabilitation, within which the ETIC would provide a cash injection of about Y300bn ($3.2bn) among other measures, a person familiar with the situation said last week.JAL is likely to file for court protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law around January 19, local media have reported. The government could approve a court-led process as soon as Tuesday, according to one report.Seiji Maehara, transport minister, told reporters late on Friday after meeting prime minister Yukio Hatoyama: “The government needs to provide back- up through giving cabinet consent in order for the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation to support JAL’s rehabilitation.”A JAL spokesperson declined to comment on the restructuring plan, adding that the airline would continue its flight operations regardless. The spokesperson also declined to comment on the ongoing talks with Delta and American.JAL has received several government cash injections over the years. It has interest-bearing debt of about Y1,400bn ($15.1bn).
350;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-07T17:22:50Z;American raises investment offer to JAL;;American Airlines on Thursday increased its offer to invest in Japan Airlines, intensifying the battle to save its partnership with the ailing carrier from the advances of rival Delta.American has offered an additional $300m of its own money, according to a person familiar with the situation. This brings the total investment American has promised with its financial partner TPG to $1.4bn. A spokesperson for American declined to comment.JAL is already part of the OneWorld alliance and American stands to lose the lynchpin of its Asian network should JAL opt to partner with Delta.Delta, along with its SkyTeam members, has offered a total of about $1bn to JAL , in the form of new equity, asset-backed financing and compensation for the cost of switching teams. However, Edward Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, said on Thursday in Tokyo he was prepared to raise additional third-party capital.JAL’s strong links to China and other Asian destinations have made it an attractive ally for US carriers, in spite of its financial problems. It will become even more valuable once a long-awaited “open skies” deal between Japan and the US is completed, likely to be next year.JAL’s shares continue to suffer wild swings as investors take bets on the fate of the carrier. The airline’s shares on Thursday sank 9.5 per cent to Y76 after a local report detailed a draft of the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation’s restructuring plan, which involved court-led rehabilitation, similar to Chapter 11 in the US.The ETIC is shaping a turnaround plan that it has shown to JAL’s main creditors that includes reviving JAL under prepackaged court rehabilitation, a person close to the situation said.The draft, which is still tentative and subject to change, involves cutting about Y700bn ($7.5bn) in debt through measures including loan, bond and derivative waivers, and a reduction in pension obligations, the person said.Pension-related obligations account for more than a quarter of JAL’s more than Y1,400bn in interest-bearing debt. JAL said earlier this week that more than two-thirds of its employees had agreed to proposed pension cuts.The draft also includes a capital injection of about Y300bn from the ETIC and Y400bn in debtor-in-possession financing, the person said.Both the ETIC and JAL declined to comment.The proposal being drafted by the ETIC is expected to be announced around January 20, and there are expectations for Seiji Maehara, transport minister, to soon announce the replacement for JAL’s incumbent president, Haruka Nishimatsu.
351;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-05T22:04:53Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;A rally among airlines and a surprise jump in factory orders pushed US stocks higher in choppy trading on Tuesday.Wall Street initially lingered in the red as the market remained cautious after surging commodity prices lifted stocks to 15-month highs in the previous session.Data showing factory orders had climbed 1.1 per cent in November briefly renewed the market’s optimism.But a sharp and unexpected fall in the number of pending home sales constrained Wall Street’s gains and continued to weigh on investor confidence throughout the session.The number of deals that were signed but not completed in November fell for the first time in 10 months as buyers pulled back before government tax incentives expire.After a final surge, the S&P 500 managed to close up 0.3 per cent at 1,136.52, once again at its highest level since October 2008. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,572.02 and the Nasdaq was flat at 2,308.71.“Home sales data is going to continue to grab the headlines,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.He said the market was focused on this week’s payrolls report, which analysts believe will show a modest rise in the unemployment rate to 10.1 per cent.Continental Airlines prompted a burst of optimism among US carriers after reporting that revenues from its main jet operations in December had declined at the slowest rate for 11 months.Shares in the Houston-based airline gained 13.7 per cent to $20.62. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, also jumped 8.3 per cent to $8.36 while Delta Air Lines was up 7.8 per cent to $12.10. Southwest Airlines led the S&P 500 industrials sector, adding 5.3 per cent to $11.77.Predatory manoeuvres in the consumer industry also boosted general confidence in the health of corporate America. Shares in Kraftclimbed 4.9 per cent to $28.77 after the food group sold its pizza business to Nestlé for $3.7bn and used the cash to sweeten its hostile bid for Cadbury.Meanwhile, Nestlé ruled itself out of the running for the British chocolate maker.Cadbury said it still considered the offer “derisory” and Berkshire Hathaway, Kraft’s largest shareholder, also issued a statement announcing it had voted “no” to the latest proposal.Hershey, the US chocolate maker that has also shown an interest in bidding for the company, climbed 2.6 per cent to $37.17.Elsewhere among consumer stocks, Domino’s Pizza announced that J. Patrick Doyle, head of its US division, would replace David Brandon as chief executive in March. Shares in the restaurant chain gained 0.9 per cent to $8.76.However, it was Radioshack, the electronics retailer, that led the consumer discretionary sector from the opening bell.Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, saying the chain would benefit “disproportionately” as smartphones begin to appeal to a broader audience. Its shares rose 7.9 per cent to $21.34, touching their highest intraday price for more than two years.Meanwhile, Brightpoint, the wholesaler of mobile phones, fell 11.3 per cent to $6.88 after its forecast for fourth-quarter revenues disappointed the market.Goldman also gave a boost to Tenet Healthcare, adding the hospital group to its “conviction buy” list.Although the bank is neutral on hospital equity and credit, analysts said the group is likely to be able to negotiate “steep” discounts on orthopedic and cardiac medical devices and told investors they should ex-pect upward earnings revisions as a result. Its shares rallied 10.1 per cent to $6.00.Analysts at Piper Jaffray raised their price target on Salix Pharmaceuticals from $29 to $58, helping boost the shares 6.1 per cent to $27.63.Wall Street has underestimated the potential revenues from the group’s Xifaxan gastrointestinal treatment, the research group said.Potash Corp of Saskatchewan rose 5.5 per cent to $118.39 after Credit Suisse upgraded the fertiliser company to “outperform”. Analysts said the company would benefit as farmers replenish depleted stocks.
352;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2010-01-04T18:15:47Z;Japan Airlines shares surge on lifeline;;Japan Airlines shares surged on Monday, recovering last week’s losses, after Tokyo agreed to double a state-sponsored credit line to the struggling carrier.JAL jumped 31.3 per cent to Y88, after earlier climbing as much as 38.8 per cent on the first day of trading after the new year break, clawing back last week’s 30.9 per cent drop.Volume remained high, with almost 12 times the daily average over the past year traded.The Development Bank of Japan, wholly-owned by the government, said it was still considering the request by the government to extend the credit line to JAL to Y200bn ($2.1bn) from Y100bn. The bank plans to make a decision quickly.The extension is aimed at helping assure creditors, suppliers, shareholders and customers of the company’s stability, while another state-sponsored entity finalises a restructuring plan by mid-January.JAL has Y45bn left of its original Y100bn credit line extended by the DBJ last year.Investors became extremely nervous last week amid rising speculation that JAL would end up filing for court-backed rehabilitation similar to Chapter 11 in the US. The airline’s main creditors are expected to oppose such a plan, which has already been proposed to them by the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, the state turnround body.“We can’t comment on [the potential credit line extension] right now except to express our appreciation for the support while our restructuring plans are being finalised,” JAL said.“As we continue to work closely with the ETIC, JAL is also working hard on its own, striving to reduce pension obligations as well as working on other measures to improve the situation.”JAL said on Monday that more than two-thirds of its employees had agreed to proposed pension cuts.Shares of All Nippon Airways climbed 5.2 per cent to Y265 on Monday on local media reports that Japan’s smaller, but more successful, airline might be considering whether to take over JAL’s international flights.ANA said that the carrier had not made such a suggestion, while JAL said that it was not giving up its international operations.JAL is withdrawing from 16 unprofitable foreign and domestic routes, on top of the dozens it has already cancelled.The airline is also weighing up a possible tie-up with either American Airlines through its financial partner TPG, the US private equity firm, or Delta Air Lines.
353;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-30T18:32:25Z;JAL in fresh plunge on collapse fears;;Shares in Japan Airlines plunged for a second day on Wednesday, losing nearly a quarter of their value as investor fears intensified that the airline could be headed towards bankruptcy protection.Following the plunge, Seiji Maehara, Japan’s transport minister, and several cabinet colleagues decided to consider extending additional funding to JAL.This funding would be until the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation finalises its restructuring plan for the airline in mid-January.Any additional funding support is likely to involve the Development Bank of Japan, one of JAL’s main lenders. JAL has Y45bn ($486m) remaining from a Y100bn credit line extended this year.The sharp share price fall was sparked by reports this week that ETIC’s preferred option was to restructure JAL in court under Japan’s corporate rehabilitation law, which is similar to Chapter 11 in the US.ETIC has discussed this option with JAL’s main creditors as an alternative to restructuring the airline through a privately negotiated agreement, a person close to the process has said.The main creditors are likely to be opposed to a court-backed procedure, given that they could suffer worse terms than in a settlement negotiated privately out of court.These heightening worries sent JAL shares down 23.9 per cent to Y67 on Wednesday, an all-time low, following an 8.3 per cent drop on Tuesday.Volume was again huge, with 398m shares changing hands, more than 21 times the daily average over the past year.This was in spite of a much lower volume on the overall market as the new year holidays approach.Mr Maehara told reporters “that nothing has been decided” on JAL’s restructuring plan.Pressure on the restructuring process increased last week when Hirohisa Fujii, Japan’s finance minister, said loan guarantees for the struggling airline had not been included in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year.Some creditors may prefer a different solution for the airline’s woes, such as using Japan’s so-called alternative dispute resolution process.This is a procedure that Aiful, the troubled Japanese consumer lender, has been using and includes rescheduling loan repayments.Should JAL apply for court-backed restructuring, it would throw into question the position of Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, both of which are keen to invest in JAL.
354;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-30T09:06:23Z;JAL at record low amid restructuring threat;;Shares in Japan Airlines tumbled to a record low on Wednesday amid growing speculation that the company will end up being restructured in a court under the country’s corporate rehabilitation law.JAL shares lost 32 per cent to Y60 at one point, before closing at Y67, down 24 per cent. They had lost 8.3 per cent to Y88 on Tuesday.The sharp decline was instigated by a local report on Tuesday that the preferred option of the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, which is working on a restructuring plan for the troubled airline, is to put JAL through the court-backed rehabilitation procedure, which is similar to Chapter 11 in the US.Seiji Maehara, transport minister, said cabinet ministers would meet at 0900 GMT on Wednesday to discuss the airline’s plight.The ETIC declined to comment.A person connected to the negotiations said the ETIC was considering asking JAL to apply for restructuring under the company rehabilitation law.The person added that it had proposed this option to the main creditors, although they had not necessarily agreed with such an option.The main creditors and shareholders are likely to be opposed to a court-backed procedure, given that they could suffer worse terms than in a settlement negotiated privately out-of-court.Some creditors are likely to prefer a solution such as so-called alternative dispute resolution, the person said.This is a procedure that Aiful, a Japanese consumer lender, has been using and includes rescheduling loan repayments.Pressure on the restructuring process increased last week when Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, said that loan guarantees for the struggling airline had not been included in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year.The ETIC is under time constraints, as it is expected to have a plan in place by the middle of next month, and Japan is already building up to its New Year holiday, which starts on Thursday.Should JAL apply for court-backed restructuring, it would throw into question the position of Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, both of which are keen to invest in JAL.In the middle of last month, Delta sweetened its offer of financial support to JAL when it said that it and its SkyTeam alliance partners were prepared to commit $1bn of aid, including $500m in new capital.Delta wants to benefit from JAL’s links to China and other Asian destinations.Meanwhile, American has brought in TPG as a financial investor, and the private equity firm could inject as much as $1bn into JAL, people close to the buy-out group have said.
355;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

But his Nigerian roots have underscored fears in western capitals that Nigeria, where religious violence periodically flares, could fall prey to al-Qaeda affiliates operating elsewhere in west Africa.“The issue of extremism is a global challenge,” Ojo Maduekwe, Nigeria’s foreign minister, told the Financial Times. “What we will not accept is an attempt to profile Nigerians, to suggest that Nigeria is a place where extremism is tolerated.”Mr Maduekwe said Nigeria’s ties to the US “remain cordial and strong” and that the country was offering “the fullest co-operation” to US investigators. As those investigations are ongoing, he declined to comment on claims that the suspect’s father recently raised his concerns about his son’s behaviour with US and Nigerian authorities.Like many children of Nigeria’s wealthy elite, Mr Abdulmutallab was educated abroad, first at the British School in Lome, capital of nearby Togo, before studying at University College London.Having become concerned by his son’s “disappearance and stoppage of communication while schooling”, his father, Umaru AbdulMutalla, a former minister who was until recently chairman of one of Nigeria’s leading banks, “reported the matter to the Nigerian security agencies about two months ago, and to some foreign security agencies about a month and a half ago, then sought their assistance to find and return him home”, the family said in a statement on Monday.The family added that their son’s disappearance had been “completely out of character and a very recent development” and that previously he “had never shown any attitude, conduct or association that would give concern”.“Along with the whole world, are thankful to Almighty God that there were no lives lost in the incident,” they added.While its northern Muslim establishment is highly resistant to the militant strands of Islam from which al-Qaeda draws its ideology, Nigeria has suffered bouts of inter-communal violence.Earlier this year hundreds died when security forces crushed a brief rebellion in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri by a group whose name, Boko Haram, means “Western education is forbidden”. The sect advocated the stricter, nationwide imposition of Sharia.On Tuesday at least 38 people were reportedly killed in clashes between security forces and members of an Islamic sect in the northern Nigerian state of Bauchi.In Funtua, the family’s hometown in northern Nigeria, however, residents told a Reuters reporter that they blamed the suspected bomber’s foreign education for his radicalisation.“Everyone knew the Mutallabs and the father is honest, generous, helpful and above all a prominent banker. I cannot see why his son should be involved in this act,” said Ibrahim Bello, 65, close to the Mutallab family home. “My only advice to the elite is to allow their children to mingle with the children of the masses so that he will have some of the traditional morals and values that [the elder] Mutallab himself enjoyed.”Nonetheless, western security agencies are concerned that extremist groups such as the al-Qaeda affiliates believed to be operating in Mali, Mauritania and Niger could extend their influence south of the Sahara into Nigeria. Nigerian authorities arrested a group of Islamists with suspected links to al-Qaeda in 2007.Nigeria has ordered stricter airport screening after Mr Abdulmutallab boarded a flight in Lagos, the commercial capital, before changing in Amsterdam for the Detroit-bound flight.Beset by corruption, poverty and unrest in its oil-producing region, Nigeria remains vulnerable to instability. “We would be the first to admit that we need to look more deeply to nip in the bud any kind of extremism,” Mr Maduekwe said.
357;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-28T22:36:09Z;Wall Street hits high for year;;US equity benchmarks rose modestly on Monday and closed at highs for the year, and offset lower airline and financial stocks.After the benchmark opened in positive territory and rose as much as 0.4 per cent to a new intra-day peak for 2009, the S&P closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,127.78.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,547.08, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,291.08, both closing highs for the year.After their opening rally, stocks trimmed some strength as investors turned wary of pushing the market too far in the final week of the year, a time of thin liquidity and low volumes.Among leading S&P sectors, telecoms and health care stood out, while energy faded some of its early gains. Financials lagged the broad market as a further rise in Treasury yields and a move by the Federal Reserve to offer term deposits for bank reserves weighed on sentiment.Monday’s rally leaves the market at its highest levels since October 2008, and the S&P is just shy of a 25 per cent gain for 2009, on course for its best year since 2003’s gain of 26 per cent. But, worries about next year loiter on the horizon, said analysts.“While one can sense more comfort about the near-term economic and earnings data, long-term issues are the primary factors generating investment community discomfort,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.“Yawning deficits, more substantive government involvement in business decisions, credit constraint and poor historical equity returns all are contributing to the feelings of unease that permeates the Street even as the near-death experience fears have backed off considerably.”Since plumbing depths in March, the S&P 500 has rebounded 66 per cent and entering 2010, the economic recovery and exit strategy of the Federal Reserve from its policy of zero interest rates and quantitative easing loom large as the big challenges facing investors.“The Fed is likely to be very careful to avoid tightening too much, and too soon, and risk undermining the recovery,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.On Monday, investors were initially cheered by data from a unit of MasterCard that showed that sales at US retailers rose 3.6 per cent for the period from the start of November to Christmas Eve compared with the previous year. However, 2009 included an extra shopping day over 2008 and, excluding that, sales were only up 1 per cent.Shares in Amazon closed up 0.6 per cent at $139.31, after it reported that it sold more e-books than paper versions for the first time on Christmas Day.Among blue chips, IBM rose 1.3 per cent to $132.31 after Barron’s, the financial paper, said the company had significant room for growth and merited trading at a higher multiple.Shares in 3M gained 1.1 per cent to $83.45, while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Golderased an early rise of 2 per cent during trading, closing a fraction lower at $81.80.Other bluechips under pressure included: Walt Disney, down 1.2 per cent at $31.91, while American Express lost 1.5 per cent to $41.05 and Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $16.10.One sector under pressure on Monday was airlines. The NYSE Arca airline index fell closed 1.8 per cent lower in the wake of an abortive attempt by a passenger to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit last Friday.Shares in Delta Airlines dropped 4.1 per cent to $11.29, while AMR Corp the parent of American Airlines, fell 4.8 per cent to $7.75 and United Airlines retreated 3.4 per cent at $12.64.By contrast, shares in L3 Communications, the maker of airport scanners, rose 1.4 per cent to $86.80.Meanwhile, shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac surged from penny stock levels. Fannie rose 21 per cent to $1.27 and Freddie was up 27 per cent at $1.60 after the US Treasury announced late last week that it will provide unlimited capital support beyond the already agreed $400bn to the mortgage giants over the next three years.

359;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-18T18:51:57Z;Jetstar and AirAsia in partnership talks;;Jetstar, owned by Qantas Airways, and Malaysia’s AirAsia confirmed on Friday they are in talks about a partnership to cut costs and consolidate their positions as the lowest-cost airlines in the Asia-Pacific region.Qantas, the still-profitable Australian flag carrier– which remains well positioned compared with its international rivals – said its wholly owned subsidiary and AirAsia had entered into preliminary discussions regarding a potential joint venture.As Qantas continues to move services from its main brand to Jetstar to counter the effects of the economic downturn, Jetstar has become the vehicle for the group’s international expansion.AirAsia, the region’s biggest low-cost carrier, and Jetstar have grown rapidly and are looking to expand routes across south-east Asia and Australia, beyond Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, China and Australia.Derek Sadubin, chief operation officer for the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation, said there was no talk of an equity arrangement between the two budget carriers or a strategic alliance on revenue-generating activities such as code sharing.However, such deeper ties could eventually happen if the two carriers established a working partnership when doing procurement deals. “As the worlds lowest-cost airline, AirAsia is attractive to rivals who want to emulate their cost leadership,” said Mr Sadubin.“It’s a feather in their cap if they can partner with a major foreign carrier like Jetstar on cost reduction. It will help them lower their costs even further and allow them to continue to offer extremely low fares in an intensely competitive market,” he said.Analysts said this potential deal probably did foreshadow a more formal tie-up, but that the regulatory approvals for business combination or revenue scheduling were so drawn-out that the carriers looked at what they could achieve quickly to benefit both parties.One analyst suggested that if Air Asia and Jetstar placed a big enough order for parts or for an engine, their combined power might encourage manufacturers not only to offer a good price but potentially develop more advanced and lower-cost aircraft.However, competition in the region is intensifying.Tiger Airways, which is modelled on Jetstar, recently began offering services between Sydney and Melbourne.Virgin Blue has forged an alliance with Delta to put pressure on Qantas’s transPacific yields.
360;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-18T12:13:58Z;Global airlines;;The permanent grounding of Scotland’s Flyglobespan, along with more histrionics at British Airways, has reignited speculation about the next airline likely to go kaput. The usual names are tossed around: Hungary’s Wizz Air, 4/1 at Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, and Finnair at 9/2. By the bookmaker’s reckoning, a narrow world view, admittedly, you have to go a long way down the field to find the first Asian carrier: Singapore Airlines, at 100/1. That is not far off silly season candidates Vatican Air at 500/1 (occasional shuttles from Rome to Lourdes) and Air Force One at 1,000/1.The global industry is in a funk, brooding about an average return on equity of minus 42 per cent in the past 12 months. But if there are pockets of exuberance, most of them are in the east. Among the largest listed airlines, the top seven share-price performers this year are all Asian. By revenues, the venerable flag carriers – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Delta – still dominate. But when it comes to net income, the five biggest non-Asian airlines by market capitalisation are forecast to lose a combined $2.6bn in the current fiscal year. Asian’s top five should earn $1bn.Even so, it is a familiar hard luck story of high fuel and low yields. At the premium end, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are pinning hopes on a lasting business rebound.In the middle, dependent on price-sensitive leisure travel, the likes of Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways are struggling – the latter not helped by its chairman, under pressure to resign after allegedly ducking excess baggage fees on 500kg of luggage, carrying mostly fruit, from Japan.And on Friday, AirAsia and Jetstar, Asia’s two largest budget carriers, said they were teaming up to shave costs. But the contrast between regions is still striking. When Ireland’s Ryanair, with a five-year revenue growth rate more than a half better than its peers, accelerates plans to reduce capital expenditure and return cash to shareholders, you know things are bleak. The enfant terrible is becoming what it has always derided: a grown-up company in a low-growth industry.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
361;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-15T17:36:14Z;JAL buoyed by vote on pension pay-out;;Japan Airlines looked set on Tuesday to clear a major hurdle in its efforts to restructure after retirees indicated that they would accept steep cuts to their pensions.Seventy-five per cent of respondents in an internal company survey said they would vote in favour of a management proposal to reduce benefits by 30 per cent.This was comfortably above the two-thirds majority required to make the change.JAL has held more than 100 “information sessions” around Japan for the 8,800 retirees enrolled in its pension scheme, and senior executives have spent weeks making personal pleas by telephone to holdouts.Pension-related obligations account for more than a quarter of JAL’s Y14,000bn ($156bn) in interest-bearing debt.Cutting the pension burden is seen as critical for the lossmaking airline’s future, and has been a key demand of bankers who have been asked to forgive several hundred billion yen in JAL loans.JAL said it would move quickly to gain formal approval for the cuts.It did not give a deadline but people close to the situation said the postal voting forms would be sent out in the next few days and the voting process would probably be completed by mid-January.About 7,600 JAL pensioners responded to the survey, or 86 per cent of the total.Under Japanese law, retirees and current employees must separately approve changes to a company’s pension scheme by a two-to-one margin or greater.JAL’s active workers are being asked to swallow an even bigger pension cut, of 50 per cent.But the carrier said nine out of 10 had indicated in an earlier survey that they would accept.JAL had initially hoped to cut retirees’ pension payouts by half as well, but heavy opposition forced it to soften its proposal.As a result, savings from the cuts may fall short of the Y88bn it had initially projected.JAL has turned to the Japanese government for emergency aid after it lost more than Y130bn in the six months to September.The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, a state-backed investment body, is working on a restructuring plan due early next year.In addition to shedding debt, it is expected to raise capital from the state and private investors.Two US carriers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, are vying to tie up with JAL to take advantage of its strong links to China and other growing Asian markets.That contest took on new urgency at the weekend after the US and Japan finally completed an “open skies” deal to liberalise air traffic.The agreement opens the way for allied carriers in the two countries to co-operate on pricing, schedules and strategy.
362;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-13T18:58:19Z;New urgency in US contest for JAL deal;;Competition between American Airlines and Delta Air Lines to secure a partnership with Japan Airlines, the troubled carrier, took on new urgency at the weekend after the US and Japan completed a deal to liberalise air traffic.The long-awaited “open skies” agreement will loosen the restrictive set of regulations that have long governed the way US and Japanese airlines do business in each other’s countries and liberalise state control over fares on flights between them.Just as critically, the agreement paves the way for allied carriers to co-operate more closely on schedules, pricing and strategy, allowing them in effect to operate as a single company in the US-Japan market.United Airlines and All Nippon Airways, its Japanese partner in the Star Alliance, said they would move quickly to secure immunity from US anti-trust rules that normally prohibit such co-operation.Antitrust immunity is available to airlines only from countries with which the US has an open skies agreement.United’s move will increase pressure on American and Delta to sort out their contested relationships with JAL, the former Japanese national carrier and the country’s largest airline by sales.American and JAL are members of the OneWorld alliance, making them natural candidates for a partnership like the one proposed by United and ANA.But Delta, the world’s largest airline, is trying to woo JAL away from OneWorld and into its own SkyTeam group.Experts say Delta, which along with United will lose protections that it had enjoyed under the 57-year-old US-Japan air treaty, is concerned about tougher competition from American if the latter establishes an immunised transpacific venture with JAL.More international slots are to be made available at Narita and Haneda, Tokyo’s crowded airports, after expansion work is completed next year.JAL’s strong links to China and other Asian destinations have made it an attractive ally in spite of financial problems that have forced it to seek government aid.JAL lost more than Y130bn ($1.46bn) in the six months to September and is straining under more than Y1,400bn of interest-bearing debt.In November, Delta and its SkyTeam partners offered to come to the rescue with an injection of $500m of new equity into JAL and an extension of another $500m in asset-backed financing and compensation for the cost of switching teams.American responded by promising to invest up to $1.1bn alongside TPG, the US private equity group.Both US airlines have dispatched high-ranking lobbyists to plead their case.In addition to courting JAL management, they must win over the Japanese government, which has taken over efforts to revive the airline.Enterprise Turnround Initiative Corporation, a state-backed investment body, is working on a restructuring plan due early in 2010.Haruka Nishimatsu, JAL president, has said he hopes to choose between the two US airlines before the plan is published.Mr Nishimatsu said JAL would apply for antitrust immunity with a strategic US partner “as soon as possible”.The airline needed to “seize this opportunity to strengthen our network and bring added benefits to our valued customers”, he said.
363;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-12-07T18:50:59Z;Tokyo poised to back JAL with Y700bn;;Shares in Japan Airlines rose 7 per cent on Monday after it emerged that Tokyo was looking at expanding public guarantees for investors in the carrier.A provision for up to Y700bn ($7.7bn) in guarantees on future loans or equity injections was likely to be included in a forthcoming supplementary budget, according to people familiar with the situation.This would not by itself ensure new funding for JAL, but the provision suggests Japan is willing to put a significant amount of taxpayer money at risk to rescue the formerly state-owned airline.JAL lost more than Y130bn in the six months to September and is struggling with one of the industry’s biggest debts.The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, a state-backed body, is working on a restructuring plan that is expected to be announced early next year.A previous aid plan collapsed, in part because of objections from JAL’s bankers, who had been asked to forgive Y250bn of the airline’s debt.Government guarantees would allow JAL to refinance its debts on better terms and could make it easier to attract outside capital.Details of the supplementary budget were not announced on Monday.The ruling Democratic party was arguing with smaller coalition partners over its size, which Japanese media have speculated could exceed Y7,000bn. That would mean funds set aside to bail out JAL would account for a 10th of the overall budget.JAL secured state guarantees for Y100bn in emergency loans in June, and the government-run Development Bank of Japan extended a further Y100bn in short-term funding last month as the carrier burned through cash.It was unclear whether expanded guarantees would apply to investments in JAL by foreign carriers. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines of the US have made competing offers of support tied to proposed trans-Pacific joint ventures with the carrier.JAL’s links to China and other Asian destinations have made it an attractive ally for the US carriers.American, which co-operates with JAL in the OneWorld airline alliance, in early December promised $1.1bn in aid, much of which would be provided by US buy-out group TPG. Delta has offered to inject $500m of new equity into JAL and to extend another $500m in asset-backed financing and compensation for the cost of switching to its SkyTeam alliance.JAL shares ended at Y107 in Tokyo on Monday, their highest in about a month.
364;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American Airlines steps up efforts to woo JAL;;American Airlines on Thursday stepped up efforts to save its partnership with Japan Airlines, the troubled carrier that is the lynchpin of its Asian network, by promising a $1.1bn investment to support the group.The investment – much of which would be provided by US private equity group TPG – exceeds a rival offer from Delta Air Lines, which is trying to lure JAL away from Amercian’s OneWorld alliance.Last month Delta and its SkyTeam partners offered to inject $500m of new equity into JAL and to extend another $500m in asset-backed financing and compensation for the cost of switching teams.Delta responded to American’s announcement on Thursday by saying it, too, might find an outside financial investor to bolster its offer.JAL’s strong links to China and other Asian destinations have made it an attractive ally for US carriers in spite of its financial problems. JAL lost more than Y130bn in the six months to September and is struggling to manage one of the industry’s heaviest debt loads.American and Delta expect ties with JAL to become even more valuable once a long-awaited “open skies” deal between Japan and the US is completed, likely next year. The deal would pave the way for full-scale joint ventures between US and Japanese carriers that could be exempted from US anti-trust rules.American declined to say how much of the promised investment would come from TPG and how much would come from American and its OneWorld partners, which include British Airways. The US carrier said the total present value to JAL of remaining in One World was $1.8bn once projected revenue gains from an American-JAL joint venture were factored in.In addition to wooing JAL management, American and Delta are fighting to win over the Japanese government, which has taken over efforts to revive the former state-owned airline. The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, a government-backed investment body, is working on a restructuring plan that it expects to announce early next year.Both US airlines have dispatched high-ranking lobbyists to plead their case.Yesterday Norman Mineta, the former US transportation secretary, argued for the American Airlines side that a Delta-JAL joint venture would be too dominant to win approval from US regulators.Together the two carriers would control about 60 per cent of US-Japan traffic.Delta – backed by its own ex-government specialists – counters that joint ventures with higher market shares have won so-called anti-trust immunity in the past, and that the US has never rejected an application for immunity from airlines based in countries covered by “open skies” deals.

The group said its recovery could be hindered by continued job losses, sending its shares down 10.4 per cent to $24.20.However, the financial sector was buoyed by Ambac Financial, which eased market concerns over its balance sheet.The second-largest US bond insurer said the statutory capital of its main unit was well above a regulatory minimum at the end of the third quarter.Last week, the group said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not solve its liquidity problems, sending its shares down more than
30 per cent.But Ambac shares soared 44.3 per cent to $1.01 on Wednesday and MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, jumped 10.1 per cent to $3.82.After brief gains in the morning, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,109.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,426.31 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,193.14.Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said: “The housing starts [data] was not expected to be that weak, but there is a lot of complacency in the market and that is being interpreted through implied volatility, which is nearing year-to-date lows.”The Vix, an index that gauges market volatility and investor anxiety, surged over the 80 points level in November last year but has fallen steadily since. The index dropped a further 3.4 per cent to 21.64 on Wednesday.The market was also torn between a series of deals, which helped to lift sentiment, and continued pessimism in the consumer discretionary sector.Hershey and Ferrero International said they might enter the bidding for Cadbury, the British confectionery group that is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods. Hershey fell 2 per cent to $37.63 and Kraft 1.4 per cent to $27.26.American Express also announced that it had bought Revolution Money, an internet-based payment platform, for $300m.The company was set up in 2007 by Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL. American Express shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $41.57.Shares in Delta Air Lines dropped 1.8 per cent to $7.76 after the airline and its partners offered a $1bn aid package to Japan Airlines, which is facing possible bankruptcy.The deal is intended to lure Asia’s biggest carrier out of a potential alliance with American Airlines.Shares in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 3.7 per cent to $5.77.But discount retailers weighed on the market.Shares in Target, the second-largest discounter in the US, slipped 1.5 per cent to $47.87 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” from “buy”. The company’s shares lost more than 3 per cent on Tuesday after the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the upcoming holiday season.BJ’s Wholesale Club reported lower sales from its third quarter than had been expected, pushing its shares down 2 per cent to $35.63.The retailer remains popular with shoppers seeking to save money by buying in bulk. But BJ’s and its rivals are facing tough comparisons given that last year’s sales were boosted by high petrol prices and food price inflation.But the retailer Perry Ellis International reported third-quarter profit above expectations due to its aggressive cost-cutting. Its shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.99 as it raised forecasts for next year.Chico’s, the women’s casual clothing chain, also beat estimates for the third quarter, sending its shares up 8.8 per cent to $14.67.General Growth Properties, the bankrupt shopping mall owner, surged 36.3 per cent to $5.82 after reports that rival Simon Property Group was considering buying assets of the company.Simon also gained after the announcement, rising 4.7 per cent to $75.58."
366;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-11-18T19:48:04Z;JAL;;US airlines must be suckers for punishment. Why else would Delta and American Airlines be jostling to throw money at the perennial problem that is Japan Airlines? The Japanese carrier, Asia’s largest by revenues, has yet to shed legacy costs built up over decades – something the US industry only achieved through bankruptcy, violent reorganisation and government assistance. It is unclear that the political will to push through change exists (a committee is appointing a second one to come up with proposals). Japan Airlines is also struggling under Y912bn ($10bn) of net debt and still losing money.However, with international mergers still mostly illegal, joint ventures are the likely route to future co-operation – an approach that is helping to cut costs for Delta, Northwest and Air France-KLM over the Atlantic. So Delta’s proposal that JAL switches from the OneWorld alliance to its own SkyTeam alliance, in return for $500m of non-voting equity finance, $200m of debt and a $300m revenue guarantee would be a step towards that goal. It also makes life difficult for weaker competitor American Airlines, which has little Asian exposure and must try to fund a counter-offer to JAL.Anti-trust objections to Delta/JAL co-operation may be surmountable. Combined, the two would have 51 per cent of slots at Tokyo’s Narita airport, less than American Airlines and British Airways would control at Heathrow if their application for anti-trust immunity were approved. Yet the US carriers are living on borrowed time, with debt and equity raisings providing only limited breathing room. Structural issues remain unaddressed, such as the overabundance of hub airports with too few spokes. And JAL needs far more cash than its peers could supply.

367;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-11-18T19:35:16Z;Delta woos JAL with $1bn aid package;;"Delta Air Lines on Wednesday sweetened its offer of financial support to Japan Airlines, the troubled carrier whose links to China and other Asian destinations have made it a potentially valuable prize.At the same time, TPG, brought in as financial investor by American Airlines, could inject as much as $1bn into JAL, said people close to the US buy-out group. But they added that no concrete numbers had been discussed with JAL.Delta said it and its SkyTeam alliance partners were prepared to commit $1bn of aid, including $500m in new capital, to woo JAL away from the American Airlines-led OneWorld alliance. Delta had initially indicated it would invest about $300m in JAL. “We believe strongly enough in JAL and in its future to put our own capital at risk,” said Edward Bastian, Delta president.He was in Tokyo to lobby JAL and the Japanese government, which has taken over efforts to revive the loss-making airline. The state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation is expected to announce a restructuring plan in early 2010.In addition to a $500m injection of “non-voting equity capital”, Mr Bastian said Delta would provide $200m in asset-backed financing; replace up to $300m in lost short-term revenue during the transition to SkyTeam; and pay computer-integration and other switching costs, estimated at $20m.Delta and American hope to benefit from a liberalising “Open Skies” deal between the US and Japan expected to be signed next year. Mr Bastian dismissed claims that Delta – which unlike American has a large hub in Tokyo – could not win an exemption from US antitrust laws, something it would need in order to co-operate more closely with JAL after the Open Skies deal.In contrast to Delta, American has been vague about whether it would commit its own money to JAL.Instead it has brought TPG on board as a financial investor. JAL’s problems were underscored on Wednesday by Seiji Maehara, Japan’s transport minister, who suggested that the airline could be allowed to file for bankruptcy if the ETIC’s restructuring efforts stalled."
368;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;BA and Iberia prepare for landing on merger;;One of the most anticipated deals in the airline industry was finally sealed on Thursday night.But one of the larger questions about the merger between British Airways and Spain’s Iberia is whether the new group can achieve the €400m (£358m, $594m) in savings that the airlines estimate it will produce by its fifth year.The deal would create a group bigger by revenue than all other European airlines except Germany’s Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.Although BA and Iberia are long-time associates, they have come relatively late to the merger party compared with their rivals in Europe and the US.Air France merged with KLM of the Netherlands in 2004 and Lufthansa has made a series of tie-ups and takeovers since 2005.In the US, Delta and Northwest Airlines agreed to merge last year, while United Airlines and Continental also held talks on a deal before abandoning it in the face of rising fuel costs and falling cash reserves.The Air France-KLM deal, which was the first takeover of a national flag carrier in Europe, is often cited as an example for the industry. Within a year of the deal, the merged group reported that it was reaping the benefits much more quickly than expected.It increased its pre-tax profits by 33 per cent in the year to March 2005, helped, it said, by synergies totalling €115m, up from the €65m originally forecast.But analysts say that there were important differences between that deal and the proposed BA-Iberia tie-up.“Air France-KLM were lucky they were in a strong economic environment,” says Andrew Fitchie, airline analyst with Collins Stewart. “You saw unit costs going down, but they did that by growing the business. This BA-Iberia deal is different in this economic climate. It’s about ‘can we put these two businesses together and take out costs’.”The urge to merge has long been present in an industry over-burdened with capacity, but it has become more pressing in the recession.The International Air Transport Association, which represents 230 airlines, forecasts the industry will suffer $11bn of losses this year.BA will contribute to that loss, as it struggles with high fuel prices and a sharp fall in the number of first and business class passengers, which provide a large share of its revenues. It reported a pre-tax half-year loss of £292m ($484m) last week and is on course for a second consecutive full year of losses for the first time in its history.Iberia is facing its first slide into the red for more than a decade.Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, who was named chief executive in a top-level shake-out in July, said recently that Iberia’s business model was “unsustainable”.The air travel industry “has never experienced such a dramatic situation as the current one”, he said.In a statement released on Thursday night, BA and Iberia said they expected 33 per cent of the synergies to be created under the deal to relate to revenues, such as joint selling and network management efforts.The majority would come from cost reductions in areas such as IT, back-office functions and fleet maintenance. Analysts also believe savings will come from ending duplication in catering, engineering and airport business class lounges.But airlines often find it difficult to cut costs, as evidenced by the industrial action both BA and Iberia are facing as a result of cost-cutting measures announced ahead of Friday’s deal.As Iberia’s board sat down to consider the deal terms, cabin crew had just completed their second two-day strike in as many weeks. They are threatening further industrial action at the end of this month and throughout December.Industry observers also expect further financial benefits from rationalising some routes, although the airlines already code-sharing on UK-Spain routes.Thursday’s deal comes nearly 16 months after BA and Iberia said they were looking at an all-share merger, which was a year after an earlier approach by BA and a private equity-led consortium.Separately, the two airlines are waiting for anti-trust immunity approval from officials in Washington to strengthen their global alliance with American Airlines in a move that investors hope will boost their financial position.Competition authorities in Brussels are also examining the alliance and recently issued a statement suggesting they may not approve it unless the airlines agree to surrender valuable take-off and landing slots at Heathrow.Previous attempts at forming an alliance foundered after authorities said a substantial number of slots would have to be given up, but Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, has said he is confident that the more competitive environment today will mean no slots will have to be ceded.The BA-American-Iberia alliance is being strongly opposed by Virgin Atlantic, which on Thursday weighed in on comments from Gerard Arpey, American chief, that Delta Airlines’ attempt to forge a similar deal with Japan’s JAL would be difficult because of Delta’s “extensive presence” at Tokyo’s Narita airport.Virgin urged US regulators to act on the “hypocritical” remarks by Mr Arpey, saying Delta and JAL together would have lower market shares between the US and Narita than British Airways and American would have between the US and Heathrow.Steve Ridgway, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said: “Virgin Atlantic absolutely agrees with American Airlines that a high level of market concentration should be an insurmountable hurdle to obtain antitrust immunity for a possible alliance such as BA-American.”

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, its US rivals, are both fighting to partner in some way with JAL and build Pacific dominance, in spite of its precarious financial position. But now private equity firm TPG has thrown its hat into the ring, perhaps to partner with AA. At a time when private equity investors are reeling from bad returns, airlines are a surprising investment.US airlines’ strategic interest in JAL is clear. An “open skies” policy between the US and Japan may soon be agreed, easing access to airports for carriers on both sides of the Pacific. A stake in JAL will also build the US airlines’ presence in Asia.

TPG is an experienced airline investor; successful past deals include Continental and Ryanair. But two concerns rein back any private equity charge. The first is conceiving an exit plan. AA wants JAL for the long haul; TPG will not. The second is convincing investors that a stake in an ailing business is a good idea.

371;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-11-11T13:48:44Z;TPG could invest in struggling JAL;;American Airlines has invited TPG, the private equity firm, to join a proposed investment in Japan Airlines that would keep the struggling Asian carrier from defecting from American’s OneWorld alliance.Thomas Horton, American’s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday US-based TPG “support American Airlines and OneWorld and they endorse our proposal” to extend financial aid to JAL.“As appropriate and if it were welcomed by Japan Airlines and the government of Japan, TPG could also be part of a comprehensive recovery plan,” he said.TPG representatives were not available for comment.JAL’s future is in the hands of a government-backed rescue fund, the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation (ETIC), which is finalising a strategy to replenish JAL’s equity, cut its debt and shrink its bloated operation.American has been forced to extend a hand to JAL to counter a rival approach from Delta Air Lines, its US rival, which has offered JAL some $300m to defect from OneWorld to its SkyTeam alliance and form a joint venture partnership.American is seeking a venture of its own with JAL, which, in spite of its financial problems, provides American with a vital link to Asian destinations.Both US carrier’s offers to JAL are contingent on the expected signing next year of an “open skies” deal between the US and Japan, which would ease airport access for foreign carriers.The successful suitor would then seek exemption from US antitrust laws, which would free it to co-ordinate with JAL on schedules, fares and corporate sales pitches while sharing revenue on flights.
372;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-11-10T23:02:28Z;Tokyo promises loans to Japan Airlines;;"Japan on Tuesday promised to provide emergency short-term loans to keep Japan Airlines in business while a state-backed corporate turnround agency finalises a plan to restructure the stricken airline.The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation is expected to take until at least January to assess JAL’s financial situation and come up with a rescue strategy. However, the airline needs about Y200bn ($2.2bn) this month to roll over debts and pay suppliers, people close to the company said.Naoto Kan, deputy prime minister, said the Development Bank of Japan, a state-owned group that is already JAL’s biggest creditor, would supply the emergency funds, though private-sector banks may also be asked to lend.Mr Kan said the transport, finance and welfare ministers had also approved the plan.“There is an agreement in place to protect JAL’s management and airline operations until the Etic reaches a conclusion,” he said.The announcement appeared timed to reassure JAL investors, suppliers and customers ahead of the planned release on Thursday of the carrier’s quarterly results. JAL suffered a record Y99bn net loss in the three months to June and is expected to report another heavy deficit for the July-September quarter.JAL is Asia’s largest airline by revenues but is shrinking fast, eliminating thousands of jobs and withdrawing from dozens of unprofitable routes. In addition to seeking government aid, it is in talks with two competing US carriers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, over a potential joint venture to cover transpacific routes.A big hurdle for any JAL restructuring is the Y330bn of pension-related obligations that account for more than a quarter of its debt; obligations its bankers say must be reduced before they agree to write off any JAL loans.Under Japanese law, two-thirds of the participants in JAL’s pension scheme must approve any benefit cuts, something they have shown little inclination to do.In a statement signed by the three ministers and Mr Kan, the government said it was examining whether to change the law to allow JAL to reduce benefits more easily.It recommended that JAL cut more 9,000 jobs and issue Y300bn of new shares to the government and private investors, and that the carrier’s banks forgive Y250bn of the airline’s debt."
373;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-11-08T22:35:12Z;American Airlines attacks Delta-JAL venture;;"American Airlines’ top executive has delivered his most pointed attack yet on Delta Air Lines’ bid to form a joint venture with Japan Airlines, arguing that Delta would face an uphill battle in convincing US regulators to approve the partnership.American, the world’s second-largest carrier, is seeking a venture of its own with JAL, its partner in the Oneworld alliance and a vital link to Asian destinations. JAL, mired in a complex restructuring plan, is in talks with both US carriers to strengthen ties before the US and Japan agree to ease airport access to foreign carriers next year.The winner would then seek immunity from US antitrust laws, freeing the two airlines to co-ordinate on schedules, fares and corporate sales pitches while sharing revenue on flights.In comments obtained by the Financial Times, Gerard Arpey, American’s chief, told managers that Delta’s extensive presence at Narita Airport, Tokyo, would make any co-operation with JAL a difficult sell to US transport regulators.“If JAL were to change horses, we would certainly argue that they might not be allowed to even code-share, let alone have immunity with the dominant carrier in Narita,” Mr Arpey said. “We have poured energy into this situation to make sure all of the facts are on the table, that both the JAL management team and this [restructuring] task force . . . understands the landscapes.”Delta executives have maintained that their planned venture would help bring stability to a Japanese airline that has foundered in spite of its relationship with American and its fellow Oneworld allies, and dismissed the notion that a JAL partnership would cripple competition on trans-Pacific routes. The Atlanta-based carrier has offered to pay JAL for the costs of switching allegiances.The battle for JAL has escalated as the US and Japan have inched closer to an Open Skies accord. Negotiators from the two countries concluded meetings in Tokyo last month with expectations that they could reach an agreement next month when talks resume in Washington.The US has made clear that an Open Skies agreement is a prerequisite, and not a promise, that Japan’s two largest carriers would be granted antitrust immunity, said John Byerly, chief US aviation negotiator.“The Department of Transportation can’t prejudge the decision,” he said. “What you can do is look at decisions that the DOT has made in the past, and consult experts in the field.”Nevertheless, Japan has insisted that any Open Skies agreement that is reached would not begin until US transport officials rule on any immunity applications involving national carriers, a detail that
countries such as Germany and Canada pursued in
past negotiations, Mr Byerly said."
374;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-27T23:05:00Z;UAL chief sees new route to airline mergers;;A recent spate of capital raisings by US airlines has removed a key obstacle in the industry’s pursuit of sweeping consolidation, according to the chief executive of United Airlines.Glenn Tilton told the Financial Times that consolidation should still play a role in shaping the US aviation industry’s future, adding that balance sheets had “probably” improved enough to help finance prospective merger plans. “There is still too much capacity in the US market,” he said.Surging fuel costs and dwindling cash reserves ended merger talks between United and Continental Airlines in April 2008, preventing the carriers from following the tie-up between rivals Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.A reversal in commodity prices later that year, while positive for the industry, nevertheless forced airlines to tie up more cash in fuel-hedging programmes.In the past year, airlines of all sizes have faced a historic downturn in air-travel demand just as the financial crisis all but froze out the industry from new capital. But in recent months, debt and equity markets have reopened to carriers such as United, Continental and American Airlines.The industry may now have the means to pay for the 12-18 months of integration airlines typically endure before the benefits of a merger kick in, Mr Tilton said. “To build a bridge to the synergies, you’ve got to have a chequebook,” he said.Mr Tilton, among the first major industry executives to endorse sweeping consolidation, declined to say whether he and his colleagues had revived talks with Continental, which this week formally joined United’s Star Alliance. People familiar with the airlines’ plans say the discussions remain dormant.Industry executives maintain that the ties United and Continental will forge on international routes as Star allies and venture partners will continue to draw the airlines together, ultimately leading the two to the kind of deal Continental scuttled last year. The combined company would surpass Delta as the world’s largest carrier. And like Delta’s acquisition of Northwest, a United-Continental merger would wed complimentary route networks.Other merger combinations remain possibilities. Continental also held talks with American last year, while United had discussed a deal with US Airways. But even if the US industry’s strengthening balance sheets do not bring about at least one major deal, Mr Tilton is confident rising commodity prices will not be the culprit.A former vice-chairman at ChevronTexaco, Mr Tilton said recent comments by Opec suggest producers are mindful that a spike in fuel prices could slow the global economy’s recovery.While oil could still climb as hedge funds and other speculators bank on an improving economy, Wall Street may seek to limit its bets on concern that another run-up without a meaningful increase in demand could prompt Washington to tighten commodity trading rules.
375;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-27T23:05:00Z;Continental and UAL seek ANA deal;;Continental Airlines has joined its new ally, United Airlines, in seeking a revenue-sharing venture on key trans-Pacific routes with Japan’s All Nippon Airways.The discussions come as US and Japanese officials work towards an Open Skies treaty that would improve access to important airports and spur closer ties between each country’s biggest carriers.“As we look at Open Skies, we’ll look at how we can take advantage of antitrust immunity on a joint venture across the Pacific,” Larry Kellner, Continental’s chief executive, said on Tuesday during an event celebrating the Houston-based airline’s formal initiation into the Star Alliance.Continental and fellow Star members United and ANA expect to reach an accord by the end of the year with a view to getting US regulatory approval for the venture by October 2010, according to people familiar with the matter.That is when Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, which handles mostly domestic traffic, will open to international services. Many global carriers hope to secure take-off and landing slots at Haneda, which is nearer the city centre than Narita, the main international airport.The extent of US carriers’ access has been a key issue in the Open Skies negotiations, which are expected to conclude by the end of the year. Keisuke Okada, an executive vice-president at ANA, told the Financial Times that he remained “hopeful” the parties would achieve that goal. Officials began another round of talks on Monday in Tokyo.The treaty would mark the first step to “immunised” trans-Pacific partnerships, similar to those US airlines have formed across the Atlantic with European carriers, such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.Immunity from US antitrust laws frees airline partners to share revenue and costs, and co-ordinate schedules, fares and corporate sales pitches.Continental agreed to join Star and seek an immunised trans-Atlantic venture with United and Lufthansa last year after two of its former allies, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, agreed to merge.For many flagship carriers, which have been hit by low-cost rivals on domestic routes and restricted from full-blown mergers with foreign peers, immunised ventures have emerged as their best hope for finding sustainable stability. As partnerships evolve, airlines may reap billions of dollars in revenue and find billions in cost savings.Immunised aviation ventures have drawn scrutiny from regulators and politicians are concerned the partnerships will squeeze out independent competitors and lift ticket prices.Mindful of the competitive threat a United, ANA and Continental venture would pose, rivals Delta and American Airlines are vying with one another for a partnership with Japan Airlines.
376;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-27T18:14:30Z;JAL hopes to end reliance on bail-outs;;"The rising sun that adorns every Japan Airlines tailfin seems to mock the company these days.The lossmaking former flag carrier has avoided bankruptcy thanks only to the benevolence of the Japanese state, which in its role as a zealous protector of former national champions is known as as oyakata hinomaru, or “guardian rising sun”.But JAL’s problems highlight how government “guardianship” can be a mixed blessing.JAL remains Asia’s biggest carrier by revenue but its market value has shrunk by more than half in the past year to Y320bn ($3.5bn) – less than a third of the capitalisation of Singapore Airlines, its closest regional rival.JAL’s shares lost Y99bn in the April-to-June quarter, meaning it is in effective insolvent, according to an unpublished government assessment.Now a bail-out worth Y550bn, split more or less evenly between new equity and debt waivers, awaits final approval from Yukio Hatoyama, Japan’s prime minister. The bail-out is conditional on JAL pushing 9,000 workers into early retirement and replacing its chief executive with an outsider.Motoshige Itoh, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied Japan’s airline industry, says the carrier suffers from the same weaknesses that have beset other global airlines. These are high wage bills; a bloated network that serves too many marginal routes; and big “legacy” costs. JAL has Y330bn in pension obligations, accounting for close to a quarter of its debt.“JAL has been protected by the government, so it has been able to put off solving its problems,” Mr Itoh says. The reckoning came with the global recession, which pushed demand below the level JAL’s cost structure could bear.Almost no one in Japan has suggested liquidating JAL, although many analysts say Japan’s other big airline, All Nippon Airways, could serve the country adequately alone.Industry executives say that the success European carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have found as global airlines would not have been possible without first securing unrivalled dominance in their home base.A large amount of Japanese government money is already tied up in JAL. After three smaller bailouts this decade, the state-owned Development Bank of Japan has Y274bn in outstanding loans to the airline, four times as much as the next-biggest creditor. A Y100bn emergency loan issued in June is backed by explicit government guarantees.In spite of JAL’s problems, it still has a valuable asset to offer potential industry investors, such as Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. Both carriers are attracted by JAL’s many connections to China and elsewhere in Asia, where overcrowded airports make it difficult to secure landing slots.“There is a lot of merit for US carriers to partner with JAL,” says Osuke Itazaki, analyst at Credit Suisse.Delta has sought a relationship with JAL ever since ANA abandoned its partnership with the US carrier in favour of one with rival United Airlines a decade ago.But last year’s merger with Northwest Airlines, another longtime JAL suitor, created the world’s largest carrier.Delta already has a successful venture with Air France-KLM. Thanks to Northwest’s existing presence in Japan, a Delta-JAL tie-up would control about 60 per cent of the trans-Pacific air travel out of Tokyo.As a fellow member of the Oneworld alliance, American has argued that JAL could avoid considerable cost and complexity by simply staying put.The lack of overlap between the two carriers’ route maps would make winning immunity from antitrust laws a relatively easy process.American officials have pointed out that JAL could agree to form a venture with Delta this year, only to learn by late 2010 that US transport regulators had rejected the plan on the grounds that the partnership would hold an unfair grip on trans-Pacific traffic."
377;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-26T00:07:43Z;Air alliance runs into turbulence;;"News of the extent of Brussels’ competition concerns about the planned alliance between American Airlines, British Airways and Spain’s Iberia comes at a critical time for the carriers.All three have reported losses this year as the economic downturn and surging oil prices force the airline industry into what its trade body, the International Air Transport Association, predicts will be $11bn of losses in 2009.“This is not a short-term shock,” says Giovanni Bisignani, IATA chief executive. “$80bn will disappear from the industry’s top line. That 15 per cent of lost revenue will take years to recover.”In other industries, such challenging times might lead to consolidation, but airline mergers face regulatory barriers. Airlines have sought the next best thing: agreements that let them co-ordinate schedules and fares on busy routes to strengthen their businesses.These agreements go much further than the three alliances – Star, SkyTeam and OneWorld – that focus on co-ordinating services such as frequent-flier programmes. Instead, they allow the airlines, in effect, to collude on pricing and services, which is why regulatory approval is needed to ensure consumers’ interests are not damaged.It is arguable, however, that consumers’ interests have received too much attention. The airline industry has been unstable for 30 years, in part because the value of an airline seat has fallen dramatically.These new alliances have been billed as a way to help ensure airlines will not end up in the bankruptcy courts or seeking government aid. For that to happen, passengers may have to pay.The US Department of Transportation has given antitrust immunity to two alliances – Star and SkyTeam. BA, AA and Iberia are members of the third OneWorld alliance and the department is due to give a preliminary ruling on their application for immunity at the end of this week.The OneWorld carriers say it would be unfair to deny them immunity.In addition, they say the Star Alliance, led by Lufthansa and United, has 41 per cent of the market; SkyTeam, which includes Air France-KLM and Delta, has 29 per cent while OneWorld has 20 per cent.Opponents such as Virgin Atlantic’s Sir Richard Branson say this misses the point that an alliance will create a “monster monopoly” at Heathrow, Europe’s busiest airport, where BA controls 41 per cent of take-off and landing slots.Regulators know this. Two previous attempts by BA and AA to forge a deeper alliance – launched in 1996 and 2001 – were scrapped after regulators said they could only go ahead if the carriers gave up large numbers of slots.BA chief executive Willie Walsh said in Washington this month he was confident the BA-AA-Iberia deal would get approval this time without having to surrender slots because the EU-US Open Skies agreement had opened Heathrow to the two rival alliances.Although the US Department of Transportation has the final say on the application, the US Department of Justice, which has pledged tougher antitrust action, also has a say.As the details in its statement of objections make clear, BA, AA and Iberia may have a way to go to prove to Brussels that the financial benefits of their planned alliance will not come at the expense of consumers."
378;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-22T17:16:15Z;JAL poised to receive $6bn long-term aid;;Japan Airlines is poised to receive Y550bn ($6bn) in long-term financial support under a rescue plan expected to win government approval this week, people close to the matter said on Thursday.The rescue, which will be partly funded by Japanese taxpayers, was put in place after a task force appointed by Japan’s transport minister determined that JAL was in effect insolvent, with liabilities that exceed its assets by Y500bn or more, the people said.In the final draft of a turnround plan for the struggling carrier, the task force has called on JAL to issue Y300bn of new shares to the government and private investors. The group also wants JAL’s banks to wipe out Y250bn of the airline’s debt.The price tag for rescuing JAL, a former state-owned carrier that remains Asia’s largest airline by revenues, does not include Y350bn of bridge loans and other short-term funding required by the cash-strapped airline next month.The five-member taskforce, made up of corporate-turnround specialists, also wants JAL’s banks to provide a Y200bn bridge loan and to syndicate a further Y150bn in new JAL debt.The airline’s biggest creditors are the state-run Development Bank of Japan and Japan’s three largest private-sector banks: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui.It remained unclear on Thursday how much of JAL’s rescue would be bankrolled by the state.One official with knowledge of the plan said this would depend on how much capital JAL could raise from private investors.This could possibly include funds from one of two US carriers– Delta Air Lines or American Airlines – that have been in talks over an equity investment in JAL.JAL’s management previously floated plans to raise Y150bn from investors, but that was before its financial problems escalated. Analysts said it could have more trouble accessing capital markets now.JAL had Y809bn of gross debt on its balance sheet at the end of its last fiscal year in March, plus off-balance-sheet obligations of Y634bn connected to aircraft leases and employee pensions.The taskforce wants JAL to cut its pension obligations, worth some Y330bn, in half by reducing promised pay-outs to retirees.The rescue plan also calls for 9,000 job cuts and changes in top management.

United’s shares surged 8.8 per cent on Tuesday and have more than doubled in the past three months.“We have a long way to go, but we are beginning to see encouraging early signs among business and premium travellers, both domestically and internationally,” Kathryn Mikells, United’s chief financial officer, wrote in a note to employees.United’s third-quarter net loss narrowed to $57m, or 39 cents a share, from $792, or $6.22, a year earlier.While operating revenue slipped 20 per cent to $4.4bn, the pace of the decline slowed from the second quarter.Operating expenses fell 28 per cent to $4.3bn, fuel costs fell by more than half.United finished the quarter with more than $2.5bn in cash unrestricted by existing credit agreements. The Chicago-based airline also raised almost $1.3bn earlier this month.

381;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-19T08:08:57Z;Tokyo to speed up JAL restructuring;;Shares in Japan Airlines rallied sharply on Monday after it emerged that the government would push for quick adoption of a recovery plan for the ailing carrier.JAL’s shares jumped 12 per cent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to close at Y113. That was still less than half the price they fetched a year ago, however, and significantly below their value at the start of last week, before a flurry of selling drove them to historic lows.Recent declines had been driven by signs of discord among the airline, its banks and the government over a recovery plan for the airline. In particular, traders worried that bankers might reject a proposal, made by a government-appointed task force, to forgive Y250bn ($2.8bn) of JAL debt.Japan’s new Democratic party-led government has signalled its intention to impose more radical changes on JAL than previous administrations had. The airline received multiple bail-outs under the more business-friendly Liberal Democrats, who were ousted in elections in August, yet still lost a record Y99bn in the April-to-June quarter.Seiji Maehara, transport minister, appointed the five-member task force last month. Consisting mostly of corporate-restructuring experts, it is to submit its recovery plan for JAL by the end of the month.Mr Maehara had initially given himself until the end of November to examine the plan and secure the co-operation of banks, unions and other JAL stakeholders. But Japanese media reported at the weekend that he and other ministers now intend to push for a quicker resolution.A final deal on the airline’s fate could be announced alongside the recovery plan itself at the end of the month, according to the reports.JAL is struggling to manage Y1,440bn in interest-bearing debt, including large pension obligations to retirees, and is believed to need Y100bn in fresh funds by the end of the year just to keep operating.Bankers are pushing to reduce the amount of debt forgiveness and increase the size of a proposed issuance of new shares by the airline. They are also insisting that JAL cut retirement benefits in order to reduce its Y330bn in pension obligations by up to half.JAL has held informal talks with two US carriers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, over a potential Y30bn equity investment and other financial support, according to people close to the situation. But the discussions are unlikely to move forward until the airline reaches a deal with the government and creditor banks.The government’s push for an early resolution suggests that a more radical plan floated by some bankers – splitting JAL’s assets between “good” and “bad” entities in a General Motors-style partial liquidation – is less likely to be adopted. Such a solution is likely to impose heavier costs on shareholders.
382;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Southwest Airlines’ quarterly net loss narrows;;Southwest Airlines’ quarterly net loss narrowed, as lower fuel costs and service cuts insulated the largest domestic US carrier from a severe downturn in air-travel demand.In a dramatic departure from its longtime growth strategy, Southwest shed 10 per cent of its flight schedule in the past year, refrained from adding new aircraft and targeted New York and other large markets the company had previously ignored.The tactics, along with a major fare sale, helped limit losses even as total operating revenue slipped 7.8 per cent. Before certain employee-compensation and fuel hedging costs, Southwest posted a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s average estimate.“To produce a profit, excluding certain items, in this environment is a remarkable accomplishment,” Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said on Thursday in a statement. “Sixty days ago, even a modest profit seemed unattainable.“We have staged an impressive revenue recovery from where we were in June.”The pace of the year-over-year revenue shortfall slowed during the third quarter, and Mr Kelly noted passenger sales were on pace to climb 1 per cent this month.“September’s strength was a major surprise to us, suggesting that the recent schedule optimisation is generating sustainable revenue gain,” Gary Chase, a Barclays Capital analyst, wrote in a note to clients.Southwest’s net loss narrowed to $16m, or 2 cents a share, from $120m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the Dallas-based company earned $23m, or 3 cents a share. The consensus analyst estimate was 2 cents.Total revenue fell to $2.67bn. Operating expenses declined 5.7 per cent, to $2.6bn.Southwest’s shares fell 57 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $9.47 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has surged along with those of peers such as American Airlines and Delta Air Lines in the last three months as investors bet that improving economic conditions would spur more business and leisure travel.The company reported a 2.8 per cent increase in enplaned passengers during the third quarter. Capacity cuts helped lift Southwest’s load factor, or the percentage of seats occupied by passengers, to 79.6 per cent.Southwest plans to trim its capacity by 8 per cent during the fourth quarter.Mr Kelly also attributed the fuller flights to an influx of new customers lured by the airline’s decision to avoid charging for baggage checks.Southwest is the first major US airline to report quarterly results.
383;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-10-13T17:26:42Z;Task force floats debt plan for JAL;;A government-appointed task force overseeing the rescue of Japan Airlines has proposed expanding financial support for the struggling carrier to include Y250bn ($2.8bn) in debt forgiveness from its creditor banks.The five-member task force floated the proposal in private meetings on Tuesday with Seiji Maehara, Japan’s transport minister, and representatives from the banks, people close to the situation said.JAL’s biggest creditors are the state-run Development Bank of Japan and the three largest private-sector financial groups: Mitsubishi Tokyo, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui.It was unclear whether bankers would accept the plan, which would give JAL more breathing space as it seeks to turn itself round. Lenders have set aside funds against a possible default but forgiving the loans would crystalise heavy losses.Some bankers have floated a tougher alternative that would see JAL’s assets split between “good” and “bad” entities in a General Motors-style partial liquidation.The government task force is to submit a final plan at the end of this month. If its draft proposals are accepted, total financial aid for the group could top Y400bn, as JAL would also seek about Y150bn in fresh capital from banks, the government and market investors, people involved said.JAL secured Y100bn in emergency loans in June, mostly backed by government guarantees, but it is believed to need Y100bn more by year-end to keep its aircraft flying, plus additional funds to replace ageing, fuel-thirsty aircraft and buy out surplus staff.The task force’s proposal would see job cuts rise to 9,000, or roughly 19 per cent of JAL’s workforce, from 6,800 under the latest management plan. Senior executives would also be expected to step down, including Haruka Nishimatsu, president, whom the task force would like to see replaced by a manager from outside the company.Even before getting emergency loans in June, JAL had Y809bn of gross debt on its balance sheet, mostly in the form of loans, plus off-balance-sheet obligations of Y634bn connected to aircraft leases and employee pensions.The former state-owned carrier has struggled to contain costs since it was privatised in the 1980s, culminating in a record net loss of Y99bn last quarter. State support has kept it out of bankruptcy at the expense of solving its underlying problems, analysts say.JAL remains in informal talks with two US carriers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, over a potential Y30bn equity investment and other financial support, according to the people close to the situation. But the discussions are unlikely to move forward until the airline reaches a deal with the government and creditor banks, these people said.
384;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-30T21:54:02Z;Clearing up the future of futures;;"“We must not let daylight in upon the magic,” Walter Bagehot warned about the British monarchy. For the world of derivatives, however, more daylight is essential.A year after the failure of Lehman Brothers, banks still make big profits from derivatives, particularly complex ones traded over the counter. US banks gained revenues of $15bn in the first half of this year on trading cash and derivatives, while the notional value of their holdings rose to $203,000bn.OTC derivatives, used in everything from hedging balance sheets to tax arbitrage, are among the most profitable contracts that big banks offer. As the revenues from trading of equities and bonds have been squeezed, complex derivatives remain money-spinners.It comes at a cost to the financial system, however. When American International Group failed, the US government spent billions of dollars to buy out its credit default swaps with institutions including Goldman Sachs. When Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers hit trouble, others worsened their plight by rushing to close derivative trades.The US government and the European Commission are trying to fix the most glaring problems in the OTC derivatives market. Both of them want the bulk of derivatives to switch from private OTC contracts to being cleared centrally, and perhaps traded on exchanges.The banks that dominate the OTC derivative markets are fighting the most stringent proposals. They have allies in their campaign: industrial companies that are dismayed by the prospect of having to hedge currency, interest rate and credit risks through clearing houses.European companies including Lufthansa and Rolls-Royce complained at a hearing last week about the financial risk posed to them by a clampdown on OTC derivatives. In the US, Delta Air Lines, Cargill and public utilities are protesting equally fiercely.But companies should not be allowed to undermine reforms by forcing regulators and governments to retreat from the push for more transparency and less systemic risk. Their concerns can be addressed without letting the OTC market carry on as before.It is unsurprising that companies worry about changes in derivatives markets because, with hindsight, they were getting a very good deal from the financial system and taxpayers. Although OTC derivatives were expensive, they turned out not to be expensive enough.Prices will rise further because regulators will require banks to hold more capital against each transaction and clearing houses will demand more cash collateral. That will not please companies but it reflects the full cost of the financial risks they have been able to lay off.Rising costs aside, companies have two main complaints.First, they say they cannot hedge complex risks using exchange-traded derivatives and need OTC products. But they will be able to buy complex products as needed – moves to ban OTC derivatives, including a Senate bill, have been dropped.Furthermore, the more contracts are cleared, the more flexibility they would have to hedge risks outside the OTC market and the cheaper it would be. In the long run, exchange trading of the bulk of derivatives is in their own interests.Second, they complain that it will be too complex and risky for them to buy derivatives that are centrally cleared. This is because clearing houses such as LCH Clearnet reduce their own risks by requiring that all participants put up margin to cover out-of-money positions.Lufthansa claims that this would “cause severe cash and liquidity risks” for companies and that, had these reforms been enacted last year, the financial crisis “would have erased many corporations with a domino effect reaching every …corner of business activity”.Companies want the requirement that derivatives are cleared centrally only to apply to financial institutions trading with each other. They want to be able to buy swaps from banks without having to put up, and constantly adjust, collateral.That would, however, create a huge loophole. Companies such as Enron and Metallgesellschaft, the German energy group that collapsed in 1993 under derivatives liabilities, were big participants in financial markets even though they were not, on the face of it, financial institutions.It would not take long for Wall Street banks to set up industrial subsidiaries to evade clearing requirements on standard derivatives if contracts were treated differently according to the institution.Smaller companies in particular lack facilities to handle the inflow and outflow of cash margin, but this can be addressed without creating a two-tier market for derivatives. Why not let banks give them credit lines and put up margin for them?The systemic benefits of moving the bulk of derivatives contracts to clearing houses are significant. The risk of runs on large investment banks and swaps dealers would be reduced, and there would be greater transparency in the pricing and valuation of derivatives.Government and regulators should not sacrifice such gains by granting loopholes they will regret.john.gapper@ft.com

385;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-24T11:08:23Z;JAL requests government rescue;;Japan Airlines has asked the Japanese government for emergency capital as part of a proposed $2.5bn-$3bn fundraising designed to support the struggling carrier’s operations and pay for a drastic restructuring.The bailout, if agreed, would tighten Tokyo’s control over JAL, a formerly state-owned carrier that was privatised in the mid-1980s. It would be the fourth rescue for JAL this decade.Haruka Nishimatsu, JAL’s chief executive, confirmed that he had asked for the capital injection in a meeting on Thursday with Seiji Maehara, Japan’s new transportation minister. JAL needs Y100bn ($1.1bn) simply to keep flying beyond the end of the year, according to people familiar with the carrier’s financial situation.Mr Nishihara did not say how much he expected the government to contribute. JAL’s bankers say the airline is seeking between $2.5bn and $3bn in new equity and loans, a portion of which it hopes to raise from market investors.Bringing the government on board first could help boost confidence in a business that is more than Y800bn in debt and suffered a record net loss of Y99bn last quarter.JAL’s plan also includes selling a minority stake to a foreign partner. It is in preliminary talks with two competing US carriers, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, over an investment of Y30bn.Mr Nishihara asked the government to provide the capital from a fund created earlier this year to support companies that have been hurt by the recession.Japanese taxpayers are already exposed to the turbulence at JAL after the previous government, which was ousted in a general election in August, agreed to guarantee 80 per cent of a Y100bn emergency loan secured by the airline in June.Mr Maehara, whose party was critical of the June guarantee while in opposition, is under pressure to extract a viable turnround plan from the airline before committing more funds. JAL released a draft of its latest restructuring plan last week, in which it said it would cut 6,800 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, and cancel 50 loss-making routes.This week the airline’s frustrated creditors, who include Japan’s three biggest private-sector banks as well as the state-backed Development Bank of Japan, leaked a proposal to divide JAL’s assets between “good” and “bad” entities as part of a General Motors-style partial liquidation.Mr Nishimatsu denied that such a plan was being considered. JAL’s shares tumbled 16 per cent on Thursday, a decline that traders blamed on talk of a break-up.The government recession fund that Mr Nishimatsu hopes to tap into was used in June to finance part of a Y160bn bailout of Elpida Memory, a troubled chipmaker.In that case, the Development Bank of Japan bought Y30bn in preference shares in Elpida using money from the fund and lent another Y10bn, while the rest of the bailout was provided by the Taiwanese government and Elpida’s commercial banks.
386;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-17T20:04:29Z;American Airlines;;American Airlines on Thursday turned an idea dreamt up by Sir Keith Mills in 1988 into $1bn of much-needed liquidity. The news that it had sold forward its air miles for $1bn to Citigroup, together with a new loan facility and a $1.6bn sale-and-leaseback commitment, sent the carrier’s share price skyward. The stock rose by as much as 25 per cent at one point. Investors can perhaps be forgiven their overreaction to this mildly good news considering that American Airlines has only turned a net profit twice this decade.High fuel costs and the recession have forced airlines everywhere to look to their loyalty schemes as a potential source of funds: Delta did it last year with American Express. Still, they would rather not. The truth is that miles programmes are so profitable that airlines try their darndest not to reveal the underlying numbers. Qantas, for example, considered a part flotation of its frequent flyer business in the dark months of last year. Even though markets have brightened, that idea is now “indefinitely off”.The high margins come from selling seats at or near their full price when they should go for next to nothing. Airlines “yield manage” their jets, adjusting prices to meet demand. Normally, if there are empty seats, prices are lowered until the last seat is sold. As a seat is a sunk cost once the airline takes off, it technically makes sense to charge just one dollar if it is still empty before the gangway is withdrawn.But with miles, airlines can sell such seats to their corporate loyalty partners for more. That is why it is hard to redeem miles on popular routes. Carriers can also adjust the accounting treatment of miles to smooth earnings. Grown-up investors generally avoid the airline sector – American Airlines shares remain 80 per cent off their 2007 peak. But if the chance ever comes along to buy a loyalty scheme, grab it.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
387;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-17T18:43:15Z;Government ‘cannot allow’ JAL bankruptcy;;Japan’s transportation minister sought on Thursday to allay concerns that the country’s new centre-left government might withdraw financial support for Japan Airlines, the loss-making carrier that is seeking at least Y100bn ($1.09bn) in emergency aid.Seiji Maehara, who assumed the transportation post on Wednesday, said: “Japan’s skies have always had two airlines, and it’s important that we continue with a system of two major airlines. We absolutely cannot allow a bankruptcy.”Mr Maehara had inflamed concerns about JAL’s future in a news conference following his appointment. He said he planned to dismiss a panel of academics, lawyers and other experts installed by the previous government to oversee JAL’s turnround effort, and to craft his response to JAL’s problems beginning with “blank slate”.The expert panel has been responsible for reviewing cost-cutting and other measures implemented by the airline and evaluating its requests for aid.This week it began examining a JAL proposal to eliminate 6,800 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, and to shrink its international network. Its report on the plan, due next month, was to serve as the basis for the government’s decision on the release of new financial aid. JAL received Y100bn of emergency loans in June but needs another Y100bn or more by the end of the year to continue operating, according to people familiar with its financial situation.The company is struggling with nearly Y800bn in debt, and suffered a record net loss of Y99bn in the three months to June.In addition to seeking further government support, JAL is in preliminary talks with two US carriers, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, over an equity injection of Y30bn ($328m). Haruka Nishimatsu, chief executive, said on Tuesday that the company aimed to agree on a capital tie-up by mid-October.Some DPJ lawmakers have been critical of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic government’s seemingly open-ended support for JAL, which is heading for its fourth net loss in five years.But disciplining the airline may prove difficult for the new administration. Many of the measures that analysts say are needed to turn the airline around are opposed by groups that supported the party in its landslide election victory on August 30.One of those groups is organised labour, which has attacked the proposed job losses as well as plans by the airline to save Y88bn by cutting pay-outs from its pension scheme.“Support from Rengo [the national federation of labour unions] is what won the DPJ its majority,” said Takao Toshikawa, editor-in-chief of the political journal Tokyo Insideline. “It can’t ignore that.”The DPJ has also courted support from relatively poorer rural districts – areas that are inevitably the first to lose air connections when unprofitable routes are scrapped.“You have all these small local airports in Japan that JAL flies in an out of. That is probably where the pressure comes,” said Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Japanese Studies at Temple University in Tokyo.One person familiar with JAL’s financial situation said the airline may need its next injection of emergency funds as early as next month.
388;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-17T18:02:37Z;American Airlines raises $2.9bn in financing;;"American Airlines has struck a series of financing accords with General Electric and Citigroup that will free $2.9bn in cash to help the company weather a slump in air-travel demand and shore up investor confidence.Shares of the carrier cased in Fort Worth, Texas, soared by more than 23 per cent on Thursday’s announcement, which comes as it vies with rival Delta Air Lines for the hand of Japan Airlines. Both US companies have offered to invest in JAL as part of a broader transpacific venture with the debt-laden carrier, which is under pressure from Japan’s government to stem losses.American also unveiled plans to shift flights to hubs such as Chicago and New York by next year, another “show of strength” aimed at persuading investors and international partners that the carrier will emerge from the downturn with the most valuable aspects of its global network intact.“These are two branches of the same tree, to make our company stronger,” Tom Horton, American’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.“We think American has a very strong franchise and an unmatched network. As people who allocate capital in this industry think about where to invest, they ought to bet on the best franchise.”International carriers rely on the strength of their allies’ hubs; the more domestic flights that touch down in a hub city, the easier it is to fill seats on transcontinental routes. American and JAL are members of the Oneworld alliance, while Delta leads the SkyTeam group.GE Capital Aviation Services agreed to buy previously ordered Boeing 737 aircraft and lease them back to American, saving the airline $1.6bn. American also secured $280m in cash from GECAS through a loan facility backed by aircraft. In return, American picked GE as its aircraft engine supplier for future deliveries on Boeing’s 787.American reached an accord with Citigroup, the airline’s credit card partner, on the advanced sale of AAdvantage frequent flyer miles. The pact raised an additional $1bn. Citi uses American miles to reward customers for making purchases with the bank’s AAdvantage cards.American will close the third quarter with about $3.7bn in cash and has another $2bn in assets it could use as collateral for additional liquidity. As of June, the airline had $11bn in net debt.American, the world’s second-largest carrier behind Delta, said its mainline flight schedule would increase by about 1 per cent in 2010, as it resumes Mexican routes postponed amid the swine flu scare and introduces a Chicago-to-Beijing service."
389;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-16T00:18:39Z;JAL cuts routes in bid to draw funds;;Japan Airlines is to cut 6,800 jobs, slash its network of overseas routes and withdraw from some airports as it seeks to attract the debt and equity funding needed to repair its balance sheet.Haruka Nishimatsu, JAL’s president, also said that the company aims to agree on a capital injection from a foreign rival by mid-October.JAL is in talks with US rivals Delta Air Lines and American Airlines about an equity injection of about Y30bn ($328m).Both carriers’ proposals to JAL may also feature investment commitments by other international airlines, including Delta’s venture partner, Air France-KLM, and allies of American Airlines such as British Airways, people familiar with the matter said.The restructuring plan, presented to an official panel on Tuesday, is the company’s last-ditch attempt to persuade the government, its banks and potential investors that it can return to profit.“It’s like the end of 1944 or 1945, after the Normandy landings,” said one person connected to the talks.The plan includes heavy cuts to JAL’s international network, where demand is most volatile.JAL’s international and domestic routes are currently split 50-50, but the airline would now focus more on its domestic services, said a transport ministry official who attended the presentation.JAL also intends to increase the use of smaller aircraft on some routes and to withdraw entirely from some airports.In addition to the job cuts – 14 per cent of JAL’s workforce – the company wants to reduce pay and pension costs.JAL lost Y63bn last year and a further Y99bn in the quarter from April to June. The company has about Y100bn in debt maturing in December, and will need to refinance another Y100bn by March, while shareholders’ equity had fallen to 10 per cent of total assets by the end of June.Any capital injection from Delta or American would be conditional on a US-Japan “open skies” agreement and US antitrust immunity.US and Japanese representatives met last week to discuss the bilateral treaty, and plan more talks for the week of October 26.“The shared goal is to finish those negotiations by the end of the year,” said John Byerly, a US State Department official who is the government’s top aviation negotiator. “We’ve been making progress.”Both governments are under pressure to reach an accord in time for airlines from each country’s biggest airlines to secure anti-trust immunity before October 2010, when Japan lifts some restrictions on international flights at Haneda Airport outside Tokyo. US carriers’ access to takeoff and landing slots at Haneda remains a key component in the Open Skies talks, Mr Byerly said.The transport ministry said that JAL would be free to chose whichever ally brought it the greatest efficiency.A deal between JAL and Delta – and JAL’s defection to the Skyteam airline alliance– would be a severe blow to American and JAL’s existing allies in the Oneworld group.However, the costs of changing computer systems over to the Skyteam alliance could soak up much of Delta’s proposed investment, and one person close to the negotiations said it might be hard to agree such a complicated deal by the mid-October deadline.JAL must submit a detailed restructuring plan to the ministry by the end of the month. Its future will depend heavily on who the new Democratic Party government appoints as transport minister and whether they offer further public support.
390;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Japan Airlines;;"A bidding war normally implies a desirable target. Yet Delta and American Airlines, the two largest carriers by fleet size, are vying for the chance to pour money into Japan Airlines, the world’s worst major operator by almost any metric you care to mention. JAL’s gross margins are about half the global peer group average; none can compete with a six-year average return on equity of minus 17 per cent. Net debt to equity was 346 per cent at the end of March, comfortably the worst in class. Management, contemplating the latest in a series of cuts to staff, hubs and wages on Tuesday, expects another net loss this year.But however feeble the near-term returns, and however strong their competing calls on capital, this is an opportunity neither Delta nor American dares to pass up. Injecting $300m or so would keep JAL’s borrowing lines open. An American rescuer could then exploit the imminent liberalisation of Japan’s aviation sector: after years of to-ing and fro-ing, the US and Japan are nearing an agreement on an “open-skies” policy, allowing trans-Pacific carriers to co-ordinate more tightly on prices and schedules. American and JAL, both members of the Oneworld alliance, seem natural partners. But if Delta, already a top-four operator on US-Japan routes, could tempt JAL to defect to SkyTeam, American might find itself out in the cold. Japan’s number two, ANA, belongs to the third big network, Star Alliance.This jostling within alliances reflects a new, harsher reality for airlines. Alliances used to be jolly, non-binding support groups; JAL, for example, shares codes with SkyTeam’s Air France, Korean Air, China Southern and Alitalia. But as revenue protection becomes more urgent, carriers are looking to place long-term bets with trusted partners. Loose relationships may have to be tightened with hard equityJapan Airlines is trying to rebuild its business amid a brutal downturn in which it reported a record Y99bn ($1.1bn) loss in the second quarter.JAL’s existing alliance partner, American Airlines, is considering investing equity as part of a possible trans-Pacific joint venture agreement.US rival Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, has also signalled it could be ready to inject up to about $300m.Such a sum would ease the effect of JAL’s losses at a time when it badly needs funds to overhaul its ageing fleet.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
391;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tie-up to aid JAL, not end its troubles;Financial aid for Japan Airlines appears to be on hand;When Haruka Nishimatsu, chief executive of Japan Airlines, joined pilots and cabin crew to distribute promotional pamphlets to passers-by in central Tokyo on Friday, he told reporters that such willingness to pitch in was vital to the future of the troubled former national carrier.Yet Mr Nishimatsu also acknowledged that staff motivation was the lesser half of the effort to rebuild JAL’s business amid a brutal downturn in which it reported a record Y99bn ($1.1bn) loss in the second quarter.“Of course the financial part is the most important,” Mr Nishimatsu said.Financial aid appears to be on hand in the form of a major investment in JAL’s equity. JAL’s existing partner, American Airlines, is considering such a move as part of a possible transpacific joint venture agreement. US rival Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, has also signalled it could be ready to inject up to about $300m.Such a sum would ease the effect of JAL’s recent losses at a time when it badly needs funds to overhaul its ageing fleet. And peer approval would also go some way to help reassure Japan’s incoming Democratic party government about the viability of a carrier that has found more than three years of often painful restructuring insufficient to shield it from the current slump.The historic victory of the DPJ over Japan’s long-ruling Liberal Democratic party last month has uncertain but potentially sweeping implications for national industrial strategy.Certainly, the carrier cannot take for granted continuation of the sort of support granted in June, when JAL was given Y100bn in taxpayer-guaranteed loans, of which Y60bn was from the state-backed Development Bank of Japan and the rest from private sector lenders.Yukio Hatoyama, DPJ president and incoming prime minister, has yet to choose his cabinet and details of likely policy toward JAL remain unclear.But while the DPJ has called for the state to retain a “significant” stake in the Development Bank to make “active” use of state banks as an economic safety net, the party in general favours helping small companies, and some party policymakers have signalled a lack of enthusiasm for further bail-outs of big businesses.The possibility of raising capital from a global peer is likely to be discussed at a meeting on Tuesday at Japan’s transport ministry, which has called on academics and lawyers to offer suggestions on how to “improve management” at JAL.Investment from an international peer would at least ease worries that the state’s money might never be returned.For potential partners, such as American and Delta, teaming up with JAL offers the chance to cement co-operation with a carrier that is Asia’s biggest by revenue, which offers a wide network of often highly strategic routes for code-sharing.Much will depend on the terms of any investment, however, and even a major stake sale would hardly solve all JAL’s problems.The carrier is still struggling to persuade retired pilots and other employees that it can no longer afford their full pensions. Meanwhile, analysts have said that its job cuts, sales of non-core assets and reduction of unprofitable routes is still not enough to turn it round.JAL insists that work on its business improvement plan is continuing.“JAL is looking at a number of measures to improve our business, not excluding tie-ups with other airlines,” the carrier said, adding that other options included further network and fleet restructuring. “Nothing has been decided.”

393;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American Airlines considers stake in JAL;;American Airlines has told Japan Airlines that it would consider making an equity investment in its Asian partner as part of a sweeping transpacific joint venture agreement between the two airlines, in a bid to ward off an approach by Delta Air Lines to the Japanese carrier.American’s willingness to inject capital into cash-strapped JAL could trigger a bidding war between the carrier and Delta, its US rival, and help shape the future of international aviation alliances.American executives were in Tokyo last week to work towards a new strategic partnership with the Japanese carrier, when they learned Delta had offered to invest about $300m in JAL.In return for Delta taking an equity stake, JAL would leave the Oneworld alliance, which includes American, British Airways and Qantas, for Delta’s SkyTeam, and pursue a strategic partnership with the Atlanta-based airline.Delta’s approach came at a sensitive time for JAL, which is under pressure from its government to stem losses and stabilise its finances. It also coincides with negotiations between Japan and the US over a bilateral “open skies” accord that would ease access to both countries’ hub airports.By dangling an equity investment of its own, American is aiming to head off Delta and persuade JAL to reach a joint venture agreement before Japan and the US sign the aviation treaty, people familiar with the matter said.JAL shares closed Y13 higher or nealry 8 per cent at Y176.American executives will remain in Tokyo this week to continue their discussions with JAL, the people said. While the proposed equity stake would fall well short of what JAL may need to shore up its finances, the investment may signal to other equity and debt investors that it is safe to back the airline.JAL is in the fourth year of a restructuring plan during which it has sold non-core assets and shed jobs and unprofitable routes. The efforts have failed to stem losses, and the company still has Y721bn ($8bn) of debt. JAL posted a net loss of Y99bn in its first quarter, and in June secured Y100bn in emergency funding from existing creditors after the Japanese government agreed to guarantee new loans.People familiar with the matter said on Friday that Delta’s discussions with JAL were preliminary, yet active, and may lead to an agreement by November. JAL’s defection from Oneworld would give Delta, Air France-KLM and their fellow SkyTeam members a powerful Asian ally just as Japan inches closer to granting foreign carriers more access to its international airports.US and Japanese officials met last week to discuss the “open skies” accord, which is viewed as a prerequisite to winning regulatory approval for transpacific joint ventures between each country’s airlines. Talks will resume next month. Both sides are hopeful the treaty can be completed by the end of the year, the people said.All Nippon Airways, Japan’s other national carrier, was expected to seek a joint venture with fellow Star Alliance members such as United Airlines and Lufthansa once its government reached an agreement with the US, people familiar with the plans said.American declined to comment.

For JAL, the investment would infuse several hundred millions of dollars of cash in a company burdened by mounting losses and Y721bn ($8bn) in net debts.People familiar with the matter described the discussions as preliminary, yet active, with both sides aiming to reach an agreement in a few weeks.Any strategic relationship that emerges from Delta’s investment would deal a stinging blow to American Airlines, British Airways and other members of the Oneworld alliance. JAL’s defection from Oneworld would give Delta, Air France-KLM and fellow SkyTeam members a powerful Asian ally just as Japan inches closer to granting foreign carriers more access to its international airports.People familiar with Oneworld’s thinking said their members will not let JAL go without a fight, and it is likely they will counter with an investment offer of their own should the carrier’s discussions with Delta gain momentum.US and Japanese officials met this month to negotiate a bilateral “Open Skies” accord, which is viewed as a prerequisite to winning regulatory approval for trans-Pacific joint ventures between each country’s
airlines.Delta’s investment would raise the stakes at a time when many airlines are hoping merely to conserve enough cash to survive.JAL is in the fourth year of a restructuring plan during which it has sold non-core assets and shed both jobs and unprofitable routes. The efforts have failed to stem losses. JAL posted a net loss of Y99bn in its first quarter, and in June secured Y100bn in emergency funding from a group of existing creditors after the Japanese government agreed to guarantee new loans.All Nippon Airways, Japan’s other national carrier, was expected to seek a venture with fellow Star Alliance members such as United Airlines and Lufthansa once its government reached an agreement with the US, people familiar with the plans said.JAL and Delta declined to comment."
395;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-09-09T18:47:26Z;Aviation: ties in the skies;;"When Richard Branson called a Boeing executive in 1984 to see if he could buy a used 747 on decent terms, the entrepreneur expected his plans for a new airline to be greeted with scepticism.Instead he found a sympathetic supplier. Start-ups such as Virgin Atlantic, explained the Boeing salesman, RJ Wilson, could weaken the grip of large and often state-run carriers. “The reason they carried on talking to me was because they needed a competitor to British Airways to have traction in selling – someone to give them a little leverage,” remembers Mr Branson.Mr Wilson could not have known then how dramatically commercial aviation would change over the following 25 years. The biggest airlines, such as BA, would lose more than a little leverage to new entrants such as Virgin, Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, whose lower costs, rapid growth and cheap tickets would help democratise air travel and pull their larger peers into a seemingly endless loop of fare wars and service expansions.Now the industry may be on the verge of another dramatic turn. By banding together, forming alliances and joint ventures, the old behemoths may have finally found a way to break the vicious cycle – at least on lucrative international routes.Bilateral “Open Skies” treaties have eased access to many international hub airports. Politicians, motivated in part by concerns that voters would miss out on the choice in destinations and service offered by a rapidly evolving industry, have freed carriers to collaborate with international allies in ways that have made many antitrust lawyers nervous.The friendlier regulatory climate has come as many airlines endure the most difficult decade in their history. Terrorist attacks, record fuel costs, bitter labour negotiations, bankruptcy filings and two deep recessions have tested more than the resolve of those in the sector.“In the final analysis, joint ventures and alliances may be the way out for the legacy airlines,” says Vaughn Cordle, chief analyst at AirlineForecasts.Alliances have continued to gain strength in recent years. Following successful efforts to secure immunity from US antitrust law, two of the big global alliances, Star and SkyTeam, are now in the process of intensifying the co-operation between the most powerful members of their respective groupings. This includes unifying fares and sales efforts to lucrative corporate clients. Meanwhile, a third big alliance, OneWorld, led by BA and American Airlines, is eagerly awaiting word on its immunity application, which it hopes will clear the way for its own transatlantic joint venture.Such ambitious plans have not gone unnoticed. Regulators, politicians, labour leaders and, not least, independent competitors, all worry that the big network carriers are about to seize back the skies one transcontinental route at a time. In time, they warn, it will be passengers who pay for the legacy airlines’ regained dominance.For an industry beset by cut-throat competition, volatile commodity prices and one of the worst downturns in demand in history, the savings made possible by international partnerships hold the promise of stable profits – a goal as elusive to many airlines as comfortable economy class seats.Few analysts doubt these partnerships will continue to flourish; many big airlines have persuaded US regulators to grant them antitrust immunity, freeing them to co-ordinate in ways that would have been otherwise impossible given the restrictions many countries impose on foreign investment in local airlines.Through these ventures, airlines such as Air France-KLM co-operate on schedules and fares, co-ordinate sales pitches to corporate accounts and consolidate marketing offices and terminal gates. The next step would be joint purchasing agreements, generating volume discounts on everything from plastic cups to jet fuel – and maybe even multi-million dollar aircraft.“It’s no secret that this industry has failed to earn a reasonable profit over time,” says Tom Horton, American Airlines’ chief financial officer. “One of the structural problems has been extreme fragmentation …Alliances are a step in the direction of rationalising the industry.”It is little wonder executives at many large carriers regard partnerships as a salvation. And why their unallied peers such as Virgin and Emirates argue they will come to dominate the skies, crushing competition.“If I were chairman of BA or American I would try to get away with it, try to dominate,” Mr Branson says. “But that is what you have governments for, and that’s what you have regulators for.”The upstarts have allies of their own, in Washington and Brussels. A bill now going through Congress could rescind US antitrust immunity deals. US Justice department officials have pushed their peers in the transport agency to limit the ventures’ scope. In Brussels the European Commission is investigating the effects of partnerships on competition.Critics argue that these ventures could undo much of the progress that has been made in the past 30 years towards making air travel more affordable. According to the Air Transport Association, a US lobby group, the price of flying each mile internationally since 1978, when the US industry was deregulated, has risen just 81 per cent – a far lower increase than the rise in cost of many consumer goods.There are signs the trend has begun to reverse, at least on routes shared by venture partners. From 1999 to 2004, air fares in transatlantic markets dominated by the immunised alliances increased significantly compared with other international routes, according to the Brattle Group, a research firm.There are also fears that alliances will eventually impact on domestic markets. US antitrust regulators worry that two local allies within the same international venture may find co-ordinating on domestic routes too tempting to avoid. Trade unions meanwhile fear airlines will use alliance membership to staff their fleets with pilots and flight attendants from countries with lower wages.Airlines usually defend their alliances and ventures with a simple mantra: a healthy airline is good for employees, shareholders and passengers; stable profit growth lowers the cost of capital, which in turn helps keep fares low.Yet for all their potential benefits, many industry insiders say these ventures fall short of the savings they would reap if governments allowed cross-border mergers. At best, alliances and cross-border ventures can help carriers to fill empty seats while they bide their time for changes to foreign-investment laws.“Alliances are much more about the revenue side,” says Mark Streeter of JPMorgan Chase. “If you want to rationalise costs, you merge.”In a world with no regulatory barriers, he says, BA and American Airlines “would love to explore a merger instead of having alliances”.Alliances and ventures currently also lack a means of guaranteeing that vendors will be paid, or a way to back those obligations with real assets – restricting their collective business operations and thus their overall purchasing power. “Let’s say I’m Russia and I want to sell jet fuel to the Star Alliance,” says Vicki Bryan of Gimme Credit, a debt research firm.“Who do I go after if Star doesn’t meet its obligation?” Alliances “are big franchises that don’t own any stores”, she adds.Mindful that merger restrictions may still be in place for another decade or two, executives believe their ventures will continue to evolve in ways their predecessors would have never thought possible.Star’s immunised venture is seeking ways to harmonise technology processes, from reservations to baggage handling, while also cutting costs through the joint purchase of in-flight entertainment systems, catering services and fuel.In what Glenn Tilton, United’s chief executive, describes as the “next iteration of the discussion”, Star is also exploring forming a special-purpose entity to help the venture build a capital structure of its own. Backed by members, this vehicle could open up even more possibilities for volume discounts.The ability for airlines to forge closer ties with partners has only come after hard-fought battles to secure immunity from antitrust rules. SkyTeam’s Air France, Czech Airlines and Delta Air Lines won such immunity in 2002. Star’s Lufthansa and United formed an immunised joint venture in 2003. They will add five others, including Continental Airlines, this year.BA and American Airlines sought immunity to form a venture of their own in 1997 and 2001, only to ditch both efforts once they deemed the cost – regulators’ insistence that they surrender take-off and landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport – too great. The carriers applied a third time last year and expect a decision by the end of October.Each venture could continue to add members as governments agree to liberalise routes to and from their international hubs. Partners are also inching their way towards a situation where one carrier generates as much revenue from selling a seat on an ally’s flight as they do their own. It is an easier goal to achieve when each partner has complementary route networks.“You want to stop worrying about which carrier a customer is on and say, ‘how do we get more business in total?’ ” says Larry Kellner, Continental’s chief executive.For those carriers left outside the various ventures and alliances, the future looks more uncertain, leading to questions as to whether they can continue to go it alone or accept the need to join an alliance themselves.“If they do succeed,” says Mr Branson with reference to his arch-rivals BA and American. “I suspect we’re going to need a big brother.”‘Their model is what we’re trying to achieve – they were pioneers’The 1989 leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines, a troubled US carrier, would lay the framework for a new era in international air travel.Twenty years after the buy-out, the joint venture that the Minnesota-based company eventually formed with one of its investors – the Dutch airline, KLM – remains the “template” against which all other airline partnerships are measured, says Tom Horton, chief financial officer at rival American Airlines.“Their model is what we’re trying to achieve over the next 18-24 months,” says Glen Hauenstein, an executive vice-president at Delta, now the world’s largest airline and a venture partner with Air France-KLM. “Northwest and KLM were the pioneers.”Yet the two airlines were not always viewed that way.By the late 1980s KLM had grander ambitions than its limited domestic travel market could meet, and it soon sought ways to work in partnership with its newfound American investment.Northwest was an also-ran airline, too. The carrier’s hub cities in Minneapolis and Detroit were less than ideal for international routes, especially when compared to the coastal strongholds of peers such as American and United Airlines.But in 1993, the US reached a landmark Open Skies accord with the Netherlands, removing restrictions that had limited their airlines’ access to each other’s airports. KLM and Northwest sought immunity from US antitrust laws, and by 1997 had formalised a joint venture.The two airlines would soon come as close to operating one transatlantic network as possible without actually merging. They shared revenue on routes, merged sales forces, honoured one another’s frequent-flyer miles, co-ordinated fares and standardised business-class seats.By the time Northwest was sold to Delta last year, the venture had created $4bn in additional revenue and established the carriers’ most profitable routes – such as Amsterdam to Minneapolis – according to a former Northwest executive.Their success has inspired many imitators.“When you look at something, and say, ‘Hey, this is working,’ it spurs competition,” says Larry Kellner, Continental’s chief executive. “It says, ‘Hey, we better get on board.’ You see everyone else look at the model.”"
396;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-08-09T14:58:01Z;Costs to aviation heading skyward;;The aviation industry is set to face additional costs of €1bn (£848m, $1.4bn) when it enters the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme in 2012, according to a new report.Airlines are likely to find out in the autumn how many carbon emissions allowances they will be allocated, and a study by analysts Point Carbon and RDC Aviation says the industry is likely to be allocated 210m tonnes of allowances for free when the European Commission makes its announcement. Airlines will have to buy 15 per cent of the allowances they need, or 77m tonnes.Andreas Arvanitakis, co-author of the report and a senior analyst at Point Carbon, forecasts the three EU-based airlines with the biggest shortfalls will be British Airways, at 3m tonnes, equivalent to €43m at current prices, Ryanair (2.8m tonnes) and EasyJet (1.8m tonnes). BA’s total is more than the total shortfall for all Spanish airlines.However, American carriers Delta (3.5m tonnes) and United (3.3m tonnes) will face the largest bill as the scheme will cover all flights that land or take off within the EU. Qantas and American Airlines come in with predicted shortfalls of 2.6m tonnes and 1.7m tonnes respectively.The low-cost carriers may see their liabilities rise because of their aggressive growth plans, which are likely to increase the shortfalls they face.“Emissions trading will increase cost pressure on airlines. They will look to pass on at least some of this cost to passengers,” says Mr Arvanitakis.The scheme will add an average of €8 to ticket prices, but that will range from €1-€2 for a Zurich to Amsterdam flight to about €20 for a flight from London to Singapore, according to Gary Critchlow, analyst at Ascend, an aviation consultancy.“It is not the industry destroyer that some people say,” said Mr Arvanitakis. “Other threats are more serious, such as the volatility of oil prices and the collapse in demand for business travel.”Nonetheless, says Simon Webber, fund manager of the Schroder Global Climate Change Fund: “The true cost of carbon emissions will have to be factored into the costs of air travel, which will act as a long-term constraint on air travel industry growth and profitability.“It will also increase pressure on airlines to invest in more efficient aircraft and engine technology, driving a faster replacement cycle, and competitive advantage for those airlines with a more fuel efficient fleet.”However, these moves are being complicated by production delays to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, one of the airlines’ main weapons in cutting emissions.“The 787, [the Airbus] 380 and [Airbus] 350, as the newest-generation airliners, are designed to reduce fuel consumption by some 10 per cent to 15 per cent over similar aircraft delivered in the 1990s. They use new alloys and sophisticated electronic controls that have given manufacturers new challenges and longer development times,” said Alessandro Bruno, aviation analyst at RiskMetrics.In the meantime, more piecemeal solutions are being deployed, such as winglets, wingtip devices to improve efficiency by reducing drag, which can cut fuel consumption by about 5 per cent, and changes to landing procedures.The ETS is also prompting changes in business model. Jet Republic, a business airline, claims to be 100 per cent carbon neutral through an offsetting scheme run by Climate Care.“We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations,” says Jonathan Breeze, chief executive of Jet Republic.Schroders’ Mr Webber believes that one of the big winners from the EU’s move will be entirely outside the aviation industry.“Strong growth in investment in video conferencing solutions is set to be one of the major consequences of pricing carbon into the cost of air travel,” he says, arguing that the sector has been one of the most resilient throughout the recession.“We have holdings in several equipment vendors, including Polycom, Tandberg ASA and Cisco Systems, all major suppliers of video conferencing equipment.”This time last year, legal action from airlines or even governments outside Europe, aimed at stopping aviation entering the ETS, looked a real possibility. However, any legal action would have been led by the US and that threat has now receded after the change of government and moves by the US to cut emissions, which will include aviation.Indeed the industry is worried it will face a melange of different schemes, with Australia, New Zealand, the US, Japan and South Korea all looking to join Europe in having some kind of ETS.The impact on the EU carbon market of aviation joining is expected to be marginal in the short term, says Mike Wilkins of Standard & Poor’s, partly because other sectors cannot buy aviation permits for compliance purposes.Demand from airlines is likely to push up the price, “but the price is too low at the moment, so it is not a problem,” adds Bruce Duguid, head of investor engagement at the Carbon Trust.However, there is another peculiarity to aviation. Because it is seen as a growth industry, it will have a static cap rather than contracting cap that other industries face. This means that, over time, it will become a more important component of the market.This may lead to calls from other industries for more stringent measures on aviation, Mr Duguid says. “You cannot have an industry whose need for permits is growing significantly against a backdrop of contracting caps. The idea is that every sector contributes to cutting emissions.”Another risk for the industry lies in the science. Aviation is being assessed on the basis of its carbon dioxide emissions, but aircraft emit other greenhouse gases and its emissions occur at high altitude, suggesting that their impact could be two to four times that of ground-based emissions. “If the science firms up, the industry could find itself one day having to buy two to four times the amount of allowances, which will have a significant impact,” adds Mr Duguid.The key to the industry’s long-term future is whether there is a breakthrough in biofuels. “If so, they [airlines] get off the hook but if not, there is a challenge for the industry and the ETS as a whole,” Mr Duguid concludes.
397;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-07-26T21:19:25Z;Flying far and wide on the back of airline loyalty;;Another day, another flight. As sales director for Rearden Commerce, a start-up in Foster City, California, Mike Lawrence flies 100,000 miles a year but admits that since the recession, his travel is under greater scrutiny. “Not so much on whether I need to go to a different city for a meeting, but making sure I opt for the lowest cost in all areas of travel – air, car, hotel, dining, parking. All of it matters now,” he says.Yet Mr Lawrence still makes sure he chooses the same airline when possible. “Frequent flyer programmes have always been very important in influencing my choice. With Alaska Airlines, my Gold status means I get automatic upgrade to first class in most cases, better seats if not, pre-boarding, double miles – even a complimentary cocktail even if I’m in the back.”If you are lucky enough to still be in a job with an employer willing to pay your airfare, there has never been a better time to be a frequent flyer as under-pressure airlines slash the miles required by their loyalty programmes for redeeming free flights or doubling the miles that count towards “elite” status.But there is also another reason: frequent flyer miles sit heavily on an airline’s balance sheet as liabilities, until they are redeemed. So, it is little wonder that carriers are giving away more frequent flyer seats than ever. At Delta, the world’s biggest airline, the number of miles earned by customers annually over the past three years has grown 25 per cent, says Jeff Robertson, the company’s vice-president of loyalty programmes.Mr Robertson is behind perhaps this summer’s biggest promotion. Until the end of this year, passengers can earn double frequent flyer miles for all Delta and Northwest flights and in all classes of service. Flyers must hold a Delta SkyMiles credit card to earn the bonus miles, but the tickets do not have to be charged to the card.Other airlines, including American, United, Qantas and Jet Airways have been offering a raft of new deals to members of their loyalty programmes.Is the tactic working? There is some evidence that travellers are using miles now because they are cash strapped – or because they expect troubled airlines to increase reward levels in the coming months.But in this recession, the real value to airlines of loyalty programmes lies in their ability to generate cash rather than loyalty. “Frequent flyer programmes no longer serve to drive brand loyalty alone, but rather to deliver extra cash, mostly through the sale of miles to card-issuing banks,” says Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive and now president of IdeaWorks, a consulting firm.At Delta alone, Mr Robertson says the SkyMiles and WorldPerks programmes are expected to generate more than $2bn (€1.4bn, £1.2bn) in revenue in 2009. United and Continental each raised cash last year from the advance sales of miles to their card partner, JPMorgan Chase.“Tough economic times have encouraged airlines to rely upon this kind of short-term gratification,” says Mr Sorensen, who reckons that when investor confidence returns some of the biggest airlines will try selling off their programmes.Until then, some carriers are trying to generate extra income from loyal customers through charges for priority treatment, such as faster security screening, upgrades and even the processing of miles award tickets.“The most enduring effect of the recession will be the nuisance fees now associated with the loyalty programmes” says Tim Winship, publisher of the FrequentFlier website. “The airlines are imposing them in a desperate attempt to shore up sagging revenues, and they won’t be rescinded in the foreseeable future.”“Frankly, with all the new fees and less capacity and fewer first class upgrades available every day, I’d just be happy to keep things where they are,” says Mike Lawrence, as he prepares for his next flight. “It’s a bit of a lame wish, but with everything happening in travel these days, I’d consider that to be a big step forward.”
398;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-07-22T18:05:57Z;Delta chief warns on ‘tough’ trading;;Delta Air Lines reported a quarterly net loss due to lacklustre demand for air travel, while rival AirTran Holdings swung to a profit on lower fuel costs.The two Atlanta-based companies’ results, which came after those of peers such as United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, highlighted the role of cost cuts as the industry’s best defence against its steep drop in revenue.Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, said on Wednesday during a conference call with analysts: “Over the last year the airline industry has faced its toughest environment since deregulation as the global recession and volatile oil prices have significantly impacted all airlines. This year has been – and will remain – challenging for the industry, as we do not see any meaningful recovery in 2009.”Carriers have shed thousands of jobs, flights and older aircraft to cope with a slowdown that shows few signs of abating. Delta’s capacity cuts, along with synergies realised through its 2008 merger with rival Northwest Airlines, have helped keep the company’s profit margins above many of its fellow network airlines.Nevertheless, the group reported a net loss of $257m, or 31 cents a share. Total revenue dropped 23 per cent to $7bn.Excluding merger-related costs, Delta would have lost 24 cents a share, less than the average analyst estimate.AirTran, which vies with Southwest as the prominent domestic airline with the lowest cost structure, reported net income of $78.4m, or 56 cents a share, in the second quarter.The company lost $14.8m, or 14 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue slipped 13 per cent to $603.7m. Operating expenses dropped 27 per cent, to $537.5m.Bob Fornaro, AirTran’s chief executive officer, told the Financial Times: “With our cost structure we can be profitable in this environment, and virtually nobody else can. We had a tough year last year and we’re on the path to recovery.”The carrier has reported record operating income of $113.9m in the first half of 2009.Shares in Delta, the world’s largest airline, climbed 0.7 per cent to $6.10 in midday trading, while AirTran increased 14 per cent to $6.58.
399;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American Airlines hit by continuing losses;;AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, reported a heavy second quarter loss for the second consecutive year, as sales came under pressure from weak demand and falling fares.Gerard Arpey, AMR chief executive, said on Wednesday revenues were down sharply from a year ago as a result of continuing weakness in the global economy.The price of fuel had also risen significantly since early this year and remained volatile.American, the second largest US carrier behind Delta Air Lines, said it had incurred a net second quarter loss, excluding non-recurring charges, of $319m compared to a loss on the same basis of $298m a year ago.The global airline industry is forecast to remain heavily in loss this year, as long-haul carriers in particular are hit by a big fall in demand from their most lucrative business travellers.Carriers worldwide are expected to make losses of $9bn this year according to Iata, the global airline trade association as a result of sharp falls in both revenues and yields (average fare levels).AMR’s reported a total net loss of $390m for the second quarter from April to June including one-off charges of $70m on the sale of some older aircraft and the grounding of some older leased Airbus A300s.The group reported a net loss of $1.5bn a year ago including one-off charges of $1.16bn for writedowns on the value of aircraft and for staff severance costs.For the first six months the total net loss, including one-off charges, fell from $1.8bn to $765m.Group revenues in the second quarter fell by 21 per cent to $4.89bn and in the first six months by 18 per cent to $9.7bn.American is among a rapidly growing group of leading global carriers that have been forced to raise additional capital to shore up shrinking cash resources.It has recently raised $520m through an issue of enhanced equipment trust certificates, debt collateralised against aircraft, and said it had raised $66m through an aircraft sale and leaseback transaction.It said it had committed financing in place to fund all 84 Boeing 737s due for delivery from 2009 to the end of 2011 to renew its short-haul fleet.It is cutting more capacity in response to the plunge in demand and is removing around 7.5 per cent of its capacity across the group for the whole of 2009 compared to last year.Mr Arpey said he was confident the group would receive antitrust approval from the US competition authorities by the end of October for its planned transatlantic joint venture with British Airways and Spain’s Iberia.Approval would allow the carriers to collude legally without fear of infringing cartel laws and jointly to arrange capacity, sales and marketing, to set fares and to share revenues across the North Atlantic. Rival allliances led respectively by Delta and Air France-KLM and by United Airlines and Lufthansa already have antitrust immunity from the US authorities although the cartel arrangements are under investigation by European competition authorities.
400;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-07-10T00:09:53Z;Australia’s Virgin Blue in deal with Delta;;Delta Air Linesand Virgin Blue are planning a joint venture in a bid to expand the reach of both carriers between the US, Australia and the south Pacific.The US airline and Australia’s second-largest carrier announced on Thursday they were seeking regulatory approval for the alliance. They said they had sought antitrust immunity in the meantime to implement code sharing, lounge exchange rights and frequent flyer programme reciprocity.Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice president for network and revenue management, said: “Together, Delta and the Virgin Blue Airlines Group will be a stronger and more effective competitor by offering consumers greater choice of destinations, frequencies and schedules, all on leading-edge aircraft.”Delta is the world’s largest airline by passenger numbers, carrying 121.5m people in 2008.Brett Godfrey, the chief executive and co-founder of Virgin Blue, which is 26 per cent-owned by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin group of companies, said the US carrier was a good fit. Virgin has been forced to reduce capacity, cut staff and delay the delivery of new aircraft due to the plunge in the demand for air travel caused by the economic downturn.The alliance of two new entrant operators, he said, would “ensure that vital competition is sustained on the trans-Pacific route”.Oversupply on the trans-Pacific route has resulted in a price war between the four operators: Qantas Airways, United Airlines, Delta and Virgin Blue.Analysts suggested that the new alliance would in effect reduce the number of carriers on the route to three, leading to significantly less aggressive pricing and better yields for the airlines.One analyst said: “While they [Delta and Virgin Blue] are not talking cuts in capacity they are clearly going to co-operate to get a better yield.”The past few months have seen a 30 per cent increase in capacity on the Pacific route while demand has fallen 10 per cent.Peter Harbison, analyst at the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, said it would take time for the deal to pass through the regulators.“The antitrust regulators are unlikely to agree to any rationalisation so the current price war won’t go away in the short term,” he said.Mr Harbison predicted that Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, would be the loser in the longer term if the alliance were approved.
401;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-07-09T20:39:29Z;Virgin America plans shake-up;;Virgin America, the carrier founded by Sir Richard Branson, is seeking US approval for a new slate of domestic investors it expects will end a rival’s bid to challenge the company’s ownership structure.Under the plan submitted to the Department of Transportation, the airline would receive new capital from a group of investors that includes Cyrus Capital Partners, people familiar with the matter said. Cyrus, a New York hedge fund, was one of Virgin America’s original shareholders.Virgin America began service in 2007 after a battle in Washington over rights to operate domestic flights and its ties to Sir Richard’s Virgin Group, which owns 24 per cent of the US airline.Alaska Airlines, which competes with Virgin America on routes to Seattle and other west coast cities, has questioned the carrier’s “US citizenship” and petitioned transport regulators in February to investigate its ownership structure. Federal laws cap foreign ownership of domestic airlines at 25 per cent.“This is a meritless petition,” Virgin America said at the time. “Nothing has changed in our ownership structure, which was approved by the DoT.“Should our ownership structure change in the future, we will of course notify the DoT in advance, so they can confirm our continuing compliance.”Alaska’s petition came as Black Canyon and Cyrus, Virgin America’s two US shareholders, exercised an option to recall their $150m investment in the company.Virgin America had hired Lazard, the investment bank, earlier in the year to recruit new domestic investors.The new round of capital may be less than $150m, reflecting the steep falls many US airline stocks have endured as demand slumped. Shares of Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest carrier, have lost half their value since the start of the year.People familiar with Virgin America’s structure note that its agreement with the DoT enabled it to keep Black Canyon and Cyrus as stakeholders and remain in compliance with foreign-ownership rules even if the two firms recalled their capital.Virgin Group plans to transfer the two firms’ stakes to its new US investor group once the structure plan is approved.By May, Virgin America was in talks with at least five US funds. Virgin America and Cyrus did not return calls.

403;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-07-06T20:03:47Z;Airline publicity ‘dogfight’ hides reality;;Ryanair has a strange obsession with comparing itself with British Airways.The Irish low-cost carrier has happily adopted BA’s former slogan: “The world’s favourite airline”. On Monday it combined use of the slogan with the claim “Ryanair: now twice the size of British Airways”. By some measures, the latter is true, by others it very much is not. It could just as well have said “Ryanair: quarter the size of British Airways”.Comparing the size of airlines is much like buying an airline ticket: you pay your money and you take your choice.“The World’s Favourite Airline” was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and first used by BA in 1983, as it was preparing for privatisation. It was always a questionable claim. For BA then, and for Ryanair now.BA based the claim on the fact it carried more international passengers than any other airline. That conveniently ignored the reality that several airlines, chiefly in the US, were much bigger than BA but derived the bulk of their passengers from their domestic market rather than from international routes.The fact that the domestic US market was a large part of a continent, compared with the domestic UK market which was confined to a collection of islands off the coast of mainland Europe, was also overlooked.It was as if an international passenger flying from London to Brussels (distance 319kms) was somehow worth more than a domestic passenger flying from New York to Los Angeles (3,933kms).BA’s descent down most league tables of airline size meant it had to abandon the slogan a decade ago. Ryanair is using the same questionable basis for its claim to have become “the world’s favourite airline”. In the latest annual statistics from the International Air Transport Association, Ryanair does top one table, namely for the highest number of international passengers in 2008 at 57.65m. It is just ahead of Air France-KLM at 56.32m and Lufthansa (including Swiss) at 54.87m.Add in domestic passengers, however, and the picture changes. Measured by total passenger numbers Ryanair falls to eighth behind Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines), Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, United Airlines and China Southern Airlines. BA ranked 17th.In the past 12 months Ryanair has become the biggest European short-haul carrier measured by passenger numbers. It is also one of the world’s fastest-growing airlines.In June Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 13 per cent year-on-year to 5.8m, setting a new monthly record. By contrast British Airways’ short-haul passenger numbers in June in the UK and the rest of Europe fell by 5.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.81m. Its total passenger numbers worldwide fell by 4.9 per cent to 2.9m.But the yardstick of passenger numbers, a Ryanair favourite, is less than perfect. It measures neither how far the passenger is carried and therefore the relative complexity of the operation, nor the revenue generated by the passenger.Ryanair operates only on point-to-point, short-haul routes. BA is a network carrier with a long-haul network spanning the globe.The more relevant and fairer yardsticks for BA are turnover and revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), which represents the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the distances they fly.In the year to the end of March BA had a turnover of £8.99bn, while Ryanair had a turnover in the same period of €2.94bn (£2.53bn), making the Irish carrier less than 30 per cent the size of BA.Both are dwarfed by the real giants of the industry. The top spot varies with exchange rate volatility but has Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines) at a pro-forma $34.2bn (£21bn) in 2008 vying with the Lufthansa group at €24.9bn.On the basis of passenger traffic, measured by revenue passenger kilometres, Delta was the pro-forma world leader in 2008 at 285bn (including Northwest), followed by American at 212bn and Air France-KLM at 209bn. On this measurement BA was eighth in the world at 115.7bn and Ryanair was back in 18th place at 62bn.If it is down to investors’ assessments, a third picture emerges.Based on market capitalisation, Singapore Airlines leads at $10.5bn, but Ryanair is in second place at $6.7bn as it performs robustly through the recession.It is the most valuable European airline ahead of Lufthansa at $5.6bn, and by this measure it certainly is “Now twice the size of British Airways”, which languishes at $2.4bn.

Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers.

But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders.

Fears over global demand knocked oil prices, which continued to fall from their highs.Shares in energy companies followed oil lower, with ConocoPhillipsfalling 5.9 per cent to $40.43 and Schlumberger giving up 5.5 per cent to $52.32.Copper prices also suffered after estimated Chinese copper consumption dropped 3.5 per cent for May compared to April, leading to concerns that the country might soon stop restocking the metal.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 11.3 per cent to $45.18. Prices of other metals also fell, bringing down shares in the companies that produce them. AK Steel gave up 13 per cent to $16.50 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, fell
8.9 per cent to $10.02.The general economic worries were exacerbated by a report from the World Bank that warned the global recession would be deeper than it had predicted in March, with the world economy suffering a 2.9 per cent decline in 2009.“The figure is surprisingly downbeat given the fact that it is even lower than what the International Monetary Fund is expecting,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Karl Mills, president of Jurika, Mills & Keifer, agreed, saying: “The economy is still sicker than people realise.”The S&P closed down 3.1 per cent at 893.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4 per cent to 8,339.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite index declined 3.4 per cent to 1,766.19 points.Investors bet that volatility would return to the markets after several weeks of trading within a narrow range.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked 11.4 per cent to 31.19.US investors were also nervous about the pace of the domestic recovery after Walgreen, the fast growing chain of chemists and general retailers, reported lower profits than Wall Street expected, despite rising sales. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to $29.64.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that recent signs on corporate earnings were not promising. “The profit outlook is becoming less certain given the recent trend in earnings reports and a more mixed economic outlook,” he wrote.Delta Air Lines dropped 6.9 per cent to $5.65 after Richard Anderson, the chief executive, said the company has absorbed a $250m hit to second-quarter revenue as a result of swine flu, and had been forced to cut capacity as a result.Shares in Apple fluctuated as optimism over sales of the new model of its iPhone competed with concerns over the health of Steve Jobs, its talismanic chief executive.The stock slipped in pre-market trade after reports at the weekend that Mr Jobs had undergone a liver transplant two months ago.But the shares rose after the company said it had sold more than 1m units of the new iPhone, compared to forecasts of closer to 500,000.The stock opened higher, but then dropped as the market extended its losses. It closed 1.5 per cent lower at $137.37.Bank of America lost 9.7 per cent to $11.94 after two more board members joined the list of departures from the company, bringing the total to seven since April.Its rival Citigroup dropped 5.4 per cent to $3, with analysts at Fox-Pitt saying that the bank’s planned conversion of preferred shares into common equity would put “significant pressure” on the stock.Credit card company Discover Financial Services avoided the worst of the selling in the financial sector following its announcement of a surprise quarterly profit last week.The figures caused analysts at RBC Capital Markets to raise their price target on the company on Monday, and the shares fell a modest 0.1 per cent to $9.31."

The shares fell 1.5 per cent to $11.97.But stocks in other sectors responded more positively to the plans, which analysts said could moderate the risk faced by many investors.“Reducing the risk investors face is a way of keeping Wall Street as a major financial competitive advantage for the US,” said David Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.Financial stocks performed especially well, with Bank of America gaining 4.9 per cent to $12.90 and JPMorgan picking up 4.4 per cent to $34.17.The sector was also boosted by data showing that leading economic indicators are improving faster than expected and that the deceleration in Philadelphia’s manufacturing industry had slowed dramatically. This helped financial stocks lift markets out of negative territory during the morning. “The markets are particularly sensitive to economic reports right now as people decide whether to send them higher or lower,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent up at 918.37 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,555.60. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped a fraction to 1,807.72, however.The travel sector was under the microscope as investors reacted to results from cruise line operator Carnival and bearish words from two global airlines.UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, said traffic in the second quarter was expected to fall as much as 10.5 per cent compared with a year ago. That knocked the shares 4 per cent down to $3.82.The negativity surrounding the sector was reinforced by Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, who said the airline industry was yet to feel the worst of the downturn.Other carriers also fell. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 4.4 per cent to $4.38 and Delta Air Lines dropped 3.2 per cent to $5.98.Shares in Carnival rose after the company said that lower costs helped its profits beat Wall Street’s estimates.The company has suffered a bruising early summer on fears that swine flu would stop people travelling, but managed to outstrip the market’s expectations, sending the shares up 7.5 per cent to $24.77.Meanwhile, JM Smucker, which makes jam, showed rare growth in the consumer sector after reporting rising profits. Sales rose, helped by its purchase of the Folgers coffee business, and the shares climbed 9.7 per cent to $47.86.In the financial sector, Discover Financial Services made a surprise profit for the quarter after a successful antitrust lawsuit against Visa and Mastercard helped cushion rising loan losses. The shares gained 4 per cent to $9.27.Sallie Mae, the student loan provider, rose 5.5 per cent to $8.11 on news that it was one of the companies to which the Department of Education awarded a contract to service its $550m loan portfolio.

ConocoPhillips lost 2.9 per cent to $43.10 while Schlumberger dropped 2.8 per cent to $58.59.Steelmakers, which were some of last week’s biggest beneficiaries, also dropped sharply. AK Steel gave up 8.1 per cent to $18.32 while US Steel declined 5.7 per cent to $37.10.Commodity producers were hampered by a strengthening dollar, which was boosted when the Russian finance minister said there was “no alternative” to the dollar as a reserve currency.Data showing that manufacturing in the New York area was falling much more than expected during June and that sentiment among homebuilders had dipped exacerbated the falls.These factors added to cautious words over the weekend from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, who warned that discussions about “exit strategies” from stimulus plans might be premature.Mr Strauss-Kahn said: “We haven’t exited the crisis yet.”Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Things are so weak we would expect them to continue to improve for quite a few months, but in some cases the improvement is petering out already, which is quite disappointing.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.4 per cent down at 923.72 points.

Consumer stocks also suffered. Wal-Mart fell 2.8 per cent to $48.46, hurt by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said sales growth at the retailer would begin to fall.Although Goldman said investors could move into more discretionary stocks as the recovery continues, others warned that the consumer sector would continue to suffer.“People are starting to realise that even when the economy recovers, certain sectors such as consumer spending are going to remain under pressure,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “This is a realisation stage for the markets.”There were negative signs on the amount of loan losses that financial companies still face. Capital One, the credit card lender, said the number of card defaults had risen in May compared with April. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.40.Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, warned that Bank of America was experiencing “horrific” loan losses. BofA shares fell 2.8 per cent to $13.33. Also in the sector, shares in Lincoln National dropped after the company became the second large insurer, after Hartford Financial, to say it would take government bail-out money and raise further capital by issuing shares.The company said it would sell up to $900m of new stock, and its shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $15.83 on fears of dilution.Housebuilders were some of the day’s biggest fallers after the homebuilder confidence figures. Centex sank 3 per cent to $8.23 while KB Home, which also suffered a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, dropped 6 per cent to $13.24. There was further bad news for the airline industry after executives at European aircraft maker Airbus warned that output at its European factories could fall by as much as a quarter over the next two years.Shares in Airbus’s US rival Boeing fell 3.7 per cent to $49.52 but shares in other major airlines were worse affected, as research suggested business class flights on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines had halved in price.Delta lost 4.7 per cent to $6.10, while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, gave up 2.6 per cent to $4.43.

The tally marks a 1.4 per cent decline from last year’s 29,400 forecast, although inflation would help keep the dollar value of those deliveries at $3,200bn, the company said on Thursday.“While the commercial-aviation industry is facing a significant downturn, it is cyclic and has a long history of declines and upturns,” Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, stated. “Over the past 30 years, through both tough and good times, traffic growth has averaged more than 5 per cent per year.”In its latest outlook, Boeing predicted that airline traffic would rise by 4.9 per cent a year, with the world’s gross domestic product expanding at 3.1 per cent.Even so, Boeing’s analysis was released on the same day that some of the world’s largest carriers, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, stepped up plans to slash their flight schedules this year.The downturn forced many business and leisure passengers to postpone or cancel travel plans. And fuel prices, which peaked last summer, are rallying again, putting further pressure on airlines already facing limited access to fresh capital.“We are not sugar-coating the magnitude of what we, along with every other airline, are up against today in this economic climate,” Gerard Arpey, American’s chief executive, said on Thursday.Boeing noted that demand for new aircraft “remains strong,” as airlines seek to replace ageing fleets with more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly aeroplanes. American also announced plans to take delivery of eight additional Boeing 737-800s. The carrier plans to receive 76 737s by the end of 2010.Two-thirds of the deliveries made between 2009 and 2028 will be for narrow-body aircraft, driven by orders for a new generation of planes considered the workhorse for domestic and regional air travel throughout Europe, North America and Asia.Boeing’s shares fell 3.1 per cent to $50.66 on Thursday in trading in New York.

But flights on Delta’s six African routes have remained crowded, with more than 80 per cent of available seats filled, and fares have held up better than most international destinations.“It has far exceeded our expectations in potential profits for us,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice-president for network planning & revenue management.The US government’s decision left some Kenyan officials, who expect the new service will help Nairobi in its push to become an economic hub to sub-Saharan Africa, stunned and disappointed.“All the requests of security measures were put forth, and we fulfilled every step of the requirements,” said Najib Balala, the country’s minister of tourism.Mr Balala dismissed links between the abrupt TSA order and the November travel warning, which he called “procedural and standard”, noting that the US remain Kenya’s second-biggest tourism market.Neither Kenya officials nor Delta executives were sure when the US would lift the ban.Delta offers passengers six African destinations in five countries: nonstop flights to Accra, Cairo, Johannesburg, Lagos and Dakar; and an indirect route to Cape Town, via Dakar. The airline also aims to begin services to Luanda, Angola, and Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, in September."

Air France said it had been able to cut its losses by reducing staff costs.Furthermore, the carrier said it would jointly operate, transatlantic routes with US airline Delta sharing revenues and costs for at least 10 years. Based on 2008-2009 data, annual revenues from the joint venture are estimated at $12bn, the companies said. Air France-KLM jumped to the top of the Paris bourse, rising 11 per cent to €11.30.The wider sector was buoyed by JPMorgan ­naming European airlines “particularly attractive”.The broker said Lufthansa and Air France were particular “buying opportunities”.“Airlines are the crown jewels of industrials,” said JPMorgan.“Although we do believe that a fundamental recovery of the airline industry is still months away, current data are already starting to show a sequential improvement.” Lufthansaadded 3.9 per cent to €9.88.Goldman Sachs raised ­Iberia, the Spanish airline planning to merge with ­British Airways, to “buy” from “sell” and added the group to its “conviction buy” list. “It remains a strategically valuable franchise, with a high market share in Latin America, a growing region,” said the broker. Iberia rose 5.7 per cent to €1.66.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.4 per cent to a fresh 19-week high of 875.85. Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax rose 1.6 per cent to 5,038.94; and the Paris CAC 40 added 0.9 per cent to 3,303.37. Volumes across the region were low, ahead of national holidays on Thursday.Having been closed the previous day due to a local holiday, Turkey’s Istanbul stock exchange rose 4.4 per cent to 35,139.70 – its highest level this year. The ISE was led by Garanti bank, the most traded stock, which rose 9 per cent to TL3.86.Elsewhere, most banks continued to rise steadily.Bank of Ireland added to the previous session’s 22 per cent rise, following an increase in its capital ratios, to climb a further 15 per cent to €1.53.Despite the chief of French bank Société Générale saying the overall banking sector, including SocGen, was likely to produce lower profits in future as a result of the financial crisis, the stock rose 1.2 per cent to €38.80. Peer BNP Paribas, however, fell 3 per cent to €45 and Germany’s Commerzbank fell 0.6 per cent to €5.84.Oil and gas stocks were among the best performing. Nomura initiated coverage of “European integrated oil” with a “neutral” recommendation, citing “expectation that oil prices will rise faster than inflation over the next two years”.The broker rated Eni, the Italian group, and Total, as “reduce” and Statoil as a “buy”. Eni, nevertheless, rose 2.7 per cent to €17.14, the heavily-weighted Total added 0.8 per cent to €41.20, while Statoil lost 4.4 per cent to NKr131.50.Defensive stocks, such as food and pharmaceuticals, sustained sharp losses in the morning, but some recovered, benefiting from investor rotation.Danone rose 0.9 per cent to €39.73, Germany’s Suedzucker fell 1.7 per cent to €14.31 and drinks group Pernod Ricard fell 0.1 per cent to €46.22.Novartis, the Swiss ­drugmaker, rose 0.5 per cent to SFr44.52 after it said it was buying the generic ­cancer treatment activities of Austria’s Ebewe Pharma for €925m.Germany’s Merck rose 2.7 per cent to €65.46 and Rochefell 0.3 per cent to SFr145.00.France’s Sanofi-Aventis, meanwhile, rose 1.6 per cent to €45.06."
411;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Branson hits out at BA/AA tie-up;;Sir Richard Branson warned on Thursday that British Airways’ planned transcontinental venture with American Airlines could imperil Virgin Atlantic Airways, the carrier he founded 25 years ago, if it wins approval from US regulators.In his most searing critique yet of his rivals’ proposal, Sir Richard said the venture would grant these rivals a dominant share of key take-off and landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport, the world’s most important international gateway, weakening their competitors and leading to higher fares and fewer transatlantic flights.“I cannot guarantee VA’s survival,” Sir Richard said during a speech in Washington. “It will be like competing with our hands tied behind our back.”BA, American and several other peers are seeking immunity from US anti-trust rules that would hinder their ability to share revenue and coordinate schedules and fares. Virgin has filed to contest the application, and plans to make its final submissions to the US Department of Transportation by Monday.BA and American launched earlier attempts to co-ordinate their activities in 1997 and 2001, but regulators required them to divest a large number of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, a price they deemed too high. The companies now argue that the competitive landscape has changed since the landmark ”open skies” accord opened Heathrow to more airlines.Besides, they point out, most of their biggest transcontinental competitors, from Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines to Lufthansa and United Airlines, already enjoy immunised ventures.“Our application is good news for customers,” American said in a statement. “They will gain greater access to discounted fares, smoother connections and more frequent flyer benefits and ultimately more travel choices.”Sir Richard disagreed, noting that Heathrow remains too congested to open slots to new competition.While Virgin Atlantic sought to derail its rivals’ venture, its sister company, Virgin America, awaits word from US transport officials on its future.Alaska Airlines questioned the carrier’s ”US citizenship” and petitioned regulators in February to open an inquiry into its ownership structure. Federal laws cap foreign holdings of domestic airlines at no more than 25 per cent.Earlier this year two US hedge funds, Virgin America’s majority owners, exercised an option to recall their $150m - leaving Virgin Group, which owns a 24 per cent stake, as Virgin America’s sole shareholder, people familiar with the matter said.Virgin America is in talks with at least five US investors and expects to find replacements for the two funds, Black Canyon and Cyrus Capital Partners, within the next two months, the people said.
412;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-05-10T22:30:55Z;In-house fraud cases surge;;Fraud committed against companies by their own employees has surged this year, new data suggest, providing fresh evidence that the recession is fuelling a rise in crime.Whistleblower hotlines operated by The Network, a US group that provides compliance services to some of the world’s biggest companies – including Aviva, the UK insurer, Cisco and Yahoo, the US tech companies, and Delta, the US airline – have received a deluge of tip-offs about fraud in recent months.Reports of fraudulent activity including theft, corruption and insider trading made up 21 per cent of all calls to the hotline in the first quarter, compared with 16.5 per cent last year and just 11 per cent three years ago.Tip-offs about other types of compliance issues, such as sexual harassment or safety breaches, had remained flat or fallen, but fraud had been “gaining speed and momentum”, said Luis Ramos, chief executive of The Network.The data, drawn from all levels of management, provide a snapshot of the extent of fraud across the corporate world. They come in the wake of dozens of investment scams, including Bernard Madoff’s $50bn Ponzi scheme.The findings mirror a trend in recession-struck countries, in which crimes such as shoplifting and robbery are on the rise. A UK government document leaked last year forecast that theft and violence would increase sharply as the economy contracted.The retail and financial services sectors were suffering particularly badly from fraud, Mr Ramos said, but no industry was immune. Mr Ramos said more of his clients were introducing schemes to encourage whistleblowers, even giving cash rewards for successful tip-offs.He conceded that increased awareness of the hotlines, coupled with a greater willingness among workers to blow the whistle on colleagues, was part of the reason for the rise. “Employees … are sensitive to the fact that their companies are in precarious situations and if they don’t help the company safeguard its assets, then they may find themselves out of a job as well.”The Network’s findings tally with a survey released last month by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the biggest anti-fraud body. In a survey of 507 fraud examiners, more than half had seen a rise in fraud in the past year. Almost 90 per cent expected a rise in scams and schemes in the coming months.Employee embezzlement was the most commonly cited type of crime, the survey found. “In this economy, employees have seen a surge of incentives and opportunities to defraud their employers, and an increased number have reportedly yielded to temptation,” the ACFE said.US organisations lost on average 7 per cent of their revenue to fraud last year – a total of $994bn – according to the ACFE.Occupational fraud will become even more common, Mr Ramos said, if the downturn leads to more job cuts and pay reductions, which add to worker anxiety and damage company loyalty. “The wildcard is what happens to the economy,” he said. “If the crisis deepens, we’re going to see even more fraud than we’ve seen already.”
413;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-05-07T19:52:19Z;Raw materials rises fuel hedging;;"The sharp rise in commodity prices in recent weeks is spurring unnerved corporate consumers to hedge their exposure to raw materials and rebuild depleted inventories.As commodities prices rose to their highest level in six months on Thursday, traders said there were signs of widespread activity among consumers – airlines hedging their exposure to rising oil prices, car manufactures buying cheap aluminium, and food companies securing supplies.Investors betting on a quick recovery boosted prices. “Consumers are getting more active,” said Kevin Norrish, a commodities analyst at Barclays Capital in London. “Inventories are low and the prospects in some industries have improved recently.”The head of metals trading at a bank in London said: “Consumers are being dragged to hedge, even if their demand is not strong, because they are afraid of the rapid price increase in some markets.”Bankers pointed to hedge examples such as Delta, the world’s largest airline, which has boosted its fuel hedge to 75 per cent of this year’s needs, from less than a third late last year.Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, two of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, last week secured a hefty position in the sugar market, pushing prices higher, to supply India, the world’s largest consumer.The surge in oil, metals, agricultural and soft commodities prices pushed the spot S&P GSCI commodity index, a basket of raw materials, above 400 points, the highest level since mid-November, 32 per cent higher than in late December.Oil has led the jump, with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate rising to an intraday high of $58.57 a barrel, well above February’s low of $32.7 a barrel, and the highest in six months. But the rally is widespread. In metals, copper is near a six-month high; in soft commodities, sugar has hit a 2¾-year peak; and in agriculture, soyabean prices have rallied 22 per cent this year.Jennie Byun, an analyst at JPMorgan in London, said economic “green shoots” seemed to be a reality. “This positive sentiment, combined with supply adjustments, US dollar weakness and inflation concerns over the long term, has played a key role in bidding up commodity prices,” he said.But in spite of commodities’ recent strength, prices are still low compared with their mid-2008 levels, when the S&P GSCI index hit an all-time high of almost 900 points. No analyst predicts a return to those levels.Traders also warned that the price recovery appeared fragile and demand outside China and some other Asian countries was still weak.Investors are betting that a quicker-than-expected recovery in global growth will support commodities demand, just when supplies could be lower because oil groups, miners and farmers have cut investment.Kurt Nelson, managing director of commodity indices at UBS in New York, said: “We have seen a pick-up in investors interest across commodities.”"

In addition, management proposals regarding executive compensation and the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC as the company’s independent accounting firm were approved.Seven shareholder proposals were not approved. An eighth shareholder proposal to change the company’s by-laws to require an independent chairman was narrowly approved. (For results see the table below).At a meeting of the Board of Directors today, after a recommendation from the Governance Committee, Dr. Walter E. Massey was elected chairman. Kenneth D. Lewis will be president and chief executive officer. The board unanimously expressed its support for Lewis to continue in that role.Massey is president emeritus at Morehouse College in Atlanta. He served as president of Morehouse from August 1995 to June 2007. He has been a director of the board since 1998 and is a member of the board’s Audit Committee. He was a director of BankAmerica Corporation from 1993 to 1998 and currently also serves as a director of McDonald’s Corporation. Massey formerly was also a director of Delta Airlines, Motorola, BP PLC.Prior to Morehouse, Massey held a range of administrative and academic positions. He is former director of the National Science Foundation, a position to which he was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush. The Foundation is the government’s lead agency for support of research and education in mathematics, science and engineering. Massey also served as vice president for research and professor of physics at the University of Chicago, as director of the Argonne National Laboratory, dean of the College and professor of physics at Brown University and as assistant professor of physics at the University of Illinois.Immediately prior to Morehouse, Massey was provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at the University of California. In this position, the second most senior position in the UC system, he was responsible for academic and research planning and policy, budget planning and allocations, and programmatic oversight of the three national laboratories the University manages for the Department of Energy: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.After earning a bachelor of science in physics and mathematics in 1958 from Morehouse, Massey received his master’s and doctorate in physics in 1966 from Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. Massey’s research has involved the study of quantum liquids and solids. His written work has also addressed science and math education, the role of science in a democratic society, and university-industry interactions and technology transfer in national and international settings.Active with a range of organizations, Massey is a past chair of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) and was a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. The recipient of more than 30 honorary degrees from institutions such as Yale University, Northwestern University, Amherst and the Ohio State University, Massey’s leadership in education includes his service as a member of the Gates Millennium Scholars Advisory Council and the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century.He is a fellow and past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a fellow and past vice president of the American Physical Society, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the Council on Foreign Relations.Born in Hattiesburg, Miss., he and his wife, Shirley Anne, have two sons and three grandchildren.During the meeting, Lewis said the company’s long-term vision for profitable growth is being advanced by the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch & Co. and Countrywide Financial Corp. despite the challenging economic environment.”We are building this company and managing for the long term,” Lewis told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting today. ”I continue to believe we have built the best financial company in the industry, and that our results over the long term will bear that out.”Let me acknowledge that 2008 was a very difficult year for the economy, for the financial services industry and for our company in particular,” Lewis said. ”Our company’s shareholders have carried a heavy burden recently. We are doing everything within our power every day to fight through today’s adversity and drive toward tomorrow’s promise.”Merrill will help the company move toward its goal of developing stronger, deeper and more profitable customer relationships over the long term through its leading positions in capital markets and wealth management,” Lewis said. ”Countrywide helped Bank of America gain a high-quality franchise and customer base along with significant market share in mortgages - a cornerstone financial product,” he added.”My strong feeling is that organizational integration - and a renewed focus on organic growth - will be the almost exclusive focus of our efforts in the coming years,” Lewis said.Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price told shareholders the company’s core strengths in its business become more evident in challenging economic times.”Our broad customer and client reach and geographic diversity form a powerful engine for revenue generation and earnings,” Price said. ”Our business diversity is equally important, providing balance as some businesses perform well while others are confronted with challenges.”With the earnings power added from recent acquisitions including Countrywide, Merrill, LaSalle Bank and MBNA, along with the cost savings opportunities, Price said although he can’t predict future results, he believes the company has the potential to produce approximately $30 billion in annual net income under more normal economic conditions.”As demonstrated by our history of revenue and earnings, and despite today’s challenges, the model we have built is working, and we expect it to be even more powerful in the future,” Price said.
415;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-28T16:45:24Z;Governments step up pig flu response;;Governments in Europe and Asia stepped up their response to the outbreak of deadly swine flu in the Americas as Spain confirmed it had diagnosed a case and investors sold off travel stocks.The World Health Organisation brought forward an emergency meeting to Monday to decide whether to raise its alert level in response to the outbreak which has killed 103 people in Mexico and spread to North America.Asian governments, scarred by their recent bird flu and Sars epidemics, responded aggressively by screening arriving air passengers for high temperatures. Russia announced similar moves. European Union health ministers are to gather for an emergency meeting on Thursday.The EU’s health commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, said later: ”Personally, I would try to avoid non essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the centre of the clusters in order to minimise the personal risk and to reduce the potential risk to spread the infection to other people.”Her staff were keen to point out however that her statements did not apply to Spain, which was confirmed on Monday as the first EU member to have diagnosed a case.But his condition, like that of 20 cases identified in the United States – where Janet Napolitano, US homeland security secretary, on Sunday declared a “public health emergency” – and six in Canada, was not serious. A New Zealand teacher and around a dozen students who recently returned from Mexico were also being treated as likely mild swine flu cases.”No one should lull themselves into thinking that everything is just fine because it’s a relatively mild disease,” Canada’s chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, told a press conference. ”It doesn’t mean we won’t see either more severe illness or more potential deaths.”Government health agencies have stockpiled 55 million doses of anti-viral drugs and are working to acquire more in the event of a large-scale vaccination campaign.The UK government sought to reassure consumers that swine flu did not pose a threat to meat-eaters, in the hope of heading off any consumer backlash against eating pork.Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer, said: “Swine influenza cannot be transmitted by eating pork products. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is perfectly safe.” He added that existing European Union rules against importing live pigs and pigmeat from Mexico would remain in force.Investors reacted on Monday by selling off shares in airlines and tour operators. Wall Street indices fell losses in line with patterns already established in Asia and Europe.Shares in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 16 per cent in New York, while Delta Air Lines gave up 17 per cent. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 6.7 per cent.Air France-KLM fell by almost 8 per cent and Germany’s flag carrier, Lufthansa, was down by more than 12 per cent.British Airways was the biggest single faller on London’s FTSE 100 shares in the flag carrier, down 8.7 per cent.“This has put a dent in the three-month recovery for BA,” said David Jones, chief market strategist, at IG Index. “But there are early signs that some traders are viewing the initial sell-off as being somewhat overdone and a knee-jerk overreaction to the weekend’s news.”Cruise operator Carnival was down by more than 7 per cent and tour operators Thomas Cook and Tui Travel lost about 6 per cent. Shares in InterContinental Hotels were 5 per cent weaker.However, Roche, the Swiss drugs company behind the Tamiflu and Relenza anti-flu drugs, made strong gains. It said it was able quickly to ramp up production of its antiviral drug Tamiflu. Its shares rose by about 4 per cent but were also helped by the general defensive nature of pharmaceutical stocks during turbulence on equities markets.Overall, equities indices were lower by about 2 per cent in Europe, after a strong end to the previous trading week prompted investors to take profits. Asian markets slipped back by similar margins.On currency markets, the haven properties of the Japanese yen and the US dollar kept them in demand. The Mexican peso fell by about 2 per cent against the dollar as the death toll from swine flu in the country reached 103.Analysts also said traders were unwinding positions in the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar after news at least one person in New Zealand was being treated for flu-like symptoms.“Swine flu is centre stage,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, head of forex strategy Japan at Royal Bank of Scotland. “The Aussie and the kiwi [dollars] are hit hard. There is a general risk aversion with concern about the possible spread to other countries.”Risk-aversion spread to commodites markets, where crude oil prices dropped by more than $2 a barrel. Gold held above the $900 level, trading at $911.10 a troy ounce.Michael Hunter and Fiona Harvey in London, Chris Mason in Ottawa, Gerrit Wiesmann in Frankfurt and Stanley Pignal in Brussels
416;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-27T21:38:33Z;Markets suffer side effects of outbreak;;World equity markets were rocked on Monday after the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico sparked fears of a global pandemic.Airline, travel and tourism stocks were the biggest fallers amid concerns that a flu pandemic could scupper hopes of economic recovery.It threatened to take the shine off the market’s seven-week rally, although the main indices recouped losses later in the day.The FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per cent, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 finished up 0.4 per cent and the S&P 500 closed up 1.01 per cent.The Mexican markets retreated sharply. The Mexican peso dropped 5.14 per cent against the US dollar, its steepest daily fall since November, at one point plumbing a three-week low.In contrast, rising risk aversion boosted the dollar, the yen and government bond prices as investors fled to the safest assets. Pharmaceuticals stocks were also boosted.The big fallers among airline, travel and tourism stocks included Germany’s Lufthansa, down 9.2 per cent, Air France-KLM Group, down 6.6 per cent, Marriott, the hotel chain, down 5.07 per cent, Expedia, the online travel agency, down 6.32 per cent, and Carnival, the cruise ship operator, down 13.51 per cent.US airline stocks suffered especially, with Delta Air Lines, the world’s biggest carrier, falling 14.34 per cent. American Airlines gave up 13.28 per cent and Continental Airlines fell 16.38 per cent, while United Airlines dropped by 14.33 per cent.“The last thing US airlines can withstand these days is another negative hit to demand,” Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, said during a conference call with clients.The deepening recession has already prompted many leisure and business travellers to postpone or cancel scheduled trips this year. Airlines have countered with sharp cuts to their flight schedules.Shares in Smithfield and Tyson, the leading US meat producers, both fell heavily on concerns their pork businesses would be affected.In contrast, pharmaceuticals stocks rose. Roche, which distributes Tamiflu, the frontline defence against the infection, gained 3.5 per cent, and Gilead, the US biotech company that developed the drug and gains a royalty on sales, rose 3.78 per cent.GlaxoSmithKline, which produces both Relenza, another antiviral drug, and flu vaccines, was up 7.57 per cent. AstraZeneca also rose 3.72 per cent, reflecting the relative defensiveness of pharmaceuticals at a time of uncertainty.Although governments on Monday called for calm and the World Health Organisation had held back during the day from advising people against travel, analysts predicted fear of a pandemic could set back any economic recovery.Sir David King, the UK’s former chief scientist and now chief scientific adviser to UBS, the Swiss bank, told investors in a conference call “the response of the population is often ahead of governments, with parents taking children out of school”.In a research note, ING warned that a pandemic would hurt second-quarter economic performance globally. “Markets should accept this is an additional risk factor in the immediate term that could undermine the nascent recovery in output,” it said.Reporting by Andrew Jack, David Oakley and Jenny Wiggins in London and Justin Baer and Jonathan Birchall in New York
417;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
418;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-21T23:22:42Z;Relief at lower losses at Delta and United;;"Delta Air Lines and United Airlines reported smaller-than-expected quarterly losses on Tuesday, as cuts to flight schedules and lower jet fuel prices helped them endure a steep drop in demand for air travel.Both US airlines’ shares surged following their reports, as many relieved investors bet that the industry had muddled through the worst of the downturn.By close, Delta shares had climbed 19 per cent to $8.11; United was up almost 13 per cent at $6.63.“We’ve seen some signs of stabilisation, as the revenue environments appear to have bottomed out,” Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts.“But it’s still a bit early to call, and we expect to face significant headwinds throughout 2009.”Delta reported a net loss of $794m, or 96 cents a share. Excluding certain costs, the Atlanta-based carrier lost 84 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.01. When losses on fuel hedges were also removed, the company broke even.Delta merged with its rival Northwest Airlines in October, and Tuesday’s quarterly announcement was the first to include a full three months of combined results.Total operating revenue fell 15 per cent to $6.7bn as demand fell.Delta slashed its capacity by 6.4 per cent, and realised $100m in cost benefits from the merger. First-quarter operating costs, excluding goodwill charges, plunged by more than $1bn due to lower fuel prices.The company unveiled plans to charge some customers a $50 fee to check a second bag on international flights, starting on Tuesday, and retire 14 Boeing 747-200 freighter aircraft by the end of the year.Delta’s operations generated about $600m in operating cash flow during the period, and ended March with $4.5bn in cash and short-term investments. The carrier also had access to another $500m from an undrawn credit line.The company plans to cut as much as 8 per cent of its flight schedule this year.United’s net loss fell to $382m, or $2.64 a share, from $549m, or $4.55, a year ago.Excluding gains on fuel hedges, the Chicago-based airline’s per-share $4 loss beat Wall Street’s $4.37 average estimate.Operating revenue fell by 22 per cent to $3.69bn, while operating expenses fell 23 per cent to $3.97bn.United raised almost $500m during the period by financing deals backed by aircraft and engines, and from payments it received from airports in Chicago and Los Angeles.The carrier had $2.7bn in cash, of which $2.5bn is unrestricted. Its operations produced $426m in operating cash flow.United Technologies, an industrial conglomerate, also reported quarterly results that exceeded analysts’ expectations.Net income slipped 28 per cent to $722m, or 78 cents a share, as revenue fell 12 per cent. The company reiterated its forecasts for 2009 earnings, while noting that cost-cutting measures would help profit resume next year."
419;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-21T19:19:16Z;Competition watchdogs probe airline alliances;;Competition authorities on both sides of the North Atlantic are struggling to respond to the growing efforts by some of the biggest airlines in Europe and the US to deepen their transatlantic cooperation.The decision this week by the European Commission to launch two formal antitrust proceedings against planned airline deals among core carriers in the Star and Oneworld alliances, respectively, highlights the confusion and the very different approaches being taken by US and European Union competition agencies.It also underlines the competitive disadvantages faced by the leading Oneworld carriers British Airways and American Airlines along with Spain’s Iberia, which have fallen behind their rivals in the Star and SkyTeam alliances in winning antitrust immunity (ATI) from the US authorities.Airlines have been hampered for decades by the arcane web of international aviation regulations agreed in the 1940s, even before the advent of the jet age, which has effectively blocked global consolidation and mergers and acquisitions in the aviation industry.Instead, in the late 1990s the airlines began to take the second best route of forming global marketing alliances, which have matured into the three groupings of Oneworld, led by BA, American, Qantas and Cathay Pacific, Star, led by Lufthansa, United Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Singapore Airlines, and SkyTeam formed around the core members Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and Korean Air.The alliances are aimed at allowing airlines to enhance their networks well beyond their own resources by offering customers “seamless travel” among members supported by code sharing deals, common frequent flier programmes and reciprocal access to business lounges.They also increasingly cooperate in common IT systems and some common purchasing airmed at cutting costs.Inevitably, the halfway house solution of the alliances has not been enough for some of the biggest airlines, however, which in addition have sought antitrust immunity from the US competition authorities for joint ventures across the North Atlantic.ATI allows them to collude legally on key sensitive issues such as setting fares, agreeing networks and capacity, sharing profits and revenues and selling and marketing jointly to corporate customers.The airlines argue they can improve their service offerings, while also cutting costs and improving profitability.The processes for securing approval for transatlantic cooperation deals, which include most features of a joint venture short of common equity stakes, are very different in the US and the EU.In the US, carriers must first apply and be granted permission to collude in joint ventures, before they can start operations.In Europe, they inform the authorities of their intentions, but they can start operations at once - at their own risk.If they are challenged, investigated and are found to be in breach of European competition law, and they fail to give subsequent undertakings that satisfy the Commission, they can be fined and face prohibition.EU investigations can take years to resolve.The most striking contrast between EU and US processes concerns the fourway antitrust immunity granted by the US last year to the core SkyTeam carriers Air France-KLM (including both French and Dutch operations) and Delta Air Lines (including both Delta and Northwest Airlines operations).The joint venture, in which Air France-KLM and Delta (including Northwest) share profits and revenues and jointly plan sales, networks and capacity, has a turnover of $12bn and accounts for about 30 per cent of the North Atlantic market.It began the first stage of its operations last year. The joint venture accounts for approximately 17 per cent of the turnover of the two airlines.While the venture has ATI approval from Washington and is up and running, it is still under investigation by Brussels.The Commission first issued a statement of objections against the SkyTeam cooperation plans on some routes in June 2006.More than a year later the airlines offered concessions by offering to make some take-off and landing slots available to new competitiors at appropriate EU airports, but the response was deemed to be insufficient by Brussels.A spokesman for the competition authorities said the SkyTeam airlines were operating the joint venture “at their own peril. We could find them in breach and fine them.”Similarly, Washington and Brussels are at different stages in reviewing the plans of the core Star carriers to deepen their alliance.This month the US transportation department gave its tentative approval to Continental Airlines’ application for ATI for its planned joint venture with Lufthansa, United Airlines and Air Canada, to be called Atlantic Plus-Plus. The carriers want to jointly arrange capacity and sales and marketing, as well as to share revenues.This week, by contrast, Brussels has just launched an investigation into the very same plan, expressing similar competition concerns as those previously fired by its long-running probe into the SkyTeam carriers.Meanwhile, the Oneworld carriers BA, American and Iberia, which announced last year a proposed transatlantic joint business agreement, are barely out of the starting blocks.BA says the deal would “give consumers more choice with a wider network, access to cheaper fares, better connections and more frequent flyer rewards.They have made many filings to the US authorities, but the transportation department has yet to say the file is complete, so it can start the clock ticking on a formal six month investigation.This week, the European Commission added to the challenge facing the carriers by launching its own investigation to assess whether the joint activities “may lead to restrictions of competition on certain transatlantic routes.”Meanwhile, in the US, wider opposition to the transatlantic airline alliances is growing in Congress, led by James Oberstar, chairman of the powerful House transportation and infrastructure committee.“Whenever antitrust immunity is granted, the airlines, protected from the antitrust laws, stop competing in highly travelled international markets,” he said last month.“The AmericanAirlines/British Airways-led immunized alliance will control the US-UK market, while the Air France/Delta and the United/Lufthansa/Continental led immunized alliances will have a stranglehold on traffic to continental Europe.“There would be no incentive for these alliances to compete with each other, and major entry barriers at the most important airports would make it extremely difficult for non-alliance carriers to seriously challenge the alliances,” he said. “The decline in the number of competitors will affect fares as well as service.”According to Mr Oberstar, “you cannot afford to be complacent about the threat to competition posed by immunized airline alliances. As the evidence indicates, these immunized alliances hold great market power and have the potential for exercising that power to the exclusion of nonimmunized carriers, thereby reducing competition in the international marketplace, as well as disrupting domestic competition.”He says combined, the Star, SkyTeam and Oneworld alliances account for almost 80 per cent of the total world airline capacity, 78 per cent of world revenue passenger kilometres and 73 per cent of passengers carried.The three alliances control over 87 per cent of the traffic between the US and Europe.He is concerned about the extent of the market domination by the three alliances on key routes.In the New York JFK-Paris market Air France and Delta, part of the immunized SkyTeam alliance, have an approximate 75 per cent share according to Mr Oberstar. Chicago to Frankfurt is dominated by Star members United and Lufthansa, which control an 85 per cent share, while the Amsterdam-Atlanta market is controlled entirely by newly immunized SkyTeam members Delta and KLM.Mr Oberstar said if the remaining two pending immunity applications were approved, the US-European market would essentially be locked down by the three alliances, which would have a market share of over 95 per cent.
420;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American Airlines hit by drop in passengers;;AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, on Wednesday reported a heavy net loss for the first quarter as shrinking demand for air travel replaced record oil prices as the biggest threat to the airline industry.The group said its net loss for the first three months rose to $375m from $341m in the same period a year ago as it was hit by declining revenues, fares and traffic.Gerard Arpey, AMR chairman and chief executive, said: “While lower fuel prices have provided a significant buffer against falling demand in 2009, the struggling economy and capital markets remain significant challenges for American and the rest of the industry.”American Airlines is the largest US carrier after Delta Air Lines.The group said it had raised a further $100m to improve liquidity through a loan secured against aircraft and was cutting non-aircraft capital expenditure by $100m more than forecast.“Our 2009 outlook remains challenging,” said Mr Arpey but actions had been taken to bolster liquidity, and reduce debt and capacity.As airlines globally seek to conserve cash, AMR said it had an estimated $3.6bn of unencumbered assets and other sources of liquidity at the end of March that could be sold or financed, including aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and frequent flyer miles.It had only $3.3bn of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter, down from $4.9bn a year earlier.Mr Arpey said he expected to receive approval from the US competition authorities in the second half of the year for the joint venture across the North Atlantic planned by American, British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, in spite of signs of rising opposition in the US Congress.American said it had begun to replace its ageing short-haul fleet.It took delivery of two Boeing 737-800s in the first quarter, its first since 2001, and is planning 29 this year, 39 in 2010 and eight in early 2011.The new jets are about 35 per cent more fuel efficient than the old MD-80s.It dismissed concerns about its ability to secure funding for the aircraft purchases and said it had obtained financing commitments to cover the 737 deliveries until late 2010.The deliveries will be funded through a combination of new bank financing, backstop funding by Boeing and a sale and lease-back transaction for 20 jets.Airline problems in securing financing for new aircraft threaten deliveries by both Boeing and Airbus towards the end of this year and, in particular, in 2010.American said revenues in the first quarter had fallen 15 per cent to $4.8bn under the impact of reduced capacity, passenger numbers, fares and cargo demand.The group said it had cut capacity in mainline operations by 8 per cent in the first three months from the same period a year ago but it still filled only 75.7 per cent of seats, down from 79.1 per cent a year earlier.As airlines cut fares to try to stimulate traffic, American said its average fares fell 4.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, after 15 consecutive quarters of rising yields.The group said it had paid 30 per cent per gallon less for fuel in the first three months than a year ago.
421;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-05T22:20:09Z;Continental waits for Star Alliance approval;;Continental Airlines is close to winning preliminary approval from US regulators to co-operate with United Airlines and its global allies on transcontinental ventures.The airlines sought immunity last summer from US antitrust rules that would have limited Continental’s ability to co-ordinate schedules and share revenue with its new partners in the Star Alliance, which includes United, Lufthansa and Air Canada.US transport officials plan to issue a show-cause order as early as this week on the carriers’ immunity application, clearing the way for final approval by the end of May, people familiar with the matter said.Continental’s path to inclusion in the Star Alliance’s immunised venture began last summer, when the Houston-based carrier rejected United’s offer to merge and opted to leave SkyTeam, the alliance anchored by Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM. Delta acquired another SkyTeam member, Northwest Airlines, last year.Stymied by rules forbidding tie-ups between US carriers and their foreign counterparts, many of world’s largest airlines forged alliances to help share revenue and costs, and extend their reach around the globe. As those alliances evolved, airlines sought immunity from US antitrust rules to seek greater co-ordination.As United and Continental form closer ties through their transcontinental venture, the two carriers may revisit merger discussions that were abandoned amid concerns that acquisition costs would overwhelm balance sheets weakened by fuel prices, people familiar with their plans said.Members of a third big alliance, including British Airways and American Airlines, are also seeking immunity for their proposed venture. The carriers submitted additional paperwork to regulators last month and now await word on whether officials will deem their application complete.While industry executives never doubted Continental would win approval to join Star’s immunised venture, airline alliances have nonetheless come under scrutiny in Washington recently.Jim Oberstar, chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, proposed a bill this year that called for tougher standards on alliances that were granted antitrust immunity. Last month, the Minnesota Democrat added language to a key measure that will set funding for the Federal Aviation Administration.Under Mr Oberstar’s provision, carriers could lose their immunity if they did not convince transport officials to approve their plans within three years.In unveiling their order granting preliminary approval next week, when Congress is on recess, regulators may hope to minimise any backlash.Continental declined to comment, as did US transport officials.
422;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-04-02T23:33:00Z;American Airlines in talks for Citigroup cash;;American Airlines is in early talks to raise cash from Citigroup, its credit card partner, after recently securing a $100m loan from Germany’s DVB Bank, defying mounting scepticism that a major US carrier could lock up additional funding amidst a steepening downturn.The liquidity comes at a crucial time for American. While slumping fuel prices and steep capacity cuts have helped the world’s second-largest airline and its peers weather falling demand, dwindling financing options have revived concerns that several big carriers are heading for bankruptcy protection.American’s talks with Citi centre on their co-branded credit card, which awards customers frequent-flyer miles with each purchase, people familiar with the matter said. The companies are discussing an arrangement in which American would sell Citi a block of miles in advance, the people said.Three US rivals – Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Continental Airlines – have already reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in similar deals with their card partners.The people noted the Citi talks were at an early stage and could end if other sources of liquidity were to open up or if demand for travel improved, easing pressure on American’s balance sheet.DVB finalised a loan to American, which is secured by 777 and 757 aircraft, last week.American, which has about $3.1bn in cash, had $3.5bn in unencumbered assets and other potential sources of liquidity such as airport slots and frequent-flyer miles at the end of the year. It has paid $700m of $1.8bn in long-term debt due this year. American’s mileage plan – the industry’s first – has 60m members.Delta added $2bn in cash by extending its card contract with American Express, while United and Continental each raised hundreds of millions of dollars from the advance sales of miles to JPMorgan Chase, their partner.American’s decision to turn to Citi for funds could appear ironic given the losses incurred by the bank since the beginning of the crisis. Its willingness to consider such a deal underscores the value issuers place on their affinity relationships with airlines.Consumers who accumulate miles tend to earn and spend more, and their ties to an airline make them more loyal cardholders too.American and Citi declined to comment.Additional reporting by Francesco Guerrera in New York and James Wilson in Frankfurt

424;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-03-22T22:11:01Z;Qantas backs its belt-tightening;;The top brass at Australia’s Qantas snapped to attention last week when the airline industry’s main international trade body published grim .The International Air Transport Association found that premium traffic in Asia fell by 23.4 per cent in January compared with the same month last year, traffic across the Pacific was down 24.7 per cent, while the South Pacific fell by 28.5 per cent.Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, an industry consultancy, says the “horrific” figures are made worse by coinciding with rising competition among Qantas, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and V Australia, as well as additional capacity on routes between Australia and the US.Qantas is to respond to the deteriorating market with a restructuring plan – expected this week – that will lead to a second wave of redundancies in nine months. It follows last July’s decision to shed 1,500 employees and successive rounds of cuts to the airline’s fleet capacity.There are no signs of an early recovery in high-margin customers and the expectation is that more airlines will fail.In the grip of the downturn, Qantas is eating into costs and revamping its business. It will be keen to avoid a repeat of a damaging dispute with the Australian Licensed Engineers Association last year that cost the airline A$150m (US$103m).On top of the financial loss, Qantas had its reputation for reliability damaged and it is still in “reputation recovery” mode, according to David Epstein, Qantas’s executive general manager for government and corporate affairs, who spoke to the Financial Times last week. “The bigger issue was the damage to the brand.”As Qantas and others consider their staffing needs, Mr Epstein says the “new reality is about engagement . . . Our workforce is very aware of the financial crisis and they recognise they have to be flexible”.However, Mr Harbison warns that industrial disputes resulting from job losses will be a “dangerous area” for Qantas and other carriers as they seek to downsize.“Because this is happening so fast and is getting so deep, it is impossible for airlines to predict even what their needs are in three months’ time. Airlines have to make the judgment – be pre-emptive and put your workforce offside or continue to erode your balance sheet.”Qantas, under chief executive Alan Joyce, is also shifting back from parts of its “segmentation strategy”, where businesses such as engineering and catering operated on a standalone basis.“Those businesses have been brought back in under the Qantas Operations banner,” says Mr Epstein.Such changes are part of Qantas’s “business sustainability” strategy, which identified A$500m of improvements to the business. “Overlapping this [is] a short-term savings exercise that has identified savings of A$250m,” Mr Epstein says. That figure includes the announced 1,500 job cuts.Qantas has cut international capacity by 13 per cent, as well as abandoning plans to increase international capacity by 5 per cent in the current financial year.As well as retiring older aircraft that Qantas had kept in service as it encountered delivery delays to new Airbus and Boeing aircraft, the Australian airline has not proceeded with a number of leases on Airbus’s A330 long-haul jet.Qantas says its “dual brand” strategy – the core Qantas brand is complemented by in-house budget carrier Jetstar – provides flexibility. “Last year when fuel prices went through the roof that was bad for budget carriers because there is much less price elasticity.“Now when fuel prices are cheap it makes it much better for Jetstar,” says Mr Epstein.Qantas recently shored up its balance sheet, raising A$526m from equity issues to top up cash reserves to A$2.5bn. The result is that it is one of few airlines in the world still to be forecasting a profit this financial year, with guidance of A$500m.That number may prove optimistic but any profit in this environment would be the envy of most of its peers.
425;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Airline alliances at risk from antitrust move;;Legislation that could eventually force US airlines to abandon joint ventures with their transatlantic peers may be gaining momentum in Washington, just as carriers such as United, American and British Airways seek federal approval to build closer ties.Stymied by rules forbidding mergers between US carriers and their foreign counterparts, many of world’s largest airlines have forged alliances to help share revenue and costs, and extend their reach around the globe. As those alliances evolved, airlines sought immunity from US antitrust rules to co-ordinate their schedules and fares.Delta Air Lines has such a venture with Air France-KLM, while United enjoys an immunised relationship with Lufthansa.Jim Oberstar, chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, proposed a bill last month that calls for tougher standards on airline alliances that were granted antitrust immunity.Later on Thursday, the Minnesota Democrat plans to add the antitrust immunity language to a measure that will set funding for the Federal Aviation Administration for the next two years.While few industry insiders gave the bill much chance of passing on its own, its presence on an important funding bill may trigger a unified lobbying effort from the airline industry.Under Mr Oberstar’s bill, carriers could lose their immunity if they did not convince transport officials to approve their plans in three years.The timing of Mr Oberstar’s efforts is less than ideal for those carriers whose immunity applications are now before regulators. Continental Airlines applied for antitrust immunity to join United and Lufthansa in their alliance, and should have a decision from US regulators by May.Another coalition of carriers led by American, British Airways and Spain’s Iberia applied for immunity in August.US transport officials requested additional evidence in December, and people familiar with the airlines’ plans said they would submit the paperwork later this month.The bill may also spur protest from European airlines and government officials already frustrated with the perceived reluctance by their US counterparts to open the nation’s commercial ­aviation market to foreign owners.A similar FAA reauthorisation bill passed the House in 2007, and while it never came before a vote in the Senate its proponents may feel the legislation stands a better chance now.
426;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-01-27T21:52:57Z;Wall St sees glimmer of hope in earnings;;Financial stocks were the winners on Wall Street on Tuesday as some corporate earnings that were not as bad as feared helped the wider market extend the previous session’s modest gains.The market opened higher after figures from American Express and Texas Instruments offered a glimmer of hope that investors’ worst fears – at least for some companies – may have been excessive.The rally came even though other results and the latest economic data suggested a bleak outlook for corporate earnings. Bullish observers took that as a sign that the market had stopped reacting to bad news.Consumer confidence fell to a record low in January, according to data from the Conference Board. The S&P/Case Shiller index, a closely watched reading of US house prices, dropped in November at the fastest rate on record. Homebuilder stocks lost 2.4 per cent overall.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent to 845.70, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7 per cent higher at 8,174.73 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1 per cent higher at 1,504.90 points.Financials led the advance, up 3.7 per cent overall. American Express, which was among several key financial losers in the previous session, bounced 9.7 per cent to $16.68 after the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings that was nevertheless better than the most pessimistic fears.Still, Donald Fandetti, Citigroup analyst, maintained his “sell” view of the stock.“We could see some short covering as the bear-case for Q4 did not play out, though we’d expect concerns around spending and credit to ultimately push the shares lower,” he said.Among the several banks to bounce back on Tuesday, Bank of America rallied 8.3 per cent to $6.50 and Citigroup 6.6 per cent to $3.55.Travelers, the insurer, rose 6.2 per cent to $39.89 on better-than-expected earnings. Financial stocks have swung violent in recent sessions as volatility has returned to Wall Street.“While a good deal of bad news is already priced into the market and some stocks have been rising on bad news, we are still seeing too many stocks fall on disappointing results,” wrote options strategists at Goldman Sachs.“This leads us to believe that downward revisions of the magnitude we are looking for will cause further volatility.”Elsewhere, well-received figures from Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 4 per cent to $23.13, gave the pharmaceuticals sector a boost.Healthcare also did well, up 2 per cent overall, on the back of better than expected results from St Jude Medical, which rose 11.1 per cent to $35.21.Other stocks in the sector rallied after RBC analysts initiated coverage on several companies in the sector with an “outperform” view.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rallied 3.7 per cent to $15.31 on better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although the technology group warned that it could report a loss in its first quarter.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 3.7 per cent overall, also pushed higher after an upbeat assessment of the sector by Citigroup’s Glen Yeung.“The potential for a bottom has been created,” he said. “Chip stocks have not gone down on bad news.” The technology sector edged 1.2 per cent higher overall.Investors took some comfort from the confirmation of Timothy Geithner as US Treasury secretary. “Bullish sentiment still surrounds the economic stimulus plan,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets.Among the more downbeat results, Dupont disclosed a slightly bigger than expected fourth-quarter loss and gloomier earnings outlook for the year. Shares in the chemical maker edged 0.4 per cent higher to $23.27.Elsewhere in materials, US Steel rallied 6.9 per cent to $31.49 on well-received fourth-quarter figures.Telecommunications was one of only two main economic sectors to lose ground. Verizon fell 3.3 per cent to $29.96 as the group’s fourth-quarter profit trailed some expectations.The lower oil price afforded scant comfort to the airlines, which did badly in the wake of downbeat results from Delta Air Lines. Delta shares dived 20.1 per cent to $7.93 as its fourth-quarter loss widened while the Amex Airline Index dropped 6.9 per cent.

428;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta predicts 4% drop in key revenue measure;;"Delta Airlines on Tuesday delivered a revenue forecast that appeared to confirm fears that carriers will confront a slump in air-travel demand this year.In its first reporting quarter since merging with Northwest Airlines to create the world’s biggest carrier by traffic, the company said that passenger unit revenue – an industry measurement that factors how well an airline fills aeroplane seats and how much it charges for tickets – would fall 4 per cent this year.“The recession is clearly causing leisure customers to rethink or postpone some of their discretionary travel decisions,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, said. “On the corporate side, companies continue to trim travel budgets and as a result business travellers are purchasing their tickets in advance to take advantage of lower fares.”However, Delta executives argued that demand would improve as the year progressed, noting the first quarter is normally the industry’s weakest.“Despite the difficult economic environment, we expect to be solidly profit-able in 2009 driven by lower fuel costs, capacity discipline, and merger synergies,” said Richard Anderson, chief executive. “Delta people have a great track record for achieving their goals, and I am confident that 2009 will be another
successful year.”Delta said it had made a fourth-quarter net loss, which includes two months of Northwest results, of $1.4bn, or $2.11 a share, due to costs from employee stock awards and jet-fuel hedges.The airline paid more than $900m in stock to employees following the merger, and recorded a $91m loss to mark down the value of fuel-hedging contracts. Excluding those items as well as one-time costs from the Northwest deal, the loss still missed many analysts’ estimates.Delta lost $70m, or 18 cents per share, as a standalone company in the fourth quarter of 2007. Including Northwest in both periods, revenue changed little from a year earlier, slipping to $7.77bn from $7.79bn. Passenger revenue – the amount Delta collects from ticket sales – fell 1 per cent.Delta plans to shed as much as 8 per cent of its capacity this year as it removes 40-50 aircraft from its fleet. The company also initiated a second voluntary workforce reduction plan this month."
429;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2009-01-26T11:58:25Z;What IT means to me: ‘Suddenly everyone’s happy to meet me’;;"Technology was a black box to me, even though it represented $100m of costs.” This is how Jim Whitehurst, former chief operating officer of Delta Airlines, describes his relationship with IT until just over a year ago.But Mr Whitehurst, who was instrumental in rescuing the company after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005, has learned a lot about technology since.In December 2007, Mr Whitehurst moved to the software industry, taking the CEO’s chair at Red Hat. His time at Delta has provided him with invaluable experience of how companies operate when they are under real pressure to cut costs.Red Hat might be best-known as a distributor of the Linux open-source operating system, but most of the company’s (paying) customers are large enterprises. It is there that Mr Whitehurst has seen a change in attitudes over the last few months – especially when it comes to IT spending.“As I’ve travelled to meet customers, I’ve felt a difference between my meetings in the spring and the fall,” he says. “Companies that would not meet me in the spring were very interested by the fall.“Customers are saying that they use another operating system, but their budgets are being cut. It has been significantly more positive in the past six months in Asia, Europe and North America.”For Mr Whitehurst, the difference is that CIOs now need to be more careful about their spending plans. When revenues were strong, companies would put factors such as compatibility, minimising risk, or speed of deployment top of their list of priorities, even if the result was a more expensive architecture. Now, IT departments are paying more attention to operating costs.This, in turn, favours operating systems such as Linux, as well as technologies such as JBoss, Red Hat’s open source-based middleware.“After the last bust [in 2001], companies took a risk with Unix to Linux migration, because they had to,” Mr Whitehurst points out. “Pressure makes people get out of their comfort zone.” He suggests that companies that were reluctant to move to open source seven or eight years ago – the “late adopters” are now considering deployment.Naturally, this is good news for Red Hat. But Mr Whitehurst admits that he often finds the business models of the IT industry baffling. Potential customers inquiring about JBoss middleware, for example, are often prompted to do so because they are faced with a large bill to renew three-year licence agreements.Companies buying enterprise software are often forced to pay for upgrades they do not need, in order to stay current and to maintain support. The result, he suggests, is ever more complex IT systems that sap productivity from both IT departments and end users, and create spiralling operating costs for little in the way of business benefits.“Ninety per cent of the functionality of business software is not used, so why do vendors keep adding functionality to force upgrades?” he asks.“It is like having to re-buy an aeroplane from Boeing every five years. You get bloated software that most CIOs don’t want, and creeping licensing costs. In the airline, we made sure we didn’t have a single source for fuel or other supplies. Yet companies that spend millions of dollars preventing things that could hold up their business allow themselves to be locked into software.”If the IT industry is to survive the next few years, Mr Whitehurst believes it needs to rethink its business model and become much, much more customer-friendly. “I am really new to open source, but what is fascinating to me is less the development model than the commercial model we have had to develop, because of the nature of not owning the [source] code.“Fundamentally, the proprietary licensed software model is broken. If you sell licences, you have to get people to buy them. That is great for new customers, but what the software companies do is add features and functionality to get you to ‘re-buy’ the application. If you ask a CIO if they have been forced to pay for upgrades when they don’t want the functionality, every one will say ‘yes’.”The open source model, advocated by Red Hat and others, takes freely available source code and packages it with commercial services such as stable releases and support. That way, Mr Whitehurst suggests, customers pay for what they need – the support services – and not for feature upgrades they do not need.Upgrades for Red Hat Linux are distributed free; installing them is optional and does not affect support. Companies that want to use a free version of the software – in Red Hat’s case, Fedora – can simply download it from the internet.Mr Whitehurst admits that although this model has been successful for server operating systems, and is growing in popularity for tools such as middleware, open source is having a tougher time in both desktop operating systems and applications.“We do have customers with 10,000 desktops [running Linux],” Mr Whitehurst points out. “But often it is on a minority of their systems. They might have 80,000 desktops and they will look to have 20,000 on Linux, to increase their negotiating power with Microsoft.”Desktop Linux users are less likely to be knowledge workers, he suggests, but staff working on “thin clients” in areas such as call centres. “If all they need to do is access a back-end system, an e-mail client and a web browser is all they need,” he says.But Mr Whitehurst does believe that such thin clients, in all probability based on Linux, will gain ground in the enterprise, as organisations make greater use of web-based applications and software as a service.Linux-based thin clients could also be a way for businesses to postpone the cost of potentially expensive PC upgrades.The past 12 months have also seen uptake of Linux boosted by the growth of low-cost, “netbook” PCs.“Netbooks are the first place where the cost of the operating system is relatively high enough for manufacturers to be forced to look at Linux, both from the point of view of the cost of the software and from the cost of the hardware [needed to run it],” he says.“It has been getting Linux into more people’s hands, which is great,” notes Mr Whitehurst. “Getting more people using Linux will also mean there will be more drivers, especially for devices such as the BlackBerry or for phones.”This contrasts with the growth of Linux to date, which has largely been driven by the enterprise.The move both to netbooks and to cloud computing are both part of a wider move towards ubiquitous access to information, Mr Whitehurst says. This, he believes, is the most significant trend in technology.Devices such as the BlackBerry or the iPhone, and location-based technologies such as GPS (global positioning system) are offering a new set of services for consumers, and new sources of information for consumers.“What can I offer someone if I know where they are and what they are looking at?” asks Mr Whitehurst. “That source [of information] has yet to be mined.” Technology such as Google’s Android mobile operating system, which is based on open source, will add further capabilities, he predicts.“The distinction between a desktop and a phone will continue to blur,” he predicts. “For better or worse, the move to greater computing/communication power in our pockets is only accelerating.”"
430;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta in $2bn card deal with AmexCo;;Delta Air Lines has struck a deal with American Express that will add $2bn to the airline’s coffers just as its industry confronts a bitter slowdown in demand for air travel.The deal builds on Delta’s existing contract with AmexCo, whose co-branded SkyMiles card lets customers accumulate frequent-flyer miles as they make purchases. In retaining its relationship with Delta, even after the Atlanta-based carrier’s merger with Northwest Airlines, AmexCo beat out fellow issuers such as US Bancorp, which had been Northwest’s affinity-card partner.AmexCo paid a steep price at a time when the financial services industry faces its own crisis. Under the new accord, which AmexCo agreed to negotiate two years before its prior contract was set to expire, Delta will sell $1bn in miles in advance and reap an additional $1bn in unspecified contract improvements by the end of 2010.“The fact that AmexCo was able to step forward with the size of liquidity we described is a testament to the power of the relationship and the power of the brand,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, told the Financial Times on Tuesday. “It was a competitive process, and we did have other banks at the table.”Credit card companies have coveted co-branding agreements with carriers, whose frequent flyers tend to be wealthier and more loyal than customers with no airline affinity.Delta’s merger with Northwest this year created the world’s biggest carrier, with a loyalty programme that boasts 74m members, granting the combined company more leverage in extracting better terms from its potential card partnership.“Our Delta co-brand cards are among our most successful products,” Jud Linville, chief executive of AmexCo’s consumer-services division, said.While the rapid descent of jet-fuel costs has helped brighten the airline industry’s outlook for 2009 profits, US carriers now confront an economic downturn that executives and analysts fear could bring about the steepest slump in air travel demand in the history of commercial aviation. The expected decline in revenue will cut into cash reserves already expected to dwindle as carriers are forced to post additional collateral on fuel hedges bought before the commodity’s slide.Mindful of the potential cash crunch, airlines have sought to squeeze out as much liquidity as possible now by selling stock, drawing down credit lines, borrowing using their aircraft as collateral and revising contracts with credit-card issuers and processors.United Airlines and Continental Airlines each raised hundreds of millions of dollars this year from the advance sales of miles to their card partner, JPMorgan Chase.
431;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-12-02T23:07:11Z;Cultural ties makemerger link-up logical choice;;Qantas’s pursuit of a merger with its largest European ally, British Airways, may be the Australian carrier’s best route to assure its role as part of a powerhouse of the global airline industry.International trade treaties and the emergence of aircraft capable of flying greater distances have made it easier for foreign airlines to open routes to Australia.This is threatening to loosen Qantas’s grip on its home region.“Qantas wants to be part of a bigger airline, and BA is the most logical choice, given the cultural ties,” says Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon.“It would give Qantas a real heavy base in Europe and give BA a nice toehold into the growing Asian market.”The deal would mark the latest step by members of the Oneworld global alliance to forge closer ties with their international partners and provides a promising foundation for a closer relationship between Qantas and BA.Aside from the two chief executives, and their common roots in Ireland, there are other figures that have been prominent bridgeheads between the companies. Former BA chief Rod Eddington, for example, was a director of Allco Finance, when it joined the buy-out consortium bidding for Qantas two years ago.The new-found heft that would come with the creation of a BA-Qantas group, particularly on transcontinental routes, may push Qantas’s Asian rivals to seek deals with Europe’s other flag carriers, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.It would also help build the case for US airlines seeking to loosen restrictions on cross-border mergers.While Qantas’s biggest North American peer, American Airlines, may have made an attractive alternative merger partner, US regulations are a major stumbling block. They limit foreign ownership to 25 per cent.Executives at American and its peers have lobbied to eliminate the cap, which they argue restricts their access to capital and ability to compete globally.Rival cross-border alliances have grown stronger, too.Delta Air Lines merged with Northwest Airlines this year to form the world’s largest carrier, and the combined company also recently strengthened its relationship with Air France-KLM.Lufthansa and United Airlines are seeking immunity from US antitrust rules to free another large US carrier, Continental Airlines, to join their own transatlantic venture.In an unrelated announcement, Delta said it would slash the number of available seats by as much as 8 per cent next year to confront the global slowdown in demand for air travel.
432;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-12-02T21:58:42Z;Wall St rallies in spite of poor auto sales;;Dire sales figures from General Motors and Ford on Tuesday failed to prevent US stocks making a tenacious recovery from the heaviest sell-off since October after a strong rally into the close.The pair rose 5.7 per cent to $4.85 and 5.9 per cent to $2.70, respectively, as investors bet Congress would take kindly to their restructuring plans and grant the car industry a $25bn bail-out.Pledges to become more competitive helped lift the beleaguered stocks and Ford said it expected to at least break even by 2011.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished at its highest level of the session, up 4 per cent at 848.81 after a volatile session during which it briefly neared negative territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.3 per cent to 8,419.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.7 per cent to 1,449.80.“I don’t trust today’s rally any more than I trusted yesterday’s sell-off,” said Jim Paulsen, strategists at Wells Capital Management. “People are trading on the volatility.”The market’s advance was wide ranging and took in even the energy sector, up 3.7 per cent overall, despite a sharp fall in the oil price.However, defensive consumer stocks such as Coca-Cola, down 0.9 per cent to 43.93, also lagged behind the market.Observers continued to question whether a market bottom was within sight. “Although the trajectory and speed of the descent has been alarming, the anticipation of a recovery remains a big question, as the timing and magnitude of a potential economic rebound are still difficult to gauge,” wrote analysts at FBR.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 8 per cent although, at 63, it continued to indicate extreme distress.General Electric, up 13.6 per cent to $17.61, helped the market bounce after the Dow component appeared to succeed in its attempt to shore up confidence despite lowering annual profit forecasts.Investors welcomed its pledge to keep the dividend unchanged and the prospect of job cuts in both financial and industrial divisions.Bargain hunting lifted the S&P 500 financials index, which suffered a 17 per cent slump in the previous session, the most since its creation in 1989. The sector recovery of 7.9 per cent overall led the market’s bounce.CIT Group advanced 21.1 per cent to $3.45 after the lender increased a swap of notes by $200m due to the amount of tenders it had received.Goldman Sachs faded another 1.2 per cent to $65 on mounting fears over the extent of its fourth quarter loss. Met Life also failed to benefit from the sector gains, down 6.1 per cent to $23.42 after the insurer said it expected to endure its first quarterly loss as a public company.A strong advance in the materials sector helped Mosaic, up 6.9 per cent to $27.16, overcome weakening fertiliser sales.Still, Brian Yu, Citigroup analyst, said that, although the phosphate producer expects a strong recovery in the May quarter, “investors may take a ‘show-me’ attitude so [the] shares could struggle over the next three to four months”.In airlines, Delta climbed 6.4 per cent to $8.47 after the group unveiled plans for capacity cuts of 6-8 per cent, which could involve fresh job cuts. However, UAL lost 1.7 per cent to $9.48 on reports that the parent company of United Airlines was close to finalising a $150m aircraft financing deal.The market’s positive momentum also helped the retail sector, among the big casualties in the previous session. Sears soared 13.4 per cent to $36.09 even after the company disclosed a wider third quarter loss than expected and failed to provide an earnings forecast for the remainder of the year.In technology, bid speculation helped lift Yahoo 7.1 per cent to $11.50. Microsoft added 2.9 per cent to $19.15 after the software group claimed Xbox 360 consoles sales during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend were on track to beat previous years.Intuit, maker of Quicken personal finance software, gained 8.4 per cent to $21.88 after Barclays upgraded its recommendation on the stock from “neutral weight” to “overweight”. “We view Intuit as an attractive defensive play given its strong position in tax,” said Eric Handler, analyst.
433;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-11-11T23:15:09Z;SkyTeam’s Heathrow challenge to BA falters;;The attempt by Air France-KLM and Delta, leaders of the SkyTeam global airline allliance, to challenge British Airways in the heart of its home market at London Heathrow is facing increasing difficulties in the weakening air travel market.Northwest Airlines, which was taken over by Delta last month to form the biggest US carrier, is set to abandon its route between Heathrow and Seattle only nine months after launching the service in partnership with KLM, its European partner.Last month Air France-KLM said it was also giving up its first foray into the long-haul market between Heathrow and the US only six months after launching its initial route to Los Angeles.The withdrawal by Air France from the Heathrow/Los Angeles route and by Northwest from Heathrow/Seattle are significant setbacks for SkyTeam in the aggressive assault it launched on the London/US market in response to the US/European Union “open skies” treaty.Last spring Delta started twice daily services between Heathrow and New York JFK and a daily service to Atlanta, while Northwest started services between Heathrow and its hubs in Minneapolis and Detroit as well as to Seattle, and Air France launched Heathrow/Los Angeles.The “open skies” treaty partly liberalised the transatlantic aviation market by making it possible for the first time for European and US airlines to fly between any two points in the two regions, and it also opened London Heathrow to full competition between all US and EU carriers.Previously only British Airways and Virgin Atlantic from the UK and American Airlines and United Airlines from the US had been allowed to operate direct flights between the US and Heathrow, the most important European gateway for travellers from the US.The decision by Air France and Northwest (Delta) to pull off the Los Angeles and Seattle routes demonstrates how tough it is to challenge profitably an incumbent carrier at its main hub.The performances of the routes have fallen well below expectations. Air France-KLM said last month that “given the present economic and financial crisis” it was being forced to restructure its operations at Heathrow in co-operation with its US partners in SkyTeam.It has pulled off the Heathrow/Los Angeles route this month and will stay out of the long-haul market at Heathrow throughout the winter season. It will protect the take off and landing slots by temporarily adding another flight to Paris.The Heathrow/Los Angeles route is one of the most heavily competed across the North Atlantic and Air France was fighting for market share against five other carriers, BA, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines, American Airlines and Air New Zealand.From June next year it said it would use the 777 aircraft and the Heathrow slots to fly a daily service between London and New York JFK augmenting the current twice daily service flown by Delta Air Lines on the route.Northwest said it would halt its Seattle service, where it was competing against BA, on January 9. It had not yet decided how it would use the take off and landing slots at Heathrow.Air France and Delta operate a profit and revenue sharing joint venture across the North Atlantic, which is being expanded to include the parallel joint venture of KLM and Northwest Airlines.British Airways is further consolidating its long-haul services at Heathrow to strenghten its grip at its global hub. It is transferring its Atlanta service there from Gatwick at the end of March next year, the start of the summer flight season.The move has also been made possible by the “open skies” treaty and follows its transfer last spring of its Houston and Dallas Fort Worth services from Gatwick to Heathrow.American Airlines and Continental Airlines have also announced the transfer of all their Gatwick services to Heathrow and the closure of their Gatwick bases as a result of the liberalisation of the Heathrow market.

435;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-10-29T22:23:24Z;US approves Delta-Northwest merger;;Delta Air Lines’ proposed merger with Northwest Airlines won approval from US antitrust officials, clearing the companies to create the world’s largest carrier.The merger, which closed late on Wednesday, comes six months after Delta and Northwest struck a deal they argued would insulate the combined company from a surge in fuel costs that had threatened to overwhelm even the nation’s biggest airlines.While a deepening economic slowdown has replaced record fuel costs as the industry’s top concern, a combined Delta-Northwest may still pressure rivals such as United Airlines and American Airlines to pursue deals of their own.“The airline industry faces a very difficult economic environment around the world and this merger gives Delta increased flexibility to adapt,” Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, said in statement.Mindful of the challenges that organised labour had posed in past airline mergers, Delta and Northwest executives sought to secure their pilots’ support before announcing an agreement. The carriers also emphasised the lack of overlap between their route networks and hubs, blunting the arguments of airline consolidation’s traditional opponents in Congress.The strategy nearly backfired when a standoff between the two pilots unions over how to rank their members by seniority threatened to derail the carriers’ negotiations. Nevertheless, the Delta-Northwest merger may now serve as a template for other airlines in an industry with a history of deals that failed to win the support of regulators, labour leaders and other key constituents.“I think it might well do that,” said Larry Scarborough, an antitrust lawyer with Bryan Cave. “The lack of significant overlap made traditional antitrust analysis pretty easy to satisfy.”United Airlines, Continental Airlines and US Airways were among the other US carriers to discuss potential combinations this year.US Department of Justice officials said on Wednesday that the merger “is likely to produce substantial and credible efficiencies that will benefit US consumers and is not likely to substantially lessen competition”.The two airlines ferried 126m passengers last year. The combined company, called Delta and based in the Atlanta, will serve more than 375 cities in 66 countries.Delta swapped 1.25 shares of its stock for each Northwest share, valuing the deal at more than $2.6bn.The company said the merger will produce $2bn or more in annual revenue and costs savings.In a separate statement, Northwest said it obtained a new $500m revolving credit facility led by US Bancorp, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.
436;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-10-29T22:20:07Z;After oil, falling traffic is airlines’ next crisis;;"In the airline world one crisis soon replaces another. The sharp decline in fuel prices is bringing some relief to the world’s hard-pressed carriers, many of which were fighting for survival in the summer because of the record oil prices.But the gains on the fuel front are being offset by falling traffic volumes, as recession looms in some of the biggest air travel markets.The global aviation map is changing and consolidation accelerating as weaker airlines collapse. More than 30 have gone this year, says Iata, the airline industry trade association; 20 more are on the watchlist. Airlines managers are grounding aircraft to cut capacity.Germany’s Lufthansa, the main predator in Europe, on Wednesday announced its long-awaited takeover of BMI British Midland, only hours after Danish low cost carrier Sterling Airlines said it was filing for bankruptcy.Financial turmoil and the job losses in the banking sector are taking their toll, especially on business travel, the key profit generator for many of the world’s traditional network carriers. The credit squeeze is forcing up the price of financing new aircraft, where funds are still available. The strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the pound is eroding some of the gains from the falling dollar price of fuel, especially for European carriers.Gerard Arpey, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines says while fuel prices have fallen from record levels a few months ago “the economic uncertainty, and what that might mean for travel demand, is a serious concern.”Fuel prices remain volatile, and he says it would be “short-sighted” to conclude fuel costs are no longer a challenge.Some countries that were performing most strongly are leading the way down. Airline traffic in India fell 19 per cent in September. Air China reported September passenger traffic volumes down by 7.9 per cent.Indian carriers, hurt by some of the world’s highest jet fuel taxes, face such high losses that they are scrambling to consolidate after the wild years of expansion and have been forced to seek a deal with the government to delay paying overdue fuel bills. Rivals Jet Airways and Kingfisher have been forced into an alliance.In Europe, even airlines with contrasting business models such as British Airways and Ryanair have, in a matter of months, gone from record profits to barely breaking even. Air France-KLM, the world’s largest airline by revenues, and Lufthansa, the number two European player, are the latest to issue profit warnings.The squeeze is forcing the pace of regional consolidation. Lufthansa is busiest with Brussels Airlines and BMI in the bag and stakes in Austrian Airlines, Alitalia and possibly SAS in its sights. BA is negotiating a merger with Spain’s Iberia, although the plunge in the UK carrier’s share price and worries about the size of its pension deficit could torpedo the deal. Air France-KLM is bidding against Lufthansa for a minority stake in a restructured Alitalia.Consolidation is a particular feature in the US. Delta Air Lines says it is on track to complete its takeover of Northwest Airlines by the end of this year to create the biggest North American carrier.US carriers have led the way in reducing capacity drastically for the coming winter. The cuts were forced originally by the surge in oil prices in the first half of the year; US carriers have on average the oldest fleets among airlines in the developed economies. The oil price has fallen from a July peak of $147 to about $60 a barrel but the capacity reductions remain timely given the falling demand for air travel.As the crisis deepens, the lines of older aircraft parked in the US deserts are growing for the first time since 2005.Since June, the world’s airlines have announced, and begun to implement, a fleet reduction programme that already accounts for 1,083 aircraft, or 5 per cent of the global fleet, according to Ascend, the aviation consultancy.About 75 per cent of fleet reductions are occurring in North America, where the airlines are cutting 10 per cent of their capacity, according to Eddy Pieniazek, Ascend director. Europe is cutting under 3 per cent of its capacity to date and Asia 2 per cent.Ascend says there are no discernible cuts yet in the Middle East, which is still building its fleet and targeting capacity growth.Airlines are inevitably uncertain as to the depth and the length of the coming recession. But Giovanni Bisignani, director general of Iata, says the sharp decline in passenger and cargo traffic in September is “alarming” and for the time being it is outpacing industry actions to cut capacity.Aircraft values and lease rates are also falling, a sure sign of the mounting troubles. “We are only just beginning to see the impact of the economic slowdown and the financial crisis on aircraft values and lease rates,” says Mr Pieniazek.According to Ascend, lease rates for out of production narrow body jets have fallen by 20 per cent since the middle of the year, while rates for short-haul jets in production are down by 10 per cent. Overall aircraft values have fallen by 5 to 10 per cent.Airbus and Boeing are preparing to step in as lenders of last resort to support selected sales during the coming year, as airlines find access difficult to some traditional sources of finance for buying new jets. Export credit agencies in the US and Europe are under pressure to fill more of the funding gap.A leading European aviation banker says the number of institutions offering finance for new commercial jet deliveries has fallen by more than half to no more than 25.Despite the rapid fall in fuel prices since July, Iata is maintaining its forecast for the global industry to fall to a net loss of $5.2bn this year. Mr Bisignani says the drop in the oil price is not enough to offset the impact of the drop in demand. “At this rate, losses may be even deeper than our forecast $5.2bn for this year.”In the six years to 2006, the global airline industry suffered net losses of $42bn and only returned to a $5.6bn profit in 2007.According to Mr Bisignani “the industry crisis is deepening along with the crisis in the global economy.”More than 30 airlines have collapsed and been removed from the industry’s international payment settlement system this year and a further 20 are on the watchlist for suspension.Paddy Power, the leading Irish bookmaker, made tens of thousands of euros during September offering odds on the next airline to go bust. It took heavy bets on XL Airways, the UK charter carrier, which came in from a 10-1 outsider to a 4-6 odds on favourite in the days before its collapse.According to Iata, passenger traffic declined by 2.9 per cent year-on-year in September, while cargo traffic, a key early indicator of the state of the world economy, fell by 7.7 per cent.“The deterioration in traffic is alarmingly fast-paced and widespread,” says Mr Bisignani. The decline in passenger volumes was the worst since 2003, when the industry was hit by the Sars epidemic.Air cargo accounts for 35 per cent of the value of internationally traded goods and the 7.7 per cent fall in September was the biggest monthly year-on-year decline since the bursting of the technology bubble in 2001."

Wednesday had seen the worst sell-off since 1987.The benchmark index closed up 4.3 per cent at 946.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 8,979.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 5.5 per cent higher at 1,717.71.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up as much as 17.2 per cent to pass yet another grim milestone, reaching above 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. It finished down 2.9 per cent at 67.25.Stocks were pushed lower by economic data that showed industrial production had endured the worst monthly decline since 1974, and factory activity in parts of the country had crashed to an 18-year low.Consumer stocks were among the winners from the late-afternoon rally as some traders bet that oil’s slide below $70 could offer hard- pressed Americans at least some relief.Macy’s closed up 16.1 per cent at $10.05 having fallen as much as 11.7 per cent. Oil’s slide to an intraday low of $68.57 a barrel, while a symptom of global slowdown could nonetheless put “cash back into people’s pockets”, said Bill Stone, investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Yet the energy sector, down as much as 8.1 per cent after data showed crude and gasoline inventories rose sharply last week, also rebounded and was up 7.8 per cent by the close.Financials were the laggards of the day, but still up 1.7 per cent, following a raft of heavy writedowns and losses from banks.Citigroup rose as much as 4 per cent but later tumbled to stand 2 per cent lower at $15.90 as investors weighed cost-cutting progress with writedowns of $4.4bn in the securities and banking division and weak revenues from its credit card unit.Merrill Lynch rose 0.6 per cent to $18.35. The bank, which is being taken over by Bank of America, reported a worse-than-expected net loss of $7.5bn, mostly due to write­downs and credit losses on complex debt securities.A host of regional banks also reported losses. Bank of New York Mellon rose 6.3 per cent to $31.08 even after costs to bail out funds hurt by Lehman Brothers’s bankruptcy dented third-quarter profits, which fell more than expected.Huntington and BB&T, which also reported downbeat figures, added 10.2 per cent to $9.48 and gained 3.4 per cent to $33.26, respectively.Insurers endured sharp declines after Fitch warned it may cut ratings on some. Hartford Financial Services dropped 11.9 per cent to $28.86, respectively.The falls came even though the rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by overnight dollar Libor, fell sharply.Elsewhere, airlines managed gains even after Southwest Airlines reported its first quarterly net loss since 1991, as oil slid below $70 a barrel.Southwest climbed 8 per cent to $12.49, while Delta Air Lines advanced 18.8 per cent to $8.64. “The leverage from the plunge in fuel prices is huge,” Credit Suisse said.Peabody Energy was a stand-out winner in the energy sector, up 18.3 per cent to $28.68 on the back of well-received third-quarter figures.Technology was up 4.8 per cent overall. Ebay fell 2.4 per cent to $14.97 after the online retailer forecast its first quarterly sales decline after the bell on Wednesday.Google, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.1 per cent to $353.02, 3.7 per cent to $91.52 and 5.4 per cent to $4.12 respectively.After the bell, the trio reported better than expected results and the shares bounced 8.2 per cent, 0.7 per cent and fell 2.9 per cent, respectively, in after- hours trade.Food groups were mixed after Hershey’s results. The chocolate group, which rose 6.9 per cent to $35.24, boosted third-quarter profits but warned of slowing sales growth next year.

Retailers Nordstrom, Macy’s and Bed, Bath & Beyond suffered some of the heaviest falls in the fall-out from grim retail sales data, down 12.4 per cent to $16.54, 17.5 per cent to $8.66 and 11 per cent to $23.89 respectively.In spite of better-than-exexpected corporate earnings in the sector, financials slumped 9 per cent overall.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – which bounced 21.2 per cent and 16.5 respectively in the previous session – retreated 12.8 per cent to $16.23 and 16.3 per cent to $18.13 after Oppenheimer warned that the government’s bank rescue was not a “panacea’’ for all ills.The major indices opened lower and sold off sharply towards the close, a hallmark of recent slumps that traders put down, in part, to another wave of mutual fund redemptions. The S&P 500 closed down 9 per cent at 907.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 7.9 per cent down at 8,577.91 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 8.5 per cent lower at 1,628.33.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.8 per cent to 68.78, a figure that indicates severe distress.The bloody retreat over the past two sessions erased virtually all of the gains from Monday, itself the biggest rise since the Depression.Energy and materials were the biggest laggards, down 15.5 and 12.1 per cent respectively, on mounting concerns of a global slowdown. US Steel sank 17.7 per cent to $38.82.“There can be no doubt now that the economy is in recession,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics. “It will be there a while.”Financials took scant comfort from JPMorgan Chase, which fell 5.5 per cent to $38.49, even after its earnings exceeded expectations. Wells Fargo which also did better than forecast, held on to gains for much of the session but closed down 0.5 per cent at $33.35.State Street, one of nine institutions in which the government will take an equity stake, sank 17.4 per cent to $46.83 after the group warned of unrealised off-balance sheet losses.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola was the only stock in the Dow to find positive territory, up 1.1 per cent to $44.21 after the soft drinks group’s quarterly profit compared favourably with a glum outlook from PepsiCo the previous day. PepsiCo lost a further 5.8 per cent to $51.25 after a 11.9 per cent slide in the previous session.Intel’s relatively well received results failed to boost Dell, which lost 10.65 per cent to $12.58.
439;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-10-10T10:16:39Z;Retrenchment: Retreat to economy class;;"The financial crisis looks increasingly likely to prompt cutbacks in corporate travel. But even if employers maintain budgets, business travellers face greater frustration and discomfort.It is not just that more will be asked to fly in economy class. Faced with record fuel costs, airlines have been dropping like flies, while survivors have pruned flights – in some cases severely.OAG, a supplier of timetable information, calculates that the global total number of flights on offer in the fourth quarter is 6.1 per cent below last year. That equates to 46.3m fewer seats – with 22.3m from US domestic flights.Off peak and unprofitable flights are the most vulnerable. As a result, peak services will become even more crowded, increasing pressure to book further in advance. It also means travellers will have to change planes instead of flying non-stop or use less convenient airports.However, the jury is still out on the full impact of the credit crunch on budgets. CWT, an international travel management company, reported increased sales for the first half of 2008 but Andrew Waller, UK executive vice-president, warns: “There is no room for complacency, as economic uncertainty continues to deepen and it is impossible to make accurate forecasts.”Meanwhile, according to Richard Crum, president of the the Association of Corporate Travel Executives: “Concern bordering on fear is surging through the business travel management profession. There is fear among suppliers that a more pronounced economic downturn will curtail spending in 2009; there is fear that companies, pressed for cash, will simply slash travel across the board, reducing the need to manage this asset; and there is fear the business travel industry will stall when it should be investing.”An earlier ACTE survey found US corporate travel managers deeply pessimistic. More than half said flight reductions would limit companies’ ability to meet manufacturers, suppliers or buyers face to face.Kevin Mitchell, Brussels-based director of the Business Travel Coalition, a lobbying group, says: “As capacity is ripped out, connectivity to important business centres will erode, and that will reduce productivity, convenience and new business opportunities.”Even the North Atlantic expansion prompted by the recent UK-US open skies agreement will have less effect than expected. United Airlines plans to withdraw its Heathrow-Denver service on October 25 – less than seven months after its launch; British Airways is dropping one of its daily Heathrow-New York flights.The cutbacks are far too numerous to be listed and few carriers have avoided them. Almost all US airlines have trimmed domestic flights: American plans to reduce fourth quarter capacity by some 11 per cent, while US Airways said it would cut available seat miles by 6-8 per cent in the fourth quarter and 7-9 per cent next year.On international routes, however, the picture is less clear-cut. Delta has launched several new services, while US Airways plans to increase international capacity despite some international lounge closures.Elsewhere, BA has reduced winter capacity by 6.4 per cent. The airline has suspended flights from Gatwick to Poznan, Sarajevo, Dresden and Newquay and postponed the launch of a planned Heathrow-Hyderabad service.Although the extent to which business travel will fall off remains unclear, the cost pressures which have prompted airline cutbacks have clearly begun to deter budget holders. One New York-based traveller, working in the furniture industry, says: “Most of my travel is on the company’s dime. In the past few months most of my travel plans to Asia and Los Angeles have been cancelled because of high fares.”Caroline Strachan, chairman of the UK Institute of Travel Management, says: “I have heard of some corporate programmes where the budget holders are so dissatisfied with the fuel surcharging and price increases that travel budgets are being slashed as the new higher fares don’t demonstrate a return on investment.”Ms Strachan is just one of many industry experts who fear capacity reductions could push up fares. “Pressure is on for airlines to make more from less.“Travellers will have to spend more time away from home or find ways to expedite their business needs.”Her concerns are echoed by forecasts from Advito, an independent consulting unit of travel management company BCD Travel. It predicts international air fares will rise by 6-8 per cent in 2009.New charges in economy class for services such as checked bags will bump the figure up to 13 per cent.The cutbacks could mean an increased workload for travel managers, according to Kevin Mitchell.He says: “I believe that many corporate travel managers will seek to modify their commitments and agreements with airlines as certain offerings may become non-competitive. For example, where a non-stop turns into a connect, or where jet service becomes turboprop.”"
440;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-10-07T08:50:41Z;Did IT work: An integration example to us all from Air France-KLM;;"This year has been a turbulent one for the aviation industry. Already several airlines, including Silverjet and Oasis have closed; US carriers Delta and Northwest Airlines have agreed to merge; British Airways and American Airlines are looking to forge a closer alliance; and further consolidation could well follow.Executives involved in those deals could do worse than look at Air France and KLM.The two national carriers announced they would merge in 2004. Today, the company is profitable, despite the considerable challenges of bringing together cultures, infrastructure and route networks.For the merger to succeed, technology had to be at the forefront of integration efforts. For the new airline’s cargo operations – which employ 5,500 people and account for turnover of €2.7bn ($3.7bn) – this meant creating a single system for sales agents, which would allow them to place freight bookings on either Air France or KLM’s legacy systems from one screen.The two airlines’ IT departments initially considered building a single IT system for cargo operations, but initially this was dismissed as too risky. Air France-KLM continues to work on a next-generation core business system but in the interim, the airlines needed software to integrate the two booking systems that could be built quickly, at a reasonable cost, and without interfering with the operations of existing cargo management software.As a result, the airlines decided to create a single user interface for sales staff to use, which would connect to both “legacy” mainframe systems: Air France’s Unisys platform, based in Sophia Antipolis, in southern France, and KLM’s IBM-based architecture in Amsterdam.In addition, the new system needed to be able to handle cargo sales from the two airlines’ existing partners, Northwest in the case of KLM and Delta for Air France. But, under the terms of each airline’s anti-trust protection, sales staff from KLM could not be allowed to see into Delta’s systems and Air France staff could not be given access to Northwest bookings.The result was a new cargo sales system known as the Unique Voice Portal. Built by Unisys and hosted in a data centre in Minneapolis, the system had to be equally accessible for Air France and KLM staff and to work not just for employees in the main offices, but also for those in the airlines’ numerous overseas “stations”.Implementing the portal took five months, and was an important step both from a technology and a morale point of view.Staff needed to feel they were working for the combined airline even if, in practice, bookings were routed to the legacy systems behind the scenes.“Cargo was the front runner in integration for Air France-KLM. We needed something for the sales staff to show that we were moving to a new organisation, and to make it easy for them to lose the KLM or Air France point of view,” says Hans Zwitzer, manager for business architecture for Air France-KLM Cargo.Making the system work involved more than creating a single portal, however. The combined cargo organisation also had to integrate three databases, covering pricing, customers and products, in order for the single portal to work.This led Air France-KLM Cargo to embark on a parallel project to address data quality and data migration, using technology from data integration vendor Informatica.Previously, the staff had only looked at data quality if a problem arose. The need to build combined databases meant there was an opportunity to look at the integrity of data in the system.“That part of the project was complex because we had different sources of information, from structured databases to Excel spreadsheets. The other was the data quality angle. We thought that if we were going to do it, we might as well do it right,” says Mr Zwitzer.Some of the results were dramatic. “In the case of the KLM customer database, there were twice as many customer records as there were actual customers,” explains Mark-jan Beutler, information manager at KLM Cargo. “The data was very polluted.”Cleaning up the data was a prerequisite to offering an integrated cargo service to customers of both airlines, and it was also a vital part of delivering a working system on time.“Firstly we had to make sure that the customer databases were aligned,” says Mr Zwitzer. “We had some customers that only use Air France and some customers that were only using KLM, but, of course, we both had the same customer in our databases. So we had to bring them together. The next was the contract and pricing structures, to be able to align them completely. Then you get into the real money.”The next phase of the work will be to use the integrated system to drive up revenues. “The idea is that it should generate more money, but that is very difficult to measure,” says Mark-jan Beutler. “It is very difficult to tie flight loadings, for example, to the user-facing system. The next phase of systems will help to generate more revenues.”But there have already been benefits to Air France-KLM, such as helping reassure staff they are working for an integrated company, and for cargo customers, who have access to a much more comprehensive route network.“The advantage for the customer is, when the booking agent has a clear overview of both the Air France and KLM networks, they can offer different options,” says Mr Zwitzer.“That is very valuable for the customer. It is again difficult to measure, but it means the customer is less likely to go to Lufthansa or British Airways.”"
441;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-10-03T08:52:53Z;Environment: Green issues move up the balance sheet;;Ryanair shareholders attending the company’s general meeting in Dublin in September were bemused by a sight not often associated with such gatherings, when a bare-chested young man wearing an oxygen mask approached the podium where Michael O’Leary, the chief executive, was speaking.The protestor, with “Exposing O’Leary’s Lies” written across his chest, accused the airline chief of denying the damage his fleet was causing to the climate. His protest underlined the pressure aviation companies are under from the green movement.All air travel accounts for only a few per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, but its projected expansion means it will become a much bigger source of emissions within 20 years.Flying also produces much more carbon dioxide than some other forms of transport.The rising number of short-haul flights to destinations that could be served by railways, which produce less carbon per passenger, has been a complaint of environmentalists.Campaigners say airlines have had unfair tax breaks on fuel that have skewed the economics of travel. Will corporate aviation be the next target for protests?Joshua Blackburn, head of the ethical communications agency Provokateur, says it is unlikely that protestors will home in on corporate jets and business travel soon, as they are targeting the industry as a whole rather than niches.But he warns that corporate travellers must become more aware of their impact, especially those using company or business hire jets.“Using corporate jets puts you at the front of the queue as far as your carbon footprint is concerned. There isn’t much else that would make your footprint bigger.”He predicts that such trips will become “socially unacceptable” and that environmental groups will target companies that claim to be “green” but continue using “this form of corporate indulgence”.The corporate aviation sector is becoming increasingly aware of the threat to its reputation of failing to deal with climate change.Mr O’Leary called his lone protestor an “eco-looney”, but other parts of the industry have taken a more conciliatory approach, seeking to reduce the impact of their flights.For instance, Boeing has worked with seven airlines in the past year – including British Airways, Air France KLM, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and El Al – on a “performance improvement package” of fuel-efficiency technologies that save 1,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per aircraft per year.There is an economic advantage, too. Per Noren, vice-president of environmental strategy at Boeing’s commercial aviation services division, says: “Operational efficiencies become environmental efficiencies and the aviation community can contribute to a cleaner future.”But voluntary measures are only part of the picture. Regulation is also increasing, in Europe at least.Airlines will be covered by the European Union’s emissions trading scheme from 2012. They will be allocated a fixed quota of carbon emissions, and must buy carbon permits from other groups if they need to emit more.This will impose large costs. Robert Casamento, a director in the power and utilities team at Ernst & Young, says: “Airlines incur very high carbon abatement costs compared with other industrial sectors.“In addition, many expected technological improvements, such as fuel-efficient engine designs and lighter-weight components, will not be in place in time to achieve significant emission reductions before 2022.”A report last year by Ernst & Young predicted that the cost to the European aviation industry of purchasing the emissions allowances needed for traffic growth could exceed €45bn ($62bn) in the period from 2012 to 2022.Mr Casamento says this could have the effect of “jeopardising the long-term viability of many airlines and increasing the need for further consolidation. Some European airlines are already beginning to develop carbon-hedging programs.”The costs will translate directly into higher ticket prices for all travellers.One aspect of the regulations that is still unclear is the treatment of private and corporate jets. One proposal would exempt such flights from the scheme, provided “carbon offsets” are bought to cover the emissions.Offset schemes allow travellers to cancel out the effect of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which fund carbon-cutting schemes, such as wind turbines or solar panels, usually in developing countries. They are already used by many corporate travellers and several charter and fractional schemes.A separate proposal would exempt companies making fewer than 245 flights in four months.But if corporate and private jets are included, it would “impose a serious administrative burden”, says Mark Bissett, partner at Stephenson Harwood, a law firm.Companies would pay a financial penalty in having to buy emissions permits, but more costly would be ensuring compliance with the scheme through monitoring emissions and having them independently verified.At least, however, companies could deflect the wrath of environmentalists by pointing to their compliance with the emissions trading scheme.
442;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-09-30T22:33:20Z;Chicago Midway in $2.5bn privatisation deal;;Chicago Midway on Tuesday became the first big US airline hub to be put up for privatisation in a $2.5bn deal with a consortium, including Canada’s Vancouver airport.The price was equivalent to more than 28 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, making it one of the most highly valued global airport deals behind the record sale of Budapest airport to BAA of the UK in 2005. (Budapest was subsequently sold to Germany’s Hochtief).Midway, with five runways, handled nearly 304,000 flights and more than 19m passengers last year.It is served by six airlines led by Southwest Airlines and including AirTran Airways, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines.Midway Investment and Development Company (Midco), a consortium consisting of Citi Infrastructure Investors, YVR Airport Services (a joint venture between Vancouver airport and Citi Infrastructure Investors) and John Hancock Life Insurance is to buy a 99-year lease on Chicago’s second largest airport.Vancouver has interests in 18 other airports.The consortium defeated bidders including Hochtief with Goldman Sachs, Aéroports de Paris with Morgan Stanley, a consortium led by Australia’s Macquarie group, and a consortium including Babcock & Brown, Gecas and Abertis.The deal represents a breakthrough for airport privatisation in the US and underlines the lead taken by Chicago in privatising infrastructure. It pioneered road privatisation with the sale of a 99-year lease on the Chicago Skyway road in 2005 and followed that with the sale of the city’s underground car parks.The sale of Midway airport is subject to approval by Chicago City Council and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) but is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The city was advised in the sale by Credit Suisse.The US has lagged behind many other countries in the privatisation of its airports and the Midway deal is the first to be completed as part of the FAA’s airport privatisation pilot programme introduced in 1996.The law only allows five US airports to be privatised, each one in a different size category, and only one of which could be a “hub” airport the size of Midway.The limits on the programme have not stopped other cities, including nearby Milwaukee, from considering privatisation plans for their airports. Under the FAA regulations, airport privatisations have to be approved by at least 65 per cent of the airlines operating at the airport, which has proved an obstacle to other deals.Southwest, Delta, Northwest and AirTran have all formally committed to support the sale, while Frontier, which is in bankruptcy administration, has also expressed its backing.Additional reporting by Justin Baer in New York
443;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-09-17T20:40:21Z;US investor anxieties intensify;;US stocks took scant comfort from the government’s historic rescue of American International Group as investor anxiety intensified over near unprecedented turmoil in the financial system.Led by the financial sector, which fell 8.9 per cent, the market once again slumped in what has emerged as one of the most extraordinary series of developments in financial history.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, a measure of future movements known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 19.2 per cent to 36.13, surpassing the level reached when Bear Stearns collapsed in March.The future of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – the two remaining independent US investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and forced sale of Merrill Lynch earlier this week – capped a long list of worries.As the cost to insure against default of their debt surged, their shares lost 24.2 per cent to $21.75 and 13.9 per cent, to $114.50 respectively.Still, more bullish observers argued such instruments unfairly inflicted heavy losses on the share prices, especially given that Morgan’s third-quarter results were not as bad as analysts had expected. Chris Orndorff, head of equities at Payden & Rygel, noted credit default swaps were relatively thinly traded and could be subject to manipulation.Nevertheless, he added AIG alone had been “just a staggering chain of events.” Traders were asking themselves “who else was close to the edge” in its wake.Washington Mutual shed 13.4 per cent to $2.01. Merrill Lynch said the savings and loans institution would seriously consider a merger offer, particularly given that credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s has downgraded it to junk status.Other financials to sustain heavy losses included Wachovia, which fell 20.8 per cent at $9.12, Genworth Financial which fell 25.8 per cent to $3.42 and Citigroup, which was down 10.9 per cent at $1.72.In recent sessions, concerns had mounted that a failure of AIG would further convulse an already fragile financial sector. But in spite of the government seizure of AIG, the market continued its slide.AIG itself sank 45.3 per cent to $2.05. Under the terms of the rescue package, the Federal Reserve will take control of 79.9 per cent of its equity.By the close in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 index had fallen by as much as it had on Monday, itself the biggest one-day decline since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. It fell 4.7 per cent at 1,1156.39. The Nasdaq Composite was 4.9 per cent lower at 2,098.85, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.1 per cent at 10,609.66.Yet Barclays Capital Research cautioned: “To put the 2007-08 move into context, for the S&P decline to equal the average or median decline of a historical bear market in terms of price and time, history suggests that it would need to weaken another 10-15 per cent over the next 10-15 months.”Meanwhile, in the wake of continued heavy losses in financial stocks, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced measures designed to stem selling a stock short without first borrowing the shares or ensuring that the shares can be borrowed.Financials now acccount for 15 per cent of the S&P 500’s total market capitalisation. When the financial crisis surfaced in July last year, it accounted for more than 20 per cent.General Electric, the world’s third-biggest company, fell 6.7 per cent to $23.00. GE last year garnered half of its profit from financial activities last year, yet other industrials sustained heavy losses. The sector was off 4.8 per cent.Meanwhile, data showing that construction of homes fell to a 17½ year low served to remind that the difficulties are not confined to the financial sector.Elsewhere, lower oil prices – which gave airlines a boost in the previous session – rebounded, to above $94.Delta pared most of Tuesday’s 11.9 per cent jump down 9.5 per cent to $9.00. Northwest which gained 19.4 per cent in the previous session, fell 9.8 per cent to $10.55.The telecoms sector fell 2.2 per cent as Nortel lost 49.4 per cent to $2.68,on renewed concerns. Sprint Nextel shed 11.9 per cent to $5.79.
444;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-09-16T20:43:05Z;Wall St up on AIG rescue hopes;;"Hopes that the US authorities might help ailing insurer American International Group lifted Wall Street stocks into positive territory on Tuesday.The session began in downbeat fashion after Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agencies, downgraded credit ratings on AIG.By the close, shares in AIG itself had sunk another 21.2 per cent to $3.75 as traders questioned its ability to secure capital to avoid more downgrades.Throughout the day, the market saw extremely volatile trading as financials see-sawed amid speculation that the government might provide assistance to keep the embattled insurer, which sits at the heart of the financial system, afloat. Still, Henry Paulson, US Treasury secretary, opposed further use of government money for bail-outs, according to CNBC.Rivals of AIG jumped. AxisChubb and Travelers rallied 9.3 per cent to $34.42, 13.5 per cent to $55.05 and 11.8 per cent to $48.86, respectively.The wider financial sector fell as much as 3.7 per cent, yet later pared those losses. By the close, the S&P financials index stood 6.2 per cent higher on the prospect that a solution might be forthcoming.The rally came even though the Federal Reserve unexpectedly opted to leave interest rates on hold.“It’s all over the place,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment Management. “It’s a wild market.”Bank of America, which has agreed to buy Merrill Lynch, rose 11.3 per cent higher at $29.55. Washington Mutual, which had its credit rating cut to junk by S&P, rose 16 per cent to $2.32.Elsewhere, there were mounting signs that strains on the financial system were worsening.Weighing significantly on sentiment was a jump in overnight lending rates and Goldman Sachs’ biggest drop in profit in its nine-year history as a public company.Goldman Sachs fell 1.8 per cent to $133.01 after reporting that its third-quarter net income fell 70 per cent.Meanwhile, it emerged that the Federal Reserve injected $50bn in an early overnight money market operation and said it stood ready to provide liquidity as needed.Morgan Stanley, which along with Goldman is one of the two remaining independent US investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and forced sale of Merrill Lynch, fell another 10.8 per cent to $28.70.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.8 per cent at 1,213.60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent higher at 11,059.02 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.3 per cent at 2,207.90.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge and which on Tuesday reached a level not seen since the collapse of Bear Stearns in March, rose as much as 6.3 per cent, only to fall back later in the session. By mid-afternoon in New York, the Vix stood 4.6 per cent lower at 30.24.In the previous session, the S&P 500 suffered its worst day since the September 2001 terrorist attacks when it plunged 4.7 per cent.Inflation data released ahead of the Federal Reserve’s meeting showed that US consumer prices dropped 0.1 per cent in August, the first decline in nearly two years.Further good news on inflation came from another sharp slide for oil, which
took US crude to below $94 a barrel. Still, energy producers rose 3.9 per cent in spite of the decline.As on Monday, the oil price helped certain sectors such as consumer discretionaries, which stood 0.6 per cent higher.Airlines also benefited. Delta and Northwest rose by 23.5 per cent to $9.94 and 19.4 per cent to $11.69.Meanwhile in technology, Dell warned of a softening in demand for global technology, pushing shares in the computer maker down 11.2 per cent to $15.98. However, the sector as a whole remained in positive territory, edging up 0.6 per cent. Hewlett-Packard rose 6.8 per cent at $48.41. It expects to incur $1.7bn of expenses this quarter due to 24,600 job cuts over three years.Apple edged down 0.3 per cent to $139.88 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “conviction buy” list. It expects to incur $1.7bn of expenses this quarter owing to 24,600 planned job cuts over three years.Meanwhile, Best Buy dropped 3 per cent to $42.40 after the electronics retailer missed second-quarter earning forecasts."
445;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-09-15T20:50:50Z;US stocks plummet to 3-year lows;;The Wall Street crisis prompted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and fears over AIG resulted in the biggest fall for US stocks since the September 11 attacks to their lowest level for nearly three years.Given its strong links to other financials through derivative contracts and other types of exposure, the shock of Lehman’s bankruptcy filing raised fresh concerns over the health of other financial institutions.The financial sector led declines among sectors in the S&P 500. It fell 10 per cent, which took its decline for the year to more than a third.The wider index closed down 4.7 per cent at 1,192.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.4 per cent lower at 10,917.51. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.6 per cent to 2,179.91.“Terrible – suicidal, maybe,” said Ben Warwick, chief investment officer at Sovereign Wealth Management of the mood on trading desks on Monday. RBS Greenwich analysts, meanwhile, described the session as a “new Black Monday for the financial market history books.”Underscoring the turmoil in financials, the cost of buying insurance on credit rose as investors sought to protect themselves against another collapse.Credit default swaps on most financial companies surged. Default protection on insurer AIG, for example, jumped to 35 points up front, or a $3.5mln payment plus $500,000 annually to insure $10mln of bonds for five years, according to Markit data. On Friday, it cost 12.5 points up front.Such jumps fed a sharp rise in equity volatility, illustrating the links between stocks and credit insurance. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 23.6 per cent to 31.7, a level not seen since the collapse of Bear Stearns in March.Still, Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital cautioned the index had “yet to enter the cathartic blow-out levels that typically marks a bottom.”American International Group sank another 60.8 per cent to $4.76 even after authorities threw the ailing insurer a $20bn lifeline. It came after Ken Lewis, Bank of America chief executive, told CNBC television that an AIG failure would be “much bigger problem” than Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.Meanwhile, the news that Bank of America was buying Merrill Lynch in a $50m all-share deal prompted a sharp slide in BofA. The shares fell 21.3 per cent to $26.55.Shares in Merrill were broadly flat, edging up 0.1 per cent at $17.06, well below the $29-a-share offer. Traders said the price for Merrill could fall after BofA goes through the books at Merrill in order to sign off on the deal.The two independent US investment banks still standing – Goldman Sachs, which reports its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley – fell 12.1 per cent to $135.50 and 13.5 per cent at $32.19, respectively.Moreover, implied volatility of both General Electric, one of the world’s largest issuers of debt, as well as Citigroup – a measure of expected future movements over the next month – have all risen to an all-time high.Washington Mutual slid another 26.7 per cent to $2 amid growing anxiety over the largest US savings and loan’s ability to raise capital.Elsewhere in financials, Citigroup fell 15.1 per cent at $15.24. American Express, the credit card company, lost 8.9 per cent at $35.48. Wachovia lost 25 per cent to $10.71Among the non-financial casualties, Idearc, the directories business, fell 19.7 per cent to $1.02. General Electric retreated 8 per cent at $24.60.In spite of the turmoil, some market analysts remained relatively sanguine. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi, said financials “should provide very attractive entry points. The sale of Merrill to Bank of America suggests less of a chance of a domino effect.”Meanwhile, a sharp drop in oil prices to below $95 a barrel – led the energy sector 6.9 per cent lower. Other sectors posting big drops included industrials, telecoms, materials and technology.Earlier in the day, the oil price decline gave some sectors a respite. Transport stocks enjoyed a boost. Delta Air Lines, for example, rose 4.8 per cent at one point in the session, only to finish 1 per cent lower at $8.05.Consumer stocks also held up better than the wider market and some of the more defensive or recession-proof names rallied. Coca-Cola rose 0.5 per cent at $54.75.

Why do big companies routinely overlook new opportunities that are apparently staring them in the face? Why did Nestlé and Kraft fail to predict the popularity of Starbucks, for example? Why did not American Airlines or Delta Air Lines create Southwest Airlines?Marketing consultants Craig Stull, Phil Myers and David Meerman Scott offer a simple explanation: most of the time, companies look at customers and markets from inside their current operations, rather than adopting an “outside-in” perspective: they simply don’t see things as customers do.Their book offers a six-step recipe for overcoming this tendency. The first, most important step sounds obvious: search for the problems customers want solving. But this, it turns out, is easier said than done.Many executives mistakenly think that because they are experts in their product or service they are experts in their customers’ problems. But the two are not the same. Organisations often pay lip-service to solving customer problems, but the focus of their innovation efforts is to solve their own problems: to feed factories with orders, achieve targets and extend their brands’ reach.Sometimes they focus too hard on what their existing customers want. However, the fact that they are already customers usually means they want just a variation on what they are already getting. This stops companies looking at opportunities to serve people who are not yet customers.Sometimes managers may equate innovation with new technologies, overlooking more basic customer problems. Sometimes they are so focused on “beating the competition” that they forget about customers. Sometimes they are so obsessed with revenue targets that they push products at customers rather than listening to them.To avoid these pitfalls executives should follow some simple rules, such as get out of the office, directly observe what people do and listen carefully to what they have to say. Then, think hard about the problems you see. You’ll know your “tuned-in” thinking is working when the product or service you come up with “resonates” – when you don’t have to educate or persuade customers to buy it, because it simply sells itself.This approach is the linchpin of the book. The other five steps involve detailed implementation. Step two is to identify different “buying personas” – that is, “definable groups of people who share the same problems”. The authors cite the example of car-sharing firm Zipcar, which deliberately appeals to different groups – city dwellers wanting the occasional use of a car, landlords wanting to offer a little extra to their tenants, and the environmentally concerned – with just slight service and communication tweaks.Step three is to get hard data: are people prepared to pay for it? (Market research is not a substitute for insight; it should be a product of this insight.) Step four is to make every step of the buyer process an experience that resonates, from discovering and buying the product through its packaging, use and after-sales. Step five is about articulating the idea (which is about buyer beliefs, not product descriptions) and step six is about communicating it (stop pitching your product and create information that answers buying personas’ questions).So far, so good: it is hard to disagree with anything the authors say. But the case studies they dwell on – such as Disneyland at its inception, event ticket market StubHub and wedding planning service The Knot – are all examples of the creation of new markets and/or business models. The few examples they cite of innovations within mature markets, such as a TV remote that beeps if you lose it, appear lame in comparison.The authors start the book with companies asking themselves “Why didn’t we think of that?” But ultimately they fail to show how companies can avoid such a situation. For example, they seem to believe it is as easy to create breakthrough products and services in mature markets as in new ones. And they fail to recognise the real pressures market leaders in mature markets feel: the need to feed and protect legacy assets, such as factories and brands, when innovations that cannibalise existing sales or take them beyond tried and tested boundaries often loom as threats not opportunities.Without deeper answers to such dilemmas, Tuned In falls back on exhortation. But it may be useful exhortation, nevertheless."

Crude oil fell as much as $8 a barrel before paring early losses.ExxonMobil dropped 3.4 per cent to $77.32 while ConocoPhillips dipped 4.3 per cent to $79. and refiner Tesoro slid 6.9 per cent to $17.28. Coal companies were particularly hard hit. Massey Energy dropped 10 per cent to $59.35, Arch Coal slid 14.8 per cent to $46.19 and Consol Energy lost 8.55 per cent to $61.92. So far this quarter, energy has been the worst performing sector, down 18.7 per cent. The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
448;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-09-02T18:15:52Z;Helping retailers find a common language;;"US retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot advertise to America’s Hispanic consumers on Spanish-language television. Some, such as JC Penney, operate bilingual customer service centres that can take orders over the phone.But online shopping, which now accounts for about 7 per cent of US retail spending, has largely remained an English language experience – because getting a rapidly changing e-commerce website to speak Spanish as well entails much more than hiring a few translators.“It traditionally involves a lot of IT infrastructure work. And one of the big obstacles is the idea that they’d have to invest, or hire someone to manage a Spanish language site . . . and retail is such a low-margin business,” says John Yunker of Byte Level, a consultancy focused on website globalisation.But there are signs of change ahead, driven largely by the growing success of a web services company, MotionPoint, which set out to find a technology-based solution to the problem of getting a single website to speak more than one language.Since it was founded in 2000, MotionPoint has expanded rapidly over the past two years to a client list that now includes more than 200 companies, including Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Amtrak and Domino’s Pizza.MotionPoint still uses human translators. But, according to Will Fleming, its chief executive and founder, translation only accounts for a quarter of the activity involved in forming a multilingual version of a site; IT infrastructure and site management challenges make up the rest.“We are a technology company, not a translation company,” he says. “We don’t claim to actually translate the words faster than anyone else.”When a customer wants to access a foreign language version of a particular site, page or item, a MotionPoint server passes on the request to the original site. The response, in English, prompts MotionPoint to retrieve a previously translated version of the page or item held in its own stored data and send it on to the customer.The foreign language versions of each page or product are kept updated by human translators, who use software that ensures the translation fits the space available on the page. They are also automatically alerted to changes made on the original site, enabling material to be updated within a few hours rather than the days required by a “traditional” operation with translators not working directly on a web-based system.Chuck Whiteman, who handles client relations for the company, says that its claims have often been met by scepticism – such as its ability to launch a fully translated site within three months, against the one year or more required by other solutions. Delta Air Lines, he says, challenged the veracity of AmTrak’s endorsement of the service before it started working with MotionPoint on its global reservation site in 2005. The scepticism, much of it from the IT department, was overcome, and Delta adopted the service for multiple languages, including Japanese.MotionPoint’s clients include international brands such as Puma and Delta, but the company says that about three-quarters of its business is now focused on the US Hispanic market. Late last year, it worked with Best Buy, the largest US home electronics retailer, to launch a Spanish version of its e-commerce site.Best Buy, says Mr Whiteman, also initially doubted its claim it could produce a Spanish version of its site in less than 90 days. “In the end, we did it in 87,” he says.The comparative ease with which MotionPoint is able to translate entire sites has enabled some of its customers to adopt online languages they might not otherwise have considered. Amtrak, the US passenger train operator, initially used MotionPoint to create a Spanish-language reservation site. When it realised how popular this was with customers coming from Europe, it added a German-language version too.Elsewhere, only a handful of US retailers offer bilingual websites, lagging behind banks, insurance companies, airlines and telephone companies. And most of the sites that are available in Spanish, such as Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, or Walgreens, the drugstore, offer only product information or advice rather than the opportunity to buy online.But in a reflection of the growing interest among retailers, Amazon, the largest US online retailer, has used its own resources to launch Spanish pages for Spanish-language books and software.Jupiter Research forecast last year that Hispanic consumers would account for 13 per cent of US sales on the internet in 2011.Steve Davis of GSI Commerce, which provides global web services to retailers, notes that MotionPoint’s solution is particularly suited to US sites, in contrast to Europe, where site owners wishing to serve more than one language group have simply constructed separate sites from the ground up. In the US, he says, translating a site into Spanish can be like “trying to change the engine when the car is going full speed down the road.”Mr Yunker at Byte Level says US retailers and others now going into Spanish online still have work to do, such as deciding whether to opt for a specific regional dialect or aiming for a more standardised version of the language. And there is still no standard approach over the best way of guiding Hispanic customers on-screen to the Spanish version of a site. But those customers, he argues, are likely to appreciate the effort, even those who speak perfect English.“If you look at the demographics in the US, you have to plan for working in more than one language if you want to connect,” says Mr Yunker. “Even if people are speaking in English, they might still be dreaming in Spanish.”"
449;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-08-31T19:18:40Z;Opposition mounts to BA-American plan;;British Airways must be hoping that “third time lucky” omens will favour its latest attempt to get closer to American Airlines, but mounting resistance from its rivals is an ominous portent that it will find hard to dismiss.By the end of last week, at least seven major airlines had formally petitioned the US Department of Transportation for access to confidential submissions by BA and American supporting their mid-August application for antitrust immunity for their joint business agreement (JBA).This is not out of the ordinary, neither is the decision last week by the European Commission to look into the tie-up between BA, American and Iberia, which is in talks to merge with its bigger British counterpart. A BA spokesman says “it is all part of the process”, but it now seems likely that BA’s hopes of a quick resolution are fading rapidly. What has already been a prolonged courtship – going back to the mid-1990s – is being dragged out even longer by ever watchful chaperones who want to ensure that a marriage between their charges is not at everyone else’s expense.The JBA will allow BA and American, as well as Iberia, to share revenues and co-ordinate prices, capacity, schedules and routes on flights between the US, Canada and Mexico and the European Union’s 27 member-states, Norway and Switzerland.BA and American have been down this road twice before – but their previous applications for antitrust immunity in 1997 and 2001 met with stiff resistance, with cartel watchdogs demanding concessions that the carriers were not prepared to make.The application for antitrust immunity also includes Finnair and Royal Jordanian, who are part of the Oneworld alliance, of which American and BA are key members.Three recent developments since the previous abortive efforts will no doubt help the latest joint-venture bid. The first is the “open skies” agreement in March between the EU and the US, which removes some of the barriers to airlines working closer together. Second, the DoT granted antitrust immunity to members of the Skyteam alliance (which includes Air France, Delta and Northwest among others), setting a useful precedent.BA and American made subtle reference to this event in their filings, indicating that their timeframe to implement their agreement would be similar to that given to Skyteam after it was granted immunity. And the third development has been the rapid economic downturn combined with steep oil prices, putting pressure on airlines everywhere. Many airline analysts have suggested that consolidation might be the only way to keep major airlines aloft.Willie Walsh, BA’s chief executive, said recently that he had seen a softening in regulators’ attitudes towards airlines because of their current circumstances.So there is some irony that tough market conditions, which BA has not escaped, might fly to its rescue.Virgin Atlantic, a long-time rival, is doing its best to undermine this factor. The airline’s website carries a quote from the American Antitrust Institute, which in July said antitrust laws were not suspended during an economic downturn and industry distress for good reason. “When the economy recovers, competition and consumers would be faced with a permanently changed and potentially impaired market structure. Undoubtedly prices for air travel would increase.”Other than Virgin (which has a loose arrangement with the Star Alliance), Delta Airlines (part of Skyteam) is the only other carrier that has publicly spoken out about BA and American’s proposed tie-up.Delta said it generally supported the BA-American link-up, but was opposed to immunity unless they relinquished “significant’’ flight slots at London’s Heathrow airport, where BA and American have more than 200,000 slots each year. Virgin, which has 17,000, says that the JBA would give BA-American about 60 per cent of the air traffic between Heathrow and the US.Affidavits lodged since mid-August at the Department of Transportation reveal that Lufthansa, United Airlines, Continental, Northwest and US Airways have also asked to see secret documents filed by the would-be joint-venture partners.It is still early days in the process – the DoT has yet to invite public comment – but regulators on both sides of the Atlantic may be hard pressed to take a hard line against BA and American.
450;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-08-14T18:33:43Z;Transatlantic venture faces close scrutiny;;British Airways and American Airlines must decide how much pain they can take from US and European competition regulators, as they try yet again to form a joint venture across the North Atlantic.They have filed applications twice before in 1997 and 2001, and on each occasion, the concessions demanded by the cartel watchdogs were deemed to be too onerous and too damaging to the airlines’ existing businesses.During the past decade, however, the two airlines have increasingly lost market share in the US/Europe aviation market to rivals that have been granted antitrust immunity which allow them to collude legally through transatlantic alliances.BA and American - this time with a third partner in the shape of Spain’s Iberia - have decided they must try yet again to close the gap with competitors.The goal is to form a joint venture on North Atlantic routes. They would be able to share revenues, jointly arrange capacity, networks, pricing and sales, a particular advantage in dealing with corporate customers.The model for such integration is the business alliance established by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest Airlines of the US, which have been operating a transatlantic joint venture for more than 10 years, leading to significant gains in both revenues and in cost savings.The KLM/Northwest partnership went further than the deal planned by BA/AA/Iberia, however, by sharing profits and losses in the venture with a common bottom line.The most ambitious aviation alliance to have received antitrust immunity is between Air France-KLM, parent company of KLM and the world’s biggest airline measured by turnover, and its US partners Delta Air Lines and Northwest. This venture, which will replace the older KLM/Northwest partnership, will encompass routes generating a turnover of $12bn within a couple of years and will account for around 30 per cent of the North Atlantic market.The detailed regulation of international aviation and continuing limits on foreign ownership of airlines still block full global airline mergers and acquisitions. Joint ventures with antitrust immunity are the next best thing.Willie Walsh and Gerard Arpey, BA and American chief executives, along with Fernando Conte of Iberia, believe the competitive landscape has changed sufficiently to get them a much more sympathetic hearing in Washington and Brussels this time round.In 2002 the US transportation department (DoT) demanded the two carriers should hand over to competitors highly-prized take off and landing slots for 16 daily departures at London Heathrow, BA’s global hub, the equivalent of 224 weekly slots at the highly congested airport.The regulatory price was far too high to contemplate for both Rod Eddington and Don Carty, at the time the respective chief executives of BA and American. The number of slots to be given up was equal to the whole of American’s operation at Heathrow.Mr Carty had argued to Norman Mineta, the then US transportation secretary, that it was “like allowing Sears to merge with Penney’s but only if Penney’s gives away all of their store locations, regardless of whether they are in competing locations and regardless of the competition that would remain and be created by others by virtue of their merger.”The argument was to no avail, and BA and American withdrew their application on the grounds there was “little chance” of agreeing an acceptable set of conditions.They have been forced back into the fray, however, by the ground they have lost since to the joint ventures set up by rivals, led respectively by Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines within the SkyTeam alliance, and by Lufthansa and United within Star alliance, which have both been granted antitrust immunity.Mr Walsh and Mr Arpey can well argue - although Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic loudly disagrees - that the competitive environment has changed radically since the groups’ last application in 2001, and since 1996, when BA and American first disclosed plans for an alliance.Both previous attempts to gain antitrust immunity were made in an era when aviation relations between the US and the UK were tense and were caught up in the restrictive practices of the so-called Bermuda II UK/US aviation treaty.In the early 1990s, the US was busy imposing its template for aviation liberalisation on the world through so-called “open skies” treaties, the first of which was signed with the Netherlands in 1992, opening the way for the KLM/Northwest venture being granted antitrust immunity.Washington was unable to reach such an agreement with the UK, however, in more than a decade of fruitless talks, and the impasse was only broken when the mandate for bilateral aviation negotiations was transferred by all European member states to Brussels.The EU finally agreed an “open skies” treaty with Washington last year, which came into operation at the end of March.Most importantly for the ambitions of BA and American, the US/EU accord opened Heathrow airport, the key gateway in Europe for travellers from the US, for the first time to full competition for all EU and US carriers.The previous Bermuda II UK/US bilateral treaty had allowed only four airlines, BA, American, United and Virgin Atlantic to operate direct flights between Heathrow and the US.This summer, four other US carriers — Continental, Delta, Northwest and US Airways — have all entered the Heathrow market for the first time, while Air France has also launched its first long-haul service from Heathrow to Los Angeles.The US carriers have shown they could acquire take off and landing slots at the highly congested airport, a move they had previously said was impossible.BA and American are hoping the entry by these airlines to Heathrow will show the regulators that competition has already been intensified, and that it should remove or at least greatly reduce the need for them to relinquish any of their own highly lucrative take off and landing slots.…………………………………………………………………………………………………..Virgin worried about squeezeThe UK is unique in Europe in having two strong long-haul carriers in British Airways and Virgin Atlantic.Virgin, for long an irritant to BA, is worried it will end up badly squeezed. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin's president, claims the alliance will damage competition on transatlantic routes and hurt consumers.Whether Virgin succeeds depends on how broadly competition authorities in Washington and Brussels define the market.Sir Richard will focus his attack on the market between Heathrow and the US where BA and American are dominant, albeit with many competitors.BA and American will concentrate on the broader market between the US and Europe, where they have already fallen behind rival groups led by Air France-KLM and Delta, and by Lufthansa and United.According to Ascend, an aviation consultancy, Air France, KLM, Delta and Northwest, which have antitrust immunity, account for 24 per cent of seats in the Europe-north America market. Lufthansa, United and Air Canada, which are seeking immunity with Continental, would have a share of 27 per cent.BA, American and Iberia would have 18 per cent.In Virgin's view the key issue should be the dominance of a combined BA/American on individual routes. There are six Heathrow routes on which BA and American overlap where competition would be reduced, according to Virgin.For instance, Virgin says BA and American account for 63 per cent of seat capacity between Heathrow and New York JFK.
451;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-07-17T14:56:40Z;Fuel costs drag Continental into $3m loss;;Continental Airlines swung to a loss, as mounting jet fuel costs offset gains in revenue from passengers and cargo.Echoing larger rivals American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which each unveiled quarterly losses of more than $1bn on Wednesday, Continental on Thursday called the current climate “the worst financial environment for US network carriers since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.”Continental’s second-quarter loss of $3m, or 3 cents a share, compared with net income of $228m, or $2.03, a year earlier. Excluding a tax gain, the company lost $25m, or 25 cents.As American and Delta did a day earlier, the Houston-based carrier posted results, excluding certain items, that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. And like those peers, Continental highlighted its efforts to raise cash it may need to weather the industry’s brutal conditions.After jumping more than 38 per cent on Wednesday, Continental’s shares were little changed by midmorning trading in New York.Continental raised $900m during the quarter by amending its credit-card marketing agreement, issuing stock and selling its equity stake in Copa Holdings.Revenue climbed 9 per cent to $4.0bn, paced by gains on transatlantic, Latin American and regional US routes.Operating expenses rose 19 per cent. Fuel costs were by far the biggest culprit, surging 66 per cent to $1.36 bn - almost double the airline’s second-biggest expense, employee wages and salaries.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
453;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American and Delta confident of beating crisis;;American Airlines and Delta Air Lines on Wednesday each reported quarterly losses exceeding $1bn, as both carriers wrote down goodwill, aircraft and other assets devalued by a brutal industrywide downturn.A relentless surge in jet fuel prices and ebbing demand for air travel have forced carriers to cancel routes, slash jobs, retire aircraft and unveil new fees. Struggling to keep pace with the increase in fuel costs, US airlines are lining up as much financing as possible to avert bankruptcy.But the shares of American and Delta jumped more than 20 per cent as both carriers’ results were better than expected, excluding the one-time charges, and they assured investors they had ample liquidity to weather the crisis.American, the world’s largest carrier, reported a quarterly net loss of $1.45bn, or $5.77 a share, including a $1.1bn non-cash charge to account for the decline in value of aircraft and other long-lived assets. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company also recorded $55m in severance costs stemming from job cuts.Excluding those charges, American’s quarterly loss totalled $284m, or $1.13 a share. On that basis, the carrier earned $317m, or $1.08, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 5.1 per cent to $6.18bn.“It’s certainly no mystery to anyone how our results could deteriorate so dramatically from one year to the next, since our roughly $600m drop in earnings coincided with a fuel cost increase of well over $800m,” Gerard Arpey, American’s chairman and chief executive, wrote yesterday in a note to employees.Delta swung to a quarterly loss as writedowns offset what may be one of the US airline industry’s few profitable operations last quarter.Delta, which will supplant American as the largest carrier following its merger with Northwest Airlines later this year, took a $1.2bn charge to reflect the decline in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets since its emergence from bankruptcy last year. The carrier wrote down $6.1bn in goodwill in the first quarter.Its second-quarter net loss totalled $1bn, or $2.64 a share. Excluding the charge and certain cost-cutting expenses, profit fell 50 per cent to $137m, or 35 cents, on high fuel costs. Revenue climbed 9.9 per cent to $5.5bn.Delta slashed its flight schedule in March and again during the June quarter, and now expects capacity to shrink by 4 per cent this year. The airline predicted it would have access to $3.2bn in cash and other liquid investments by year end, including $1bn available through a credit facility. It finished the second quarter with $4.3bn in unrestricted liquidity.Delta upped its cost-savings target through its merger with Northwest, and now expects the deal will trim $2bn from its annual expenses by 2012.American, which has also cut capacity, had $5.5bn in cash and short-term investments at the end of June. The carrier obtained $720m in new financing through the aircraft sales and debt secured with other planes, including $500m it received in July. American also expected to add $480m this period from the sale of its American Beacon unit.The carrier postponed the divestiture of its regional-jet division until market conditions improve.
454;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-07-09T19:52:45Z;Northwest Airlines to slash 2,500 jobs;;Northwest Airlines, whose merger with Delta Air Lines will create the world’s largest carrier, plans to eliminate 2,500 jobs and match its peers in introducing a wave of new passenger fees designed to help insulate the company from record fuel costs.The surge in jet-fuel prices have wiped out the US airline industry’s profits, put smaller rivals out of business and pressed large carriers such as Northwest, Delta and American Airlines to take increasingly desperate steps to eliminate costs and find new sources of revenue.“Our fuel costs have more than doubled in the past year,” Doug Steenland, Northwest chief executive, said in a statement. “In order to manage through this unprecedented fuel challenge, we have to take action to both control costs and increase our revenue.”Northwest’s job cuts, which stem from the company’s decision last month to reduce its total mainline flight schedule by as much as 9.5 per cent during the fourth quarter, will trim about 8 per cent of its total workforce.The carrier aims to reach its goal for eliminating management and front-line positions though voluntary programs and attrition. If it falls short, some employees will be furloughed.Starting on Thursday, Northwest will join American, United Airlines and US Airways in charging passengers $15 to check a single bag. The Minnesota-based company also followed some of its rivals in introducing a temporary service fee on fares purchased with frequent-flyer miles.Northwest also will now charge passengers $150 to change tickets, up from $100.“We expect these three incremental revenue-enhancing measures to generate $250m-$300m a year, which will help ease the burden of these record high oil prices,” Mr Steenland said.Crude oil, the commodity refined into jet fuel, trades at about $136 a barrel.Northwest agreed in April to merge with its Atlanta-based rival, Delta, in part to help endure the run-up in fuel costs and an expected slowdown in demand for air travel.Both conditions have since worsened, renewing concerns that even established legacy carriers can avoid bankruptcy during a prolonged downturn.The merger agreement had underwhelmed investors for failing to target steep cuts to the combined company’s flight capacity and workforce.But that was before fuel expenses forced both carriers to take steps to shed expenses this year, before their deal closes.

So it is no great surprise that British Airways, American Airlines and Spain’s Iberia are to consider some form of joint venture.BA and AA have wanted to work together for more than a decade, but have twice been frustrated by regulators; in 1997, and again in 2001 when the UK airline considered sacrificing 224 landing slots at its home base of Heathrow too great a price too pay. However, since the “open skies” agreement came into force in March this year, allowing any national operator to fly between any two points within the European Union and the US, the landscape has shifted.Bringing in Iberia would be less attractive than the takeover BA contemplated last year but can no longer afford. It would, however, cement ties already established through extensive route-sharing agreements. It might also block advances by Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, who would both be eyeing Iberia’s attractive South American routes.Yet any tie-up should be seen as a purely defensive move designed to protect BA’s core operation, the highly profitable transatlantic business market. Competitors already have, or have applied for, the US antitrust immunity that allows the sharing of operations and co-ordination on ticket pricing. Delta Air Lines and Northwest have immunity for a joint venture with Air France-KLM, while Continental wants to co-operate with Lufthansa, United Airlines and Air Canada.A worsening outlook for business travel is only one of the many problems besetting the industry – aircraft orders are also set to increase long-haul capacity by the largest amount in a decade next year. Any action that can cut seat numbers and improve pricing helps. But alliances are second best to the cross-border mergers needed to rationalise the industry. Until national governments accept this, the playground will remain as vicious as ever.Post and read comments on this Lex"
456;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-06-24T16:20:40Z;Airlines: Flight plans hit by fuel price;;Airlines are used to ups and downs. The current problems facing the industry are sky-high fuel prices and the economic slowdown in some of the sector’s most valuable markets.But airlines have been collectively in profit only twice this millennium – in 2000 and again last year. The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 helped push the industry into recession, and it took until 2007 until the airlines could report a net profit of $5.6bn between them.The International Air Transport Association said this month that fuel prices would force the airlines into a net loss of $2.3bn this year. Even that estimate is based on an old oil price of $106.5 for a barrel of Brent crude – an oil price higher than that punishes the sector even harder.Many other matters are affecting the airlines. Regulation and deregulation have been huge factors, from the web of bilateral agreements between countries about flights between them, to the landing slots available at big airports.Other infrastructure challenges bedevil the sector. Building enough airports and runways to cope with the increase in passenger and freight volumes has been expensive and politically fraught.On both sides of the Atlantic the air traffic control systems are in need of a revamp. Last year in the US, air traffic delays were blamed for $19bn in extra costs for the airlines. And air transport, despite contributing only 2-3 per cent of mankind’s output of greenhouse gases, has been demonised by green campaigners – in part because of the steep rise in that contribution.The pain is being felt most keenly in the US, where the economic slowdown has added most distressingly to high oil prices. The industry’s seven biggest carriers reported operating loses of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, down 7.7 points on the same period last year and the second quarter of loss after a year and a half of profits.But pain is nothing new to US airlines – they have flown in and out of bankruptcy for years. Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways have all in the past invoked Chapter 11 protection from creditors in order to restructure and to trim wage and aircraft costs.Analysts and industry insiders argue that the survival of those carriers did not do the industry any favours – and gave it embedded problems that were bound to crop up later.Restructuring is again in the air for US carriers. Delta Air Lines, which announced in April a merger with Northwest Airlines, targeted 2,000 job losses – and has received twice that number of requests for voluntary redundancy.Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, says that up to 13 per cent of domestic capacity will be trimmed this year. Northwest is also to cut capacity by more than 12 per cent.American Airlines will match that, while United Airlines will go further, with a cut of more than 17 per cent. That is the figure chosen by US Airways, too. Those cutbacks will at least have the effect of easing the infrastructure roadblocks.More mergers may be in prospect too, as other carriers look to the $1bn in cost-savings and revenue rises hoped for from the combined Delta and Northwest.Mergers and acquisitions, along with cutbacks in capacity, would also allow the carriers to continue to put up ticket prices without losing too many passengers to the low-cost airlines.However, United and US Airways have stepped back from consideration of a merger in favour of seeking ways to control costs on their own.Charges for checked-in baggage are another way that the carriers are coping with their financial squeeze – American, United and US charge $15 for a first bag, while most airlines are charging $25 for a second bag.A promising option in a world of high oil prices is to move to more fuel-efficient aircraft and retiring older gas-guzzlers.United aims to put its older Boeing 737s and 747s out to grass if it can agree terms with the lessors that own many of them. American and Continental, among others, are also planning to push some older aircraft out of the hangar door.Retiring older aircraft in favour of newer, more fuel-efficient versions, will help avoid the airines’ pain spreading too quickly to manufacturers, whose order books are currently bulging.But deferrals of orders have started to appear, and some analysts warn that many more are in imminent prospect.“At face value, the feed-through of airlines’ problems to manufacturers is not immediate,” says Charles Alcock of Air Industry News. “Some of the manufacturers have such vast backlogs that deferrals of orders do not impact on their plans for years.”US distress has spread across the Atlantic, with three of the four business-class-only airlines going under in recent months. Maxjet Airways, Eos Airlines and, most recently, Silverjet, found they could not make the model fly.Iata warns of more to come. Giovanni Bisignani, director-general and chief executive, this month told airlines belonging to the trade body: “For every dollar the price of oil goes up, costs go up by $1.6bn.”He pointed out that 24 airlines had gone under in the past six months, despite a steady streamlining in the years since 2001.“The situation is desperate,” he said, calling for help from governments in removing the regulation that prevents consolidation.Europe-based carriers, too, including British Airways, warn that capacity must be trimmed.“Whether cutting capacity will work will depend partly on whether it is done in a fast and decisive way,” says Mr Alcock.It may help. As will the fact that the international economy is heavily reliant on air transport.However, many of the signs suggest that this period will be one of the bigger downturns for the airline industry.
457;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Continental and United in marketing tie-up;;Continental Airlines forged a marketing partnership with United Airlines, the carrier it rejected as a merger partner this year, and plans to seek immunity from US antitrust laws to co-operate with its former rival on transcontinental ventures.The agreement quells the suspense that has surrounded Continental’s next move since the carrier stated its intent to remain independent but seek alliance alternatives, and may presage another attempt by the two airlines to combine.Continental also plans to leave SkyTeam, a confederacy of global airlines that share schedules and honour each other’s frequent-flyer miles, for the rival Star Alliance, which is anchored by United and Germany’s Lufthansa.The airlines industry’s numerous alliances and partnerships vary greatly in the degree of cooperation between any two carriers, and while they don’t match what mergers promise in opportunities to slash costs and eliminate overlapping capacity, they can help companies share revenue, coordinate routes and jointly pursue lucrative corporate accounts.Continental had grown frustrated with its junior position on SkyTeam, whose dominant US members – Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines – plan to combine. Delta and Northwest also enjoy anti-trust immunity with their a transatlantic ally, Air France-KLM. For United, securing a partnership agreement is a welcomed victory following its failed merger discussions with Delta, Continental and US Airways.While American Airlines and British Airways also courted Houston-based Continental, the carrier viewed United’s route network as the better fit, the people said. American and BA in turn are weighing whether to seek anti-trust immunity for their own joint venture.Continental plans to seek approval from US regulators to join the subset of Star Alliance members – including United, Lufthansa and Air Canada who already have anti-trust immunity. The carrier will also seek approval to forge joint ventures with United on international routes, freeing them to coordinate on schedules and fares, and share costs.The ties formed through the new partnership may eventually lead to a full United-Continental tie-up once fuel prices stabilise, as both carriers confront a bigger, stronger global competitor following the close of the Delta-Northwest deal, people familiar with the plans said.Continental said it does not know when it would win the necessary approvals to exit SkyTeam and join Star. While Delta’s merger with Northwest gives Continental the right to sever ties with its allies, the carrier’s contract requires that it must wait until nine months after the deal’s close.Continental dropped its merger discussions with United in April amid concern the companies, already grappling with record fuel costs, would struggle to finance their combination. While stung by the abrupt end to the Continental talks, United’s executives reached the same conclusions a month later as it considered merging with US Airways.By late May, when United broke off discussions with US Airways, the company had made progress in its alliance talks with Continental, people familiar with the matter said.United’s labour contract with its pilots will not hinder its ability to co-ordinate with a domestic competitor, another advantage the company had over American, they said.
458;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-06-17T16:51:22Z;Northwest joins Air Canada in cutting flights;;Air Canada plans to slash 2,000 jobs and reduce capacity by 7 per cent, mostly on US routes, while rival Northwest Airlines stepped up its plans to trim flight schedules, as the carriers race to keep pace with fuel costs that have threatened the industry’s financial stability.Air Canada’s reductions mark the end of a decade of aggressive expansion by the Montreal carrier, as it took advantage of lower regulatory barriers, and the closer integration of the US and Canadian economies after the North American Free Trade Agreement.Northwest, which agreed earlier this year to merge with Delta Air Lines to create a combined company with enough strength to endure a bitter industry-wide downturn, now plans to trim as much as 9.5 per cent of its capacity in the fourth quarter and trim 14 aircraft from its fleet. The carrier said it was too early to tell how the cutbacks would affect its workforce.The other legacy US airlines, including United, Delta, Continental and US Airways, have announced similar moves. United plans to ground a fifth of its fleet, while Continental will cut 3,000 jobs and take 73 aircraft out of service.Air Canada said on Tuesday it would cut US capacity by 13 per cent in the final three months of this year and the first quarter of 2009, compared with a 2 per cent drop in domestic routes and 7 per cent overseas.Montie Brewer, chief executive, warned that further cutbacks were likely if fuel prices remained at current levels.“Air Canada, like most global airlines, needs to adapt its business in the current fuel environment,” he said.Fuel now makes up about a third of operating costs. The airline estimates that it spends an average of C$230 (US$226) in fuel costs for each passenger carried, up from C$146 last year.Additional reporting by Justin Baer in New York
459;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-06-05T20:47:55Z;Wall St up after surprise fall in jobless claims;;US stocks decisively ended a three day losing run on Thursday after initial jobless claims dropped unexpectedly to a six-week low while a late surge in oil prices helped energy stocks to their biggest one-day gains since early March.According to the US Department of Labor, first time claims for unemployment benefits fell 18,000 to 357,000 last week, after seasonal adjustments. Economists had expected a rise of 3,000.The numbers, when combined with better-than-expected private employment data released on Wednesday by payroll services group ADP, will give markets a little more confidence ahead of an employment report for May.Gains accelerated after reports showed robust retail sales growth in May. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, chain store sales rose a better-than-expected 3 per cent on a year-on-year, same-store basis.The main beneficiaries were the wholesale, drugstore and discount sectors, hinting that the consumer remains under pressure.A late rally in commodity-related stocksadded to the momentum, as did news that Verizon Communications had agreed to buy rival Alltel for $28.1bn in cash and debt from TPG and Goldman Sachs.A broad rally pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index 2 per cent higher to 1,404.04 – its biggest one-day gain since mid-April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,604.45 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.9 per cent to 2,549.94.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve unnerved markets with hawkish comments on inflation while the threat of credit ratings downgrades to major bond insurers snuffed out an early rally in financials. On Thursday, financials revived thanks to a positive note on Lehman Brothers, the embattled brokerage firm whose slumping share price has acted as a drag on sentiment for much of this week.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the shares could rise, as the “worst-case scenarios” were already priced in.“Net-net, we feel Lehman is not Bear,” Mr Mayo said, as “liquidity is not a major issue, in our view, while equity risk remains but does not seem outsized”.Lehman rose 7.8 per cent to $33.85 while an index of investment banking stocks advanced 2.8 per cent and the broader S&P 500 financials index added 2 per cent.The sector briefly pared gains in mid-afternoon, when S&P cut the financial strength rankings of MBIA and Ambac, before regaining its stride.Even the two bond insurers eventually closed higher, up 7.3 per cent to $6.04 and 5.2 per cent to $2.62 respectively, as traders covered short positions.Better-than-expected retail figures buoyed consumer-facing stocks. Costco Wholesale reported a 9 per cent rise in same-store sales in May, while Wal-Mart reported a 3.9 per cent rise. Wal-Mart rose 3.7 per cent to $59.80 and Costco added 3.8 per cent to $73.50.Gains in the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors were limited to 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, by a dramatic rise in commodities prices. Oil surged $5 after the dollar dropped against the euro on statements by the ECB suggesting interest rates may rise next month. That was a boon for materials and energy stocks, which added 3.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.Nucor climbed 8.6 per cent to $80.54 after it raised its forecasts for second-quarter profit because of rising demand for steel.Monsanto made ground, rising 5.3 per cent to $138.51 after Jefferies raised its price target from $140 to $152.Exxon Mobil and Chevron jumped 4.2 per cent to $89.31 and 4.1 per cent to $99.99 respectively. Airlines were in focus after a number of analysts upgraded stocks in the sector, pointing to decisions by the big carriers to slash jobs and capacity.Continental Airlines said it would cut 3,000 jobs and reduce capacity by 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to offset rising jet fuel prices.UAL added 10.6 per cent to $10.11. Delta and Northwest advanced 12.1 per cent to $6.84 and 15 per cent to $8.06 respectively. Continental rose 4.8 per cent to $15.20.The Verizon deal boosted the telecoms sector. Verizon added 5.4 per cent to $38.96, AT&T advanced 2.5 per cent to $39.46 while the broader sector rose 2.9 per cent.
460;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-06-05T18:02:35Z;Take-off delayed: America’s airlines are making drastic cuts;;Thirty years ago this October, President Jimmy Carter brought the regulated era of commercial US aviation to a close, opening the domestic market to competition, freeing carriers to set their own fares and paving the way for decades of rapid expansion.Forgive executives if they neglect to uncork the anniversary champagne.US carriers have descended into a crisis that will leave few, if any, unscathed. Fuel costs have surged in the past year, wiping out earnings and threatening to send even some of the largest airlines back to bankruptcy court. The economy’s slowdown has damped demand for business and leisure travel alike, leaving more empty seats on flights already struggling to make money.Irritating fees and frequent delays have tarnished the industry’s reputation with passengers, while recent restructurings and bankruptcies have strained relations with workers. As for airline stocks, their performance this year would make even Wall Street executives blush.Further evidence of the harsh conditions faced by the industry came on Thursday when Continental Airlines said it was cutting 3,000 jobs and taking 73 aircraft out of service. The news came a day after United Airlines announced that it planned to ground a fifth of its fleet.“A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,” Warren Buffett, the world’s richest man and a one-time airline investor, wrote recently. “If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down.”Mr Wright’s safe landing in North Carolina more than a century ago made it impossible for future generations of capitalists to imagine a world without flight, and it seems equally unlikely to many airline executives that the industry will ever return to a regulated era whose rationale, in part, was to help ensure their stability. The carriers that survive the current downturn will offset mounting fuel prices by finding the right balance between trimming unprofitable routes and raising fares, or merging with a peer that makes those choices easier.“We won’t see re-regulation,” says Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta Air Lines. “The marketplace is going to react to supply and demand the way an unregulated market should.”Air travel is more popular than ever. The 1978 measure has largely lived up to its mandate to “encourage, develop, and attain an air transportation system which relies on competitive market forces”. Affordable fares have helped free businesses to reach the rest of the world from practically any sizeable US city, spurring global trade and transforming the professional and personal lives of countless Americans. For those reasons, there is little groundswell in Washington to bring back regulations that would shelter airlines from competition.“No, it was a good idea,” said Representative James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who, as chairman of the US House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is one of Capitol Hill’s most vocal members on most aviation issues. “Air travellers are still saving compared to pre-deregulation ticket prices.”While cheap fares and intense competition have remained constant since deregulation, financial stability at the airlines themselves has not. “There’s just so many risks to mitigate – it’s energy-intensive, subject to weather, it’s tough to execute a schedule and labour-intensive,” says Gary Kelly, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, the world’s largest low-cost carrier. “It’s a marginal profit at best for most airlines. Any change in the variables can have a pretty dramatic impact.”No single variable looms larger this year than fuel, which for most carriers has surpassed labour as the single-biggest expense. The run-up has forced carriers to take increasingly desperate measures. American Airlines will soon charge some passengers $15 to check a single bag, while US Airways recently banished all free snacks.Most airline executives acknowledge the industry must take more drastic steps to return commercial aviation to the stability it enjoyed, however briefly, before the latest surge in fuel prices. “The simple fact is that the US airline industry, as it is constituted today, was not built for $125 per barrel oil,” Gerard Arpey, chief executive of American Airlines, said last month during the world’s biggest carrier’s annual shareholder meeting. “The industry will not and cannot continue in its current state.”Some industry insiders continue to argue that sweeping consolidation would help carriers shed unprofitable routes and wield enough market power to raise ticket prices without losing a significant amount of traffic to low-cost airlines. When Delta agreed to merge with Northwest Airlines earlier this year, those executives and their advisers predicted other deals would follow.But the window for reaching a deal in time for a regulatory review by Bush administration officials – viewed as being more open to mergers than any of their potential successors – has all but closed. Many other legacy carriers, including United and Continental, have bowed out of the M&A game, at least for now.In conceding that talks with US Airways had ended, Glenn Tilton, United’s chief executive and a vocal advocate for consolidation, said during a message to his employees that the costs of integrating two complex operations would threaten to overwhelm a carrier already burning through its cash reserves to pay for fuel.Should oil prices continue to climb, some battered carriers may have no choice but to return to the table. Indeed, many of the industry’s biggest deals took place when one of the merger partners was under duress, says Andrew Watterson, a partner with Oliver Wyman in Dallas. “You could see some shotgun weddings.”“Mergers are not easy,” says Ilker Baybars, a professor of operations management at Carnegie Mellon. “It is painful. But when an industry is so competitive and margins are so small, consolidation is inevitable.”In the meantime, carriers will take deeper cuts to their flight schedules, trim administrative staff and ground older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. But this may not be enough to counter fuel costs should oil prices remain where they are or climb higher. CreditSights, a debt-research firm, predicted that the 2008 fuel bills of Delta and United would surpass each airline’s current cash position should crude oil remain at $125 a barrel. Of the 11 biggest US carriers, only Southwest, US Airways, Alaska and Northwest would end the year with cash on hand with oil at $150.In past downturns, including the one triggered by recession and the 9-11 terrorist attacks, troubled airlines filed for bankruptcy. Under the court’s protection, US Airways, United, Delta and Northwest reduced their debts, won wage concessions from employees and discarded older aircraft. While they emerged healthier, their revivals did little to confront what some executives see as the industry’s real problem: too many legacy airlines flying too many planes.“If a tree is dead, it should die because it has had its use and can make for new shoots,” says Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic. “In America most of these airlines have gone through Chapter 11 at least once. The quality is dreadful and the old planes stay in the air.” Sir Richard blames the ease with which US companies can emerge from bankruptcy largely intact. “You’re going to get a major carrier going into Chapter 11 again in the next few months, with fuel prices being at these levels,” he says. “Let those who should be dead die. That would be the best shot in the arm for the American industry.”If only it were that easy. The liquidation of a major airline would cost the economy thousands of jobs and dramatically reduce air service to some communities. Politicians would fight it, as may organised labour. “It is the worst scenario for the employees working for that carrier,” says Captain John Prater, president of the Air Line Pilots Association.Large suppliers, which often land influential seats on the creditors’ committees of bankrupt airlines, may seek to ensure that they do not lose customers. “Saving them is almost always the cheaper and easier option, even if it’s a government bailout,” says Peter Walsh, a managing partner at consultant Oliver Wyman who runs the firm’s manufacturing, transportation and energy business.Some executives believe the government can play a role in fixing the industry. They have lobbied federal, state and local officials to modernise US airports and air-traffic control systems, and aim to convince Washington to ease airlines’ tax burdens. Air-traffic delays cost carriers $19bn last year in excess labour, fuel and maintenance expenses as planes circled crowded airports or sat on gridlocked runways, according to a recent study by Congress’s Joint Economic Committee.Airline executives also argue they should no longer be subject to excise taxes generally levied on luxury items, cigarettes or alcohol. Carriers must pay those fees on the fares they sell, no matter how cheap the ticket or how unprofitable the airline, Mr Walsh says. “Flying airplanes is neither a sin nor is it an addictive substance,” he says. “It’s a commodity business.”Also awaiting a resolution from Washington are potential changes to the rules limiting foreign ownership of US airlines. Liberalising the cap of 25 per cent tops the agenda in the US and European Union “Open Skies” negotiations that opened last month in Slovenia.Removing or raising this cap could give carriers another source of potential capital. Germany’s Lufthansa bought a 19 per cent stake in JetBlue Airways, a low-cost US carrier, earlier this year, and Air France-KLM weighed making an investment in Delta while its transcontinental ally negotiated its merger with Northwest.Congress resisted past efforts to change the restrictions, with some members – including Mr Oberstar – concerned that foreign ownership could threaten carriers’ commitment to ferrying military personnel and supplies around the world in times of war. “Why should we let foreign airlines buy up extremely valuable US assets?” Mr Oberstar says. “We’d have to dramatically change the legal structure. And I’m not going to let that occur on my watch.”Mr Kelly, who succeeded Herb Kelleher as Southwest’s chairman last month, is optimistic his industry will rebound. The current challenges of record oil and a softened economy have punctuated what has been a “difficult decade” that began with terrorist attacks and recession and continued with adjustments to heightened security and record congestion at US airports.Most carriers, he says, have shown they can be profitable in more stable times, in the latter half of the 1990s and again in 2006-2007, when the industry enjoyed a fleeting renaissance. As they have in past downturns, the best airlines, large or small, legacy or low-cost, will adjust. “But it takes real resolve here,” he says. “There is not going to be instant gratification. There is very high demand for air travel, and if we can make improvements, demand will be even greater.”Prof Baybars agrees. “Service is not going to go away. Consumers are going to be fine and you’ll have plenty of seats.”But as services are cut, airline executives hope Americans accept they need to forgo a few of those seats, at least until fuel prices stabilise.

The list of C-suite scalps includes Citigroup’s Charles Prince and Merrill Lynch’s Stanley O’Neal.Financials were also hit by news that Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, lowered its ratings on Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, and revised its outlooks on Bank of America and JPMorgan to negative.“The outlooks on the large financial institutions sector in the US are now predominantly negative,” S&P saidComments by Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, weighed on sentiment. He said it could be months before markets recovered from the turmoil.Economic data showed that US manufacturing contracted for a fourth successive month and house prices declined steeply.The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index came in at 49.6 for May, up from 48.6 in April and better than expected but still in contraction territory.Radar Logic added to the gloom with statistics that showed house prices continued to slide across the US in March. The 25-metro area composite tumbled 14 per cent year on year.The benchmark S&P 500 recovered some losses at the close but still ended the day down 1.1 per cent at 1,385.69 points with nine of the 10 leading industry sectors in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent lower at 12,504.71. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.2 per cent to 2,491.53.Last week equity markets bounced back tepidly and ended May slightly ahead. Technology and materials stood out.The positive monthly tally was the second in a row for the S&P 500 and marked the first back-to-back monthly gains since October.Analysts remain cautious about the markets’ direction. The summer months are often light on volume.Airlines were in focus on Monday after the International Air Transport Association said the sector could report losses of $6.1bn this year because of the rising price of fuel and slowing world economies.Delta Air Lines fell 4.9 per cent to $5.85. UAL, parent of United, slid 7.7 per cent to $7.88. Continental gave up 3.6 per cent to $13.89.Financials began their slide early in the day after Bradford & Bingley, a UK lender, deeply discounted an announced rights issue and warned of a deteriorating housing market in the UK.The retreat accelerated after Wachovia said it had asked Ken Thompson, chief executive, to retire.The shares, which have lost more than 57 per cent of their value in the past year, fell 1.7 per cent to $23.40. Washington Mutual shares fell 0.2 per cent to $9. They have dropped almost 80 per cent in the past year.The broader financial sector slipped 1.8 per cent with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Lehman giving up 1.3 per cent to $33.58, 2 per cent to $42.15 and 8.1 per cent to $33.83 respectively.A rise in oil prices added to the malaise and weighed down consumer discretionary stocks, which slid 1.2 per cent.The sector was not helped by Marriott International, the largest hotel group in the US, which dipped after it said revenues from North America in the second quarter would increase slower than it had forecast as a result of weak US demand.Marriott lost 2.2 per cent to $32.19 while Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide declined 4.2 per cent to $46.36.Higher oil prices and a number of analyst upgrades helped energy stocks to a meagre 0.1 per cent rally.Independent oil refiners were among the few gainers.

Continental has said it would consider leaving SkyTeam – of which it is a junior member to US anchors Delta and Northwest – for another global alliance.United and US Airways, carriers run by two of the industry’s most vocal proponents of industry consolidation, each conceded in separate notes to their employees that they would not find a merger partner “at this time”.Glenn Tilton, United’s chief executive, met US Airways’ Doug Parker on Thursday to call off the discussions, the people said.While the carriers may revisit the deal, the window of opportunity is closing for agreement in time to receive a regulatory review before the Bush Administration leaves office. Delta Air Lines’ agreement with Northwest Airlines, once expected to trigger a series of tie-ups to consolidate the industry, may now stand as the year’s only deal between legacy carriers.Mr Tilton and Mr Parker have argued a flurry of mergers would help the surviving companies to eliminate costs and to raise ticket prices.By Friday morning, each chief executive had acknowledged months of strategic planning and countless conference calls with their peers had failed to find their airlines the right match.“We have come to the conclusion that consolidation involving US Airways will not occur at this time,” Mr Parker wrote to employees.“It is simply unlikely that anything will happen in 2008 as our industry continues to struggle with how to function in a world with $130-a-barrel oil prices.”Record fuel prices have already affected the airlines’ financial strength, making the deal’s integration costs more daunting. United recently revised the terms of its credit facility, giving the company more financial flexibility.“United has determined that it will not be pursuing a merger at this time due to issues that could significantly dilute the benefits,” Mr Tilton said in a message to employees. “We are evaluating other options.”United was also concerned about US Airways’ looming obligations to pay for new aircraft, and with elements of its labour contract that would have granted pilots a substantial raise after the merger.In his memo to employees, Mr Parker said US Airways was “working on a number of initiatives” to help counter record fuel costs – “and you’ll hear more about them in the weeks and months ahead.”Airline executives have argued ay merger or alliance requiring antitrust review would stand a better chance of gaining approval before the next US president takes office.
463;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-05-27T00:04:06Z;Tom Horton: Carrier that caught the fisherman, twice;;"Tom Horton’s journey back to American Airlines began 27 months ago on Great Exuma, a sandy paradise in the Bahaman archipelago.Mr Horton had left the world’s biggest carrier as chief financial officer four years earlier for the same post at another corporate giant, AT&T. He had helped pare the phone company’s debt load and, eventually, lead its sale to SBC Communications.By February 2006, Mr Horton was bonefishing on the shallow flats of the Bahamas when an e-mail arrived from his former boss, Gerard Arpey, American Airlines chief executive. “We’ve got to talk,” Mr Arpey wrote.“So I called him up, and he made the pitch,” Mr Horton recalls. “And here I am.”“Here” is back at American’s sprawling corporate headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, where the Bahamas are a small blue dot on the massive, global route map that adorns the building’s lobby. And the US airlines business is no paradise.Fuel costs have surged since the start of 2007, ending the sector’s modest, two-year recovery from the losses brought upon by terrorist attacks and recession earlier this decade. The latest economic slowdown is expected to sap demand for air travel, limiting revenue growth at a time when expenses have escalated.While American, the world’s largest carrier until Delta Air Lines completes its merger with Northwest Airlines, boasts a robust international route network and $4.9bn in cash, the company is saddled with a higher cost base than many of its peers, a fleet of older, gas-guzzling aircraft and a contentious relationship with its pilots’ union. “There are days I wish I could go back to fishing again,” Mr Horton says.American remains the lone legacy carrier that has not filed for bankruptcy protection – a process that has helped its peers extract concessions from its unions, and shed both debt and inefficient planes.“Only in the upside-down world of the airline industry could bankruptcy be considered a competitive advantage,” observes Mr Horton.He has helped Mr Arpey to pay down debt, trim capacity and conserve cash. At the end of 2002, the company had $2.7bn in cash, and debts of almost $21bn; by March 2008, its debt load had shrunk to $15.2bn.However, rising fuel costs have forced American to take bolder steps. In April, the company agreed to sell its asset-management business, American Beacon Advisors, to two private-equity firms. And it is seeking a buyer for its commuter carrier, American Eagle. On May 21 it announced plans to trim capacity by as much as 4 per cent this year, cut thousands of jobs, retire at least 75 aircraft and charge most passengers $15 to check in a single piece of luggage. The airline is also in talks to forge closer ties with British Airways and Continental Airlines. The carriers hope to structure a marketing alliance to generate more passengers and corporate accounts. They may also seek immunity from US anti-trust laws to create yet closer ties.Earlier this month, the carrier agreed to waive for a year a covenant on its credit facility that would have required American’s cash flow to exceed its interest and rent expenses. The amendment should give the company greater financial flexibility should fuel costs remain high.Mr Horton has had a hand in plotting American’s path on all of these measures. In order to persuade his former colleague to return to the company, Mr Arpey also made Mr Horton head of planning, which includes setting the airline’s schedule and ticket prices, managing the route network and maintaining alliances with other carriers. “There is never a dull moment here,” Mr Horton insists. One gets the feeling that the long-time Texan would not have it any other way.“He is really unflappable in the face of adversity,” says David Dorman, former AT&T chief executive who was Mr Horton’s boss. “He’s a positive guy who never had the low lows or high highs.”AT&T saw those qualities tested at American, where Mr Horton helped the airline stabilise after the 9-11 attacks.“We were looking for someone who could manage difficult situations,” says Mr Dorman, who like Mr Horton left AT&T following the company’s sale to SBC. “Tom had them in spades at American.”AT&T had them, too. The company’s plan to counter the gradual erosion of its legendary long-distance business by building a massive cable-television network had failed. A fierce battle with WorldCom for business customers had squeezed profit margins. AT&T was laden with debt, and its bonds were trading as though one of corporate America’s most familiar names might disappear forever.Then, a few weeks before he started his new job, Mr Horton emerged from an underground station in London to catch the banner headline on one of the city’s evening newspapers: “WorldCom in multibillion dollar accounting fraud,” he recalls. The scandal deepened what was already a testing slump for the US telecommunications industry, which, like commercial aviation, had endured a difficult passage to deregulation. “Through it all, Tom always kept his eye on the ball,” Mr Dorman says.Mr Horton did not leave American behind completely. “I was juggling a lot of things out there, but cheering for American the whole time,” he says. He kept a pair of model “silver birds” – the carrier’s Boeing aircraft – in his conference room at AT&T, and watched “with great trepidation” American’s narrow escape from bankruptcy in 2003.Mr Horton left AT&T in early 2006 following the sale to SBC. Corporate headhunters sought him out, hoping to recruit him just as AT&T had four years earlier. But the SBC deal came with a multimillion severance package, giving Mr Horton the financial security to turn down opportunities that would have forced him to relocate to another part of the country – and making a return trip to Fort Worth, and American, that much more appealing.“This company is, like AT&T, one of the great American institutions,” says Mr Horton. “We have got a lot more work to do to secure this company’s future, but I think it’s a job worth doing.”"
464;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-05-22T02:34:53Z;American cuts flights as fuel costs soar;;The crisis confronting the US airlines industry worsened on Wednesday as American Airlines said rising fuel costs would force it to eliminate flights, cut thousands of jobs and charge most passengers $15 (£7.60) to check a single piece of luggage.It declared the extraordinary measures as the spot price for crude oil reached a record $133.82 a barrel, heading above $134 in after-hours trading, and the cost scheduled for delivery in December 2016 surged to an all-time high of $142.14.Gerard Arpey, American’s chief executive, warned the rest of the industry to take similar actions or risk repeating the downward spiral into bankruptcy that claimed carriers in previous downturns. American remains the only legacy US carrier that has managed to avoid seeking protection from creditors.“The airline industry as it is constituted today was not built to withstand oil prices at $125 a barrel, and certainly not when record fuel expenses are coupled with a weak US economy,” Mr Arpey said. “Our company and industry simply cannot afford to sit by hoping for industry and market conditions to improve.”This year’s rise in fuel prices has added almost $3bn to American’s annual expenses. Its shares were down 25 per cent in late New York trading, leading the sector lower amid concern that the downturn would pull several big carriers into bankruptcy.American, the world’s biggest airline, said it would make deep cuts to its flight schedule, retire at least 75 aircraft, close facilities and eliminate jobs.The company intends to reduce system-wide capacity by as much as 4 per cent this year, up from a previous plan’s 1.5 per cent. Flights within the US will face the steepest cuts, with capacity expected to drop by up to 12 per cent in the fourth quarter. Regional service will shrink by 10-11 per cent.American hopes to generate several hundred million dollars in extra revenue by fees ranging from $5 to $50 – including an unprecedented $15 for a single checked bag. Premium customers will not have to pay the baggage charge. Other fees will include those for reservation services, allowing pets on flights or checking oversized bags.The actions aim to “eliminate unprofitable flying and [to] improve the supply and demand equilibrium”, Mr Arpey said.Delta Air Lines, which will pass American to become the world’s biggest carrier after its merger with Northwest Airlines, said it would not match American’s plans with its own single-bag fee.Oil prices rose on Wednesday after a big fall in US crude inventories, now 6.5 per cent below last year’s level. Samuel Bodman, the US energy secretary, said the rise reflected a tight oil market.The jump in long-term prices is serious for airlines, which rely on these contracts to hedge oil cost exposure. Since January, long-term prices have surged 60 per cent, outpacing the 35 per cent rise in the spot price for oil.American was one of the first US carriers to restrain expansion and stepped up capacity cuts in April. It said it has been hit with $1.9bn more in annual expenses since March when crude rose from an average price of $105 per barrel to $130.Additional reporting by Daniel Pimlott in New York
465;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-05-21T22:34:51Z;BA chief in overture to Continental;;Willie Walsh, British Airways’ chief executive, said US rival Continental Airlines would make a “great addition” to its Oneworld alliance of global carriers.BA and fellow transatlantic partner American Airlines have sought to persuade Continental to leave its own alliance, SkyTeam, for Oneworld, and the three carriers may seek immunity from US antitrust laws to forge even closer ties.The planned merger between two other SkyTeam members, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, has cast doubt on Continental’s future in that group. BA and American are not Continental’s only suitors – the Houston-based company is also in talks to form a partnership with United Airlines, which anchors the Star Alliance, people familiar with the matter have said.“It’s a great airline, has a great reputation, a strong brand and a good management team,” Mr Walsh said of Continental, which ruled out merging with United or another peer last month but said it would consider leaving SkyTeam.“Continental would be a great addition. But that’s just one of several options I have no doubt Continental is considering at this time.”BA and American had sought antitrust immunity in 1997 and 2001 but were stymied by US officials’ decision to approve their application only if the two airlines divested some landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport – a price both deemed too high.The two airlines have argued that recent efforts to open up the world’s busiest airports to more competition, most notably at Heathrow, have eliminated the need for slot divestitures and are considering reapplying for immunity.“It’s definitely worthwhile revisiting the issue at this point in time,” Mr Walsh said. “We’ve got a completely different competitive landscape that we had six years ago. We’ve got a completely different economic environment. For that reason it’s right that we sit down and look at it again.”Mr Walsh said BA was not considering making equity investments in its US peers, whose shares have plunged amid concern the surge in fuel costs would push even the largest carriers into bankruptcy.
466;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-05-01T08:41:30Z;BA explores American tie-ups;;British Airways, American Airlines and Continental Airlines are “exploring opportunities for co-operation” that could lead to an eventual transatlantic alliance of three of the world’s biggest carriers.The confirmation by BA and American of the talks comes amid intense manoeuvring among US carriers triggered by the recent announcement of the planned takeover by Delta Air Lines of Northwest Airlines to form a new leader in the US.The restructuring efforts are being driven by the rapid deterioration in the aviation sector’s financial outlook under the burden of record fuel prices.BA shares, which have fallen in recent months because of record oil prices and problems with the opening of the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow, rose 6¾p or nearly 3 per cent in morning trading in London to 233¼p.Continental had been in merger negotiations with United Airlines, but it broke off the talks last weekend amid concerns about UAL’s financial weakness, and said it had decided to explore alternative alliance relationships rather than an outright merger.The threat of the emergence of a transatlantic joint venture between BA and the two US carriers immediately came under attack from Virgin Atlantic, BA’s UK long-haul rival.Sir Richard Branson, founder and president of Virgin Atlantic, said: “When BA and AA first tried to get together nearly 10 years ago, the regulators ruled it was against the consumer interest. Nothing has changed.”A merger or acquisition involving BA, the third largest European airline behind Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, and the two US carriers is ruled out by tough restrictions on foreign ownership and control of airlines in the US and the European Union. Foreign entities are restricted to owning a maximum voting share of 25 per cent in a US carrier.Instead, the US carriers are exploring the potential for a marketing alliance with BA. American and BA are already members of the Oneworld global alliance, while Continental is a member of SkyTeam.Continental said last weekend it was reviewing whether to remain a member of SkyTeam. If Continental were to swap camps and join Oneworld, the three carriers are considering an eventual application to the US and European competition authorities for antitrust immunity for a transatlantic joint venture.The immunity allows carriers to collude legally on sharing sales and marketing and arranging capacity and networks.On Wednesday Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, called on the US and EU authorities for fully liberalise transatlantic aviation to allow full mergers of airlines.He said US/EU talks due to begin this month on a stage two “open skies” treaty should “sweep away the outdated restrictions on the ownership and control of airlines, so that EU investors can take majority stakes in US airlines, and vice versa.“Then the industry can finally reap the benefits of the kind of sensible cross-national consolidation that has taken place in electronics, motor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, banking and almost every other business sector.”
467;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-05-01T02:08:58Z;Airlines to seek damages over T4 delays;;The SkyTeam global airline alliance, led by Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines of the US, is seeking financial compensation from BAA for the months-long delay in the airlines’ planned transfer to Heathrow’s Terminal 4.The move by several of the SkyTeam airlines to T4 is being held up by British Airways’ decision to postpone shifting its long-haul flights from there to T5, after its disastrous launch of the new facility five weeks ago.Giorgio Callegari, chairman of SkyTeam’s airport infrastructure group, said: “We are very unh appy and disappointed at the latest developments at Heathrow.”He said SkyTeam carriers were considering legal action against BAA, if negotiations failed to produce a deal on compensation. “We still don’t have a formal timeline to discuss with BAA,” he said. “We are hostage to the fact BA is not comfortable moving more flights to T5. We are not on a competitive par with other operators, and our operations are being degraded.”The disclosure of the airlines’ resentment at their treatment by BAA and the lack of consultation came as the latest consumer report released by the Association of European Airlines on Wednesday showed that BA had the worst record among European airlines in the first three months both for flight delays and misplaced bags.During that quarter, operations at Heathrow, BA’s global hub, were hit on several occasions by bad weather including snowstorms and high winds. But the period also included the first five days of BA operations at T5, when the airline was forced to cancel more than 500 flights, stranding thousands of passengers and leading to a mountain of up to 28,000 misplaced bags.BA and BAA, the airports group that operates Heathrow, announced 2½ weeks ago in a joint statement that BA was postponing the transfer to T5 of most of its long-haul flights from April 30 to June, but it emerged that the move could take until October to complete.In a speech on Wednesday to the Institute of Directors annual convention Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, apologised again for the chaotic opening of the £4.3bn terminal. A timetable for the next moves to T5 had not yet been agreed, he said, but the first phase was planned for June with completion by the end of October.Mr Walsh said BA was seeing “big improvements” in the T5 operation and “a steady performance” in the overall baggage operation.According to the AEA figures published on Wednesday BA had the worst performance in the first quarter for misplaced bags of the 28 European airlines reporting data with 28.9 missing bags per 1,000 passengers. Air France had 17.5 missing and Lufthansa 15.1.BA had the worst record for on-time short-haul arrivals among 29 carriers with only 58 per cent of flights on time.
468;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-28T22:31:09Z;United still keen on consolidation;;"Glenn Tilton, United Airlines’ chief executive, has remained a staunch advocate of consolidation among US carriers, but after losing his preferred merger partner last weekend, his options in striking a deal of his own have narrowed.Continental Airlines’ decision on Sunday to break off talks surprised Mr Tilton and his management team, even if it did confirm suspicions that their counterparts were never as sold on the merits of mergers as they were. Nevertheless, the negotiations’ sudden end has not deterred Mr Tilton.“Consolidation is under way. Ensuring you have the right partner is everything,” Mr Tilton said. “We will pursue all options to ensure a strong, sustainable future for our airline and will not shy away from the tough choices necessary to create value for our shareholders and benefit our employees and customers.”With Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines poised to combine to create the world’s largest carrier and any attempted deal with American Airlineslikely to run into regulatory problems, United’s list of potential partners among the six legacy airlines has dwindled to one: US Airways.For Wall Street, that may not be such a bad thing.Unlike Delta’s deal to merge with Northwest, whose modest cost-cutting goals left investors unimpressed, a United-US Airways deal would probably promise more aggressive targets for savings and profitability.Any attempt to push a deal through by promising large cutbacks could imply big job losses and reduction in flight schedules, which in turn would attract greater scrutiny from politicians, unions and regulators. And US Airways lacks the robust international route network of many of its counterparts, including Continental.But people familiar with United’s thinking have argued that the synergies realised in a combination with US Airways would easily exceed the company’s market value, which stood at about $700m on Monday.United had continued to discuss a possible tie-up with US Airways even as its negotiations with Continental progressed, people familiar with the matter said. While the pace of the talks was expected to accelerate, the two sides had yet to find common ground on several fronts, including roles its top executives would take in the combined group, the people said.United’s volatile shares, which plunged 37 per cent on Tuesday last week after the group’s disappointing results cast doubt on its ability to remain in compliance with its debt covenants, may make it more difficult for both sides to agree to terms. United’s market capitalisation has slipped to $1.7bn.Continental and United disagree on the carrier’s motives for walking away. People familiar with Continental say the company was deterred by what it learned in recent days about United’s finances; those close to United’s executives argue that their peers never wanted to pursue a merger.Doug Parker, US Airways’ chief executive, had no such reservations about United’s financial strength, people familiar with his thinking said.As of March 31, United was in compliance with the covenants included in its loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse. Under the accord, United must have at least $750m in unrestricted cash and produce an earnings-to-fixed-charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0.Continental continues to discuss an alliance with American and British Airways, and the companies are considering applying for immunity from US antitrust regulations. The three carriers may have an agreement within the next two weeks."
469;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-28T19:15:31Z;Airlines act to ease impact of fuel bills;;"Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, announced drastic measures to boost its revenues, cut costs and conserve cash in response to the continuing surge in its fuel costs. Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was suspending its share buy-back programme to conserve cash “in light of the fuel price volatility.”Airlines round the world are being forced by rising fuel prices to take action to bolster their profitability.In the US, Northwest Airlines said it was raising its fares by 3-5 per cent, in line with increases by other leading US carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines.“We are making this move to offset the extraordinarily high cost of fuel,” said Jim Cron, Northwest senior vice-president of revenue management.This month the airline announced emergency measures including increased fees, fares and fuel surcharges; 5 per cent domestic capacity reductions; a reduction in the fleet of 15-20 aircraft; and an estimated $100m reduction in non-aircraft capital expenditure.Airlines are seeking new ways of increasing revenues and American said it was introducing a $25 charge for second bags checked in on domestic routes.In Europe, Ryanair said it was raising its fee for checked-in bags from £6 to £8, and that it was raising its charge for passengers checking in at the airport rather than online from £3 to £4.Ryanair has virtually no hedging protection in place for its fuel requirements for the 12 months to March 2009, and has warned there is a “significant chance” its profits would fall by as much as 50 per cent this year.Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was raising its domestic fares by 3.5 per cent and international fares sold in Australia by 3 per cent.He said Qantas had hedged 34 per cent of its fuel requirements for the 12 months to June 2009 at an equivalent crude oil price of $90 a barrel, but the majority of the hedges were in the first half of its financial year. “If high fuel prices persist beyond this point, it would be of increasing concern.” But he said the airline was still confident of meeting its target of increasing pre-tax profits by at least 40 per cent in the current year to June 2008."
470;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-28T01:07:39Z;Continental calls off merger talks with United;;Continental Airlines brought its merger talks with United Airlines to an abrupt end on Sunday amid concerns for the rival US carrier’s financial strength in the face of record fuel costs and waning demand for air travel.United and Continental have held preliminary discussions for more than a year, and the pace of the negotiations quickened this month with Delta Air Lines’ agreement to merge with Northwest Airlines.But United stunned investors last week with a wider-than-expected quarterly loss, triggering a 37 per cent drop in its shares and casting doubt on whether it has enough cash to endure an industry-wide downturn and meet its debt covenants.The shortfall gave Continental pause, too, and additional due diligence into United’s finances and outlook convinced its top executives at the weekend to recommend abandoning the talks, people familiar with the matter said. Continental’s board approved management’s plan to go it alone.“The best course for Continental is to not merge with another airline at this time,” Larry Kellner, chief executive, and Jeff Smisek, president, said in a message to employees. “The board very carefully considered all the risks and benefits of a merger with another airline, and determined that the risks of a merger at this time outweigh the potential rewards.”Continental continues to discuss an alliance with American Airlines and British Airways and the three are considering applying for immunity from US antitrust regulations. The three carriers may have an agreement within the next two weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.While Continental’s decision – and immediate public announcement – caught United’s executives by surprise, it nevertheless confirmed their suspicions that the Houston-based carrier was never convinced consolidation was its right path, people familiar with their thinking said.The sudden end to the Continental negotiations leaves Glenn Tilton, United’s chief executive and one of the first big US airline chieftains to champion the benefits of consolidation, with a decision to make on whether to pursue an agreement with US Airways, another rival.While US Airways is the smallest of the six US network carriers and lacks the robust international route network of its peers, its cheap stock price has nevertheless made it a tempting target for United or American. Airline executives have argued the cost savings realised in a US Airways deal would easily exceed the company’s market value.The pace of United’s discussions with US Airways, which had also progressed since the Delta agreement, is likely to accelerate now that the carrier’s first choice, a merger with Continental, is no longer an option, people familiar with the companies’ plans said.Delta’s accord with Northwest, which would create the world’s largest airline, is expected to trigger at least one other US deal.”Consolidation is underway – ensuring you have the right partner is everything,” Mr Tilton said in a statement. ”We will pursue all options to ensure a strong, sustainable future for our airline and will not shy away from the tough choices necessary to create value for our shareholders and benefit our employees and customers.”United has said that as of March 31 the company was in compliance with the covenants included in its loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse. Under the accord, United must have at least $750 million in unrestricted cash and produce an earnings-to-fixed-charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0.The Chicago-based company said last week it finished March with $2.9 billion in cash and a coverage ratio of 1.5, and another $3 billion in hard assets.Additional reporting by Julie MacIntosh
471;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta, Northwest hit by soaring fuel costs;;Delta Air Lines and its merger partner, Northwest Airlines, on Wednesday joined the list of US carriers to report quarterly losses amid record fuel costs.An unrelenting surge in oil prices, which have neared $120 a barrel, has wiped out profits and pressed carriers to scramble for ways to trim additional costs, from shrinking their flight schedules and retiring less fuel-efficient aircraft to job cuts. Investors’ concerns for the industry’s future peaked on Tuesday, when United Airlines’ wider-than-expected loss touched off steep declines on US airlines’ stocks.The run-up in oil prices, coupled with a looming slowdown in demand for air travel, helped press Delta and Northwest to pursue a merger to create the world’s largest airline. While the two carriers have argued that their agreement – announced last week – would tap new revenue opportunities and insulate the combined company from a slowdown, the absence of steep cost cuts has underwhelmed Wall Street.Delta’s quarterly net loss widened to $6.39bn, or $16.15 a share. The results included a $6.1bn writedown in goodwill Delta recorded to reflect a decline in the company’s market capitalisation. Delta had booked $12bn in goodwill following its emergence from bankruptcy last year.Excluding the writedown, Delta’s loss of $274m, or 69 cents, was wider than analysts’ estimates. Revenue climbed 12 per cent from a year earlier, to $4.77bn. The carrier’s fuel costs jumped 50 per cent.Delta also joined peers such as American Airlines, United and Continental Airlines in taking additional measures to slash expenses.“We have moved quickly to mitigate the short-term impact of higher fuel prices by further reducing domestic capacity and taking a disciplined approach to costs and cash flow,” Edward Bastian, Delta’s president, said in a statement. “These actions have offset more than 50 per cent of the fuel price impact. However, we clearly need to do more.”Delta now expects its total flight schedule in the second half of 2008 to fall as much as 2 per cent from a year earlier, with domestic capacity down by as much as 11 per cent. The latest capacity cuts will cull 15-20 mainline and 60-70 regional jets from its fleet by the end of the year.Northwest also wrote down billions of dollars during the first quarter to account for the impairment of goodwill since its own emergence from bankruptcy. Both carriers were still in credit protection in the year-earlier period.Including the writedowns, Northwest’s net loss widened to $4.1bn, or $15.78. The carrier lost $191m before the non-cash charge. Revenue rose 8.8 per cent to $3,13 billion.Northwest’s fuel bill surged 58 per cent.By early afternoon, shares in Delta were 1.3 per cent lower at $6.71 and Northwest was off 1.9 per cent at $7.33.
472;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-17T19:43:00Z;Record fuel costs hit US airlines’ profits;;Continental Airlines swung to a quarterly loss, while rival Southwest Airlines eked out a small profit on Thursday amid record fuel costs.Both US carriers followed American Airlines in taking steps to brace for losses that Wall Street expects to deepen as an economic slowdown saps demand for air travel.Continental, whose fuel expenses surged 53 per cent from a year earlier, plans to remove 14 older, less fuel-efficient jets from its fleet and trim 5 per cent of its domestic flight schedule this autumn.The company also plans to cut regional capacity, and is seeking to extract better terms from its contract with ExpressJet, which flies many of Continental’s commuter jets.Southwest deferred the delivery of some aircraft and continues a “rigorous review of our flight schedule to eliminate non-productive flying”.Continental reported a first-quarter loss of $80m, or 81 cents a share, compared with net income of $22m, or 21 cents, a year ago. Revenue jumped 12 per cent to $3.57bn.“In this fuel environment, we must reduce our domestic capacity to help reduce our losses in the domestic system,’’ Jeff Smisek, Continental’s president, said on Thursday in a statement.The Houston-based carrier paid $100 to Northwest Airlines, redeeming its so-called golden share provision and clearing the carrier to pursue a merger unencumbered by Northwest’s right to block the deal. Continental was granted the right to buy the golden share when Northwest agreed this week to merge with Delta Air LinesContinental has had preliminary merger talks with United Airlines and American, two of its bigger competitors, people familiar with the carrier have said.Southwest’s consistent profitability and financial strengths have helped the Dallas-based airline hedge against well over half of its fuel needs even as oil prices spiralled to $100 and beyond.For the year Southwest’s derivative contracts cover more than 70 per cent of its estimated fuel consumption, at an average price of about $51 a barrel.First-quarter earnings slipped 63 per cent to $34m, or 5 cents a share. Fuel costs jumped 34 per cent from a year earlier. Southwest said revenue climbed 15 per cent to $2.53bn.“Traffic thus far in April has been solid, and bookings for the remainder of the second quarter 2008 appear strong,” Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said in a statement.
473;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-17T17:06:00Z;On a wing and a prayer;;When you have tried pulling every lever to hand but your aircraft is still losing altitude, the only thing left to do is bail out. Airline stocks should have climbed this week. Delta and Northwest finally agreed to merge. That paves the way for further industry consolidation.Investors, many of whom have called for any sort of corporate action to catalyse a rally, are unmoved – the sector is down 3 per cent this week. It is telling that, having touted $1bn of annual synergies, Northwest and Delta have since seen their combined market value decline by roughly the same amount. The need to keep politicians and labour onside means airlines must focus on revenue synergies, rather than cost savings. Top line gains might well transpire, but they are far off and run a high risk of being competed away.With mergers no longer looking like a silver bullet, the fundamental problems facing the sector loom larger. As quarterly results from AMR (American Airlines’ parent), Continental and Southwest show, this industry is selling its product too cheaply to offset high fuel prices. Only Southwest managed to turn a profit, mainly because of smart hedges on fuel costs.Unit revenues for the major airlines are growing at mid-single digits in percentage terms. But they need growth rates at double that level to offset the high cost of fuel, according to CreditSights. With seats already full – and regulators capping flights at busy airports such as JFK – that means raising prices. The airlines are doing this, but cautiously. Charging more in what could be an economic downturn is a bold experiment. Demand has remained robust so far, but then passengers’ appetite typically cracks only after a couple of recessionary quarters have passed.Unlike the downturn after 2001, the industry has a bigger cash cushion. In an ideal world, that would be used to address other needs, such as upgrading tired fleets. Instead, the airlines will use it to hunker down and survive a rough ride – not exactly the most enticing of investment propositions.Post and read comments on this Lex
474;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-16T18:32:04Z;The airlines merger that will not fly;;When a business venture is declared to be good for everyone – even those with widely differing interests – it often turns out not to be particularly good for anyone.This, I fear, will be the case with this week’s proposed merger of Delta and Northwest Airlines to form the largest airline in the US, and one of the biggest in the world.The new Delta, its combined name, sounds impressive but few mergers have combined such lofty rhetoric with such meagre intent.Leaders of the two faltering airlines said they would create an entity strong enough to withstand the fuel price rises that have pushed the industry into losses and to take on international rivals. But they intend to meld their operations with few changes in how they work.They talked of the merger benefits coming from “addition, rather than subtraction”. The new Delta would be “a win” for staff, customers and communities (in other words for unions, cheap fares and the cities from which it flies).It is good to travel hopefully, I suppose. But there is not much hope of this merger doing much to dig Delta and Northwest out of their hole. Nor, unless they are more ambitious, will the mergers that are likely to follow any Delta/Northwest deal, including one between Continental and United Airlines.The problem with US airlines is that they are starved of capital and have underinvested in aircraft and customer service. They have been trying to improve their fleets since returning to profit two years ago but are once again being undermined by the rising price of fuel.Despite efforts to restructure while several were in Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the industry downturn following the attacks of September 11 2001, they are still lumbered with inefficient route patterns based on flying from city hubs. This puts them at a severe disadvantage to low-cost rivals such as Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and now Virgin America.Meanwhile, given a free choice, hardly anyone would travel with a US airline on an international flight. The meals are bad, the staff are surly, the aircraft are old and the business class seats do not lie flat.“The hardware and the software of the US airlines are behind their competitors. Anyone who flies on Etihad [the Abu Dhabi-based airline] would not get back on a US airline. It is just a far better product,” says Bob Mann, a US airline consultant.Delta is only now bringing into service two Boeing 777s with flat-bed business class seats on international routes, trailing British Airways and others by years. It intends to install them across its fleet by 2010, which would be far too late if it faced unconstrained competition.In practice, it does not, although “open skies” deals are bringing more rivalry to transatlantic routes. The new Delta, like the old one, would rely on feeding passengers who are tied to its domestic network by frequent-flier miles and corporate purchasing schemes on to its international flights.So Richard Anderson, Delta’s current and future chief executive, clearly hopes that merging the airlines will provide enough benefits without him having to do much more. He is bulking up and hunkering down, relying on the fact that the new Delta will have $7bn in cash to withstand a recession.Perhaps he should take a look at another low-margin and troubled US industry – autos. Until recently, the Detroit big three were convinced that salvation lay in growth but they have now changed their minds after coming close to bankruptcy.Their new emphasis is on raising margins by slimming down their US operations rather than expanding at all costs. Chrysler, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group, this week struck a deal with Nissan as part of its efforts to make more out of less.Chrysler is getting Nissan to manufacture a small car for the US while it makes Nissan’s US pick-up truck. Meanwhile, it is trying to get its US dealers to consolidate so it can sell all of its brands – Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep – through single outlets.There are lessons here for the airline industry. One is that it does not help to be big if you do not make money. In fact, the bigger you are, the faster you can lose it. Mr Anderson’s $7bn is not enough to shield the new Delta from harm.The imperative for US airlines is to improve margins in order to be able to invest in aircraft and raise service standards. If they do not, customers will keep moving to domestic low-cost carriers. That would have the nasty side effect of making them less tied to Delta when flying abroad.Mr Anderson says the new Delta will be strong enough to invest more. But the something-for-everyone nature of the merger does not allow him much room for manoeuvre.It could be that he has little choice but to be nice to everyone. There is a thicket of regulatory and commercial hurdles for the merger to get through and Northwest’s pilots have already refused to go along with proposed changes to their terms.It could also be that the fuel price conquers all, putting legacy airlines with older fleets of fuel-guzzling aircraft in jeopardy. That might mean that the new Delta has little chance of becoming sustainably profitable even if it does more to help itself.Delta and Northwest are not even trying, however. Instead, they said this week that theirs was “a different kind of merger” to the hostile bid for Delta by US Airways in 2006 that would have involved job cuts and pruning of over-capacity.The latter merger would “only have been good for Wall Street”, they said. Ah yes, the shareholders. I knew that someone had been left off the “good for everyone” list.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/gapperRead John Gapper’s Business Blog
475;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-15T20:47:44Z;US stocks edge up in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks climbed on Tuesday for the first time in three days as advances by financial and energy companies offset declines in healthcare stocks in a temperamental session of trading.The S&P 500 financials index swung between gains and losses but by mid-
afternoon bank and brokerage stocks had recovered thanks to a rare spot of good news from a pair of regional banks.Regions Financial, the biggest bank in Alabama, and M&T Bank, part-owned by Berkshire Hathaway, said gains from selling their stakes in Visa and increased fee income had enhanced first-quarter results.Regions shares rose 8.4 per cent to $20.12 while M&T added 6.3 per cent to $85.86, pushing broader indices into the black.That news helped offset revelations that State Street, the money manager for institutions, could be forced to bail out a number of mortgage-backed debt funds, or “conduits”, that have already incurred $1.49bn in unrealised mark-to-market losses. State Street fell 9.9 per cent to $69.23 after rising as much as 4 per cent earlier in the day after the company had reported a 69 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.“If you are looking to see if we have turned a corner with financials, then the answer is probably no,” said Thomas Nyheim vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “They are going to keep coming out with mixed numbers, but it seems to be priced into the market.”The financials sector was among the leading gainers in the broader S&P 500, with the financials index up 1.1 per cent, snapping a five-day losing streak.Throughout the day the markets struggled to find a clear direction as investors were hit with a raft of conflicting data including reports showing rising inflation, stabilising manufacturing activity in New York state and a slightly more optimistic outlook among homebuilders.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,334.44.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,286.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.5 per cent, to 12,362.47.Still, the S&P 500 has fallen in four out of the past six sessions, as a string of disappointing first-quarter earnings results from the likes of Wachovia, and expectations of worse to come, weighed on investor confidence.Markets started on Tuesday in a positive mood after better-than-expected results from healthcare sector bellwether Johnson & Johnson.The group’s profits jumped in the first quarter, breaking the run of bad earnings news from major US corporations that has undermined sentiment in the past two weeks.But the results left investors largely unmoved once trading began and the shares fell 0.1 per cent to $65.65 while an index of healthcare stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Technology companies also suffered after a series of earnings downgrades by analysts worried that a slowdown will hit profits. An index of technology stocks shed as much as 0.9 per cent before rallying towards the close.Computer component makers EMC and Emulex led the fallers, dropping 3.2 per cent to $14.17 and 6.3 per cent to $12.74 respectively after Citigroup downgraded the stocks.Cisco and IBM also lost ground, falling 0.9 per cent to $23.11 and 0.1 per cent to $117.17 respectively.First-quarter results from Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer and industry bellwether, should help reassure investors spooked by disappointing results from arch-rival AMD last week however. Intel said profits fell 12 per cent to $1.44bn but first quarter sales rose 9.3 per cent to $9.67bn. The shares fell 0.9 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading.Record oil prices and buoyant commodity prices lifted oil producers, material stocks and wider indices. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips added 1.2 per cent to $90.80 and 1.8 per cent to $81.24 respectively.Airline companies, however, fared poorly as analysts and investors worried that rising fuel costs would eat up any benefits from recent moves to consolidate the industry.Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines jumped in pre-market trading after they agreed to a $3.63bn merger, but by the close Delta shares were down 12.6 per cent to $9.66. Northwest fell 8.4 per cent to $10.28."
476;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-15T20:00:52Z;US airlines stocks slump on merger news;;US airline stocks slumped on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines’ long-awaited agreement to merge with rival Northwest Airlines underwhelmed investors looking for steeper cost cuts from the two carriers’ combination.The sell-off, which came as oil prices surged to a new record, may give other carriers pause as they weigh deals of their own.Delta slipped 13 per cent, while Northwest fell 8.4 per cent. Continental Airlines, US Airways, American Airlines and United Airlines also closed lower.Delta and Northwest argued that their deal’s greatest benefits lay in the combined company’s ability to generate additional revenue and redeploy its fleet to pair the right-sized aircraft with the right route, maximising profitability.A merger built on steep cuts to capacity and jobs would have faced much greater scrutiny from regulators, politicians and labour leaders, industry executives have argued, reducing the likelihood that the combination would ever close.Nevertheless, investors expected more than the $1bn in cost savings that Delta and Northwest plan to extract from the deal.The relentless rise in fuel prices has forced some smaller carriers into bankruptcy and crimped profits at even some of the biggest airlines.“The $1bn synergy goal is actually at the midpoint of our previously published estimate for this deal, so we are not surprised – or impressed – by it,” UBS analyst Kevin Crissey wrote on Tuesday in a note to clients.“If fuel prices remain near their current levels, even if Delta/Northwest achieve their synergy target, our per-share earnings estimates likely need to come down,” he added.On a call with analysts on Tuesday, Ed Bastian, Delta’s president, said fuel costs might continue to climb.By merging, he argued, both carriers could fly fuller aircraft, charge higher fares, shift capacity to international routes and win more lucrative corporate accounts.“We will only grow if it’s profitable growth,” he said.“The majority of the growth we are seeing in this combined entity is going to be on the international side of the business.”Delta recently unveiled plans to trim its domestic flight schedule 10 per cent this year.The carrier might increase those cutbacks if “fuel and economic conditions” worsened, Mr Bastian said.Some shareholders were disappointed to learn that Delta’s deal with Northwest would not help accelerate that plan.“We are hoping you are understating your capacity cuts,” Mr Crissey said during the call.

478;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta/Northwest deal;;Delta and Northwest have embarked on their long-awaited flight to safety. Whether the two airlines will get there is unclear. The pressing reason for their all-stock merger is the oil price, a point amply demonstrated by the market’s reaction to the deal. In initial trading on Tuesday, Delta and Northwest’s combined market capitalisation jumped by 6 per cent. Then crude prices hit a record and that swung quickly to a combined drop of 12 per cent.Wary of the need to get regulatory approval and mitigate political opposition, both airlines emphasise the minimal overlap between their routes. The flip-side of courting Washington, however, is minimal savings – annual cost synergies of up to $400m equate to just 1.4 per cent of pro forma operating expenses.Rather, Delta and Northwest aim to fly faster than the speed of oil. The companies hope for $800m of annual revenue synergies by 2012, as a bigger global airline attracts passengers, to offset higher fuel costs. Give Delta and Northwest the full benefit of the doubt, ascribe a generous 10 per cent discount rate, and the after-tax net present value of the total synergies is $4.6bn. To put that in perspective, the two airlines’ combined market cap at Monday’s close was $5.7bn.Investors have good reasons to be sceptical. Revenue synergies are slippery in any deal. And, while Delta’s pilots are onside, Northwest’s are not as yet. Antitrust regulators, meanwhile, may weigh the deal’s likely effect of catalysing more airline deals when passing judgment.In spite of the challenges, the rationale is solid. The problem is this is not yet a done deal and the benefits are “strategic” and long-term. Investors looking for immediate relief from the impact of high oil prices and potential recession will find little solace here.Post and read comments on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

479;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Airline mergers in a holding pattern;;Global consolidation of the airline industry remains on hold but the pace of change is accelerating in individual regions around the world.The industry remains fragmented and global mergers and acquisitions activity is still constrained by an arcane regulatory system dating from the mid-1940s.The latest merger move in the US with the proposed takeover of Northwest Airlines by Delta only serves to underline how mergers and acquisitions activity in the sector is still largely bound by national or regional boundaries.Between regions, airlines are still forced to pursue the second-best option of forming alliances backed by antitrust immunity from competition authorities but stopping short of outright mergers.Here too, Delta and Northwest are in the vanguard, however, as they seek antitrust immunity for a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM. Provisional approval was granted by the US transportation department last week.The joint venture, in which Air France-KLM, Delta and Northwest will share profits and revenues and jointly plan sales, networks and capacity, will have a turnover of $12bn and will account for around 30 per cent of the North Atlantic market.Air France-KLM said on Tuesday that given Delta and Northwest’s strong liquidity, it no longer needed to provide any additional funding through a capital increase to support the merger.The transatlantic joint venture is set to become one of the most powerful forces in the North Atlantic aviation market, providing tough competition for other leading carriers in the market, such as British Airways, American Airlines, Lufthansa, United Airlines and Continental Airlines.The sheer scale of the planned Delta/Northwest merger will be rattling cages at other carriers around the world, however, and the combination of this deal with the transatlantic joint venture could force a response, in particular from the likes of American Airlines and British Airways.BA and American have tried previously to gain antitrust immunity for a transatlantic joint venture, but were unwilling to pay the regulatory price in terms of giving up large numbers of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow to rivals.Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, and Gerard Arpey, his opposite number at American, may soon consider, however, that the competition map is changing so much that another attempt could be justified.For now, takeovers are a regional matter, however. US regulations still prohibit the foreign takeover of US airlines and limit foreign entities to a maximum voting stake of 25 per cent.In Europe, Air France succeeded in 2004 in taking over KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, although the airlines were forced to adopt a cumbersome structure providing a figleaf semblance of KLM remaining ultimately under Dutch national control to allow the deal to go ahead.Air France-KLM is also seeking to take over Italy’s Alitalia.The international aviation industry remains an unusual business, however. The normal rules of global consolidation do not yet apply and cross-border acquisitions have been virtually excluded by arcane regulations.This largely ties bilateral traffic rights between two countries to their respective national carriers.The European Union is eager to bring down this barrier in the forthcoming talks with the US on a stage two “open skies” deal.A deadline of 2010 has been set for a deal to be reached in the US/EU talks. Until there is a breakthrough, consolidation is likely to remain a regional affair with the global alliances remaining a poor substitute for real M&A.
480;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta and Northwest agree merger;;Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines have reached a merger agreement to create the world’s largest carrier, reviving expectations that the combination will touch off a wave of consolidation within the US aviation industry beset by record fuel costs and waning demand.The accord, reached late on Monday after the two companies’ boards met separately, capped several months of negotiations that nearly ended following an impasse between the carriers’ pilots. Driven by fuel, restless investors and a looming slump in demand for air travel, Delta and Northwest returned to the talks earlier this month.Both companies’ shares rose in early trading in New York on Tuesday. Delta was up 5.2 per cent at $ 9.94 while Northwest was up 0.7% at $11.30.“Both companies acted deliberately and rationally, and put a lot of work into making certain that the assumptions and planning would make it successful,” Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson told the Financial Times. “We are where we are today because of that hard work and planning, and we’re looking forward to getting this approved and closed.”In the proposed stock swap, investors will receive 1.25 shares of Delta for each Northwest share they own. The deal values Northwest at about $3.6bn, or $13.10 a share, a 17 per cent premium above Monday’s closing price.The tie-up creates a company with more than $35bn in annual revenues, a mainline fleet of almost 800 planes and a workforce of 75,000 people. In a statement, the carriers said their merger would generate more than $1bn in revenue and cost savings.Air France-KLM, the two US carriers’ transatlantic joint-venture partner, will not make an equity investment in a combined Delta/Northwest, Mr Anderson said. The European carrier has publicly pledged its support for the deal, and earlier this year had offered to inject $750m in equity capital.The merger may also draw scrutiny in Washington, and push some of their peers, from American Airlines to United Airlines, to choose a partner of their own.The combined company will be called Delta and keep its headquarters in Delta’s hometown of Atlanta. Mr Anderson will keep his title with the new carrier, as will Ed Bastian, Delta’s president and chief financial officer.The 13-member board will include seven Delta directors and six from Northwest. Northwest’s chief executive, Doug Steenland, will have a board seat, as will a representative from the pilots’ union.Delta and Northwest vowed to maintain both carrier’s existing hubs.Delta also reached a new labour contract with its pilots that would provide members with a pay rise and a 3.5 per cent equity stake in the combined carrier. The companies said they aim to combine the two companies’ pilots unions before the deal closes later this year.Non-pilot employees at both carriers will get 4 per cent of the equity.Mounting fuel costs and the deteriorating outlook for the US economy has triggered a spate of bankruptcies among smaller carriers and cast doubt that even the biggest domestic airlines can remain profitable. Many industry executives have argued consolidation would help wring out duplicate costs and give the surviving entities the scale to generate more revenue from profitable corporate clients.The pact could trigger at least one additional deal in the coming weeks, as airline executives weigh whether their own merger stands a better chance of winning the approval of US regulators while they are studying Delta’s tie-up. Most carriers would prefer to present a potential agreement before the Bush administration leaves office.Delta has long been viewed as a catalyst to a wave of mergers among the US’s legacy carriers because of its route network, recent emergence from bankruptcy and the absence of any previous agreement that would limit its ability to merge with a rival.With a Delta-Northwest pact, many industry executives and their advisers will turn their attention to the plans of Houston’s Continental Airlines.People familiar with the carrier said Continental has had preliminary discussions with both American and United.Its willingness to pursue any deal with a rival is damped by a so-called golden share provision that gives Northwest the right to block it. Continental can buy out that golden share for $100 once Northwest itself agrees to merge.Delta’s agreement with Northwest will end months of negotiations between the two carriers and their pilots. A stand-off by the pilots in finding common ground on how to rank members by seniority threatened to scuttle the merger last month.Northwest pressed Delta to consider pursuing their merger agreement even without the pilots’ support, and this month the Delta board cleared the company’s executives to revive the talks.The Northwest pilots’ labour leaders met in Minnesota on Sunday to discuss their company’s participation in consolidation.“Any merger involving Northwest Airlines, in order to avoid our vigorous opposition, must clearly be in the best interest of NWA pilots, its customers and employees,” said Dave Stevens, the Northwest pilots’ chairman.
481;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta inches closer to merger with Northwest;;Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines inched closer to a merger agreement, capping months of negotiations between two US carriers battling surging fuel costs, restless investors and a looming slump in demand for air travel.The airlines intended to unveil their accord by Tuesday, although by midday on the US east coast a late Monday announcement remained possible, people familiar with the airlines’ plans said.A merger between Delta and Northwest would create the world’s largest carrier, draw scrutiny in Washington and push many of their peers, from American Airlines to United Airlines, to consider deals of their own.The pact could trigger at least one other big deal in the coming weeks, as airline executives weigh whether their own merger stands a better chance of winning the approval of US regulators while they are studying Delta’s tie-up.

482;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-14T07:46:15Z;Airline security;;Airline shareholders have been treated to a rough ride recently.Grounded jets are making the headlines, but the bigger story is the record fuel prices that hit shares across the sector last week, not just American Airlines’ parent, AMR. The threat of recession is further depressing the sector. Meanwhile, the drip-feed of merger rumours has made equity prices volatile.There is, however, another way to invest in the sector: airline debt. In spite of bankruptcies at regional airlines, this is not as dangerous as one might think, largely because some of the loans outstanding for the large airlines are so well collateralised.Take American’s $440m term loan, maturing in 2010, which has been trading at between 90 and 95 cents on the dollar. Apart from aircraft, it is backed by valuable rights to routes from the US to Tokyo. American has $4.5bn of unrestricted cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Calyon Securities estimates that, assuming zero revenue growth and crude oil averaging $100 a barrel, American would end 2008 with cash equivalents of $3.1bn. While such an outcome would be unwelcome, the airline is far from bankruptcy, in spite of the high levels at which AMR’s credit default swaps are trading.There is an added bonus in the covenants. CreditSights reckons that, barring an unlikely surge in unit revenue growth, American could breach the cash flow-to-fixed charge requirement on its term loan this year. A breach could conceivably result in a waiver fee for debt holders, repricing at higher yields, or repayment at par.Other large airlines’ loans have been trading recently at discounts to par of between 10 and 30 per cent. If merger activity ever gets under way, repayment of some debt would be likely, offering exposure to that potential outcome. Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are said, once again, to be near a deal.As ever, there is a big risk involved – namely, that a long, deep recession ensues, while jet fuel remains expensive. But airline speculators should be used to flying by the seat of their pants.Post and read comments on this Lex

Most executives would prefer to present their agreements to US regulators before the Bush administration leaves office.Delta also hammered out the framework of a contract with its pilots that would give members a pay rise and a stake in the combined carrier, the people said.Delta said the board’s special committee continues to review all of its options in consolidation, and declined further comment. Northwest did not return a call for comment.Meanwhile, American’s flight schedule returned to normal on Sunday. The carrier cancelled more than 3,000 flights last week over safety concerns.
484;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-11T22:45:20Z;Frontier Airlines files for bankruptcy;;Frontier Airlines, a US low fare carrier headquartered in Denver, collapsed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday as the latest casualty of the growing shake-up of global aviation, as carriers struggle to cope with record oil prices and weakening economic growth.Frontier said it had been forced to seek court-administered protection from its creditors in response to a move by its principal credit card processor, First Data, to start withholding “significant proceeds” received from the sale of Frontier tickets.The collapse of Frontier into bankruptcy is the starkest illustration to date of the drastic tightening of operating conditions in the US aviation sector, where several leading carriers are already cutting domestic capacity and grounding older aircraft.The airline said the action by the credit card company would have drained “a substantial portion” of its available cash almost immediately and may have made it impossible to continue normal operations.Frontier said it intended to continue operating its full schedule of flights while in bankruptcy. It said it expected its restructuring in Chapter 11 to last between nine and 18 months.“It is truly unfortunate that we have had to take this action,” said Sean Menke, Frontier’s chief executive.“We felt that Frontier would be able to withstand the challenges confronting the US airline industry, which include unprecedented and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel and the impact of the credit crisis in the financial markets, without seeking bankruptcy protection.”Under the bankruptcy code, the credit card processor would be prohibited from increasing the share of ticket sale proceeds it was withholding.“We are prepared to litigate this issue if necessary,” said Mr Menke.Frontier’s bankruptcy comes less than a year since the outlook for the US airline industry appeared to be brightening with the emergence of two leading airlines Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines from Chapter 11 restructuring.At least five US airlines including Skybus, a start-up low-cost short-haul carrier, Aloha Airlines and ATA have collapsed, suffering the same fate as Maxjet Airways, the all-business class, transatlantic carrier, which went into liquidation at the end of December.
485;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-10T23:57:04Z;American cancels another 1,500 flights;;American Airlines cancelled 570 flights on Friday, setting up US airports for a fourth day of chaos and bringing the number of flights cancelled by the carrier this week to more than 3000.The cancellations, coming after 900 on Thursday, brought further chaos to US airports, as AA raced to perform safety checks. The cancellations came after Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways pulled flights after officials announced spot inspections of all US airlines’ safety paperwork.Airlines have been under increased scrutiny since early March, when details surfaced of a congressional investigation into claims that the Federal Aviation Administration, the regulator, had permitted Southwest Airlines to fly aircraft that were not compliant with airworthiness standards.Before the Senate aviation sub-committee on Thursday, the transportation department’s inspector-general criticised what he called an “overly collaborative” relationship between airlines and the FAA, and called for improved safety oversight.“[Airlines] were deciding which inspectors checked their facility,” said Calvin Scovel. “To me it signals a regulator that has lost the respect of the [airlines it regulates].”Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said: “Every day it seems to get worse with the Federal Aviation Administration. I’m concerned that so many air travellers are stuck on the ground, but I’m even more concerned that so many potentially unsafe planes were allowed to take millions of Americans into the skies for so long.”Analysts said this week’s disruptions could cost American tens of millions of dollars at a time when the industry is being hit by soaring fuel costs and recession fears.Gerard Arpey, American’s chief executive, was quoted by Reuters as saying his airline would need several more days to restore normal operations.The disruption prompted massive queues at airports.American cancelled 123 flights at Chicago’s O’Hare, half its scheduled number of take-offs, after cancelling 168 flights on Wednesday. O’Hare, American’s second largest hub after Dallas Fort Worth, has been among the worst affected.Additional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington
486;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-10T18:24:17Z;Wave of safety checks snarls US travel plans;;The wave of disruption spreading across US airports in recent days shows little sign of abating, as airlines are forced to ground fleets of aircraft at short notice in response to growing concerns in the US about aviation safety regulation.Chicago’s O’Hare airport, the second biggest aviation hub in the US after Atlanta, was hit by the chaos of flight cancellations after American Airlines was forced to ground its fleet of 300 ageing MD-80 short-haul jets used on domestic routes across the US. Meanwhile, Dallas Fort Worth, American’s largest hub, had 269 flights cancelled on Thursday.American said it had cancelled more than 900 flights on Thursday, as it worked to complete the inspections of the MD-80 fleet, after halting 1,094 flights on Wednesday and 460 on Tuesday. More than 100,000 travellers have been affected by the cancellations, the airline estimates.At O’Hare the airline cancelled half its scheduled take-offs, sending thousands of customers scrambling across the airport to seek seats on other carriers or leaving them stranded overnight in the terminals.The disruption prompted huge queues and angry exchanges between customers and staff at O’Hare, where hundreds of travellers have been forced to spend the night at the airport.Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the airport, said American Airlines had asked O’Hare to supply emergency cots and blankets for about 400 people during the past two days, but many more had stayed at the airport overnight.“There are lots of people who spend the night walking around the airport or who choose to sleep in chairs,” she said.Businesses have been pre-emptively rescheduling their executives’ flights by rebooking them on to other carriers.The grounding of the domestic jets at American follows similar actions at leading airlines including Southwest Airlines, Delta and United Airlines following a recent spate of aircraft-safety violations at Southwest and other carriers.A US congressional committee said last week that the violations pointed to a “systematic pattern of failure” by federal regulators to supervise the nation’s aviation industry. “There is evidence that there may be a pattern of regulatory abuse and that these regulatory lapses may be more widespread,” the US House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure said last week.Jim Oberstar, committee chairman said “it is of no consolation later to say nobody died. That is not the purpose of safety. We expect the FAA to oversee safety compliance of the airlines.”At American Airlines the inspections were conducted to ensure compliance with a Federal Aviation Administration directive related to the bundling of wires in the wheel well of the MD-80 aircraft.The FAA last month fined Southwest $10.2m for flying some aircraft for more than two years after they were due for inspection, and launched spot audits on the records of all 118 domestic carriers. In the atmosphere of a witch-hunt carriers are taking no chances and are allowing no short-cuts.United Airlines, the second largest US carrier, was forced last week to ground its entire fleet of 52 Boeing 777-200 long-haul jets for safety checks. The 777 is the most important aircraft in the United long-haul fleet, and the grounding immediately led to the cancellation of scores of flights causing serious disruption for thousands of passengers stranded round the world.The United grounding followed a regular review of maintenance records, when it discovered the functional test that checks the firing system on one of the five bottles in the cargo fire suppression system on the Boeing 777s had not been performed. The oversight was disclosed to the FAA.
487;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-09T22:54:45Z;American Airlines cancels 1,000 flights;;American Airlines cancelled more than 1,000 flights on Wednesday as the reinspection of its fleet of MD-80 aircraft stretched into a second day, diverting thousands of passengers and piling expenses on a US carrier already burdened by record fuel costs.The airline pulled its 300 MD-80s from service on Tuesday to check if the aircraft were in compliance with a government airworthiness directive, the second time in two weeks it had grounded the fleet following an audit of its records by the Federal Aviation Administration.American and its peers have faced regulatory scrutiny since early March, when details began to surface of a congressional investigation into claims the FAA had permitted Southwest Airlines to fly planes that were not in compliance with certain airworthiness standards. Other US carriers, including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, have pulled aircraft into service following the FAA’s spot inspections of all US airlines’ paperwork.American cancelled 460 flights on Tuesday, and more are expected on Thursday as the company, based in Fort Worth, Texas, continues to inspect and service additional MD-80s.The carrier has sought to divert affected passengers to other American flights and, when necessary, found them alternative airlines. American agreed to reimburse hotel and meal costs for those stranded overnight and offer about $500 in travel vouchers for their inconvenience.At Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, one of American’s hubs, the queue snaked rows deep as diverted passengers sought to trade their tickets for seats on United flights. At American’s hangar, a row of MD-80s sat awaiting inspection.An American spokesman noted the cancellations had “a very significant financial impact”.The FAA ordered spot audits last month on the paperwork of all 118 domestic carriers. A week later, American grounded its fleet of MD-80s while it checked whether the aircraft violated an airworthiness directive that specified the distance between clips holding bundles of wires in place. In its review, the FAA found the way American had bundled wires in the MD-80’s wheel wells may also have violated that same directive.
488;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-06T17:41:54Z;Delta and Northwest revive merger talks;;Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, two US airlines seeking to add scale in the face of a brutal industry-wide downturn, have revived their talks to merge, people familiar with the matter said.Record fuel costs, competition and ebbing demand has ended the US industry’s modest recovery, forcing carriers to slash flight schedules, park aircraft and impose fees on passengers. In the past week, three low-cost airlines – Aloha Airgroup, ATA Airlines and SkyBus – shut down operations.Delta and Northwest had inched close to an agreement in February. Those negotiations stalled when their pilot unions failed to find common ground on how to rank members by seniority, which determines pay, rank and aircraft flown.Executives at Minnesota-based Northwest have since put pressure on their counterparts at Delta to proceed without the pilots’ support.Delta’s board members, who convened a meeting late last week to discuss the company’s options, agreed to press ahead with negotiations, the people said. Those talks are now intensifying, with the two sides set to meet again this week, they said.Delta and Northwest declined to comment.As part of the previous talks, the two carriers agreed to swap Northwest shares for those of Delta at little or no premium, appoint Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, as the combined company’s chief executive and keep the headquarters in Delta’s hometown of Atlanta, the people said.They also hammered out a new, $2bn labour accord that would have given pilots pay raises and a 5 per cent equity stake in a combined company.But by late February, the two labour groups broke off negotiations without agreement. Representatives from each union met again in March to no avail, and Delta’s pilots rejected the Northwest union’s proposal to seek arbitration for a solution to the seniority stalemate.Delta’s public assurances that it would not proceed with any deal that would sacrifice job security and seniority benefits, along with the pilots’ impasse, appeared to thwart the two airlines’ plans. The companies had sought to line up the pilots’ accord to help avoid the acrimony and protracted negotiations that often slows down airlines’ effort to integrate.The industry’s outlook has since darkened, forcing Delta’s executives and board members to consider leaving negotiations with the pilots until after they reach an agreement to merge.Delta and Northwest each recently announced plans to trim domestic capacity, reducing the size of their fleets, to reduce costs.
489;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-04-02T18:29:01Z;United Airlines grounds Boeing 777 fleet;;United Airlines grounded its fleet of 52 Boeing 777s Wednesday after missing safety checks on a component in the fire-suppression system of the planes’ cargo hold.Passengers were told to expect delays and cancellations as the carrier repeated inspections on each of the wide-body jets used on international and cross-country routes. By mid-afternoon Wednesday, the company had returned 26 aircraft to service, but was still forced to cancel 38 flights from airports ranging from Hawaii to London Heathrow.United’s admission underscores the heightened scrutiny facing airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration, their chief regulator.A US House committee’s investigation into allegations of lax FAA supervision of Southwest Airlines, and suspicions it was no more diligent with other carriers, threatened to damage the industry and prodded the regulator into action.The FAA fined Southwest $10.2m, its steepest penalty yet, for flying some aircraft well after they were due for inspection, and launched spot audits on the records of all 118 domestic carriers.FAA officials said Wednesday that its initial wave of checks showed that airlines were complying with 99 per cent of the nearly 2,400 airworthiness directives they reviewed. The regulator is investigating four airlines for failing seven compliance tests between them.Those tests, which continue until June, prompted American Airlines and Delta Air Lines to cancel hundreds of flights last week as they repeated inspections on aircraft. US Airways is inspecting its 45 Boeing 757s after a composite panel fell off a wing during a March 22 flight from Orlando to Philadelphia.In reviewing the paperwork on its 777s, United discovered its standard preflight checks did not include an inspection of one of the five canisters used to extinguish fires in the cargo area. None of the aircraft indicated the system had malfunctioned, and United expects to complete its tests within 36 hours.The carrier plans to reroute passengers on different aircraft in its fleet, or find seats for them with other airlines. United said it was too early to predict how much the cancellations would cost United.The House committee will hold a hearing in Washington Thursday to collect testimonies from FAA officials and Southwest executives.
490;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-31T21:01:37Z;Hedge funds feel the pain;;"Hedge funds are having their worst start to the year on record after March turned into one of the ugliest months for popular strategies and several funds imploded.Daily data from Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research showed that, with two trading days to go, the average fund tracked by its HFRX index was down 2.4 per cent in March, its worst month since the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998.January had also been a very poor month for the industry, only partially offset by February’s recovery.The dire March performance follows disastrous results from many big, relative value traders, who bet on price discrepancies and typically use a lot of gearing.Several big funds specialising in relative value strategies were hammered by wild swings in Japanese bond spreads, forcing sales – and losses – across other markets that they traded.“It was a very difficult month to make money for every fixed income strategy,” said one hedge fund investor. “At some stage, something’s gone wrong for almost all trades.”Big losers among relative value traders included London’s $3bn Endeavour Capital, which plunged 34 per cent last month; London Diversified Fund Management’s flagship fund, down about 10 per cent this year, and John Meriwether, the former LTCM co-founder, whose flagship fund is down about 28 per cent.As well as the problems at relative value funds, managers across all strategies suffered as the widespread bet on commodity prices going up and the financial sector suffering turned against them.“I’d like to say there was a bright spot but there really wasn’t,” said one prime broker.Pardus Capital Management, a New York activist with positions in Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Paris-based Atos Origin, on Monday suspended redemptions on its $2bn fund to prevent it being forced to sell.This year has seen a series of hedge fund blow-ups as banks pulled leverage or investors demanded their money back from illiquid strategies.The highest profile collapse was that of London’s $2bn Peloton ABS fund, which missed margin calls after betting that the price of mortgage securities would recover. But problems have struck leveraged funds across all investment styles, with some leveraged equity funds – such as Focus Capital, down about 80 per cent – plummeting in value when forced to sell hard-to-trade shares.“I can’t recall a year that’s got off to a worse start,” said Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR.The HFRX index is not always a good measure of broader industry performance as it includes only funds which provide daily valuations. But recently it has tracked closely the wider HFRI index. The HFRX is down 2.7 per cent so far this year, compared with a worse-ever first quarter from the HFRI in 2001, when it fell just over 0.5 per cent.Still, hedge funds have done better on average than equity markets, with the FTSE 100 UK blue-chip index having its worst first quarter since creation in 1984, down 11.9 per cent."
491;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-31T18:04:06Z;Delta plans four-way Atlantic venture;;Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines expect to receive antitrust immunity this month from the US government to form a four-way transatlantic joint venture including KLM and Northwest Airlines.The joint venture, in which Air France-KLM, Delta and Northwest would share profits and revenues and jointly plan sales, networks and capacity, would have a turnover of $12bn and would account for about 30 per cent of the North Atlantic market.It would become one of the most powerful forces in the North Atlantic aviation market, providing tough competition for other leading carriers, such as British Airways, American Airlines, Lufthansa, United Airlines and Continental Airlines.KLM and Northwest pioneered such collaboration under the protection of antitrust immunity a decade ago, while Air France and Delta agreed last October to form their own transatlantic joint venture, which from 2010 will include routes generating about $8bn a year.The first phase of the Air France-Delta joint venture came into force at the weekend encompassing annual revenues of $1.5bn.The four airlines are combining forces for an attack on the lucrative London Heathrow market to the US to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the liberalisation of transatlantic aviation secured by the US/European Union “open skies” treaty, which came into force at the weekend.Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, Air France-KLM deputy chief executive, said the European group was still supporting moves by Delta and Northwest, its partners in the SkyTeam global airline alliance, to explore a merger in the US in spite of the problems the two groups have faced in seeking to combine their pilot workforces.He said Air France-KLM had offered to inject $750m in fresh equity capital into a merged Delta/Northwest to support the deal.In the face of the impasse in the Delta/Northwest pilot talks, the two US carriers were instead examining the potential for a light version of a merger much more along the lines of the takeover deals completed in Europe by Air France of KLM and by Lufthansa of Swiss, said Mr Gourgeon.In both these deals the equity ownership of the respective airlines has been merged along with various corporate functions and the merged groups have sought to present a unified product offering to customers. The flying operations have been kept as separate entities, however, avoiding the highly sensitive issue of trying to merge the pilot seniority lists of separate airlines.
492;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta/Northwest deal;;Calling all airline bosses: here is a great way of ensuring your staff goes ballistic over a possible merger. First, propose a deal in an industry famous for bitter labour disputes, but make employees’ buy-in a precondition and offer them various goodies. Then, once the workers say “no thanks”, consider going ahead with the merger anyway.Northwest Airlines has reportedly proposed to Delta Air Lines that they both forge ahead with a deal, even without first securing the support of their pilots. Back in February, the two airlines were said to be offering pay rises and even equity in the combined entity if pilots could agree on a combined seniority list before announcing a deal. Now, even those sweeteners might be off the table.Airlines are service businesses. Ticking off the people who actually fly the aircraft has been a pretty effective way of wrecking customer satisfaction in the past. A deal announced with the pilots’ blessing already in hand would have a better chance of regulatory approval and smooth integration. Given the industry’s history, however, handing the pilots some sort of veto over corporate strategy was a rash move.On top of this, pricey fuel stirred in with a possible recession make a potentially lethal cocktail for the industry, so the pressure is on.That Northwest was ready to concede the name, headquarters location and top job gives an idea of how much it wants this deal. In that light, the suggestion of an about-face on preconditions looks like an attempt to light a fire under the pilots. If that is the strategy, it is a risky one. Even if a deal were announced, angry pilots could stymie its success. For investors betting on the range of possible outcomes, one thing is becoming clearer: the chances of this deal providing near-term relief from the growing pressures on the industry’s economics look ever more remote.Post and read comments on this Lex
493;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-28T23:08:03Z;Northwest proceeding on merger despite unions;;Northwest Airlines has sought to press ahead with plans to merge with rival Delta Air Lines without first securing the support of their pilots, people familiar with the plan said.The two carriers’ pilots unions have failed to reach agreement on how to rank their members in seniority, casting doubt on a deal that had appeared imminent last month after Delta and Northwest had found common ground on every other front.Northwest’s stance ratchets up the pressure on a Delta management team already contending with frustrated shareholders, mounting fuel costs and a deteriorating US economy. In prodding Delta now, Northwest may also succeed in coaxing the two pilots groups back to the bargaining table to resolve the seniority impasse, the people said.Delta’s public assurances that it would not proceed with any deal that would sacrifice job security and seniority benefits may have painted the company’s chief executive, Richard Anderson, into a corner, airline executives said.In pursuing a merger now without a firm agreement with its pilots, they said, Mr Anderson risked appearing to be reneging on promises to seek a tie-up that avoided the acrimony and protracted union negotiations of previous airline mergers.Mindful that union support could help their accord win a friendlier reception from regulators, Delta and Northwest tried to reach agreements on both a new labour contract and a combined seniority list, which determines pilots’ pay, rank and the aircraft they fly.The two carriers had agreed to swap Northwest shares for those of Delta at little or no premium, appoint Mr Anderson as the combined company’s chief executive and keep the headquarters in Delta’s hometown of Atlanta, the people said.They also had hammered out a new, $2bn labour accord that would have given pilots a 30 per cent pay raise and a 5 per cent equity stake in the combined company, the people said.But by late February, the two labour groups had broken off negotiations without agreement. Representatives from each union met again earlier this month to no avail, and Delta’s pilots recently rejected the Northwest union’s proposal to seek arbitration for a solution to the seniority stalemate.Even if the two unions do agree on a seniority list now, the recent run-up in oil prices declining health of the US economy may force Delta and Northwest to renegotiate some of those benefits.
494;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta grounds 275 flights for rechecks;;"Delta Air Lines cancelled 275 flights this week to reinspect its fleet of Boeing MD-88 aircraft and became the latest US carrier to alter its schedule following a review by federal regulators.The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered spot audits on the records of all 118 domestic carriers. It had been criticised for failing to catch safety violations on some Southwest Airlines aircraft.About 3 per cent of Delta’s flights were cancelled. It had planned to resume its normal schedule by early Friday.In reviewing records with FAA investigators, Delta found that its 117 MD-88s might be in violation of a directive that specifies the distance between clips that bind a bundle of wires inside the wings.American Airlines pulled about 300 flights this week to check whether its fleet of MD-80s complied with the same directive.“This is a voluntary reinspection,” Delta said.FAA investigators were to review each carrier’s paperwork on at least 10 tests by Friday. By the end of June they will check 10 per cent of the thousands of airworthiness directives.Southwest’s lapses prompted a congressional investigation into whether FAA officials had grown complacent in enforcement in an effort to win co-operation from carriers.The US House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure will hold a hearing on aviation safety next week.

This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.
496;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-26T18:44:27Z;The big story: New gateway designed to please;;Business travellers flying from Heathrow will not be able to cut it as fine as they used to after the airport’s Terminal Five opens on Tuesday.They will have to pass through a new security check and will be turned back if they fail to get there at least 35 minutes before departure.The extra check should help to avert problems that cause delays, says British Airways.For example, it will alert staff at the departure gate that a passenger who has checked in online has arrived at the airport. At present they are often unaware until the last minute.BA, T5’s sole tenant, is clearly making a virtue of necessity. Domestic and international customers, separated up to now, will be able to mingle before boarding.So the airline needs to ensure they will not be able to swap identities.As well as reading their boarding passes, equipment at the new checkpoint will photograph and take a four-finger biometric record of domestic travellers.“The information will be destroyed after staff at the gate have ensured passengers are who they say they are,” says a BA spokesman. “The new check is to their overall benefit because it will result in fewer delays.”Cutting down delays is the sine qua non of the £4.3bn ($8.5bn) terminal.Every inch of it is designed to restore Heathrow’s severely-damaged reputation by ensuring that passengers are processed more efficiently, more flights leave on time and baggage turns up according to plan.BA promises that, for the vast majority of travellers, progress from check-in to the departure lounge will take no more than 10 minutes.The terminal will be able to handle 27m passengers a year from the outset and an extra 3m from 2011 when the second of two departure gate satellites opens.That is nearly half the annual 68m currently passing through Heathrow’s four existing terminals, which were designed to handle 45m. T5 will function on two main floors – arrivals at ground level and departure above.“Currently about 60 per cent of our passengers check in online or at self-service kiosks,” the BA spokesman says.“T5 will get that up to 80 per cent. There will be 96 kiosks and over 90 fast bag drop desks.“We’ve tried to make it much more intuitive. Sometimes in Terminal One you have no idea where you need to queue. When it’s busy you are not sure whether you are waiting for our desk or someone else’s.”Passengers with problems to be resolved, including those that require returning to a ticket counter, will be dealt with at another line of desks, beyond the fast bag drop.“Usually, baggage check-in is at the back wall of the departure area because that’s where the baggage system starts,” says the BA spokesman. “In T5 it’s different. Instead of turning back on themselves when they have dropped their bags, they will carry on straight ahead. They need never turn through 180 degrees.”Even when the number of passengers using the terminal has reached its maximum, there will still be spare baggage capacity, BA claims, and while passengers and travel managers still question whether gremlins may sneak in, the airline has been working to sure they are excluded.It has been testing the system by pushing through up to 12,000 bags a day.“Bar codes on bag tags will be scanned every few seconds so that we can identify those which need to be speeded up because of an imminent departure,” says the spokesman.“We will also be able to locate bags more quickly if they need to be offloaded. At present it’s quite a cumbersome system.“We aim to get bags to the carousel before the passenger arrives there.”The fact that 90 per cent of BA’s transfer passengers will switch flights without changing terminals should also lead to fewer hold-ups.It is not just the internal design of T5 that should reduce irritations.Frequent travellers complain that one of the greatest of all frustrations is to land at Heathrow only to crawl across the airport and then sit on the tarmac while the crew waits for a parking stand to become available.But T5’s location means aircraft will not have to taxi across runways after touching down.And they will no longer have to wait for another aircraft to clear the parking cul-de-sacs that cause delays at existing terminals.Passengers with time to kill, perhaps before boarding long-haul flights from Satellite building B – linked to the main building by driverless trains running every 90 seconds – will be able to do so in one of five lounges, depending on their ticket type or frequent flyer scheme status.They will provide 25 per cent more capacity than those operated by the airline in Terminals One and Four combined. Four will be in the main departure area and one in the satellite.There will also be an arrivals lounge.Retail outlets will include Mappin & Webb, Tiffany, Dior, Gucci, Prada and Bulgari.Travellers hit by delays that clever design can do nothing to prevent, such as those caused by weather or air traffic congestion, will be able to soothe frayed tempers at a travel spa, offering treatments including facials and massages – or dine at one of about two dozen eateries such as Carluccio’s (Italian) and Plane Food, Gordon Ramsay’s 180-seat restaurant.………………………………………………Who flies from which terminal?A huge shake-up will accompany the opening of Terminal Five, with 54 airlines switching terminals in eight phases.All but 30 per cent of British Airways’ services will move into the new building as soon as it opens.These include all domestic and international short-haul flights now using Terminal One (T1) except those to Madrid, Lisbon, Nice and Helsinki, which will operate from T3 starting on September 17.Long-haul services using T1, short-haul flights from T4 and Miami services – currently using T3 – will also move to T5 at its inception.Algiers flights, currently from Gatwick, will operate from T5 from March 30.On the same date, BA’s Houston flights will move temporarily to T4, shifting to T5 a month later.All other inter-continental services will move from T4 to T5 at the end of April – except those operated by either BA or Qantas under joint service agreements to Bangkok, Singapore and Sydney, which will move to T3 early next year.BA’s airline partners in the Oneworld alliance will be based in T3. American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines and Royal Jordanian are there already.American will transfer its Raleigh-Durham services and one of its Dallas-Fort Worth flights there with departures starting on March 29.Finnair and Iberia will operate there from September 17 and Qantas from early next year.Star Alliance airlines will use T1.United Airlines and Air New Zealand will operate there from June 10. Carriers in the Skyteam alliance will operate from T4.They include Delta, Continental and Northwest, which will all launch new services from Heathrow this spring as a result of the recent US-UK open skies agreement.One member, KLM, already uses the terminal, while five others – France, Alitalia, Czech Airlines, Aeroflot and Kenya Airways – will move there next February.Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic has confirmed it will stay in T3 but Jet Airways, Gulf Air and Malaysian Airways are scheduled to move from there to T4 in September.
497;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Departure of EA takeover chief;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest independent video game publisher, has announced the departure of a key figure in its fight to gain control of rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series of games.EA said that Warren Jenson, chief financial officer for the past six years, was leaving the company and that a successor would be announced shortly. It gave no reason for the change.Mr Jenson had been leading the $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two with John Riccitiello, chief executive, and his departure comes as a surprise.EA said Mr Jenson would help with the transition to his replacement and would close out EA’s fiscal year, which ends next Monday.A regulatory filing re-vealed EA reached a transition agreement with Mr Jenson last week. He would continue to receive his base salary of $595,000 a year with benefits until September 30 unless he took up a new job.Mr Riccitiello has made several management changes since he succeeded Larry Probst as chief executive a year ago. He has reorganised the company into four different “labels” with separate heads and this month appointed a chief operating officer, John Pleasants, to lead the company’s global publishing operations.Mr Jenson is a high-profile CFO, having served in that position in companies as varied as Amazon.com, NBC and Delta Airlines.
498;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta cuts staff as it struggles with tie up;;Delta Air Lines on Tuesday said it had offered early retirement to 30,000 employees, made steep cuts to its domestic flight schedule and parked as many as 45 aircraft.The airline industry has been beset by a surge in fuel costs and the weakening US economy, with oil’s march above $100 a barrel set to add more than $2bn to Delta’s fuel bill this year.While “it’s not out of the question we’ll be profitable this year”, said Ed Bastian, Delta president, the US carrier needed to “act quickly and decisively”.United Airlines, one of Delta’s largest rivals, also unveiled plans to pull as many as 20 of the less efficient planes from its fleet by the end of the year.“It’s not a good time for the industry,” Mr Bastian said on Tuesday. “We’re in uncharted territory.”Delta expects about 2,000 employees, including 1,300 frontline workers, will accept the voluntary severance. No pilots were offered the deal. If fewer than 700 administrative employees take the package, Delta will close the gap through involuntary cuts.Delta now plans to trim its domestic capacity by 10 per cent this year by reducing the frequency of busier routes and cutting some point-to-point flights. It also reiterated its quarterly forecasts, noting the demand for international travel and advanced fuel purchases would help to offset the US slowdown.The carrier’s announcements came a day after its pilots’ top labour leader told his members he had failed to find common ground with his counterparts at Northwest Airlines on a combined seniority list, casting doubt on prospects that the two companies will merge.The stalemate leaves Delta and Northwest executives and their boards with a difficult decision: press ahead with a deal without pilot support or break off talks, risking the ire of shareholders. At Tuesday’s meeting, Mr Bastian declined to tip Delta’s hand.Complicating Delta’s choice is its executives’ public assurances that they won’t proceed with any deal that would sacrifice job security and seniority benefits, or abandon the company’s corporate headquarters in Atlanta. Seeking to pre-empt the acrimony and protracted negotiations that have followed past airline mergers and mindful that their unions’ support could help their deal win a friendlier reception from regulators, Delta and Northwest tried to reach agreements on both a new labour contract and a combined seniority list, which determines pilots’ pay, rank and the aircraft they fly.Delta’s peers have privately questioned the company’s strategy, noting that meshing two seniority lists is difficult under any circumstances, let alone before a merger is officially announced. United, which has held talks with both Delta and Continental Airlines, has told its pilots that they won’t be given the chance to negotiate anything before a merger agreement is reached, people familiar with the matter said.While Delta and Northwest inched closer to an accord last month, their pilots’ seniority list stood as the final hurdle. By late February, the two labour groups had broken off negotiations in New York without agreement. Representatives from each union met again earlier this month to no avail.In a letter to his members, Lee Moak, Delta master executive council chairman, said he received an invitation from his counterpart at Northwest to meet a third time, but learned “they were unable to address our last proposal”.He wrote: “I declined and informed the MEC and Delta’s senior executives that the two MECs were unable to reach an agreement on an acceptable seniority list integration.”But he did not rule out the possibility his union would revisit discussions to advance the merger efforts.“So what happens next?” Mr Moak wrote. “Quite frankly, the answer to that question is unclear. We work in an industry filled with uncertainty.”

By late February, the two labour groups had broken off negotiations in New York without an accord. Representatives from each union met again earlier this month to no avail.In a letter to his members, Lee Moak, Delta Master Executive Council chairman, wrote that he received an invitation from his counterpart at Northwest to meet a third time, but learned “they were unable to address our last proposal.”“I declined and informed the MEC and Delta’s senior executives that the two MECs were unable to reach an agreement on an acceptable seniority list integration,” Mr Moak wrote.Pursuing the Northwest merger without the full support of Mr Moak and his members would mark a reversal of the line Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, and other top managers have shared publicly in the last month.In a February 26 memo to employees, Mr Anderson and Ed Bastian, Delta president, wrote that they would not sacrifice job security and seniority benefits or abandon Delta’s corporate headquarters in Atlanta to complete a deal.Of course, some of the factors that led to Delta and Northwest holding discussions in the first place – fuel costs and economic uncertainty – have only worsened in recent weeks. Oil prices, Mr Moak pointed out, reached another record high last week.“Our special committee of the board remains active,” a Delta spokeswoman said. A Northwest spokeswoman declined to comment.Mr Anderson said Friday he would unveil plans this week to scale back Delta’s domestic flight schedule to combat the surging price of fuel.Mr Moak also didn’t rule out completely the possibility that his union would revisit discussions to advance the companies’ efforts to merge.“So what happens next?” Mr Moak wrote. “Quite frankly, the answer to that question is unclear. We work in an industry filled with uncertainty.”

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,243.87.“The overall sentiment picture suggests that although there is scope for a short-lived rally, equities are by no means out of the bear trend,” said analyst Sreekala Kochugovindan of Barclays Capital. “Sentiment is only marginally below crisis levels and there is a risk that once the euphoria of [the Federal Reserve’s liquidity action] subsides, investor focus could return to the continued problems of financial sector woes and the effect of a mild bout of stagflation.”Credit Suisse characterised said the Fed’s action – which sparked a massive rally in stocks on Monday – “does not address the fundamental problem of solvency, in our view. The two critical issues are that US housing still looks overvalued and that we think banks need to deleverage.”Until the Fed-induced rally, the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Financial stocks ended lower after a volatile day’s trade. The S&P financial index fell 2.1 per cent, while an index of investment banks fell 1.8 per cent.Among big bank stocks, Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $21.21, JPMorgan, fell 0.6 per cent at $38.61, while Bear Stearns fell 2.2 per cent at $61.58.Shares in the government sponsored mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae closed lower in active trade.Both Fannie and Freddie fell sharply this morning after media reports said they might have to issue more than $10bn in new stock this year as the lenders continue to serve as a backstop for the deteriorating housing market.Freddie Mac fell 0.6 per cent to $20.04 despite comments from the company’s chief executive that it had sufficient capital and had no plans to raise more capital through a share sale. Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.04.Countrywide, the mortgage lender which Bank of America has agreed to buy, fell 7.1 per cent to $4.75. Fitch, the ratings agency, cut the lender’s rating to BBB- from BBB+ after the market closed.American Eagle, the clothing retailer, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 6.4 per cent as it increased discounts to clear out unsold merchandise. The earnings were in line with expectations and the shares gained 4 per cent to $17.94. Healthcare company WellPoint fell 1.7 per cent to $46.45 after Fitch changed its outlook on the company from “stable” to “negative”. WellPoint warned early this week that 2008 earnings would not meet forecasts because of higher medical costs and fewer subscribers than expected.JPMorgan downgraded a number of airlines, including American, Northwest and Delta. Shares in American fell 12.8 per cent to $9.31. Northwest fell 16.2 per cent to $10.25 while Delta was down 16.4 per cent at $10.13.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained in afternoon trade, rising 1.1 per cent to $24.91, after the video game publisher raised its outlook for 2008. Take-Two reiterated that it had rejected a $2bn buy-out offer from rival Electronic Arts.Dow component Caterpillar said after the close of the previous session that 2008 sales and earnings would top earlier forecasts. The heavy equipment maker also raised its long-term sales goal. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $75.25.The pharmaceuticals sector came under pressure after Wyeth and Progenics

502;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-11T23:06:15Z;Northwest moves to ease fuel costs pain;;Northwest Airlines is to begin using a dedicated commodity and energy derivatives platform as it steps up its efforts to cope with record fuel prices.The US carrier will use a platform developed by SuperDerivatives, a firm that provides specialist derivatives trading and pricing platforms to asset managers, investment banks, exchanges and corporations.It comes after Doug Steenland, chief executive of Northwest, said skyrocketing oil prices were a “serious budget-breaker” and a “difficult financial challenge” for the carrier that emerged from bankruptcy last year and which is close to announcing plans to merge with Delta Airlines.Higher fuel prices are one of the factors driving consolidation among carriers.Crude oil prices on Tuesday surged to an all-time high near $110 a barrel as the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ energy watchdog, said that demand would be robust this year, boosted by consumption in China and the Middle East.The price spike was helped by the weakness of the US dollar which fell to a record low of $1.5459 against the euro. Financial flows into the commodities markets are also behind the current oil price rally, according to some analysts.Although the IEA did not say in its report whether prices above $100 a barrel were justified by market fundamentals, it warned that “only a protracted and severe global recession would justify a sustained dip in oil prices” below $60 a barrel.David Zanussi, managing director of fuel management at Northwest, said the company had searched for a derivatives platform that would enable it to evaluate various trading strategies.“The platform supports our decision-making process and allows us to smartly plan and time our energy market purchases and financial activities. It also provides us with hedging approaches using a solid selection of proxies to jet fuel exposure, including heating fuel and crude oil and the ability to use other specialised instruments to our advantage.”Northwest Airlines is the first airline to use SuperDerivatives, which is also in talks with other US-based regional and international carriers.
503;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-10T23:32:54Z;Airport overhaul races to prepare for Olympics;;Within a few months, as many as 26m fewer passengers a year will be using the existing, highly congested four terminals at Heathrow, as most BA customers are transferred to T5.As a result, for the first time in decades, BAA, the operator of Europe’s busiest airport, has room for manoeuvre. It can start the long-needed overhaul of the rest of the airport, subject to the health of its finances. The next big goal is the opening of another terminal, Heathrow East, to accommodate 30m passengers a year in time for the London Olympics in 2012. Heathrow East will replace Terminals 1 and 2. While attention is focused this month on the opening of T5 for British Airways, the rest of the airport and the more than 90 other airlines using Heathrow face two years of upheaval. As many as 54 airlines are eventually due to be relocated.With the addition of T5, passenger capacity at Heathrow will rise to around 90m a year, from the 68m handled in the past 12 months.The airport is being reorganised around the global airline alliance structure that has emerged in recent years with the three groupings of Star, Oneworld and SkyTeam. The alliances are all keen to be co-located to improve the interchange of passengers between member airlines and to share facilities. For the first time, BAA can begin to satisfy the airlines’ wishes.SkyTeam, led by Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines, will be based at T4, along with many of the non-aligned carriers. Star carriers, led by BMI British Midland, Lufthansa, United Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, will be grouped at T1 (and from 2012, at Heathrow East), while Oneworld carriers will largely be at T3, where Virgin Atlantic will maintain its current base.BA is also locating its joint operations with Oneworld partners Qantas and Iberia at T3, which is being redeveloped as part of a 10-year, £1bn upgrade. Modernisation of the forecourt of T3 has already been completed and a new pier has been opened in time to handle the first operations of the Airbus A380 superjumbo.The move of Star alliance carriers to T1 will take place in two stages in June and November, while SkyTeam carriers will move to T4 at the end of this month and in February next year.
504;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-03-06T19:13:40Z;BA looks to play consolidation game;;As investors worry about the short-term outlook for British Airways, its chief executive Willie Walsh is starting to think longer term, and dealmaking appears to be back on the agenda as he plots a new vision and strategy for the UK carrier.With record profits already in the bag for the current year to the end of March, Mr Walsh is preparing for a period of growth, both of the existing business and through possible mergers and acquisitions. And his enthusiasm is not dimmed by the prospect of economic slowdown and lower profits next year.“Some of the shackles have been removed,” he told investors and equity analysts on Thursday, “we have not quite fixed the core business, but we are well on the way”.Closest to home he publicly signalled his strongest interest yet in a possible takeover of local rival BMI British Midland, largely for the 11 per cent of the take-off and landing slots BMI controls at London Heathrow airport, BA’s global hub.“We are very interested in the future of BMI,” he said, putting down a clear marker for the discussions on its future ownership, that will take place later this year between Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman and majority shareholder of BMI, and Lufthansa, which holds 30 per cent minus one share.Sir Michael, who is still playing his cards very close to his chest, has a current option to sell the majority of the business to Lufthansa, while the German carrier has a six-month call option to buy BMI starting from mid-December.It is still most likely that the options will either be extended or that Lufthansa will take control in order to use BMI as the bridgehead for an assault by the Star global airline alliance, of which it is a leading member, on the London aviation market.But Mr Walsh made clear that BA is ready to step up to the plate, if it gets a chance.Elsewhere in Europe, he also sought to maintain a bridge to Spain’s Iberia, in which BA still holds a 10 per cent stake despite the failure of a takeover approach last year as part of a consortium led by TPG, the US private equity group.“[Iberia] remains attractive to us,” said Mr Walsh. “There are opportunities to do more with Iberia, that make sense.”Apart from BMI and Iberia, he said, “we don’t see much else of strategic value in Europe”.BA, which itself came close to taking over KLM in 2000 and later in the decade turned down a deal with Swiss, has been surprised at the success that has been made by Air France and Lufthansa in their respective pioneering takeovers of KLM and Swiss.He said on Thursday, “we look with admiration” at how both deals had generated substantial revenue synergies, a possibility BA had largely discounted, as it concentrated much more on the potential for cutting costs.At the end of last year, BA was also outbid by Air France for the takeover of VLM, the Belgian regional airline which has a leading position at London City airport.“We are mindful of the opportunities consolidation can offer,” he said. And his gaze is not only fixed on Europe.The consolidation game is also afoot in the US, where Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are close to announcing a plan to merge, if only their respective pilot groups can solve their thorny issues regarding seniority.“US consolidation would be a good step forward,” said Mr Walsh, “it would benefit the US and the global industries”.There had to be a strong US industry for there to be progress in the next stage of transatlantic liberalisation and a dismantling of US restrictions on the foreign ownership and control of US airlines.BA had a “good relationship” with its US partner American Airlines, but the development of any deeper deal was “inhibited” by the two groups’ lack of antitrust immunity from the US and European competition authorities.“There is evidence that the regulatory landscape is changing,” said Mr Walsh, but it was not yet clear that it had changed sufficiently to make a fresh application for a deal with American, he said. “We will continue to look and examine.”BA is also looking for possibilities to expand in Asia, in particular, and in India and China. “We are looking at whether there are opportunities,” said Mr Walsh. “I don’t see any today, but given the growth [in the region], we would be foolish not to look.”In the very short term, BA’s attention is fixed on the imminent move to the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow.Surging fuel costs and economic slowdown will bring BA’s earnings in the coming financial year to March 2009 down from the profits peak this year. But Mr Walsh expressed confidence that a restructured BA is in shape to achieve an operating margin of 8-12 per cent through the trading cycle.The dividend is about to be restored, an investment grade credit rating has been regained, and the balance sheet has been repaired. Mr Walsh believes BA has the strength again to be back in the consolidation game.
505;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-02-27T00:29:41Z;Delta acts to soothe workers’ merger fears;;Delta Air Lines would not sacrifice its employees’ job security and seniority benefits to complete a merger with Northwest Airlines or another rival, the US carrier’s top executives told employees on Tuesday via a memo.The comments came as Delta and Northwest await word on whether their pilots’ unions can agree on how to combine.The labour leaders’ failure to find common ground on how to rank their members’ seniority has threatened to scupper a deal that only a week ago appeared to be imminent.“To date, we have not arrived at a potential transaction that meets all our principles,” wrote Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, and Ed Bastian, president. “We will not complete a transaction unless all these conditions are met.”In the memo, the executives stated a list of conditions, from preserving seniority to keeping Delta’s name and its headquarters in Atlanta, that must be met before the company would agree to a deal.Within hours, Northwest’s chief executive, Doug Steenland, had issued a memo of his own, listing similiar, but less detailed, criteria. He didn’t note how a potential merger would affect employee seniority.“We continue to believe consolidation among network carriers is inevitable,” Mr Steenland wrote.Delta and Northwest have been in talks since last month, people familiar with the matter said. By last week, the two carriers had closed in on a transaction that would swap Northwest shares for those of Delta for little or no premium, those close to the talks said. They also agreed to base the combined company in Atlanta and negotiate a new labour contract with their most influential employees, the pilots.But the pilots remain deadlocked on seniority, which helps determine their pay, the planes they fly, and where they are based.The Delta chiefs assured employees that any deal would not affect the company’s pensions or its plans to expand internationally.“We have a strong stand-alone plan,” they wrote.Record fuel costs, restless shareholders and a weakening US economy have prodded the largest US airlines to consider deals.
506;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-02-25T02:10:33Z;Why pilots are forced to stay for a long haul;;Pilots at Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines may have seen the terms of their compensation and benefits change from one labour contract to the next but no figure matters more than the one next to their names on their union’s seniority list.Now, as the two airlines inch closer to a merger agreement, the pilots are grappling with how to best combine two lists into one. For some members, where they land on the list could change what they’re paid, what plane they fly – even where they live.“Seniority is really the keystone of a pilot’s career,” says Derek Martin, vice-chairman of the FedEx pilots’ union. “Every aspect of your career, from the time you’re hired to the time you retire, is driven by your seniority number. It stays with you.”Because Mr Martin was hired 12 years ago, near the start of a long recruiting wave at the delivery company, he has always reached the next phase of his career faster than many of his peers. Within two years he was first officer on a wide-bodied jet ferrying packages internationally.The captain says the key to his rapid advancement was his position on the FedEx pilot seniority list. Its importance is also a reason Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, in talks to merge since last month, may never combine.Now that the two US carriers have found common ground on a chief executive, a corporate headquarters and a new labour contract, the deal hinges on whether the two pilots groups can agree where members will rank following the merger.While the airlines can proceed without an agreement from pilots, its absence could undermine the companies’ pledge to present a unified front with employees as they seek regulatory approval.Delta and Northwest executives had hoped to present their boards with a definitive agreement last week, people familiar with the matter said. But as the weekend arrived the pilots were at an impasse, trading accusations of inflexibility.Not all pilots are convinced that the combination is in their best interests.Mike Stark, a Delta pilot who has sought to recall his union’s leadership in part for supporting potential mergers, argues that whatever his colleagues gain from the new contract could be offset by a lower position on the seniority list.“You’re getting a short-term pay-off, but it’s much better waiting,” he said.What is more, the further their name sits from the bottom of the seniority list, the more likely they will keep their job even as an airline take steps to slash expenses and eliminate routes.“It’s job security, pure and simple,” said Charles Craver, a labour law professor at George Washington University. “You lay off in reverse order of seniority.”
507;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Pilots give Delta deal a bumpy ride;;An impasse between pilots at Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines threatens to derail the companies’ bid to merge.The pilots had reached an agreement with Delta and Northwest on a new $2bn labour contract, a pivotal step toward the airlines’ push to secure the unions’ support for the merger.But late on Wednesday, the two groups had failed to find common ground on the crucial detail of how their members would be ranked on the combined company’s seniority list, which helps determine how much pilots are paid and what aircraft they fly.“Most of our economic and contractual obligations have been resolved,” said Matt Coons, a spokesman for the Northwest pilots.“While we’re enthusiastic, we also know a pilot’s career is tied entirely to seniority ranking. Short-term economic benefits are not worth sacrificing the possibility of advancement.”The boards of Delta and Northwest had planned to meet on Wednesday to vote on the merger if they were presented with an agreement, people familiar with the matter said. Without the pilots’ support, they may not proceed with the deal, the people said.Although Delta and Northwest executives could still press ahead without the pilots’ blessing, doing so could make it more difficult to win regulatory approvals and integrate quickly the two companies’ operations.More than two years after America West acquired US Airways, the two carriers’ pilots still operate as separate groups.The unions’ failure to agree on a seniority list has hurt the combined company’s morale and prevented management from negotiating a new labour agreement. Delta and Northwest declined to comment.Delta won approval from its board last month to pursue talks with Northwest or another rival, United Airlines. As Delta and Northwest drew closer to an agreement, United reignited discussions with Continental Airlines, people familiar with the matter said. Continental has also had talks with AMR, parent of American Airlines.If successful, a Delta-Northwest accord had been expected to spawn other airline deals, as carriers scramble to keep their competitive standing amid record fuel costs and an uncertain economic outlook.
508;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-02-19T20:43:53Z;Air France eyes joint venture with merged carrier;;Air France-KLM is aiming to use the planned merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines to build a long-term joint venture with the enlarged US carrier that would become the biggest player in the North Atlantic air travel market.The French carrier, the world’s leading airline by revenues since its takeover of KLM in 2004, is prepared to invest about $1bn to acquire a minority stake and to strengthen the finances of the merged US group.In return Delta and Northwest will agree to pay a substantial break-up fee if the transatlantic joint venture were to end, as an incentive to make a success of the alliance, which would be the most ambitious ever formed in the aviation industry.The joint venture, in which Air France-KLM and Delta-Northwest would share profits and revenues and jointly plan sales, networks and capacity, would have a turnover of $12bn and would account for 30 per cent of the North Atlantic market.The joint venture would account for 17 per cent of the turnover of the two airlines.An announcement of the planned Delta/Northwest merger, which would create the biggest US airline and could trigger further consolidation in the US, is expected as early as Thursday.The merger and the joint venture would still have to overcome serious regulatory hurdles, but the airlines are hopeful they could be approved by the end of the year before the Bush administration finishes.The French airline, which was the first in Europe to take over another national flag-carrier with the acquisition of KLM of the Netherlands, has responded positively to the approach by Delta and Northwest to invest in the merged entity, both as a way of securing the transatlantic joint venture and of deterring other merger moves by either of the two US airlines.Delta has previously held talks with United Airlines.A merger of Delta and Northwest would be the ideal outcome for Air France-KLM, which already has close ties with both US carriers.All four airlines – KLM operates as a separate division of the Air France-KLM group – are members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance, and respectively KLM and Northwest and Air France and Delta already have antitrust immunity for separate transatlantic joint ventures.An application by the four carriers for a four-way joint venture is already being considered by US competition authorities.KLM and Northwest were the first airlines to attempt to build a transatlantic joint venture a decade ago, and no other airlines have yet matched the depth of their alliance, which has total sales of $4bn. Air France and Delta agreed last October to form their own transatlantic joint venture.From 2010, it will include routes generating around $8bn a year.The first phase, with revenues of $1.5bn, will include flights operated by both carriers between London Heathrow and the US.The SkyTeam carriers are mounting a growing joint challenge to the dominance of British Airways in the London region, the world’s richest aviation market, as they seek to take advantage of the US/European Union “open skies” treaty, which comes into operation at the end of March.Air France, Delta and Northwest/KLM are starting their first ever long-haul services between Heathrow and the US in April with flights to Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta, New York, Minneapolis and Detroit.Air France/KLM has also succeeded through its recent takeover of VLM, the Belgian regional airline, in becoming the leading carrier at the small London City airport, where it has acquired 56 per cent of all the take-off and landing slots, eclipsing British Airways measured by the number of flights at the airport closest to London’s financial districts.
509;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Deals in the air: rising costs force US carriers to seek mergers;;"On a cold morning in January 2007, Gerald Grinstein, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, sat before a roomful of US senators in Washington to denounce US Airways’ hostile bid for his company. It was, he said, an “anti-competitive” transaction that would lead to higher ticket prices and fewer routes – and even “threaten the future stability of our nation’s transportation industry”.A year later, Mr Grinstein’s successor, Richard Anderson, asked his board of directors for their support to pursue a merger with two other rivals, Northwest Airlines or United Airlines. Either accord – and any other airline deal that follows – would promise to give the combined company impressive global reach, financial heft and, yes, opportunities to raise ticket prices and eliminate less profitable routes.What changed in these past 13 months was the emergence of a nemesis far more threatening to Delta and its peers than an overzealous rival from the Arizona desert: $100 oil. On the day Mr Grinstein testified before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee, the commodity traded at just $55 a barrel. Sweeping consolidation, conceded the chief executive of US Airways as he withdrew his bid, would probably have to wait until a steep downturn sent a few carriers wobbling back to bankruptcy court.Oil, which touched $100 last month, ended last week at about $95, while the Amex Airline index has plunged 36 per cent in the past year amid concerns that the carriers would lose money. “The world is not the same,” says Gordon Bethune, the former chief executive of Continental Airlines, who now advises a top investor in both Delta and United. “At $100 oil, the status quo doesn’t work.”For US airlines, which consume more than 19bn gallons of jet fuel a year, the rise threatens to end the revival of an industry beset earlier this decade by terrorist attacks and recession. If the US economic slowdown begins to sap demand for air travel this year, carriers will struggle to pass higher fuel expenses on to their customers through fare increases. In addition, the biggest US airlines will soon face greater competition on international flights from their counterparts overseas, as Open Skies accords free up routes.The confluence of those challenges has emboldened airline executives to go public with their support of industry-wide consolidation, softened labour leaders’ opposition toward mergers and recaptured the imagination of investors optimistic that this really could be the year the big US carriers pursue deals that – on paper at least – always looked so promising.Will it happen in 2008? The industry has come close before; US Airways’ bid for Delta was just one of numerous attempts to trigger a wave of deals. But with at least five of the six legacy US carriers in negotiations, many executives, employees, bankers and investors are convinced they will see at least one agreement this year. “Consolidation may indeed be at our door,” wrote Lee Moak, chairman of the Delta pilots’ union, in a letter to members.Delta opened talks with both United and Northwest last month. By late January, and with Delta’s negotiations with Northwest gaining momentum, United executives began to weigh reigniting discussions with Continental, another legacy carrier, people familiar with the matter said. Continental in turn has held preliminary talks with American Airlines.According to these people, Delta and Northwest may reach an agreement as early as this week and have scheduled board meetings on Wednesday; United and Continental, meanwhile, held discussions a year ago in response to US Airways’ hostile bid for Delta and the two carriers have kept in touch. Those talks gained steam this month, the people said, though Delta remains the likely catalyst.True to Mr Grinstein’s Senate testimony, the Atlanta-based Delta did emerge from bankruptcy protection as a stronger and more profitable airline. The carrier enjoys a higher market capitalisation than most of its peers and its hub in New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport would be a prize for any carrier with global ambitions.What is more, most of Delta’s peers may be either too big (American) or too small (US Airways and Northwest) to act first. American also faces an increasingly bitter stalemate with its pilots’ union over a new contract; in a recent statement, a labour leader said the group remained “adamantly opposed” to any merger.Then there is the “golden share” agreement that Continental signed a decade ago after its merger with Northwest fell through. The accord gives Northwest the right to block most deals Continental pursues. It also means Continental is likely to wait to see how Delta’s talks with Northwest progress before it strikes its own deal; if Northwest reaches a definitive agreement first, Continental can buy out the golden share for $100.The logic behind these potential deals is not all that different from others attempted by past generations of airline executives ever since President Jimmy Carter deregulated the industry in 1978. A merger or two would squeeze excess capacity from the market and help surviving carriers deploy their planes to more profitable routes. Large corporate clients might consolidate their travel accounts with one to two global carriers, giving survivors a bigger slice of the most lucrative passengers. “Fewer players would be helpful to the industry’s financial returns,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last month in a note to clients. “It’s hard to argue otherwise.”Those motives have not been lost on some of airline mergers’ most ardent critics, including Jim Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the US House Transportation Committee. “Hell, no,” Mr Oberstar said last month when asked of his views on airline consolidation. “They’re not in the public interest.”Excessive overlap in routes created by the merger of two carriers that service the same cities may also draw the ire of anti-trust regulators. Adding to the carriers’ sense of urgency is the looming US presidential election. With no candidate emerging as a clear favourite to take office next year, airline executives and their bankers are betting their deals might get a friendlier reception in the final months of President George W. Bush’s administration.Few airline deals have been completed during the Bush presidency (by comparison, more than a dozen deals went through under Ronald Reagan). The two legacy carriers sold – US Airways and TWA – were both in bankruptcy court and on the brink of liquidation.United’s May 2000 agreement to buy US Airways, then still in good standing with creditors, collapsed a year later amid an extensive antitrust review. Advocates of consolidation argue that their case is stronger today. Back then, few low-cost independent carriers had become sustainable rivals to the legacy airlines. Now more carriers, including JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways, have joined Southwest Airlines as proven competitors.A merger between two heavyweights might lighten the competition on some routes and give smaller rivals the chance to deepen their presence at key airports. “Whoever merges, there will be a reduction in capacity, and there’s going to be fewer seats flying around going on sale,” says Stan Gadek, AirTran’s chief financial officer.“You’ll take off some pricing pressure. And if you have Northwest get together with Delta, we’ll be the beneficiary. There will probably be some requirements to divest assets, imposed by the Justice Department.”AirTran, Atlanta’s second biggest carrier behind Delta, could add gates at the southeastern US hub, Mr Gadek says. Or as Gary Kelly, chief executive of Southwest, noted at a recent investor conference: “If they shrink, we’ll benefit.”Any combination of the six major US carriers would also impact business relationships with their counterparts throughout the world. Airlines have built valuable alliances with foreign peers; although the degree of co-operation between the members of each group varies greatly, many agreements can help carriers serve passengers whose final destinations are smaller cities far from a country’s international gateway. For example, a passenger in Paris could board a plane to New York or Chicago on a European carrier, then pick up a connecting flight from the airline’s US ally for the final leg of their journey to, say, Fort Wayne, Indiana.A deal between two US airlines in different global alliances could sever one carrier’s ties with their international allies. This is one reason why Air France-KLM has said it would help to assure the merger of its two closest US allies, Delta and Northwest – including making an investment in the combined company. A Delta merger with United, which is part of another alliance, could weaken Air France-KLM’s US partnerships.Lufthansa recently bought stock in JetBlue, a low-cost airline with a valuable hub in New York. A spate of deals in the US is not expected to spur many foreign mergers; the US market remains fragmented relative to those in many developed countries, where one or two airlines often dominate.Labour leaders representing pilots and other employees at carriers such as Delta and Northwest have said they are open to consolidation, so long as they have a seat at the table and a share of the benefits once the two companies have merged. “United pilots will not rubber-stamp any merger unless and until our interests are addressed,” Steve Wallach, chairman of the United pilots’ union, said last month.Employees who made concessions during recent bankruptcies – Delta, Northwest and United have all filed for protection from creditors this decade – may push for higher wages. Higher labour costs would put yet more pressure for the combined company to deliver on promises of higher revenue and profits, especially if fuel expenses do not ebb.“Combinations that eliminate domestic overlap should, therefore, improve shareholder returns the most,” Morgan Stanley’s William Greene and John Godyn wrote. “Unfortunately, the challenge with mergers that have substantial overlap is that the reduction in domestic capacity could make it difficult for labour unions and regulators to support the deal.”Any airline that pursues a deal will have to convince a number of constituencies, as well as its customers, that mergers will not cost thousands of jobs, weaken local economies and scale back service.“With the airline industry, typically it takes a long time for benefits to outweigh the costs,” says Nicole Crain, a professor of economics and business at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. “Consolidation is not a panacea.”For example, America West’s 2005 purchase of US Airways has been plagued by reservation-system problems, poor punctuality and a still-simmering conflict between the two companies’ pilots unions. But it did earn more money than most US airlines last year, and there is no question the company will embark on this latest downturn in much better shape than either carrier would have been on its own.“It’s not going to be easy,” Mr Parker said in an interview last month. “That doesn’t mean you don’t do it. Make sure your management team and employees are ready for 24 months of rough road ahead.”"

Late on Friday, those negotiations were still ongoing, the people said. Northwest may also call a board meeting for Wednesday, they said.The two airlines have agreed to exchange Northwest shares for those of Delta at little or no premium, the people said.Securing support of pilots and other workers would be a crucial victory for the carriers’ executives, who are mindful that any deal would face stiffer opposition in Washington without endorsements from key employee groups.The Air Line Pilots Association represents pilots at both Delta and Northwest. While each group has said it was open to consolidation, they are pushing for wage increases to unwind concessions they made to their airlines during their bankruptcies. They also want to resolve how their members will rank in the combined company’s seniority list, which helps determines how much pilots are paid and what aircraft they fly.While pilots cannot technically block two airlines from merging, they can help galvanise opposition. Delta was able to fend off a hostile bid from US Airways last year in part because of the pilots’ co-operation with management.Delta has a market value of about $7bn, including shares the company will issue to creditors as part of its agreement to exit bankruptcy. Northwest is worth about $5bn. Both carriers filed for protection from creditors in 2005 and emerged last year.Delta and Northwest also still need to determine whether Air France-KLM, their mutual European ally, will invest in the combined company, the people said.Neither company immediately returned calls seeking coment.

It increased both traffic and capacity by 4.2 per cent, filling 81.8 per cent of its available seats.Air France-KLM, which is the world’s largest airline by turnover, is seeking to expand through the growth of its existing network and through acquisitions.There is growing speculation that it is considering investing directly in the US airline industry for the first time by becoming a minority shareholder in the merged group that would result from a takeover by Delta Air Lines of Northwest Airlines.Merger talks between the two US carriers are at an advanced stage. Some details of a potential deal have already been shared with labour leaders, as the two carriers seek support from key workforce groups ahead of an eventual filing for regulatory approval.A deal between Delta and Northwest would have big implications for Air France-KLM, which already has strong ties with both airlines. All three carriers are leading members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance.Air France and Delta on the one hand and KLM and Northwest on the other have antitrust immunity for their respective transatlantic joint ventures.The four entities had also applied previously to the US authorities for antitrust immunity for a four-way transatlantic joint venture, before Delta launched its merger negotiations with Northwest.In Europe, Air France-KLM is in the midst of a due diligence investigation at Alitalia, although progress in the potential takeover of the perennially lossmaking, state-dominated Italian flag carrier, has been greatly complicated by the recent collapse of the Italian government.

513;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-02-07T21:16:06Z;US airline M&A;;The airline industry is not noted for its shrinking violets. Bob Crandall, the former chairman of American Airlines, was called “Fang” by some critics. Once asked when he realised he wanted to run AA, he is said to have replied: “When I was born.”It is a measure of the pressure on the sector that Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are believed to have agreed on who would run a combined company. No airline executive relishes the prospect of losing their job. Now, however, many of them have shareholder-friendly boards – appointed in the last round of bankruptcies – breathing down their necks. And expensive fuel and a looming recession mean the need for action is urgent.Two other potential obstacles to consolidation are labour and the Department of Justice. The former ought to be ameliorated by the complementary nature of the network tie-ups being discussed. As for the DoJ, passenger misery shows the fragmented industry is not delivering good service overall. In addition, forced slot disposals at some hubs might offer openings to new entrants.Northwest and Delta have had $3.3bn – or 55 per cent – added to their aggregate market capitalisation since merger speculation resumed on January 8. There is clearly leverage to even small gains in profitability. Minimal overlap, however, minimises cost-cutting potential. Merger gains should be real enough. But they are likely to be longer-dated, predicated as they are on tempting more passengers on to bigger networks and positioning against international competitors.After a dismal 2007, investors are nursing big losses. That leaves them at risk of falling prey to overoptimism on what the airlines can deliver in short order. As Mr Crandall put it: “This is a nasty, rotten business.”Post and read comments on this Lex
514;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta and Northwest close to merger;;Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are closing in on an agreement to merge the two US carriers, people familiar with the discussions said.The airlines may clinch the landmark accord as early as the middle of this month, the people said, though they cautioned that negotiations could still stall or even collapse.Delta and Northwest have made some progress in selecting the combined company’s top managers. Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, would keep that title following the proposed merger, while Doug Steenland, Northwest chief executive, would remain part of a senior team that would include executives from both airlines, the people said.A deal between Delta and Northwest, two of the world’s largest carriers, would help squeeze excess capacity from an industry beset by record fuel costs and intense competition for passengers.It could also spark a wave of consolidation throughout the industry, as rivals scramble to strike deals that help them eliminate unprofitable routes and weather a looming economic downturn.The two airlines and their advisers still need to find common ground on the deal’s terms, including the ratio at which Northwest investors will exchange their shares for those in the new company.There are also no assurances that any of the concessions either side have made will be part of a final agreement, should there be one, one person said.Mindful of the scrutiny any airline merger will receive from regulators, politicians, organised labour and consumer advocates, both carriers are striving to structure a deal that would minimise job losses while still delivering the cost savings its shareholders crave.It is a delicate balance and any agreement would merely mark the start of a lengthy process of winning the necessary approvals and then integrating complex operations into one company.Northwest declined to comment on Wednesday. A Delta spokeswoman said: “Delta’s board is working with management to analyse strategic options, including potential consolidation transactions, to ensure Delta maintains its leadership position.”Delta executives received approval from their board last month to pursue a merger with either Northwest or United Airlines, another legacy carrier. As January ended, and Delta’s talks with Northwest gained momentum, United in turn weighed reigniting negotiations with yet another airline, Continental.
515;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-02-03T19:21:22Z;Pardus value cut as airlines bets sour;;Pardus Capital, the activist New York hedge fund, lost almost a quarter of its value – about $800m – in the past two months as bets on US airlines and a number of European companies soured.According to investors, Pardus, run by Karim Samii, lost 14 per cent in November and another 14.5 per cent in December, its two worst months yet, to leave it down 23.8 per cent last year. This compares with gains of 6.9 per cent for the average event-driven fund, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research.However, the losses are unlikely to force the fund, which now has $2bn under management, to back down from fights with management on both sides of the Atlantic, at least in the short term. Unlike some rivals, Pardus has no gearing, so it will not be forced to sell assets to meet bank margin calls, while terms introduced last summer prevent investors withdrawing money for one or two years.Pardus became a feature of the activist scene after scoring net gains of 20 per cent in 2005, its first year, and 35 per cent in 2006.Current targets include United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, where Mr Samii is encouraging airline industry consolidation, car parts maker Visteon in the US, which he wants France’s Valeo to buy, and French software group Atos Origin, where he is working with London hedge fund Centaurus Capital to push for a sale.Rumours in the hedge fund industry suggested Pardus would be forced to liquidate its positions – some of which are close to 20 per cent of the target’s shares – have led some rivals to bet against it, pushing share prices down further.However, people close to the fund pointed out that the investor lock-up and lack of gearing meant it had no need to sell positions to raise cash.Pardus has a highly concentrated portfolio with the bulk of its money in a handful of investments, which makes it naturally volatile.Investors said Pardus had lost more money in January although it is understood to have bounced back from its low point.It remains in most of its positions, and is still pushing for change in the hope of scoring big gains if its activism is successful.
516;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-29T20:24:21Z;Fuel costs take shine off airlines recovery;;Northwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and AirTran Holdings added their names to the roll call of US carriers that limped into 2008 with a quarterly loss amid record fuel costs.The shortfalls dampened what for most carriers had been a year marked by more passengers, higher fares and growing cash reserves. But by late 2007, surging oil prices had threatened to end the industry’s modest recovery and return to profitability. Carriers such as American Airlines and United Airlines have also reported quarterly losses.Northwest, one of the six US legacy carriers, recorded a net loss of $8m, or 3 cents a share in the fourth quarter. The airline, which emerged from bankruptcy protection last year, said revenue rose 3.9 per cent to $3.1bn. Northwest, which has held talks this month to merge with rival Delta Air Lines, flew fuller planes and charged more per ticket than the same period a year earlier. On a conference call with analysts, Northwest executives declined to discuss their negotiations.JetBlue, the low-cost carrier with a large hub at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, reported a $4m net loss, or 2 cents a share. Operating revenue jumped 17 per cent to $739m. JetBlue, which sold a 19 per cent stake in itself to Germany’s Lufthansa, unveiled revenue and cost forecasts that gave some analysts’ confidence the carrier would exceed earnings estimates for 2008.“While we expect our revenue momentum from the December holidays to continue into the first quarter, we continue to operate in an environment of high fuel prices and economic uncertainty,” Dave Barger, the JetBlue chief executive, said during a conference call.AirTran reported a net loss of $2.2m, or 2 cents. Revenue jumped 27 per cent to $583.8m.
517;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-20T21:48:30Z;US airlines consolidation may not be quick fix;;Consolidation in the US airlines industry may eventually achieve everything its proponents say, from slashing expenses to helping domestic carriers compete with their global rivals, but it could take several years of operational glitches and tough negotiations with organised labour before any merger can be called a success.Airlines executives, who have touted the merits of takeovers as their best hope for enduring record fuel costs and a slowing US economy, look to the most recent deal – America West’s 2005 merger with US Airways.But the combination, which stitched together what industry insiders considered a second-tier airline with a legacy carrier under bankruptcy protection and near the brink of liquidation, has been plagued by reservation-system problems, poor on-time arrival performance and a still-simmering conflict between the two companies’ pilots unions.US Airways and America West provide a classic example of what can go wrong, said Bill Swelbar, a research engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation.Delta Air Lines is now in separate merger talks with both Northwest Airlines and United Airlines, and Continental Airlines executives said last week they would move aggressively should the industry consolidate around them. United in turn is weighing whether to reignite negotiations with Continental if its discussions with Delta fail to end in an agreement, people familiar with the carrier’s plans said.Even if the carriers strike a deal or two and win the approval from antitrust regulators and labour leaders to proceed, they will face the daunting task of combining two complex companies. However, Doug Parker, US Airway’s current chief executive and the architect of the merger, remains unapologetic. “I’d do it again in a second,” he said in a recent interview.“Anyone who goes through a merger is going to have those same difficulties. There are a myriad of systems, and putting those together is very, very hard. It’s the right thing to do.”Despite trailing its five fellow network carriers in market capitalisation, US Airways is poised to report a 2007 profit of about $418m, according to analysts. That is more than United is expected to earn and within $10m of Delta’s estimated total, analysts predict.The combined company has rebounded from a brutal stretch in the first six months of 2007, when it finished last among the top domestic carriers in on-time performance, according to a US Department of Transportation study. By November, US Airways’ ranking had climbed to ninth.But, unable to agree on how to rank the combined workforce by seniority, which helps determine pilots’ pay and choice of aircraft they fly, America West and the old US Airways haven’t merged their unions. Though the combined company has continued to operate with two separate pilots’ groups, their dispute undermines employee morale and makes it difficult for management to negotiate new contracts.Mr Parker said he remains optimistic the America West and US Airways pilots will merge their members into one union. Besides, say the advocates of consolidation, what has made this dispute unusually trying has been the differences in average tenures of the US Airways pilots and the smaller America West.Delta, United, Continental and Northwest pilots may not confront the same challenges.Nevertheless, airlines CEOs may need to wait a few years before their companies are integrated completely, Mr Parker said.

Delta opened negotiations with both United and Northwest earlier this month, the people said.“Our position has always been that we control our decisions; no one makes them for us,” Mr Tilton said on Friday in a message to employees. “The advantage of our situation is that we have choices that we continue to consider with our board.”United and Continental discussed a possible merger a year ago after US Airways made a hostile bid for Delta, which was then under bankruptcy protection, the people said.Those talks cooled after Delta rejected US Airways’ advances, but the two sides remained in touch, they said.United and Continental declined to comment.Record fuel prices, vocal shareholders and the slowing US economy have pressured airlines to pursue deals that help reduce costs, eliminate unprofitable routes and extend their global reach.Delta may have an easier time winning the approvals of anti-trust regulators and labour leaders in a deal with Northwest, the smaller of the two potential partners.Richard Anderson, Delta’s chief executive, once ran Northwest.Nevertheless United and Continental will probably need to wait for their peers to reach a deal before they sign their own accord; Northwest has the right to block a Continental merger under most conditions. Continental in turn can buy out that so-called golden share for $100 once Northwest reaches an definitive agreement of its own."
519;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-16T20:03:38Z;Fuel costs could ‘wipe out’ US airline profits;;"Mounting fuel costs could wipe out the US airlines industry’s profits this year, forcing consolidation in the sector as carriers seek to cut costs, according to Doug Parker, the chief executive of US Airways.“Speaking for US Airways, fuel prices are going to be $800m or so higher than what they were in 2007,” Mr Parker told the Financial Times. “Everyone has that same equation. What we’re spending on oil this year, if all else stays equal, is more than enough to push them from a profit to a pretty big loss.”Most US airlines are poised to report their second straight year of annual profits, buoyed by healthy demand for air travel, and economists and analysts alike had predicted the industry would stave off losses for at least another year.A weak US economy may prevent carriers from pushing through fare increases, which have helped the airlines weather oil’s climb last year, Mr Parker said. Running out of ideas for ways to cut costs or operating their fleets as fuel-efficiently as possible, the airlines may at last be ready to pursue consolidation to eliminate less-profitable routes and expand their footprints, he said.“You have a lot of people sitting around in boardrooms and looking at prospects for 2008 that don’t look very good,” Mr Parker said.Mr Parker was the architect of the last deal involving a US legacy carrier when, in 2005, as chief executive of America West he led the deal to acquire US Airways, then in bankruptcy. He tried to buy another bankrupt rival, Delta Air Lines, last year before that company rejected Mr Parker’s unsolicited bid.While undeterred, Mr Parker said he was a realist on US Airways’s role in consolidation now that all of his peers have emerged from credit protection. The carrier, along with Northwest Airlines, is probably too small to be a catalyst for consolidation. Some competitors, such as Continental Airlines, appear to prefer the status quo; United Airlines, though vocal about the merits of mergers, have failed to reach a deal, he said.“That leaves one, Delta,” said Mr Parker, noting his rival now trades at about $4bn, as much as $8bn less than what Delta said it would be worth when it rejected his bid. “There’s pressure on them from shareholders to do something.”Delta’s board on Friday freed the airline’s executives to pursue merger talks with either Northwest or United, people familiar with their plans said. A Delta spokeswoman reiterated that its board was reviewing the company’s strategic options, including a potential merger, and declined to comment further.“With these fuel prices at the levels we haven’t seen before, it’s important we be certain Delta is always in a safe harbour,” Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, told staff this week."
520;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Northwest urges staff to be open to mergers;;Northwest Airlines’s chief executive warned employees that staying on the sidelines as their rivals consolidate could hurt the US carrier’s future, a signal that he may be ready to discuss a merger with Delta Air Lines.Doug Steenland sent a memo to his workforce within hours of Delta’s board meeting on Friday to weigh whether to engage Northwest or United Airlines in talks, people familiar with the matter said.His memo noted that, while Northwest’s recent emergence from bankruptcy protection left the company in better financial footing than many of its peers, escalating fuel costs have made it harder to remain profitable.“Doing nothing could be our worst alternative,” Mr Steenland wrote. “If we wait to react to what others do, we could be left with options that are undesirable or with no options at all.”Delta’s financial strength, international routes and recent labour peace have put the Atlanta-based carrier atop most legacy carriers’ list of potential merger partners. The company, which fended off a hostile bid from US Airways while still under bankruptcy protection, formed a special committee of board members and hired advisers late last year to review its merger options amid pressure from investors.Northwest executives joined many of their counterparts late last year in declaring their willingness to consider mergers.In Friday’s memo, Mr Steenland said the company’s managers and directors would analyse any potential transaction “very carefully”, and that its employees would be “included in the process.”Delta executives have not revealed which deal – Northwest or United – is their first choice and the special committee’s review is ongoing.Delta and Northwest declined to comment.Leaders of the Delta pilots’ union met last week to discuss its approach to potential deals, hire an M&A lawyer and organise merger and strike-preparedness committees. “Any attempt at consolidation will fail without the active involvement and support of the pilots from the earliest formative stages of the effort,” Lee Moak, chairman of the pilots’ group, wrote in a letter to members last week.For Delta pilots, who have watched their peers at US Airways and America West struggle to integrate their unions more than two years after the two carriers merged, their support on a proposed agreement may hinge on whether executives can guarantee members will not surrender seniority to their new colleagues.That might be easier to do in a deal with Northwest, because the carrier is smaller than United, analysts, bankers and labour officials have said.
521;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-10T22:25:28Z;Delta directors to discuss merger;;The board of Delta Air Lines will discuss on Friday whether to authorise the US carrier’s executives to pursue a merger with United Airlines or Northwest Airlines.The Atlanta-based company’s board formed a special committee and hired advisers late last year to consider Delta’s options amid pressure from shareholders for a link-up with a main rival. A decision has not been made on which potential deal would present the best fit for Delta, and the committee’s review is ongoing, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Airline executives and investors alike have long argued that a wave of mergers would help the industry cut expenses and help weather an inevitable downturn.Record fuel costs and the threat of a US recession have added a sense of urgency to the case for consolidation, but any proposed combination would draw scrutiny from government officials and labour leaders.Delta emerged from bankruptcy protection last year with lower costs and unencumbered by agreements that would limit merger options, leading to the view that the carrier could become the catalyst for several deals in the airline industry. When US Airways launched a hostile bid for Delta, then still in bankruptcy, Continental Airlines and United quickly began discussions of their own.Delta rejected the US Airways bid, but left open the possibility of pursuing a merger once it regained its financial footing. In October, chief executive Richard Anderson told investors his company would participate in industry consolidation as a buyer. Today its market value of more than $3.8bn exceeds that of all but one carrier, Southwest Airlines.“We’ve said we have a committee looking at this,” Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton said on Thursday night.Labour leaders representing Delta’s pilots, suspecting the company was close to picking a potential merger partner, met this week to discuss how they would prepare for those negotiations.“Consolidation may indeed be at our door,” Lee Moak, chairman of the Delta pilots’ union, told his members.Delta recently put on hold plans to sell its Comair regional jet service division. The airline has had preliminary discussions with JPMorgan Chase on its options for the unit, but will not retain the firm until the board’s special committee and their bankers – Merrill Lynch and Greenhill – have completed the merger review.Delta and United officials denied they had held talks in November, when a hedge fund went public with calls for the carriers to merge.“Our position on the need for consolidation generally in the industry is well known, and we don’t comment on rumours or speculation,” United spokesman Jean Medina said.

However, large-cap technology companies continued to lag amid concerns over growth prospects in the sector.The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent in early trade, but recovered to close up 0.8 per cent at 1,420.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9 per cent to 12,853.09 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,488.52.Mr Bernanke said the Fed might take “substantive” action on rates, leading traders to believe the Fed could ease by 50 basis points at the end of this month.“What this did is it indicate the Fed is not going to get caught behind the curve,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.Many traders have already priced in further rate cuts amid the threat of a looming recession. After the Fed chairman’s comments the futures market factored in a 90 per cent chance of a 50bp cut at the end of this month, with at least two further 25bp cuts seen likely.The financial sector rallied further before the close on reports that Countrywide Financial, the struggling mortgage lender, was in advance talks with Bank of America about a possible merger. Countrywide’s shares soared 51.4 per cent to $7.75.The S&P financial sector climbed as much as 6 per cent off its session-low. Big movers included rival mortgage lenders IndyMac Bancorp and Washington Mutual which climbed 23 per cent to $5.78 and 14.8 per cent to $14.16 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the troubled online brokerage, jumped 22.1 per cent to $2.93. Homebuilders also rebounded with the S&P homebuilder index closing 6.2 per cent higher at 305.05.Blackstone made gains after the private equity group agreed to acquire GSO Capital Partners for up to $930m. Blackstone also announced a $500m stock buy-back programme and the shares rose 9.6 per cent to $19.84.Earlier a profit warning at Capital One Financial had unsettled traders. The credit card company cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent because of rising loan delinquencies. The shares closed down 1 per cent at $42.92.After the closing bell American Express reported similar problems. The card issuer said it would take a $440m charge for the fourth quarter as more customers have missed payments. It also gave a cautious outlook for 2008. The shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $48.92, but slid 5 per cent after hours.US airline shares rose sharply on reports that Delta Air Lines is on the verge of merger talks with both Northwest Airlines and UAL, parent of United Airlines. Delta declined to comment.UAL, gained 23.7 per cent to $32.19, Northwest Airlines gained 32 per cent to $15.85 and Delta rose 18.2 per cent to $15.98.Other transport stocks gained as oil prices fell sharply but falling crude prices hurt a broad range of companies in the energy sector. Hess, the oil producer and refiner fell 2.2 per cent to $92.68.Retailers lagged the market after US stores reported an anaemic set of December sales figures, prompting some companies to lower their earnings guidance.Although Wal-Mart, up 3.2 per cent at $48.40, reported solid results and other low-cost chains fared well, niche retailers disappointed as middle-market consumers cut back on discretionary spending.However, analysts were split on the severity of the problems. Banc of America said the numbers did not “look as bad as feared”.Retailers posting significant December same-store sales declines included AnnTaylor Stores, the women’s clothing retailer, and Gap. The shares fell 15.5 per cent to $19.95 and 7.1 per cent to $17.97 respectively.
523;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-10T16:12:14Z;Delta delays Comair sale;;Delta Air Lines has put on hold plans to sell its Comair regional jet service division while it explores a possible merger with United Airlines or another rival, the latest sign that 2008 could be the year US carriers press for consolidation.Delta executives said in October they would reach a decision on whether to sell or spin-off Comair within the next several months. The Atlanta-based airline has had preliminary discussions with JPMorgan Chase on its options for the unit. It will not retain the firm until a special committee of Delta directors and their bankers – Merrill Lynch and Greenhill – has completed the merger review, people familiar with the company’s plans said.In postponing a decision on Comair, Delta may be following through with its stated plans to participate in the industry’s expected consolidation. A tie-up with United or Northwest Airlines could be the spark that touches off a wave of deals among the nation’s six legacy carriers – those that existed prior to deregulation in 1978 – as each seeks to expand its global reach, slash expenses and eliminate less profitable routes.Delta and United officials denied they had held talks in November, when a hedge-fund went public with calls for the two carriers to merge. Record fuel costs and the threat of a US recession have made the case for merging airlines more compelling, but any proposed combination would draw scrutiny from government officials and labour leaders.The setbacks US Airways and America West have faced in integrating their operations and workforces following their 2005 combination have only underscored the challenges such combinations pose. Nevertheless, industry leaders, bankers and investors view Delta’s decision to launch a review as the potential catalyst for big airline deals.Delta emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year with lower expenses and boasting a market value beaten only by two other US carriers, Southwest and United. In theory, it is now in a position to combine with any of the other five legacy carriers, although Northwest has the right to block a deal involving Continental, in which it holds a golden share.Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson said in October that he saw the benefits of consolidation and would be a willing participant, appearing to signal a break from his predecessor’s position. A year ago, while under bankruptcy protection, Delta rejected a hostile bid from US Airways.In November, amid pressure from investors such as Pardus Capital Management, the company revealed its board had formed a special committee and hired advisers to explore potential deals. Later that month, American Airlines unveiled plans to divest its own regional carrier, American Eagle. Investors have argued that carving out the commuter aircraft would help the mainline carrier reduce costs while freeing the subsidiary to win contracts from other large airlines.Delta is still expected eventually to reach a similar conclusion for its Comair business, which ferries passengers between smaller US cities and larger hubs.Delta said: “The sale of Comair is not imminent, but our position hasn’t changed in that we are always looking to maximise the value of our assets.”
524;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
525;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-09T13:03:27Z;BA risks pilots’ ire with new service;;"British Airways is naming its new subsidiary airline to fly between the US and continental Europe “OpenSkies”.It is seeking much more flexible employment conditions than exist in BA’s current operations flying to and from the UK, which is threatening serious labour unrest, in particular among its existing workforce of 3,000 pilots.BA said on Wednesday the OpenSkies operation would be launched in June with daily flights from New York to Brussels and Paris.Congestion in New York airspace, and US government moves to limit the number of flights to New York’s JFK airport, mean that BA has yet to decide whether the new service will operate to JFK or New York Newark airports.It would start with one Boeing 757 aircraft operating from New York to either Brussels or Paris Charles de Gaulle airports. A second aircraft would be added later this year to fly to the other EU destination.BA said it was planning to operate six 757s in the OpenSkies fleet by the end of 2009, all of which would be sourced from the current BA fleet. It will apply shortly for the necessary regulatory approval in the US and the UK.Dale Moss, a former BA sales director who has led the development of the venture, has been appointed managing director of OpenSkies.The new venture is a controversial development for existing BA staff, in particular among pilots and cabin crew, as BA pushes to establish a lower cost base and more flexible terms and conditions for flight and cabin crew than exist in the current BA mainline operation flying to and from the UK.BA said it was planning to recruit cabin crew for the airline in the US.It has already started to recruit pilots for OpenSkies outside the BA group and is insisting that there will be no links between the new airline and the seniority list for existing BA mainline pilots, setting it on course for a confrontation with Balpa, the powerful pilots’ union.A further round of talks on conditions for pilot recruitment to OpenSkies is due to take place between the airline and Balpa next Monday.Balpa’s BA company council has warned members that it was “incidental” whether the base for the new BA airline was in Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam: “It is work which pilots on the BA Mainline Seniority List should be able to fly.”The venture is being started as a separate subsidiary within the BA group with its own air operator certificate. It will be regulated in the UK.BA has registered a separate company, currently named BA European, to operate the venture, with a board that includes Roger Maynard, BA director of investments and alliances; Keith Williams, BA chief financial officer; and Robert Boyle, BA commercial director, as well as Mr Moss, a US citizen.The move to launch the new services is designed to take advantage of the US-EU “open skies” deal to liberalise transatlantic air services, which comes into operation at the end of March.It will be the first time that BA has tried to fly long-haul out of Europe other than from its stronghold UK bases at London Heathrow and Gatwick and to a small extent from Manchester.It will take the British carrier into head-to-head competition – in particular for business travellers – with European carriers such as Air France-KLM or US carriers such as Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and American Airlines, which are already operating on its planned routes.Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said on Wednesday that OpenSkies would “build on the strength of British Airways’ brand in the US and Europe.”The aircraft livery and crew uniforms would be similar to the BA mainline operation and its flights would carry both an OpenSkies and a BA code.“By naming the airline OpenSkies, we’re celebrating the first major step in 60 years towards a liberalised US/EU aviation market which means we can fly between any US and EU destination. It also signals our determination to lobby for further liberalisation in this market, when talks between the EU and US take place later this year.”Virgin Atlantic, BA’s UK long-haul rival controlled by Sir Richard Branson, had considered a similar move to BA, but shelved its project last autumn."
526;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-08T22:18:29Z;BA to press ahead with Europe-US flights;;British Airways will announce on Wednesday that it is pressing ahead with its ambitious plan to launch services between the US and leading business and financial centres in continental Europe.The venture will start during the coming summer season with early services to include the routes between New York and Paris and Brussels.It is designed to take advantage of the US/European Union “open skies” deal to liberalise transatlantic air services, which comes into operation at the end of March.Congestion in New York airspace and US government moves to limit the number of flights to New York’s JFK airport, mean that BA has yet to decide whether the new service will operate to JFK or New York Newark.The initiative, code-named Project Lauren, will start modestly with one or two Boeing 757 narrow body aircraft taken from BA’s existing fleet but configured with business class and premium economy seating.It will be the first time that BA has tried to fly long-haul out of Europe other than from its stronghold UK bases at London Heathrow and Gatwick and to a small extent from Manchester.It will take the British carrier head-to-head, in particular for business travellers, with European carriers such as Air France-KLM or US carriers such as Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and American Airlines, which are already operating on its planned routes.BA is moving ahead despite a looming dispute over the project with its existing 3,000 pilots.The venture is being started as a separate subsidiary within the BA group with its own air operator certificate, so that it can be established with a lower cost base and more flexible terms and conditions of employment for flight and cabin crew than the current BA mainline operation.BA has begun recruiting pilots for the venture from outside the group.It has refused to accept the demand from its existing pilots, who are organised by Balpa, the British Air Line Pilots Association, that pilots for the new venture should be linked to the seniority list of its existing pilots flying to and from the UK.BA has registered a separate subsidiary, currently named BA European, to operate the venture, with a board that includes Roger Maynard, BA director of investments and alliances, Keith Williams, BA chief financial officer, and Robert Boyle, BA commercial director.The board also includes Dale Moss, a US citizen and former BA sales director, now based in the US, who has led the project development.Balpa’s BA company council has warned members that it was “incidental” whether the base for the new BA airline was in Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam, “it is work which pilots on the BA Mainline Seniority List should be able to fly”.It told pilots the operation proposed by BA “could be a ‘Trojan Horse’ for the future and it is imperative Balpa is a part of the new venture from the beginning. It will be too late in five or so years’ time when ‘Lauren’ has grown to possibly 15 or 20 aircraft, carrying passengers that used to be Mainline BA, to try and ensure BA pilots are able to fly those planes.”BA is due for a further meeting with its pilots next week.Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said late last year that the new services would be “a natural extension” of BA’s “long-established expertise in providing for the transatlantic business market.” He said BA was seeking to take advantage of its “deep roots” in the US with “an established reputation and a strong brand”.Virgin Atlantic, its UK long-haul rival controlled by Sir Richard Branson, has considered a similar move to BA, but shelved its project last autumn.
527;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-06T22:06:01Z;Rising oil prices fuel US airlines’ fears;;"In a March 2004 speech, James May, president of the Air Transport Association, delivered a grim prognosis for the health of the US airline industry, which was grappling with mounting fuel costs.“When cash is available and the gamble makes sense, we hedge,” said Mr May, whose trade group represents most US carriers. “But today’s prices are killing the industry.”At that time, oil traded at $37 a barrel.Almost four years later, most of the nation’s airlines still have a strong pulse. But for an industry now facing oil at $100 a barrel, Mr May’s comments might as well have come from an era before wide-bodied jets and in-flight movies.Fuller flights, fuel-efficient aeroplanes, recent bankruptcies, fare increases and more restrained expansion plans have all helped the industry to shake off record fuel prices and return to profitability.But with the US economy’s slowdown sure to sap demand for both corporate and leisure travel this year, the airline industry faces renewed questions on its ability to weather yet higher energy costs without taking more drastic measures.United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines moved to lift ticket prices by as much as $20 last week to help offset the latest increase in the jet fuel price, which is now above $2.80 a gallon.Every additional cent on fuel adds another $190-$200m to US carriers’ fuel bill, according to the ATA. The expected rise in empty seats will make it harder for fare increases to stick, forcing carriers to make steeper cuts to their expansion plans for 2008.“Longer-standing incumbents have principally reacted by cutting back schedules,” says John Heimlich, the ATA’s chief economist. “You’ll see (seat) reductions. Sometimes it’s existing routes, sometimes it’s new markets.”Industrywide domestic capacity should drop by 0.5 per cent this year, compared with a 2 per cent increase in 2007, Mr Heimlich says.For years, airlines sought to cushion fuel surges by hedging against the commodity. The trading strategy Southwest Airlines adopted in early 2001 paid off within months, when the 9/11 terrorist attacks otherwise crippled the industry and helped send some of the carrier’s bigger competitors into bankruptcy court.Times have changed, and oil’s unrelenting climb to $100 has caused even seasoned airline executives to doubt their ability to predict the commodity’s direction. Hedging now, while oil trades at record levels, would be a bold call.“The question is: ‘is this the new norm?’ ” David Neeleman, JetBlue Airways chairman said last month. “If oil goes up to $120 and no one is hedged then you don’t look like a fool. But if you do it at $100 and it goes to $80 or $70, then you really look like a fool.”You can also lose money, as both Continental Airlines and United did in late 2006 when the carriers’ contracts had locked in some of their fuel needs at prices above where the commodity had traded. And the higher prices climb, the more expensive hedging becomes.Of the big carriers, all except Southwest have more than half of their first quarter fuel needs exposed to market prices, according to research compiled by Lehman Brothers, Calyon Securities and the ATA.It’s little wonder, then, that airline chief executives have become more vocal in preaching the merits of consolidation; a large merger or two would free the industry to scale back capacity more dramatically. And those chieftains can make a more convincing case to regulators and organised labour if their profits have already been crimped by record fuel costs.“All else being equal, they’ll be more pressure to consolidate at higher prices,” Mr Heimlich said. “All of a sudden, you find it easier to do when one is in bankruptcy or in a weakened financial condition.”"
528;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2008-01-02T20:45:17Z;Delta holds key to shape of US fleets;;This year could see consolidation in the US airlines industry, with the fate of Delta Air Lines likely to prove pivotal, executives, bankers and investors say.Delta recently emerged from bankruptcy protection unencumbered by financial agreements that restrict some potential deals, and is not as big as, say, American Airlines parent AMR.As a result, it features prominently in most consolidation scenarios concocted by industry insiders and shareholders alike.The Atlanta-based carrier is working with its bankers at Merrill Lynch and Greenhill to review potential mergers. Delta’s executives believe a merger would help the combined company save money and weather future downturns. But they are not convinced a deal is worth pursuing at all costs, given the challenges it would pose, from winning the approval of regulators and organised labour to combining complex operations, people familiar with their thinking said.It may be months before the company decides whe­ther to proceed, they added.“There has been talk from one corner or another,” said John Prater, president of the Air Line Pilots’ Association, whose 60,000 members include pilots at Delta, United and Northwest.“Is there going to be consolidation? I think we’re going to see some attempts.”Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, fuelled merger speculation in October, when he said the company recognised the benefits of consolidation and planned to participate. His comments appeared to contradict Delta’s stance earlier in the year, when it fought off a hostile bid from rival US Airways.“Delta has said previously that its board has formed a special committee to work with management to review and analyse strategic options to ensure Delta maintains its leadership position in the industry, including potential consolidation transactions,” the airline said in a statement.“During this period we will not comment on any rumours or speculation regarding mergers or acquisitions.”Some of Delta’s peers may have a harder time persuading antitrust regulators to approve any merger. Others would be challenged by existing relationships and financial arrangements. For instance, Northwest has the right to block a deal involving rival Continental Airlines.Delta’s greater flexibility is not lost on the investors who built positions in the company last year.Pardus Capital Management, a hedge fund with more than 2 per cent of Delta and a 4.8 per cent stake in United parent UAL has said a Delta-United merger represents the best possible combination of large US airlines.Airlines are bracing for a difficult year. The International Air Transport Association predicted that industrywide profit will slump this year amid record fuel costs and an expected slump in demand for air travel.
529;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-12-14T18:52:35Z;Lufthansa sure deal won’t take shine off Star;;Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa chief executive, dismissed fears on Friday that the German airline’s plan to purchase a 19 per cent stake in JetBlue Airways, the US low-cost carrier, could disrupt relations with its existing North American partners in the Star alliance – United Airlines, US Airways and Air Canada.The surprise move, announced late on Thursday, was described by many analysts as “opportunistic” by Lufthansa to take advantage of the historic low in JetBlue’s share price as well as the weakness of the US dollar against the euro.The injection of about $305m in fresh equity into JetBlue comes as the US carrier is looking at various options to bolster its finances ahead of a looming downturn in the US market, and as it presses on with an ambitious expansion of its fleet. Its profitability has recovered in 2007 but it suffered net losses in the two previous years.Lufthansa said that only about 2 per cent of the JetBlue network overlapped with its Star partner airlines.It accepted that the financial timing was highly advantageous for the deal, but said that it was also a strategic move aimed at overcoming its long-standing weakness in the New York and US east coast markets.Stephan Gemkow, Lufthansa chief financial officer, said the group was anxious to generate more feeder traffic for its transatlantic services from both New York and Boston. At present only about five per cent of its traffic in these markets was represented by transfer passengers compared to 50-55 per cent at its much bigger US rivals Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines.Continental is the dominant carrier at New York Newark airport, while Delta is the other large operator at New York’s JFK airport alongside JetBlue. Both US carriers are key members of the rival SkyTeam alliance, while Star has a relatively small presence in the New York area.Mr Mayrhuber said that JFK was “a second Heathrow” in terms of its strategic importance at the centre of one of the world’s richest aviation markets. At Heathrow Lufthansa has already secured a bridgehead through its 30 per cent stake in BMI British Midland, the second largest operator at the airport.No details of the future collaboration between Lufthansa and JetBlue were disclosed on Friday, but the US carrier was already working on some elements of a similar deal to feed traffic with Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier.The surprise Lufthansa deal could change the competitive landscape for Aer Lingus. The Irish airline said Friday it was awaiting “further developments and clarification” but said it was “optimistic that the partnership remains on track.”JPMorgan, the US investment bank, said the Lufthansa/JetBlue deal was “about money - JetBlue needs it, Lufthansa has it. We see no other reason for this transaction from JetBlue’s standpoint.” It said there was “little strategic logic” for Lufthansa to take a non-controlling stake. (Foreign entities are limited to owning no more than 25 per cent of the voting shares in a US carrier.)Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, said the deal was “quite a departure for Lufthansa, considering recent management commentary suggested they were looking more in Europe and Asia for investment opportunities …We’re not clear that opportunities to co-operate are meaningful.”The bank warned too that JetBlue appeared to be facing “lots of issues managing costs and operations in the near term, with substantial management turnover and significant new domestic low-cost competition from Virgin America and Skybus.It said Lufthansa could have pursued an agreement similar to Aer Lingus with JetBlue, if it just wanted co-operation at JFK on traffic feed.
530;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-12-07T20:38:16Z;Maxjet share trading halted;;Trading in the shares of Maxjet Airways, one of the new breed of all-business class long-haul airlines, was suspended on Friday in London, as the US group struggled to put together a financial rescue package.The airline, which started flying transatlantic services in November 2005 between London Stansted and New York JFK airports, raised net proceeds of £47.3m in an initial public offering in June, becoming the second all-business airline after UK rival Silverjet to list on London’s alternative investment market.It has faced mounting losses in the face of surging fuel prices and lower than expected fare yields. Higher maintenance costs for its ageing fleet of Boeing 767 aircraft have also depressed financial performance.After being launched at 138p a share, the Maxjet share price rose briefly to a peak of 140p, but it has declined steeply in recent months, falling to a low of 73½p before trading was halted on Friday. Maxjet said it had requested the suspension “with immediate effect pending clarification of its financial position”.In an attempt to shore up confidence it issued a second statement last night “to confirm to its employees, customers and suppliers that business continues to function as normal”.Maxjet services operated from Stansted on Friday to both New York and Los Angeles.As senior executives criss-crossed the North Atlantic to try to secure financial backing – an effort made more difficult by deteriorating conditions in world financial markets – the group said that an announcement about the company’s financial position would be made “as soon as ­possible”.Maxjet had losses of $31.9m in the first six months of the year as it was affected by higher than expected costs from aircraft maintenance and rising fuel prices, while it expanded its transatlantic operations.It is one of a group of four carriers – including Eos of the US, the UK’s Silverjet and L’Avion in Paris – launched in the past two-and-a-half years with all-business class services in an attempt to challenge the legacy carriers such as British Airways, American Airlines, Air France and Delta Air Lines on long-haul routes out of Europe and the US.The airline made a net loss of $79m in 2006, its first full year of operations, on a turnover of $41.1m.
531;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-12-06T18:34:47Z;UAL debt move secures approval;;United Airlines has won support from its lenders to amend its debt agreement, freeing the US carrier to pursue buybacks and other initiatives designed to revive its flagging share price.UAL, United’s corporate parent, secured approval from investors in its $1.8bn term loan late Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said.The agreement, which gives United the flexibility to devote $500m to “shareholder initiatives”, came only after United offered to increase the amount it would repay on existing debt to $500m. Lenders had baulked last week at United’s original proposal, which would have reduced the loan’s outstanding debt by $350m.“We think the proposal we put forward meets the needs of lenders and all our stakeholders,” said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman with Chicago-based United.United, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2006 with fewer planes and lower costs, has sought to persuade investors it has been reborn a more shareholder-friendly company. The carrier’s executives were among the first of their peers to advocate consolidation, and have unveiled plans to sell or spin off United’s maintenance division.The carrier told investors in October that it might have a deal on the sale by the first quarter. And though the airline denied a report last month that it had discussed a merger with Delta Air Lines, United officials have held talks with another rival, Continental Airlines, in the past year.United’s shares plunged 15 per cent in November amid concern record fuel prices and a slowing US economy would crimp profits.Loan investors had complained that the proposed amendment, offered without a fee or interest-rate increase to lenders, appeared to ignore the new realities of a stressed credit market, according to Debtwire, a fixed-income news service owned by the FT Group.
532;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Air France-KLM profits soar;;Air France-KLM increased its profits strongly in the first half and forecast higher earnings for the full year supported by continuing strong demand for air travel in particular on long-haul routes.The airline said on Thursday it was still considering possible takeover moves for both Alitalia, the heavily loss-making Italian flag carrier, and Spain’s Iberia, which is already the subject of possible acquisition approaches by two rival consortia including one led by TPG and British Airways .“Any consolidation in Europe must improve the profitability of the new group,” said Jean-Cyril Spinetta, Air France-KLM chairman and chief executive. “If this is not the case of course we would abandon any idea of consolidation.”Air France led the consolidation of the aviation industry in Europe with its acquisition of KLM, the Dutch national airline, in 2004, the first takeover of a European flag carrier.It is also deepening its ties with Delta Air Lines of the US, its leading partner in the SkyTeam global airline alliance, through the launch of a transatlantic profit and revenue sharing joint venture.Air France-KLM operating profits in the first half to the end of September rose by 16.4 per cent from €979m to €1.14bn ($1.7bn) supported by a strong second quarter from July to September, when operating profits rose by 27.6 per cent to €725m.The group, the world’s largest airline measured by turnover, said “robust global growth continues to underpin demand, especially on long-haul.”The shares jumped more than 9 per cent in Paris, their biggest gain since May 2003, to €23.38.Jean-Cyril Spinetta, Air France-KLM chief executive, said the “dynamic market conditions” and continued efforts to control costs supported the forecast for higher profits for the full year despite record oil prices and the impact of the five-day strike last month by Air France cabin crew.The strike over a new long-term pay agreement cost around €60m, and the labour conflict remains unresolved with the present deal due to expire at the end of the year.Air France-KLM pre-tax profits in the first six months jumped by 83.4 per cent from €830m to €1.52bn, helped by a gain of €284m from the refinancing of its stake in Amadeus, the global travel distribution system.The impact of the rise in oil prices has been mitigated by the weakness of the US dollar and further successful fuel hedging, and the group continues to pass on to passengers a significant part of the extra costs through higher fuel surcharges on airfares.Turnover in the first half rose by 4.2 per cent to €12.4bn.
533;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-12-04T23:17:13Z;Southwest reduces expansion of fleet;;Southwest Airlines has reduced its planned growth in capacity next year amid fears that an economic slowdown will hit demand for air travel, while rising fuel costs are also undermining profitability.Gary Kelly, chief executive, said the leading US low-cost carrier was “concerned about growing evidence of slowing economic growth that would inevitably affect passenger demand, coupled with a surge in energy prices”.He said Southwest was planning to reduce the growth in its fleet next year to only five to 10 aircraft resulting in an increase in capacity, measured by available seat miles, of about 4-5 per cent.“This more conservative growth rate will aid us in our efforts to drive improved profits next year,” he said.The slower capacity growth would also give the group more time to benefit from various initiatives it was undertaking to increase revenues per passenger, as part of the effort to counter the impact of rising costs.“If the airline industry prospects worsen, we will be prepared with the strongest balance sheet, best fuel hedge, lowest operating costs in America,” he said.Southwest and many other US carriers flew fuller planes and raised fares during the third quarter, helping to lift profits even as oil prices continued to climb.Amid signs that demand for air travel has started to ebb, carriers are bracing for a downturn. Delta Air Lines cut its forecast for quarterly operating margins on Tuesday to reflect higher fuel costs.Southwest said on Tuesday it filled fewer available seats in November with its load factor falling from 71.8 per cent last year to 69.3 per cent. Capacity increased by 6.4 per cent, but traffic volume grew by only 2.6 per cent.But its traffic in the first 11 months rose by 7.1 per cent, supported by a 7.7 per cent increase in capacity. It filled 73 per cent of available seats compared with 73.4 per cent a year earlier.
534;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-11-18T18:57:21Z;US airlines;;In the old Road Runner cartoons, the hapless Wile E. Coyote, having once again run off a cliff-edge, would flap his arms vigorously in a vain effort to stay aloft. Activist investors appear to be taking a similar approach with US airline stocks.The fall in airlines’ share prices this year has mirrored the relentless climb of jet-fuel prices. Pardus Capital Management, the hedge fund demanding that UAL, parent of United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines merge, really began piling into both stocks this spring, according to regulatory filings. The release of its letters helped prompt a small bounce in the sector last week. Pardus is not alone in waving its arms about: earlier this summer, other activists called on airlines to do the opposite and break themselves up. For all the air of desperation, though, Pardus’s call is right.The industry is in dire need of consolidation. Load factors – bums on seats – at more than 80 per cent are very healthy, but higher fuel costs have eroded margins. A bigger problem is duplication of fixed overheads: all those terminals, ground staff, and IT systems. Do passengers really need big hubs at both Newark and Philadelphia, less than 100 miles apart, for example? Consolidation would allow the biggest airlines to rationalise national routes while making it easier for carriers to build truly global networks. This could also alleviate pressure on America’s air-traffic control system – creaking so badly the Pentagon has opened up airspace normally reserved for jet fighters to ease Thanksgiving holiday congestion.The shame is that none of this appears likely to happen any time soon. Antitrust constraints, a history of integration difficulties and unions smarting from years of concessions are big obstacles. Certainly, buying US airline stocks is an option on eventual merger activity (or falling kerosene prices). In the meantime, though, be prepared for the hard realities of high costs and a weakening economy – airline stagflation.
535;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta sets up team to review options;;"Delta Air Lines, under pressure from a large investor to combine with rival United Airlines, has formed a special committee to review strategic options, including a possible merger.Pardus Capital Management, a hedge fund with more than 2 per cent of Delta, the third-biggest US carrier, and a 4.8 per cent stake in UAL, parent to second-ranked United, has said the merger represents the best possible combination of large US airlines.Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, said on Wednesday that while the company had sought recommendations from legal and financial advisers, and asked Daniel Carp, its chairman, to head the special committee, there had been no discussions between the airlines: “There have been no talks with United regarding any type of consolidation transaction, and there are no such ongoing discussions.”Record fuel prices, high labour costs and excess capacity on many routes have led several airlines’ chief executives, including Delta’s Anderson and Glenn Tilton of United, to acknowledge the cost savings a merger would produce.Investors, mindful of the airline industry’s habit of wilting in times of economic weakness, would also favour consolidation. A merged Delta-United would surpass AMR’s American Airlines as the biggest domestic carrier.“Consolidation is needed to de-risk the industry and time is of the essence,” Karim Samii, Pardus president, wrote in a letter toDelta’s executives this week, which has been seen by the Financial Times.The logic of a Delta-United merger is not a novel concept: many industry executives and bankers agree that the two carriers have complementary strengths. Mr Tilton may be willing to cede the combined company’s CEO post to Mr Anderson, they said, eliminating another potential roadblock. In his letter, Mr Samii said he would support “the Delta team leading the strategic direction of the combined entity”.In pursuing an agreement now, Mr Samii wrote, Delta might face an easier antitrust review than it would once the Bush Administration leaves office.Mr Anderson, a former Northwest Airlines executive who joined Delta in August, told investors last month that the Atlanta-based carrier saw the merits of industry consolidation and would participate as a buyer. The comments raised eyebrows at Delta’s peers and their bankers.; Mr Anderson’s predecessor fought off a hostile bid this year from US Airways.Delta executives said Mr Anderson addressed consolidation to set the record straight on the airline’s views now that it had emerged from bankruptcy and installed a new CEO.Mr Samii said that while he appreciated the “more pro-active public stance”, he urged them to act. The fund manager revealed that his firm had accumulated 7m shares in the company, and sought advice from Gordon Bethune, the former Continental chairman who advised Delta during its bankruptcy, and Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, an airline consultancy. Pardus argues that a merger with United would create a more robust route network, with key strengths in the US, Europe and Latin America, and save the combined company about $585m. While other potential deals might offer more opportunities to eliminate overlap and cut costs, they pose specific challenges that make the United transaction more attractive, Mr Samii wrote.Mr Tilton, a former oil company executive, has been one of the industry’s most vocal advocates for mergers. When US Airways launched its bid for Delta, the Chicago-based airline held merger talks with Continental Airlines, people familiar with the negotiations said."
536;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-30T20:08:34Z;Airline shareholders look for spin-off plans;;"Investors’ patience with US airlines may be wearing thin.While many of the biggest carriers have signalled they are weighing plans to sell or spin off ancillary businesses – from frequent-flyer programmes to aircraft maintenance divisions – news of the possible spin-offs has drawn the same foot taps that greet a long-overdue flight.“They don’t have all the time in the world,” said Hannes Smarason, chief executive of FL Group, the Iceland-based investment firm that has urged American Airlines parent AMR to shed its AAdvantage rewards plan. “We hope to see them move aggressively.”Investors such as Mr Smarason, whose $7.5bn firm owns a 9.1 per cent stake in American, say the divestitures would release value hidden within a cyclical industry challenged by fierce competition and unprecedented energy costs. Some of these businesses might generate steadier returns – after all, aircraft need repairs whether oil trades at $30 or $90 a barrel – if they’re run separately.Many investors point to Air Canada parent ACE Aviation, which spun out stakes in four of its businesses, as a blueprint for the transactions the largest US carriers should pursue.Elsewhere, particularly in Europe, other airline groups have pursued similar strategies, most notably British Airways, which hived off non-core units such as catering and ground services in the late 1990s.American told investors this month for the first time it was reviewing options for American Eagle, a regional air service; AAdvantage; its maintenance and repair arm; and American Beacon Advisors, an investment-management firm.It also offered investors a glimpse of how some of those divisions perform – another first. American is working with advisers, including bankers at Rothschild, to evaluate plans for each of the divisions.Delta Air Lines executives say they will decide whether to sell its regional carrier, Comair, within months.Continental Airlines has said it will look at alternatives for its frequent-flyer arm, and USAirways is studying the merits of a spin-off for its rewards plan.United Airlines parent UAL was in talks with private equity firms and strategic buyers to sell its maintenance business, chief financial officer Jake Brace said.Northwest Airlines chief executive Douglas Steenland, who said on Monday that asset spin-offs had “the potential for significant value creation”, is also studying ways to break off the carrier’s rewards division.“For each of these businesses, there are arguments for some type of value-enhancing activity,” American finance chief Thomas Horton said during an analyst call. “But there are also strategic and practical challenges.”Not the least of which, industry executives, bankers and analysts say, is how the airline structures the contract defining its business relationship with the spin-off once they are separated, and how it values the division. Making the deal too lucrative for one side can imperil the other’s future.“We do not want to create a long-term issue for the business,” Larry Kellner, Continental Airlines chief executive, told the FT.The carriers’ relationships with organised labour could also influence how and when these businesses are separated. “Nobody said it would be easy,” FL Group’s Mr Smarason said of the challenges a frequent-flyer spin-off would pose.While encouraged by American’s willingness to at least raise the possibility of one or more spin-offs, Mr Smarason wants greater clarity on when the airline would reach a decision. “They don’t want to do it but, because stock prices are so lacklustre, they’re facing pressure,” Calyon analyst Ray Neidl said.“There’s a sense of urgency because it’s the right thing to do,” said Mr Brace, noting United might have a deal on its maintenance business to take to its employees’ unions by the first quarter."
537;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-29T21:56:03Z;Northwest shows first profit since protection;;Northwest Airlines posted a profit in its first full quarter since the US carrier’s emergence from bankruptcy protection, as higher fares and hedges against fuel costs fattened margins.The report completed a sweep of better quarterly results from the biggest US carriers. AMR, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, UAL and US Airways also capitalised on robust demand for air travel to fly fuller planes and raise ticket prices.Northwest earned $244m, or 93 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $1.18bn, or $13.50, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.9 per cent to $3.38bn.Aircraft fuel costs fell 7.9 per cent during the period. The Eagan, Minnesota-based company hedged 40 per cent of its exposure, saving $23m. Fares rose 2.1 per cent. Like many of its peers, Northwest scheduled fewer domestic flights this year.On a conference call with analysts, Doug Steenland, chief executive, said the airline would consider ways to unlock value from its frequent-flyer program, including a possible spinoff. Investors have urged US carriers to peel off rewards arms and other ancillary businesses that might generate steadier returns than core airline divisions, especially as fuel costs spiral higher.”This is worthy of further analysis, and we are undertaking that work,” Mr Steenland.Any spinoffs the carriers undertake wouldn’t necessarily delay the industry’s move to consolidate, Mr Steenland said.“I don’t believe the two are linked,” he said.The company’s executives declined to say if they were currently in merger talks with of their peers.
538;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-25T21:15:17Z;Heathrow take-off slots battle intensifies;;The battle for take off and landing slots at London Heathrow airport intensified on Thursday, as a small number of coveted slot pairs became available as a result of the EasyJet takeover of GB Airways from the Bland group.GB Airways’ four pairs of slots at Heathrow, the most congested airport in Europe, were not included as part of the EasyJet takeover and are being sold separately by the Bland group in three different deals.The world’s airlines are due to meet in Toronto in two weeks to thrash out slot deals around the globe, but some of the pieces of the jigsaw at Heathrow are already falling into place.Deals are not finalised yet, but it is understood that of GB Airways’ four pairs of slots, two are to be acquired by Continental Airlines of the US, one by British Airways and one by Qatar Airways.Heathrow slots trade in a grey market and often exchange hands for more than £5m for a pair of slots depending on the timing of the arrival and departure. It is understood that prime peak hour slot pairs have traded for up to £12m.Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, which controls more than 41 per cent of the slots at Heathrow, said on Thursday, “as always we will be bidding to get slots. We have not finalised any at this point.”The battle for slots has been particularly intense in recent weeks, as airlines prepare for the Toronto conference, which will agree deals in preparation for the start of the next summer season at the end of March.The much-heralded “open skies” deal between the European Union and the US, aimed at liberalising transatlantic aviation, comes into force at the end of March, and as a result of the deal Heathrow, the most important European gateway for US air traffic will be fully opened to competition for the first time.The previous stranglehold on direct US/Heathrow routes held by British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and United Airlines will be broken, and at least three more US carriers Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines are planning to start services to Heathrow from their main US hubs.It is understood that Continental is considering opening twice daily services from Heathrow to both Houston and New York Newark with an announcement possibly next week.Delta Air Lines will have the use of three slot pairs from its alliance partner Air France to launch twice daily services between Heathrow and New York JFK and a daily service to Atlanta. Air France is also opening its first long-haul route from Heathrow to Los Angeles.Northwest Airlines is expected to announce shortly that it will use three slots pairs held by its alliance partner KLM of the Netherlands to operate services between Heathrow and its hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis.American Airlines is also taking advantage of the “open skies” deal to move part of its present services between Gatwick and Dallas-Fort Worth and between Gatwick and Raleigh/Durham in North Carolina, to Heathrow from the end of March. British Airways is moving its services to Houston and Dallas-Forth Worth from Gatwick to Heathrow.
539;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-24T02:31:53Z;United and JetBlue outperform;;United and JetBlue Airways flew fuller planes and raised fares during the third quarter, helping the US airlines report results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.The two carriers joined rivals such as AMR, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines in capitalising on a busy summer for air travel. Most limited their expansion plans, especially in the US, helping to ensure existing routes were flown with fewer empty seats.Net income at UAL, corporate parent to United Airlines, climbed from $190m, or $1.30 a share, a year ago to $334m, or $2.21 a share. Excluding certain items, the Chicago-based company earned $1.96 a share to beat analysts’ estimates. United filled 85 per cent of its seats during the quarter. Operating revenue rose 6.8 per cent to $5.53bn.“Our decision to reduce capacity in the US is delivering the results we had anticipated – just as we have seen the benefits of our decision, ahead of the industry three years ago, to shift our capacity internationally,” Glenn Tilton, chief executive, told employees.United plans to trim another 3-4 per cent from its North American capacity in 2008 while adding as much as 6.5 per cent overseas.JetBlue earned $23m, or 12 cents a share, after breaking even in the year-earlier period. Its planes flew at 82 per cent capacity during the quarter. Revenue jumped 22 per cent to $765m. The New York-based carrier also said it would discontinue service to Columbus, Ohio, and Nashville, Tennessee, in January.Both UAL and JetBlue shares surged following the announcements.On their call with analysts, United executives said they may have an agreement to sell the company’s maintenance arm by the first quarter. The division has already “drawn a lot of interest” from both aircraft-repair companies and private-equity investors, said Jake Brace, United’s chief financial officer.“We’re going through a process now,” Mr Brace said in an interview. “We’ll probably end up reducing the field to one, and then go to talk to the unions about a specific deal rather than in general terms. We’re talking to a lot of people.”United said it would explore options for the maintenance arm and its frequent-flyer programme earlier this year. Investors have pressured US carriers to sell or spin off divisions to help lift their share prices and devote more attention to their main airlines.
540;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-17T22:23:32Z;Alliance plans Atlantic assault;;Air France and Delta Air Lines of the US, two of the world’s biggest carriers, Wednesday unveiled details of a transatlantic joint venture expected to become one of the most powerful forces in North Atlantic aviation.It will pose a tough competitive challenge to rival carriers in the transatlantic market, in particular British Airways at its global hub at London Heathrow, where Delta and Air France are planning a direct assault under the aviation freedoms created by the US/European Union “open skies” deal, which comes into force at the end of March.Under the “open skies” treaty, Heathrow, the most important gateway in Europe for air traffic from North America, is being opened to free competition. This will end the previously protected status enjoyed on Heathrow/US routes by BA, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and United Airlines.Delta executives on Wednesday warned rivals such as BA and Virgin that prices, in particular in business class, would inevitably fall as a result of the extra long-haul capacity at Heathrow.“This is a game changer for BA. The world will never be the same,” said one Delta executive. “BA has been insulated from competition for 40 years, but it is not a guaranteed monopoly any more.”From 2010, the Air France/Delta venture will include routes generating about $8bn a year.Eventually it is expected to be expanded to integrate the transatlantic operations of allied carriers KLM, already part of the Air France-KLM group, and Northwest Airlines of the US, adding annual revenues of more than $2.8bn.All four are already members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The Air France/Delta joint venture will take in about 20 per cent of the two group’s global operations, including from the summer of 2010 all their transatlantic routes between North America, comprising the US, Canada and Mexico on the one side, and Europe and all of the Mediterranean on the other.Richard Anderson, Delta chief executive, said the joint venture could add an estimated incremental pre-tax profit of between $125m and $200m a year from 2011.As part of the first phase of the deal, from the end of March next year the joint venture will include flights operated by both carriers between Heathrow and the US, where neither currently operate in the long-haul market.Air France is launching under its own brand a daily service between Heathrow and Los Angeles, while Delta will launch two daily services between Heathrow and New York JFK and one daily service between Heathrow and its biggest US hub in Atlanta.Delta will lease the necessary three pairs of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow from Air France, which will free up the necessary slots by cutting its daily services between Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle from 12 to probably seven.The London/Paris air services will be reduced to take account of the growing market share that will be taken by the Eurostar rail operation, where journey times are being reduced further next month with the opening of the high-speed rail link from London St Pancras.Air France is also expected to provide one pair of Heathrow slots to Continental Airlines of the US to support its parallel move into Heathrow, while KLM will provide three to four slot pairs to Northwest Airlines with which it already operates a long-standing North Atlantic joint venture.The KLM/Northwest and Air France/Delta partnerships already have antitrust immunity to operate trans-atlantic joint ventures. But in another step the carriers have an application under examination by the US department of transportation (DoT) for the eventual four-way transatlantic joint venture.Under the Air France/Delta deal the two carriers will share all incremental profits and revenues on a 50-50 basis. They will be able to market jointly and to collude on fixing capacity, prices and routes.The limited first phase of the joint venture, from the end of March next year and running for two years, will include all non-stop flights operated by Air France and Delta between their respective hubs at Paris Charles de Gaulle, Paris Orly and Lyon, and Atlanta, New York JFK, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City, plus the Heathrow/US services.The first phase will cover about $1.5bn of annual joint revenues.As a result of the new transatlantic services, the initial joint venture will encompass 19 daily flights and more than 4,500 daily seats, a 45 per cent increase in capacity.
541;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-10-17T22:03:30Z;Higher prices and full flights lift American;;"American Airlines’ profit climbed in the third quarter, as fuller flights and higher ticket prices helped offset an increase in compensation expenses.Under pressure from investors to revive a flagging stock price, executives for AMR, American’s corporate parent, told investors they were weighing the sale or spinoff of several businesses. Some shareholders have argued that the divestitures would help lift the airline’s returns.Net income rose to $175m in the third quarter, or 61 cents a share, up from $15m, or 6 cents a share, a year ago. The most recent period’s results include a $40m charge that the Fort Worth, Texas-based company took to account for additional wages and benefits its workers had accrued. Excluding the charge, American would have exceeded analysts’ 73-cent estimate by a penny.AMR, the biggest US carrier, has disappointed investors this year by failing to keep pace with some of its peers’ revenue gains. American, mindful of escalating fuel prices and an uncertain economic outlook, opted instead to shrink capacity and look for ways to extract more profit from its existing routes.“They’re the largest, they’re well-positioned,” said Michael Derchin, an analyst at FTN Midwest Securities, who rates AMR a “buy”. “They’ve opted basically to hold steady and not grow the international business and are actually shrinking the domestic.”For the year, capacity will drop by 2.2 per cent, AMR said. On a call with analysts and reporters, Thomas Horton, AMR finance chief, said the company would maintain about the same number of scheduled flights next year.Total revenue rose 1.7 per cent to $5.9bn in the third quarter. American filled a record 84 per cent of its seats during the period, up from 82 per cent a year earlier, and its average fare increased by 2.3 per cent.Last month one of AMR’s largest investors, Iceland’s FP Group, called for a strategic review of the company’s assets, including its AAdvantage frequent-flyer program, which it valued at $4bn.Horton said on the call that such a review was underway for four of its divisions: AAdvantage; its regional airline, American Eagle; the company’s maintenance and repair arm; and American Beacon Advisors, an investment-management business.“When it makes sense for our shareholders, we take appropriate steps to unlock the value we have created,” Mr Horton said.The revenue AMR generated from each seat, per mile, rose by 5 per cent, reaching the top of a range the company had forecast last month.“That’s a respectable number, but it’s lower than what Delta produced,’’ Mr Derchin said.Delta Air Lines reported its quarterly results on Tuesday.AMR predicted on September 21 that the per-mile passenger revenue would climb 4-5 per cent in the third quarter, less than what some of its peers had forecast, prompting analysts to trim their earnings estimates."
542;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta bounces back from bankruptcy;;Delta Air Lines, the US carrier that emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, on Tuesday reported earnings quadrupled in its third quarter as sales rose by 10 per cent.Net income was $220m, or 56 cents a share, up from $52m last year, when Delta was still under bankruptcy protection and not publicly listed. Analysts polled by Thomson had expected per share earnings of 42 cents. Operating revenue was a quarterly record of $5.23bn, up from $4.75bn last year. Operating margins more than doubled to 8.7 per cent.Delta has now returned to profitability after running up years of huge losses.The Atlanta-based company reinvented itself after coming out of bankruptcy, emerging with a lower cost structure. At one point the largest passenger carrier in the domestic market, Delta has now focused its energies on international routes, where price competition remains less fierce.During the quarter 35 per cent of Delta’s flight capacity was international, up from 24 per cent two years ago.“We are maintaining our disciplined approach to domestic capacity, including the elimination of 13 domestic aircraft from our fleet, while remaining focused on pursuing profitable international growth,” said Edward Bastian, Delta’s chief financial officer.The earnings are the first released under new chief executive Richard Anderson. Mr Anderson, the former head of Northwest, took over from Gerald Grinstein in August.“As these results demonstrate, Delta has emerged as a leader in the airline industry and we intend to maintain that position,” he said.Delta said it continued to strengthen its balance sheet, paying down more than $1bn in debt. Delta has also invested more than $400 million on renovations such as Delta’s Atlanta and New York JFK hubs, and aircraft deposits.The airline realised approximately $46m in cash gains on fuel hedge contracts settled during the quarter.The shares rose $1 or 5 per cent to $21 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.
543;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-09-27T03:17:48Z;Delta in talks for Latin America partner;;Delta Air Lines hopes to secure an alliance partner in Latin America by next year, filling a gap in what has been a problematic region for the groupings which now dominate the global industry.Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice-president, said the SkyTeam alliance – founded by Delta and Air France – is in talks with “several unaligned carriers” in Latin America, which has been a focus of its own international expansion.Oneworld, the alliance led by American Airlines and British Airways, is the only one of the three global groupings to have a partner in the region through its relationship with Chile-based Lan. Star, which is headed by United and Lufthansa, tossed Varig from the grouping late last year as the Brazilian carrier went into creditor protection. Varig was later purchased by rival Gol.The financial problems which have beset Latin American airlines has trimmed the ranks of potential candidates, leaving a “beauty contest” between SkyTeam and Star to secure Gol and Tam, the two largest Brazilian airlines, which have both embarked on their own international expansion.”Joining with one of the alliances requires careful analysis and we will be conducting a study from October through the end of this year,” said Wilson Maciel Ramos, Gol’s vice-president planning.Delta has boosted its Latin American capacity by a quarter over the past year as part of a strategy which has seen it switch aircraft from unprofitable domestic routes to overseas destinations. Local alliance partners help boost traffic by offering onward connections and marketing support, especially for high-margin business passengers.“[Latin America] is one of the holes for SkyTeam,” Mr Hauenstein told the Financial Times as Delta unveiled a raft of new international services from its hub at New York’s JFK airport. He said the alliance would “hopefully” secure a partner next year, bolstering the presence it has through Aeromexico and Panama’s Copa Airlines.Delta is vying with American Airlines for international dominance at JFK, which remains the largest US gateway despite the congestion issues which have plagued services from the airport and triggered government proposals to cap the level of flights.Atlanta-based Delta has followed the lead of Continental – another member of the SkyTeam alliance – by launching flights to secondary destinations in Europe, but has also pioneered the first services by US airlines to parts of Africa and the Middle East.Analysts had questioned the strategy, but Delta executives said the first raft of routes had proved among its most profitable, despite admitting at their launch that it was unsure of how successful they would be.“This is responsible and sustainable flying,” said Richard Anderson, Delta’s new chief executive, on a call with reporters, noting that all of the new international routes had “been profitable since day one”.The carrier announced plans for 14 new services, including flights to Cairo, Cape Town, Lagos and Nairobi, none of which are served at present by US airlines. Mr Anderson said Delta had a 20-30 per cent cost advantage over the European airlines that currently carry the traffic via their own hubs, and said its experience of new non-stop services was that the time saving helped boost traffic by as much as 30 per cent.
544;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-09-23T18:17:31Z;US airlines in court over ‘dirty tricks’;;Two US airlines will face each other in a Honolulu court Tuesday amid allegations of ’dirty tricks’ which could have wider ramifications for deal-making in the industry.Hawaiian Airlines has accused Mesa Airlines, the largest US regional carrier, of misusing documents obtained when it looked at investing in the carrier three years ago, before opting to launch its own inter-island operation, Go.Mesa placed its chief financial officer on paid administrative leave last Friday amid allegations he had destroyed documents involved in the long-running dispute, which are due to be examined this week by a Hawaii bankruptcy court.Peter Murnane has been put on 90 days’ leave while Mesa investigates the allegations. Brook Hart, his high-profile Honolulu defence lawyer, declined to comment.Mesa has insisted it used publicly available information when setting up Go.The small Hawaiian market has been a financial graveyard for airlines because of fare wars and the high cost of operating short routes between the islands, prompting three bankruptcy filings in recent years by Hawaiian and Aloha, the two incumbents.Hawaiian alleged in court papers that Mesa had violated confidentiality agreements by using proprietary information – including its business plan – gathered as a potential investor. It unsuccessfully sought to block the launch of Go, but has continued its legal fight, seeking unspecified damages and a one-year injunction preventing Go from selling tickets.Last month, the airline alleged in court filings that Mr Murnane had destroyed documents on three computers, including Hawaiian’s post-bankruptcy business plan.“Mesa – specifically, Mr Murnane himself – engaged in wilful and deliberate spoilation of evidence that existed on three of his computers,” Hawaiian said in the filing. “He did so even though Mesa’s in-house counsel explicitly instructed him and others at Mesa to ‘preserve any and all documents’.”While such confidentiality agreements are standard practice, their observance is particularly sensitive in the airline industry as the business revolves around a service rather than a trademarked product. Recent contested takeover battles – such as US Airways’ pursuit of Delta and AirTran’s unsuccessful effort to buy Midwest – saw both targets decline to open their books.Mesa operates flights on behalf of United, Delta and US Airways on the US mainland, but the regional market has become increasingly competitive as major carriers seek cheaper contracts to cut costs.
545;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-09-17T07:01:22Z;Where to wait: Everything the devoted lounge lizard would need;;The last thing any company wants is one of its senior managers sitting for two, three − or even four − hours in an airport departure lounge.But, with executives having to leave more time for security searches, extra hours at the airport have become a necessary evil.For once, airlines and airports have facilities in place to help the business traveller − albeit at a price. Airport lounges, once regarded as an unnecessary extravagance by penny-pinching company travel managers, have come into their own.The popularity of lounge access at crowded airports such as London Heathrow − which runs at or beyond capacity throughout the year − is shown by the increasing numbers of upmarket leisure travellers who are prepared to pay for them.It is yet another example of the leisure traveller moving into an area traditionally thought of as the business traveller’s domain.Most of the time, access to business and first-class lounges requires a first or business-class airline ticket − but not always. Today, you can buy lounge access from a separate provider. Servisair, for example, allows you to pre-book lounge access online irrespective of the airline and class of ticket that you hold.There is also continuing growth in online companies offering lounge entry. One of the biggest is Priority Pass which offers access to 500 VIP lounges in 90 countries and 250 cities.Chris Hale, its marketing director, says that a growing number of business people who have been downgraded – for example from business to premium economy class flights – are buying into lounge access programmes.He notes: “We also have a lot of higher-end leisure travellers who want lounge access too. We’ve got something like 1.5m users and the numbers are growing.”Even charge and credit card companies are joining lounge access programmes and offering them as incentives to cardholders. Last month, for example, American Express and American Airlines granted their consumer, small business and corporate platinum card and Centurion members access to American Airlines Admirals Club lounges worldwide.American Express already allows some card members access to Continental Airlines Presidents Club, Delta Crown Room Clubs, and Northwest Airlines World Clubs.In addition platinum or Centurion cardholders with relevant identification can also take their spouse and children, or up to two travelling companions, as lounge guests.If you are travelling with a big carrier, then go online to find out what lounge access is provided with your ticket class.Some airlines permit regular economy-class passengers a lounge upgrade if they are airline cardholders.Most, however, try to maintain privilege status by allowing access to first and business-class travellers only.Emirates Airlines, which has a worldwide lounge network, does not think passengers choose an airline simply for its lounge facilities − but says a good lounge certainly helps.Today, building state-of-the-art lounges is expected of the important carriers – especially at their hubs.Thai Airways’ new Royal First-class lounge at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport is a case in point. Although all of Thai’s Royal Orchid Lounges at Suvarnabhumi offer almost every facility the business traveller could want, first-class passengers get extra pampering – the Royal Spa providing two private therapy suites, sauna, exercise and yoga spaces.Air France is another airline that has invested heavily in a premium lounge at its hub in Paris Charles de Gaulle. Its first-class lounge, l´Espace Première in Terminal 2E, will provide a baggage porter waiting for you outside the terminal ready to take your bags to check-in – as well as its swanky facilities.
546;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-08-21T22:40:52Z;Delta names Anderson as new chief;;Delta Air Lines named Richard Anderson, a former head of rival Northwest Airlines, as its new chief executive.Mr Anderson is currently an executive vice-president at UnitedHealth and joined the Delta board in March, just before the carrier emerged from 17 months of bankruptcy protection.Gerald Grinstein announced his intention to stand down as Delta’s chairman and chief executive after restructuring the third-largest US carrier through labour concessions and a strategy that saw it focus on more international flying.Mr Anderson fought off competition from Jim Whitehurst, Delta’s chief operating officer, and Ed Bastian, chief financial officer. Mr Bastian now also assumes the post of president.His choice over two internal candidates and background at Northwest, which has one of the most troubled labour relations records in the industry, is expected to raise questions over Delta’s ability to retain the confidence of employees at a time when industrial relations across the sector are at a low ebb.Mr Anderson, a former Texas prosecutor, arrived at Northwest and was chief for three and a half years before departing for UnitedHealth in October 2004, a decision driven in part by the carrier’s poor outlook and the financial rewards outside the sector.Some US carriers remain beset by employee aggravation over executive compensation but Delta, Northwest and others have seen managers leave the sector in search of better compensation.Mr Anderson is one of the few – Tom Horton, American Airlines chief financial officer, being another notable example – to return to the industry.His tenure as Northwest’s chief was viewed as mixed, though his departure was still seen as a surprise after focusing on cost-cutting and protecting Northwest’s core business in its US heartland.However, his restructuring efforts did not prevent the airline filing for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta in September 2005.The two airlines flirted with a possible merger during their bankruptcy reorganisation and, while Mr Anderson’s arrival is likely to spark further speculation, most observers do not expect any of the leading carriers to combine during the current cycle, in part because of antitrust concerns.Delta has returned to profitability after running up $10bn in losses during the preceding five years but its restructuring has seen it emerge with one of the lowest cost structures in the industry.The decision to appoint an external candidate will also trigger speculation about the future of Mr Whitehurst, who has been linked by some observers with the soon-to-be vacant chief position at Virgin America.
547;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-07-24T22:30:36Z;Delta Two writes to reassure on Sainsbury;;"Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim, Qatar’s prime minister, on Tuesday sent a letter to Lords John and David Sainsbury assuring them that Delta Two, his investment vehicle mulling a £10.6bn bid for J Sainsbury, had the supermarket chain’s long-term interests at heart.The sheikh, who met the two cousins earlier this month in Sardinia to discuss his plans, is thought to have told them Delta Two would endorse the current management team.He also told the cousins, who speak for about 14 per cent of the shares, that he wanted to grow the business in the long-term. The sheikh said he would not seek to jeopardise the company’s competitive position through excessive gearing.Delta Two is keen to win over the Sainsbury family shareholders – the wider family own about 18 per cent of the stock – as part of efforts to make a friendly approach. In April, the Sainsbury cousins saw off a 582p-a-share indicative bid from CVC, the private equity firm.The correspondence between the Sainsbury family and Delta Two comes amid continued talks between the board and the investment company over the 600p-a-share indicative offer put to the board last week.The Qatar-backed investment group, which owns 25 per cent of the retailer, needs 75 per cent shareholder approval to de-list Sainsbury under its proposals.With an 18 per cent holding, the family cannot block the deal. But their opposition would make it harder for Sir Philip Hampton, Sainsbury’s chairman, to put the offer to shareholders.The two Lord Sainsburys are thought to have sent a letter to the sheikh early last week reiterating their concerns about a possible bid. It is understood the cousins pointed to three areas of concern: the value of the bid; the leverage around the company; and future pension funding.Under current proposals, Delta Two is planning to inject £3.1bn of equity into the business and will raise a further £9.6bn of debt to cover the 600p indicative price, refinancing of net debt and investment plans."

549;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-07-24T18:43:43Z;Oneworld alliance applies for antitrust immunity;;American Airlines, Iberia, the Spanish flag carrier, and three other airlines in the Oneworld global alliance have applied to the US authorities for antitrust immunity to allow them to work more closely together in the transatlantic market.British Airways, the leading European airline in the Oneworld grouping, has been excluded from the application, however, as the UK carrier and American are not yet ready to risk such a move given the difficult history of earlier similar initiatives.The US transportation department (DoT) has previously demanded that the two airlines, and in particular BA, should give up a large number of take off and landing slots at London Heathrow airport as the price for immunity.Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said earlier this year that BA was itself seeking to add more slots at Heathrow and was not willing to hand over any of its existing holding to competitors.BA and American have chosen to wait to see how successful rivals such as Delta Air Lines, Continental, Northwest and US Airways are in their search for slots at Heathrow, before they consider a renewed application.American said on Tuesday that it had applied to the DoT for antitrust immunity to allow it to collude legally with four other Oneworld carriers, Iberia, Finnair, Malev of Hungary and Royal Jordanian Airlines.They are seeking permission to co-operate in areas such as codesharing, where airlines sell seats on each other’s services under their own codes, frequent flyer programmes, route and schedule planning, advertising and marketing, pricing and yield management and revenue allocation.The application by the Oneworld carriers follows a similar move last month by leading European and US airlines in the rival SkyTeam global alliance.The SkyTeam application included a request for approval of a planned transatlantic joint venture between Air France-KLM, the world’s biggest airline by turnover, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.A similar move was turned down last year, but the airlines believe that the new application will be approved as a result of the “open skies” deal reached earlier this year between the US and the European Union to liberalise transatlantic air services.Henry Joyner, senior vice president planning at American, said on Tuesday “we believe that an alliance with antitrust immunity is of vital strategic importance and will help us remain competitive with other transatlantic alliances that already have such immunity.”
550;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Continental moves to protect recovery;;Continental Airlines on Thursday announced plans to sell aircraft to overseas carriers and trim capacity, highlighting broader industry efforts to reduce supply and protect a fragile financial recovery.US airline executives have expressed concerns in recent months about excess domestic capacity, which has limited their ability to raise fares at a time of record load factors and buoyant growth in international traffic.Houston-based Continental has been the fastest-growing network carrier, expanding its transatlantic network and services to Latin America and Asia and adding domestic capacity to support its push into higher-margin overseas routes. Its performance on transatlantic services helped lift net profits from $198m to $228m in the June quarter.However, the airline said it will cut its growth next year from 5-7 per cent to 3-4 per cent, selling 10 737-500 aircraft to Russia’s Transaero and negotiating the sale of another five aircraft to another overseas carrier.The deals follow the pattern seen during the US industry’s restructuring of the past six years, with airlines and leasing companies taking advantage of capacity shortages in emerging markets to realise high selling and rental rates.The earnings’ reports from US carriers this week highlight the cost and revenue challenges facing the industry, with fuel prices continuing to rise. Labour rates are under pressure, with unions at some carriers, such as American – whose earnings undershot analysts’ expectations – calling for new, richer contracts.The major airlines are continuing to pursue a mix of cost cuts and revenue-boosting measures, while trimming capacity at a time when new entrants such as Skybus, ExpressJet and the soon-to-be launched Virgin America are intensifying the competitive landscape.Southwest, the largest domestic airline and the acknowledged low-cost leader, has already cut its growth plans, and this week said it would offer voluntary redundancy to as many as a quarter of its staff.The Dallas-based carrier remains the most profitable airline in the US and has never had any compulsory redundancies, and analysts view its twin moves as evidence of a serious supply-demand imbalance.Delta, which produced its maiden profit after emerging from bankruptcy protection in April, demonstrated the largest turnaround as it continued to shift aircraft from domestic services to more profitable international routes.The share of international flying by the Atlanta-based airline has increased from 23 per cent to 35 per cent over the past 18 months, helping to close a margin gap with its peers.Southwest was the only one of this week’s reporting carriers to produce a drop in second-quarter earnings, hit by higher costs and the diminishing effect of the fuel hedges which had propped up profits over the past two years.The carrier said Herb Kelleher, founder of the airline, will quit as executive chairman in May 2008. He will remain for five more years. No succession plans were announced.
551;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-07-08T21:01:39Z;Customers guard Boeing 787 delivery slots;;"Key Boeing customers have ruled out giving up any delivery slots for the new 787 aircraft to alliance partners or other airlines amid demand that has left it in effect sold out until 2014.Boeing rolled out the 787 at a glitzy ceremony in Seattle on Sunday and, after a sluggish start, has logged 677 orders ahead of its first scheduled delivery – to All Nippon Airways – next May.The company continues to work through early manufacturing problems and has delayed a decision on raising 787 production from a forecast 100 a year until it gains more experience with building the revolutionary carbon-fibre aircraft. But executives admit they are under pressure from sales staff to boost rates as it competes with Airbus for orders for longhaul jets.US carriers such as Delta and American are also examining fleet plans which could include 787 orders, but even large and loyal Boeing customers face the challenge of tight supplies as the rival Airbus A350XWB won’t enter service until 2013.“There’s no way we would give up our [787] slots,” said Geoff Dixon, chief executive of Qantas, one of the largest 787 customers and a member of the Oneworld airline alliance alongside BA and American. “We believe there’s a shortage of capacity around the world,” Mr Dixon told the FT after the Australian flag carrier increased its 787 orders from 45 to 65, with options for 20 more.These views were echoed by other customers, and will add to the pressures on Boeing to accelerate the 787 programme, even before the first flight, slated for late August or early September.Boeing is confident the 787 will arrive on schedule, in spite of the supplier problems that have seen it take some outsourced work back in-house and rely on temporary fasteners amid a global shortage of titanium parts.“We have no intention of being late into service,” said Mike Bair, the head of the 787 programme, at a presentation ahead of the roll-out. The company is mindful of the financial and reputational damage suffered by Airbus following production problems with its A380 aircraft, which will be delivered two years late to its first customer this year.Mr Dixon also repeated his call for Boeing to commit to launching a larger 787-10 variant of the aircraft, which would compete more directly with the A350 and its own 777 models, and said he had held talks with Airbus. “The number [of a particular type] in your fleet doesn’t matter; it’s the business case,” he said. Boeing said the 787-10 would not be ready to enter service until 2014 if it decides to give the go-ahead.In the battle between Rolls-Royce and General Electric for the engine orders to power the 787, the UK jet engine maker has secured an order to power 40 of the 74 787 Dreamliners ordered by International Lease Finance Corporation, the world’s biggest aircraft leasing company.Rolls has won about a third of the 787 engine orders."
552;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-06-29T21:53:50Z;SkyTeam partners apply for immunity;;Leading European and US airlines in the SkyTeam global alliance have applied to the US authorities for antitrust immunity for their transatlantic services in a move designed to intensify competition against rival carriers such as British Airways, American Airlines, Lufthansa and United Airlines.The SkyTeam application includes a request for approval of a planned joint venture between Air France-KLM, the world’s biggest airline by turnover, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. Air France, which took over KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, three years ago said that the airlines were aiming to create a “comprehensive and integrated partnership” across the Atlantic.A similar move was turned down last year, but the airlines believe that the new application will be approved as a result of the “open skies” deal reached earlier this year between the US and the European Union to liberalise transatlantic air services.Approval of the application will allow the four airlines to operate a profit and revenue-sharing joint venture operation across the North Atlantic enabling them to collude legally on setting prices and capacity levels and giving them a powerful new tool in the fight against the rival alliances of Oneworld and Star led respectively by British Airways and American and by Lufthansa and United.KLM and Northwest Airlines have operated a far-reaching joint venture across the North Atlantic with US antitrust immunity for several years.Air France and Delta have a separate immunity, but they have been slow to take full advantage of the approval, while Delta was being restructured under Chapter 11 bankruptcy administration, from which it emerged in April.The biggest prize in the “open skies” deal is the opening up of London Heathrow airport to full competition among European and US carriers.
553;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-06-13T15:21:15Z;Southwest looks to acquisitions;;Southwest Airlines said on Wednesday that it was examining potential acquisitions and alliances with multiple carriers, a signal that industry consolidation could emerge among the fast-growing low-cost segment.Gary Kelly, chief executive, said the largest US domestic airline had the funding to support acquisitions, despite a slowdown in revenue growth across the industry which is challenging its expansion plans and profit forecasts.His comments followed a recent signal by Delta Air Lines, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in April, of interest in a future combination with JetBlue, the second-largest low-cost carrier. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reported the interest after a management meeting, though Delta declined to comment on any speculation.The US low-cost segment is seen as ripe for consolidation after Delta’s successful rebuff of a hostile bid from US Airways this year raised concerns that any deals among the large network carriers could be blocked on antitrust grounds.While low-cost carriers such as Southwest and JetBlue continue to expand faster than network rivals, the overlap in their route systems is less likely to attract opposition from regulators.Mr Kelly declined to be drawn on any potential targets, though analysts have in the past linked the company with Denver-based Frontier and Spirit, a Florida-based carrier which focuses on routes to the Caribbean. He noted Southwest had made acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s – Texas-based Muse Air and Morris Air, a Utah-based airline run by JetBlue founder Dave Neeleman. “Who knows, maybe we’ll do one this decade,” he said.Southwest’s business model formed the template for the rapid emergence of low-cost carriers around the world such as Ryanair, Easyjet and AirAsia. However, the airline is evolving its strategy to provide the flexibility for code shares and other alliances, as well as international flights. Southwest had previously eschewed such moves to protect its cost structure.The airline is upgrading its computer systems to handle the added complexity of alliance partners and international flights. Southwest’s only code-share is with ATA, a domestic carrier which it helped rescue from bankruptcy to secure its slots and gates at Chicago’s Midway airport.Analysts believe it is likely to seek partnership s with overseas carriers operating to the US. JetBlue has held talks with Aer Lingus about a pact which could offer the Irish carrier’s passengers onward travel within the US, and is examining similar partnerships.Mr Kelly also said domestic margins remained under pressure at the start of the key summer travel season. “If trends don’t change, it would be appropriate to change the growth rate,” he said, noting Southwest had the flexibility to defer some of the 32 Boeing 737s scheduled for delivery next year.
554;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Northwest Airlines sticks to strategy;;Northwest Airlines will emerge from bankruptcy protection on May 31, completing the latest round of industry restructuring and providing a focus for a future stage involving consolidation among the six largest US carriers.Minneapolis-based Northwest won court approval on Friday to end 20 months of bankruptcy protection, which has seen it forge new deals with most employees and lenders to cut costs and improve competitiveness.While Delta Air Lines changed its business model ahead of its emergence from Chapter 11 protection last month, Northwest executives insisted its strategy was not “broken”, with a strong international franchise and domestic position less troubled by low-cost rivals.Doug Steenland, chief executive, flirted with suitors including Delta after its Atlanta-based rival was subjected to an unsuccessful takeover bid by US Airways.Northwest will emerge as a standalone carrier, but many analysts still view it as a likely takeover candidate because of its attractive route network.The lack of overlap with rivals could avoid some of the potential antitrust issues which dogged US Airways’ pursuit of Delta.American, which tried to acquire the airline seven years ago, is viewed as a leading candidate, and any future deal would also void a golden share that Northwest has in Continental, freeing the Houston-based carrier to pursue merger possibilities of its own after holding tentative talks with United.Northwest is expected to be valued at around $7.75bn when it debuts next month on the New York Stock Exchange. Overcapacity is still viewed by executives as the main barrier to the industry’s ability to sustain a financial recovery after narrowly breaking even last year following five years of heavy losses.Four major airlines - Northwest, Delta, United and US Airways, which was acquired by America West – restructured through bankruptcy since the September 11 attacks. While all have shrunk domestic flying – often shifting to more profitable international routes - critics of the Chapter 11 process argue that failing carriers should be liquidated to bring stability to the highly-cyclical airline business.Northwest has cut average costs to a little above those at Delta – now the lowest among the legacy carriers – while its Pacific and transatlantic networks have kept yields just below those of American, the industry leader.The airline expects to return to profitability this year, though has still to conclude a new deal with its flight attendants, which have twice rejected earlier offers and opposed the reorganisation plan approved by the court on Friday. The cabin crew union has given tentative backing to a fresh proposal, and Northwest’s fractious history of labour relations may be improved by the departure as chairman of Gary Wilson, who led an unpopular leveraged buyout in 1991.However, staff have bristled at the stock grants and options to the current management team, which could see Mr Steenland emerge with more than $20bn, though employees are being offered more than $1bn in equity and profit shares.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,565.46 and remains well below its March 2000 record of 5,048.62.The release of the April employment report on Friday could well dictate whether the S&P’s old high is taken out soon, analysts say.After the S&P set its record in 2000, the index endured a tough period in which it hit a low of 776.76 on October 9, 2002.

556;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-04-29T22:41:16Z;Overseas focus key to Delta’s protection exit;;Delta Air Lines will emerge from 19 months of bankruptcy protection Monday, just as fears of overcapacity in the domestic industry raised concern about US carriers’ recent financial recovery.Atlanta-based Delta has reinvented itself in bankruptcy: what was once the largest passenger carrier in the domestic market has become the largest and fastest-growing US player on international routes, where price competition remains less fierce.The dichotomy was highlighted during the airlines’ first-quarter reporting season, as continuing international expansion contrasted with warnings of deteriorating conditions in the domestic market.Overcapacity rather than weakening demand in a slowing economy was identified as the main culprit by most executives, though some carriers – such as Southwest and JetBlue – also pointed to pockets of “softness” in summer bookings.US Airways, a prime beneficiary of the shrinking of carriers such as Delta in the domestic market, cut its own capacity forecast for the year, and said there was little visibility as the industry entered its busiest and most profitable part of the year.The airlines’ conference calls highlighted a split in who was to blame for the end to the capacity discipline that had allowed carriers to claw back some of the fuel-price increases over the past two years.American and Continental, for example, cited the continued expansion of low-cost rivals, which in turn pointed to the revival of the major network carriers following their restructuring in bankruptcy protection.In response, the low-cost carriers noted that United, Delta and Northwest have completed the domestic cutbacks while in bankruptcy. Analysts expect the big seven legacy carriers to have flat domestic capacity growth this year, though low-cost rivals such as Southwest and AirTran are expected to grow at double-digit percentage rates this year.Three new entrants – Skybus, ExpressJet and Virgin America – will add only minimal capacity to the domestic system, but are likely to lead to limited price wars in some markets which, in the past, have shown the capacity to spread.Delta, buoyed by its international expansion, offered the most bullish assessment of its own domestic markets, with executives claiming they were operating “in a parallel universe”.The Delta management team faces the task of delivering on the financial pledges of the restructuring plan.
557;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-04-23T21:48:05Z;JetBlue ponders in-flight text messaging;;JetBlue is examining the potential for in-flight text messaging, highlighting efforts by US carriers to exploit on-board communications as a way to boost revenues and differentiate their service.David Neeleman, JetBlue founder and chief executive, shares the misgivings of many US airline executives about the on-board use of mobile phones for voice calls, but said text communications could prove attractive.JetBlue was the first US carrier to offer live television on its aircraft, and bought additional radio spectrum in a federal auction this year which could be applied to launch the US first in-flight texting service.European carriers are at the forefront of introducing mobile phone technology, with Air France-KLM due to start a six-month trial on short-haul routes, while Ryanair has announced plans to equip all of its aircraft to allow mobile phone use.Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic carrier in the US, last week said it was exploring in-flight wireless access as part of its own shift away from a “no-frills” business model. This comes at a time when network carriers such as Delta are narrowing the expense gap with low-cost rivals after restructuring under bankruptcy protection.JetBlue’s assessment comes as the carrier seeks to rebuild its popular following among travellers after a series of delays and cancellations in February prompted Congressional hearings into airline service standards.Mr Neeleman, who apologised again at a House hearing last week, has received plaudits for accepting responsibility for the problems, which will see the carrier report a first-quarter loss today.JetBlue responded with a passenger “bill of rights” offering a sliding scale of payments and refunds for delays deemed to be in the carrier’s control. But Mr Neeleman and fellow airline CEOs have rejected calls for a federally-mandated passenger charter, arguing the proposals would add to delays and compromise operations.
558;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-04-23T19:15:26Z;Delta seeks slots at Heathrow;;Delta Air Lines said on Monday it was seeking up to six daily pairs of slots at London’s Heathrow airport as it became the first US carrier to commit to a launch date for services to the congested UK gateway.The third-largest US carrier by revenues is among a pack of airlines on both sides of the Atlantic which are tapping alliance partners and a “grey market” in slots at Heathrow following the recent open-skies agreement between the US and the European Union.“We feel very confident we will be able to get the slots we need,” said Jim Whitehurst, chief operating officer, pointing to a March 30 2008 launch date. “We are still working with our alliance partners and other unaligned carriers to build a slot portfolio.”The current US-UK bilateral restricts US flights from Heathrow – which boasts a large share of high-margin business traffic – to just four airlines: British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and United Airlines. This would be replaced by the open skies deal due to come into force on March 30 next year, opening access to any carrier which can secure landing and takeoff slots at appropriate times.Delta, Continental and Northwest – which currently fly into London Gatwick airport – plan to start Heathrow services when they can secure slots. UK-based BMI, which has the second-largest slot pool at Heathrow after British Airways, also wants to start services to the US from the airport.“We are canvassing everybody,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice-president for network development. “There is quite a lot of activity going on right now.”Delta is a member of the Skyteam airline alliance, alongside Air France-KLM, Continental and Northwest, and has expressed confidence it could secure some slots from partners or from other carriers operating smaller regional jets into the airport.Mr Whitehurst said Delta would start with as little as a single slot pair – enough for one daily service - though would ideally like between three and six to launch services to Heathrow from its hubs in Atlanta and New York’s JFK airport. He said recent transactions had valued slots at around $20m a pair.Delta, which is due to emerge from bankruptcy protection as early as this week, is shifting capacity to more international routes as part of its financial recovery.
559;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-04-20T00:59:25Z;Southwest seeks new sources of revenue;;Southwest Airlines, which provided the template for low-cost carriers, on Thursday announced a three-year transformation plan to deal with the “permanent” increase in fuel prices.Dallas-based Southwest is the largest and most efficient US passenger carrier. Its plan to find new revenue sources could widen the competitive gap which network carriers such as Delta and United have closed after years of restructuring.Southwest on Thursday reported its 64th straight quarter of profitability, a record unmatched in the industry, but will experiment with measures which could alter the “keeping it simple” business model emulated by carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet in Europe, and AirAsia. The airline, which insisted that it was not interested in a leveraged buy-out, is losing the edge it had over rivals as fuel hedging contracts start to unwind.Southwest was one of the few carriers able to buy protection during the ramp-up in fuel prices in 2004, which have pushed up unit costs at the airline by a third over the past three years. The plans outlined by Gary Kelly, chief executive, borrow heavily from measures introduced by Ryanair and others, driving more non-flying revenue such as hotel bookings from its website, and charging passengers for a broader array of services, including the potential for in-flight wireless access.Southwest’s efficiency and ability to set prices in the US market reflects a strategy which eliminates many of the complexities of rivals. It uses a single aircraft type, with no assigned seating or on-board food, except peanuts.Mr Kelly said a business operating almost 500 aircraft and carrying 21m passengers last year had “hidden assets” which would allow it to boost average revenues. These include carrying more cargo, looking at the potential of international flights and alliances with other carriers,and providing in-flight internet services.The efforts to create a more competitive Southwest – which continues to expand into more of the network carrier’s core domestic markets – comes as its rivals recover from the heavy losses suffered since 2001, most of them after a bankruptcy process which eliminated more than 120,000 jobs. While the industry expects to move into profit this year, after effectively breaking even in 2006, executives warned this week that overcapacity could threaten their ability to sustain higher earnings and rebuild battered balance sheets.Mr Kelly declined to comment on LBO speculation but said he opposed any move which would leverage Southwest’s balance sheet up to the levels of rivals.
560;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;United and BMI file for antitrust immunity;;United Airlines and bmi have applied to the US government for antitrust immunity to operate joint transatlantic services.The two carriers, which are already part of the global Star airline alliance, have asked US regulators for permission to deepen their pact following last month’s “open skies” agreement between the US and the European Union.An immunised deal between United and bmi, which holds the second-largest amount of slots at London’s congested Heathrow airport after BA, would allow the airlines to co-ordinate the marketing and operations of their transatlantic services, improving their competitive position for premium business passengers.United already holds immunity for transatlantic services operated with other members of the Star alliance such as Germany’s Lufthansa. The US transportation department granted tentative backing to a United-bmi pact in 2002, subject to the successful conclusion of an open skies-style agreement with the UK, which is included in the deal with the EU due to come into force on March 30 2008.The US-EU deal will open services from Heathrow to the United States beyond the four airlines – BA, Virgin Atlantic, United and American - permitted by the current bilateral agreement, allowing BMI into the market for the first time.The UK’s second-largest carrier, which successfully lobbied for the deregulation of EU markets, has long pushed for additional rights beyond the limited services it operates from outside London. It currently flies only to Chicago and Las Vegas from Manchester.United is the fourth-largest UK to US carrier, flying from London to its hubs in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. The carrier last year sold its New York to London rights to Delta Air Lines.However, Delta and rivals such as Continental – which are also seeking Heathrow access – face the task of buying slots at the airport at suitable times.The large pool of slots held by bmi, which last week sold a portion of its holding to BA for £30m – give the carrier an advantage in expanding its own transatlantic services, provided it can secure suitable aircraft.If the United-bmi deal is approved by regulators, BA could face more pressure to seek a similar deal with American Airlines, its partner in the rival oneworld global alliance. The two carriers sought such an alliance five years ago, but balked at regulators’ demands to give up more than 200 daily slots at Heathrow.
561;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-03-23T21:07:33Z;‘Open skies’ fares cut in doubt;;Business class and leisure travellers expecting air fares between London Heathrow and the US market to fall dramatically as a result of the “open skies” deal could be disappointed.There will be more choice as new entrants add routes and frequencies but as the dust settles from Thursday’s decision by the European Union to back the deal with the US, doubts are being raised about some claims.Business-class fares are one example. The scale of the cuts suggested in recent days of up to 50 per cent are unlikely to be realised for most passengers, as few pay the full-rate fares used in the comparisons.Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, the US investment bank, said: “Lobbyists tend to fixate on ‘rack rate’ flexible business fares from London Heathrow, which almost no one pays. Like new aircraft sticker prices or hotel rack rates, they bear very little relationship with actual corporate fares after discounts.“We do not anticipate an immediate fare war,” he said. “Despite popular perception, Heathrow/US fares are competitive. We saw a £200 all-in round-trip fare Heathrow/New York recently on ba.com.”Mr Avery said the expected US new entrants to Heathrow such as Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and US Airways would put downward pressure on business-class fares from the summer of 2008. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the UK incumbents on Heathrow/US routes, would be unlikely to be able to leave corporate fares unchanged.“At this stage, average cuts here of 5 to 10 per cent look credible to us, which might represent a similar cut to BA’s profits then.”That figure is in line with those provided by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which prepared a study for the government on the probable economic and consumer impact of an “open skies” deal. It said: “UK passengers flying to the US for business purposes are paying around £700 one-way [including taxes and charges]. We would expect reductions of up to 10 per cent over the next five years.“Similarly, for UK passengers flying for leisure purposes we estimate that they are paying £215 one-way and we would expect similar reductions over the period of around 10 per cent.”Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, insists the London/US market is already competitive and that initially much of the extra capacity coming into Heathrow will be transferred from other airports rather than being incremental capacity.“In the short term, you will see a transfer of capacity from airports outside Heathrow and probably outside London into the London market. I do not think you would see a significant increase in the total capacity available in the market.“The fares that are already available are very competitive. When British Airways sells London-New York return for £199 all inclusive, I do not believe you are going to see a significant discount in that fare. I do not believe that you will see a radical change to the pricing structure in the market,” he told MPs last week.Figures used by the European Commission before the vote for the scale of benefits on both sides of the Atlantic included the claim that 26m passengers could be added over five years and that the economic benefits could be worth up to €12bn over a five-year period.The report prepared for the commission by management consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and Campbell Hill Aviation Group represented data for the fully liberalised open aviation area sought by the EU originally.“The passenger numbers and economic benefits are vastly exaggerated,” said one aviation economist. They depend on the second-stage negotiations for an open aviation area, which leading US congressmen are ruling out, and include removing limits on foreign ownership and control of airlines and on foreign carriers gaining cabotage in the US market.“Perhaps an extra 2-4m passengers is possible from open skies, but 26m is ludicrous,” he added.
562;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-03-19T23:17:26Z;Delta rewards staff for helping fight merger;;Delta Air Lines’ staff will receive $480m in cash and stock when the third-largest US carrier emerges from bankruptcy in a move which reflects their crucial support in fending off the hostile bid from US Airways.The payments are part of a restructured package of pay and incentives for Delta staff and executives, including profit-sharing and bonuses, at a time when a broader industry recovery has created labour tensions at some rivals.The payments will give 39,000 Delta employees a 3.5 per cent stake in the carrier when it emerges from 20 months of bankruptcy protection in May, with 1,200 managers receiving an expected 2.4 per cent in “equity opportunities”.Delta pilots will also receive a yet-to-be determined stake.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chief executive, said the support of Delta employees – who endured pay and staff cuts – swung support for the carrier’s standalone plan despite a higher cash-and-stock offer from US Airways which at one point topped $11bn.“They let it be known how miserable and unhappy they would make life [under US Airways],” Mr Grinstein told the Financial Times, emphasising that the incentive plan – to be announced on Tuesday – was not intended to “buy” employee morale.Ed Bastian, chief financial officer, said the 11-week takeover battle provided management with crucial leverage in winning support from the creditors’ committee for a new renumeration policy.“They said ‘No’ to US Airways and ‘Yes’ to investing $500m in our people,” said Mr Bastian of the committee, which included Delta’s pilots, the only large unionised group at the airline. “That was certainly something that [US Airways’ CEO] Doug Parker was not planning to provide.”Delta executives conducted dozens of “town hall-style” meetings over the past year to win support for the standalone plan and improve labour relations, which at one point brought pilots close to strike action.The plan includes a July pay rise to move staff towards “industry standard” levels and a profit-sharing plan designed to pay at least 15 per cent of pre-tax earnings.
563;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-03-07T21:08:12Z;BA ready to profit from ‘open skies’;;Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, on Wednesday played down the impact the planned liberalisation of transatlantic air services would have on the airline and sought to allay investor fears following a sharp drop in its share price this week.BA is fiercely opposed to the “open skies” treaty between the US and the European Union, but Mr Walsh said that, if the deal was approved by EU transport ministers this month, the airline was fully prepared.Other leading European carriers – including Air France-KLM, Europe’s biggest carrier – strongly support the deal and BA appears increasingly isolated. It is continuing to lobby both the UK and German governments and the European Commission against the agreement.Mr Walsh told an investors’ conference in London that BA was better placed than either its US rivals or BMI British Midland to take early advantage of the liberalisation because of its existing holding of more than 41 per cent of the take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow.The airport will be at the centre of changes in transatlantic aviation if the treaty is approved. The treaty would remove restrictions on the number of carriers that can fly between Heathrow and the US. At present only BA, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and United Airlines may operate direct flights on these lucrative routes.Mr Walsh said BA would transfer its Atlanta, Dallas and Houston services to Heathrow. The existing treaty forces it to operate these services from Gatwick.US carriers, such as Delta Air Lines, Continental, Northwest and US Airways would be “hampered” initially, he said, in making similar moves because of their lack of slots at Heathrow.Mr Walsh said Heathrow was 98.5 per cent full. Non-Heathrow carriers would have to try to buy slots on the grey market or acquire them from European alliance partners. BA would also be a buyer in the slot market.“We believe the threat to BA is very manageable …in the short term it is minimal and may be positive,” Mr Walsh said.He ruled out any new move by BA and American Airlines to apply for antitrust immunity for a profit and revenue sharing venture across the North Atlantic, if “open skies” was approved.Earlier, such moves were abandoned because many Heathrow slots would have to be relinquished to satisfy regulators.
564;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-02-20T20:11:36Z;Airlines & private equity;;What does it mean when private equity starts sniffing around the notoriously unstable airline industry? Qantas recently bowed to a buy-out led by Texas Pacific Group. Meanwhile, rumours have swirled around British Airways, United and, most recently, American Airlines.One obvious interpretation is that the private equity cycle is peaking. Flush with cash, funds are delving into ever-riskier areas. The Qantas deal is not as extreme a signal as the buy-out of a US carrier might be. The Australian airline has a dominant position at home and does not currently face excess competition on some profitable international routes. But it is still subject to the vagaries of an industry where earnings swing wildly on the back of fuel prices or drops in passenger volumes.A deal in the US would be more worrying. With limited barriers to entry, new capacity has typically flooded in during good times. During the current upswing, that effect has so far been restrained. But without structural change – even in the dark days after September 11 2001 there was no serious consolidation – it is hard to believe overcapacity will not return. For investors, the industry should remain a cyclical trading play.That is how TPG hit its two home runs. It bought both Continental and America West during bankruptcy, turned them round and sold at the right time. Unions are willing to make concessions when they are looking into the abyss during a downturn, but during better times, understandably, they try to claw benefits back. Financial sponsors would be brave to buy American Airlines now, even though it is enjoying the up-cycle, because it faces labour renegotiations in a few years.At this point in the upturn, straight buy-outs look tough. Private equity would need to deploy capital while simultaneously restructuring companies’ costs and engineering a rationalisation of industry capacity. And it is hard to see the creditors of bankrupt Delta or Northwest giving up control of the airlines at a bargain price to a financial buyer, particularly with potential merger partners already circling.
565;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Delta wins approval for restructuring plan;;Delta Air Lines on Wednesday secured court approval to seek creditor backing for its standalone restructuring plan after evading the hostile takeover bid from US Airways.The third-largest US airline by revenues had offered a series of concessions to creditors in a successful effort to limit support for the unsolicited offer from its smaller rival, which was dropped last week after reaching a potential peak of $11bn.Delta, which entered bankruptcy protection in September 2005, now hopes to exit court protection by the end of April. The airline revealed on Tuesday that it had resolved objections to the standalone plan, paving the way for solicitation of the two-thirds majority of the estimated $15bn in unsecured claims needed to validate the management proposals.The proposed deal – which would have created the world’s largest carrier by revenues – collapsed last week after Delta’s official creditors’ committee backed the plan pushed by management.The airline has reduced losses after cutting staff and capacity and renegotiating labour and other deals, but some of its financial targets were greeted with scepticism during the 11-week battle with US Airways.Delta sweetened its own stance by giving bondholders the right to elect almost all of the post-bankruptcy board, eliminating any plans for a poison pill and restricting the issuance of new equity to senior managers. Delta’s existing equity will be wiped out by the bankruiptcy.A court hearing has been set for April 25 to consider the reorganisation plan, assuming it secures the required support from creditors.
566;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-02-06T20:14:29Z;Northwest welcomes first profit in six years;;Northwest Airlines on Tuesday reported its first annual profit in six years, though analysts said it still has to repair relations with some employee groups ahead of its planned emergence from bankruptcy protection by mid-2007.The Minneapolis-based carrier reversed a $1.36bn loss in 2005 to produce a pre-tax surplus of $301m last year as a mix of cost and capacity cuts combined with the broad improvement in fares and revenues experienced by other US carriers.Northwest, which ranks fifth by traffic in the US, has pledged to emerge from bankruptcy protection as a standalone carrier, though was drawn into potential industry consolidation by US Airways’ aborted takeover of Delta Air Lines.Delta’s management is due to present its own standalone plan to a US bankruptcy court on Wednesday before seeking approval from creditors to emerge from Chapter 11 protection on April 30.While Delta mounted an aggressive campaign to stay independent, many analysts view Northwest as more agreeable to a potential takeover or merger. The airline’s extensive network and route authorities to Asia and relatively small overlap with low-cost rivals in the US have made it a highly-prized franchise. Northwest hired financial advisors to assess “strategic combinations”.Doug Steenland, Northwest’s chairman and chief executive, last week declared that “the airline is fixed” after bankruptcy protection allowed it to shrink capacity by 10 per cent, renegotiate financial contracts and push for new labour deals.However, Northwest’s labour relations are viewed as among the most fractious in the industry, with both pilots and flight attendants coming to the brink of strike action last year.Northwest flight attendants last week reopened talks with management for the first time in almost two months - cabin crew are currently working under terms imposed by the airline with the backing of the bankruptcy court.Its pilots, which did reach a new deal, have recently called for amendments to the existing agreement following the carrier’s improved financial performance. The 2006 profit, which excludes reorganisation expenses, is about $60m ahead of he forecast issued last October, helped by the decline in fuel prices during the fourth quarter, when the airline lost just $7m.Northwest has sought to diffuse labour tensions by introducing a profit-sharing scheme, and successfully preserved employee pensions after lobbying Congress to pass new legislation which eased the financial burden on airlines.The airline is expected to file a full reorganisation plan next week, which will provide financial projections and the proposed payouts to an estimated $9bn in unsecured creditors. The plan will also contain potentially-contentious items such as management compensation schemes, which could impact its talks with labour groups.
567;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-02-01T02:18:45Z;US Airways drops hostile bid for Delta;;US Airways on Wednesday abandoned its quest to take over bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines after a three-month campaign that shook the US airline industry and raised hopes of consolidation among the largest carriers.The decision was prompted by the refusal of Delta’s creditors committee to allow US Airways access to the company’s books, a decision sharply criticised by Doug Parker, US Airways chief executive.“We are disappointed the committee is…ignoring its fiduciary obligation to those creditors…We would have created a better, more financially stable airline that offered choice to consumers and increased job security to employees,” Mr Parker said.The collapse of US Airways’ bid – which is unlikely to be revived – could delay consolidation. America’s airlines have struggled with high fuel prices, declining passenger numbers and increased competition.A flurry of deal conversations in the sector, involving Northwest, United Airlines and Continental Airlines, were sparked by the offer.The hostile bid for Delta was closely watched by the industry to gauge whether antitrust regulators would oppose a tie-up between the nation’s third and fifth largest airlines.At a congressional hearing last month, the plan was met with scepticism from several senior lawmakers. US Airways offered $5bn in cash and 89.5m shares for Delta, valuing it at about $10bn.Delta’s standalone plan, which would give creditors new equity in the company but no cash, values the airline at between $9.4bn and $12bn.The biggest obstacle to the Delta plan had been securing adequate financing to emerge from bankruptcy.But on Tuesday Delta moved closer to that goal by agreeing a $2.5bn package from a consortium of banks to repay a $2.1bn bankruptcy loan and expenses.The rejection of the bid by creditors is a victory for Delta’s management, led by Jerry Grinstein, chairman and chief executive, who said a union with US Airways was flawed and would cause regulatory problems.He said on Wednesday: “This is a proud day for the thousands of Delta people, customers, communities, civic leaders and others who stood up for our stand­alone plan and said, emphatically, ‘Keep Delta My Delta.’ ”Delta has rejected the possibility of inviting a “white knight” bid from another airline.Shares in US Airways were up 0.5 per cent to $53.38.
568;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-30T17:57:42Z;US Airways rules out new bid for Delta;;US Airways on Tuesday ruled out returning with a fresh bid if Delta Air Lines emerges from bankruptcy as a standalone carrier, in a last-ditch attempt to rally creditor support for its hostile offer.Delta’s official creditors’ committee is expected to vote on Wednesday on the merits of the competing plans for the third-largest US carriers by revenues, amid intensifying efforts by bondholders to push Delta to the negotiating table.Doug Parker, US Airways’ chairman and chief executive, also ruled out extending the deadline set for the committee to accept its negotiating conditions “beyond midnight Phoenix time” on February 1.Mr Parker expressed impatience with the lack of signals from the official committee, which acts as an effective gatekeeper for the progress of both the US Airways’ bid and the standalone Delta plan. “If they can’t do that, we’re quite happy taking care of our own debtors,” he said, adding that he had not had recent contact with Gordon Bethune, the former Continental Airlines head advising the committee.He said an ad hoc committee of Delta bondholders was getting “more and more agitated” about the Atlanta-based carrier’s refusal to open up its books to US Airways.Mr Parker said the nine-member official committee “knows exactly what they have to do. If they don’t do it, we’re gone.”US Airways’ effort to create the largest airline in the world triggered discussions among six of the country’s seven biggest carriers, and is being closely monitored for any signal that regulators would permit deals.Mr Parker said the blocking of its Delta offer would probably mean there would be no consolidation until the next industry cycle.He said any move on a post-bankruptcy Delta was “probably not one we would be interested in,” as it would lose many of the potential synergy benefits.Delta on Tuesday added a heavyweight line-up of six banks to provide exit financing and explicit support for its effort to thwart the bid: JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, UBS and Barclays Capital would provide $2.5bn in funding.US Airways has already secured $8.3bn in funding from Citigroup and Credit Suisse, which could provide an additional $1bn to sweeten the existing offer and persuade Delta creditors to push the carrier to the negotiating table.
569;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-30T14:59:54Z;Six banks fly to Delta’s aid;;Delta Air Lines on Tuesday added a heavyweight line-up of six banks to provide exit financing and explicit support for its effort to thwart the hostile $10bn bid from US Airways.The Atlanta-based carrier selected JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch to provide $2.5bn in exit financing, with Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and UBS completing the roster of co-arrangers.The announcement, which came as US Airways reported full-year results and prepared for a crucial bid deadline, adds another dynamic to the unfolding battle for control of the third-largest US airline by revenues.US Airways has already secured $8.3bn in funding from Citigroup and Credit Suisse, which could provide an additional $1bn to sweeten the existing offer and persuade Delta creditors to push the carrier to the negotiating table. US Airways’ existing offer expires on February 1.Delta Air Lines’ official creditors are expected to vote on Wednesday whether to force management to examine a sweetened offer from US Airways.The vote comes amid signs that creditors are not enthusiastic about either the hostile bid or the Atlanta-based carrier’s stand-alone plan.Delta’s board, which has already rejected one offer, remains committed to its plan to exit bankruptcy protection as a stand-alone carrier this year, and has successfully marshalled political support to back its claim that any deal should be blocked on competition grounds.However, there are signs that neither proposal has garnered the two-thirds vote of support from the official creditors’ committee, despite a call from an ad hoc group for Delta to open its books to due diligence.“If they don’t at least open up the process, they’re gone,” said one person close to US Airways, who described the official creditors group as “frozen”.The ad hoc creditors group on Monday urged the official creditors to force the airline’s management to evaluate the enhanced US Airways bid.US Airways’ shares gained more than 7 per cent on Monday on hopes the enhanced terms would sway creditors.Other airline stocks, including carriers such as United, which are also monitoring consolidation opportunities, rose on Monday in response to another drop in oil prices.An enhanced bid is now valued at $11bn, some $3bn above the initial hostile offer last November, and close to the top end of the valuation made in Delta’s plan.
570;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-25T00:44:52Z;Senators wary of hostile bid for Delta;;Washington lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Wednesday expressed deep scepticism about US Airways’ $9.8bn hostile bid for Delta.The poor reception for the deal in Congress raises significant questions about the future of the proposed transaction. The airline merger would lead to a wave of consolidation that would cut sharply the number of national carriers in the US, the lawmakers said.In a small, packed hearing room to discuss the prospects of the deal, some Democratic and Republican senators appeared unconvinced by promises from Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, that the proposed deal, which would create the largest US carrier, would not lead to cuts in service, large-scale redundancies or increased fares.While Congress does not have a formal say in deciding whether the deal could move forward, lawmakers – particularly those representing rural states – could put political pressure on both the airline industry and the Justice Department, which would review the deal on antitrust grounds. Although the White House has been largely hands-off on merger reviews, the Justice Department blocked a proposed merger between United and US Airways in 2001.Andrew Steinberg, assistant secretary for aviation at the Department of Transportation, which would likely confer with antitrust authorities on the deal, declined to comment on the US Airways case, but presented mixed signals on where the Bush administration might stand on the issue.While mergers were “not a panacea” for the airline industry’s long-term problems, the government should not assume that having fewer carriers “necessarily translates into detriment to consumers”, said Mr Steinberg.However, even some Republican lawmakers who traditionally do not oppose mergers on competition grounds, such as Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, said they were concerned the deal would lead to the closure of some routes.“You’re an aggressive suitor,” Mr Lott told Mr Parker. “But the lady from the South doesn’t want to be forced into this shotgun wedding,” he said, referring to Georgia-based Delta.Gerald Grinstein, Delta’s chief executive, whose testimony was backed up by the presence of 32 uniformed Delta pilots around the hearing room wearing “Keep Delta My Delta” pins, said the combination would trigger further deals and lead the industry “to devolve into three network carriers”. He also testified that Delta was not negotiating a separate deal with Northwest Airlines.He said: “Approve this [deal] and you will be setting a very low threshold.” Mr Grinstein added that, given the roughly $22bn in debt the deal would amass on the combined company’s balance sheet, one might sooner believe in Tinkerbell than Mr Parker’s notion that the merger would not lead to a disruption in service.The tone of some legislators’ remarks revealed underlying frustration at the airline industry and US Airways in particular for pursuing the merger even though it and other companies have in recent years dumped their pension liabilities on to the federal government.Lawmakers in the House of Representatives are due to take on the same issue next week at another hearing.US Airways has said it will withdraw its bid if Delta creditors do not push the carrier to the negotiating table by February 1, allowing it to start seeking regulatory approval. Delta’s board is reviewing the revised bid to create the largest US carrier, a move that has triggered talks about potential combinations. However, the final decision will rest with its creditors.
571;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;‘Personal jets’ seen as salvation for rural areas;;The US transportation department on Wednesday suggested that the new breed of so-called personal jets could provide a radical solution to the declining airline service to rural communities.Andrew Steinberg, assistant secretary for aviation and transportation affairs, said the DoT was examining the future role of the new jets – which have just started production – to counter the impact of large carriers cutting flights to smaller airports.“You can envisage at some time in the future a much more vibrant market of on-demand service that can be operated profitably,” he told a Senate commerce committee hearing on airline consolidation.Mr Steinberg’s comments came as Congress started its review of the hostile takeover bid by US Airways for Delta, its larger rival.Senators focused during Wednesday’s testimony on the potential impact on air fares and consumer choice, and expressed widespread concern that deals between the largest carriers would lead to further service cuts.Mr Steinberg admitted that reduced rural services had been one of the largest negative consequences of industry deregulation, with the DoT forced to boost subsidies and examine alternatives to operation by the large network carriers.New Mexico-based Eclipse Aviation, whose backers include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, has already secured more than 2,500 orders for its six-seat Eclipse 500 very light jet (VLJ). It delivered its first aircraft earlier this month, and a number of air-taxi and charter operators have placed orders for the Eclipse and rival VLJs targeted mainly at business flyers.Supporters of the VLJ concept argue they will transform the airline business, and the emergence of government support for the sector could accelerate their acceptance by consumers and make finance easier to secure.The Eclipse 500 is the first of an array of very light jets, which utilise new engines, avionics and lean manufacturing techniques to produce small jets at a fraction of the cost of existing executive aircraft.Proponents of the emerging VLJ sector believe the low entry and operating costs will create a vast new market of personal and business users currently deterred by high prices.
572;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-23T23:59:34Z;Antitrust issues ‘key barrier’ to Delta merger;;Antitrust concerns have re-emerged as the key barrier in US Airways’ hostile pursuit of Delta Air Lines, according to aviation financiers surveyed by the Financial Times.The airlines’ chief executives will face off on Wednesday before a Senate hearing on airline consolidation, which both sides view as a key test of political sentiment for deals involving the largest US carriers.Doug Parker, US Airways’ chairman and chief executive, is adamant that a deal which would create the world’s largest airline would be cleared by the Justice department.He is expected to provide assurances to the Senate commerce, science and transportation committee that the merger with its larger rival would not lead to higher fares or reduced service to smaller communities.Jerry Grinstein, his opposite number at Delta, argues the airlines’ overlap on the US east coast would see it blocked on competition grounds, though has entertained discussions with Northwest about a potential combination when both emerge from bankruptcy protection.Delta is reviewing final bids from banks to provide exit financing for its planned exit from bankruptcy as a standalone carrier, which could include private equity investment.US Airways has already lined up more than $8bn in funding from Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to back its offer, and has set a February 1 deadline for Delta creditors to force airline management to the negotiating table and trigger an antitrust review.While creditors, advised by former Continental Airlines chief executive Gordon Bethune, are reviewing the competing financial benefits of US Airways’ raised bid and Delta’s plan, financiers said the antitrust issue is assuming greater importance.“Finance is not the issue,” said one banker, noting there are funds available to back any of the potential combinations which could emerge if lawmakers and regulators signal a change in the industry climate. Six of the seven largest carriers have held talks on potential combinations.The justice department effectively scuppered deals between United and US Airways and American and Northwest at the start of the decade. However, Mr Parker and other executives said the expanding role of low-cost rivals such as Southwest has intensified competition.Another financier bidding on the Delta funding believes that the chances of regulatory approval have dropped to 50/50.
573;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-22T17:35:34Z;United Airlines halves shelf-life of miles;;United Airlines has cut the expiry date on unused frequent-flyer miles to 18 months in a move which highlights the US industry’s renewed focus on revenue growth after years of cost cutting.The decision to halve the time limit applies only to inactive accounts, but will trim millions of dollars of liabilities from its balance sheet and provide more incentives for its best business customers at a time when United is looking to cement the revenue premium is enjoys over rivals by investing in extra services.United’s Mileage Plus scheme is the world’s second-largest frequent-flyer programme after American’s Aadvantage. Almost 500bn miles have been accrued by flyers at United, which carries a $3.5bn deferred revenue liability on its balance sheet to cover future free flights and upgrades by Mileage Plus members.The airline declined to quantify the potential impact on revenues and its balance sheet, but noted in regulatory filings that a 1 per cent change in the level of outstanding miles could trim the revenue liability by $41m.United reports its full-year results on Tuesday, and analysts are expected to question executives about any potential to sell Mileage Plus, a strategy already followed by Air Canada and considered by other US carriers.Frequent-flyer programmes remain one of the most powerful marketing tools for the network airlines to compete with low-cost rivals, though carriers such as Southwest and AirTran have their own bonus schemes, in contrast to peers such as Ryanair and easyJet in Europe.Delta recently announced it would cut the expiry date on inactive accounts from three years to two, while American retains a three-year window and Continental and Northwest have no cut-off dates.United said its best customers would face less competition to redeem miles on flights as dormant accounts expired, boosting its efforts to attract higher-paying business customers at a time when all of the US carriers have renewed their focus on maximising revenues.While some carriers have yet to report fourth-quarter data, the industry is expected to report its first full-year profit since 2000 after five years of relentless cost-cutting, helped by a series of fare hikes over the past 18 months.Revenue growth eased in the final quarter of 2006, in part due to tougher comparisons, but executives have highlighted a series of initiatives to boost non-ticket sales to regain momentum.Southwest, the sector’s most-profitable carrier, plans to sell more travel-related services such as hotel rooms, while American has turned its maintenance base from a cost into a profit centre after new labour agreements allowed it to secure third-party work from other carriers.
574;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Virgin America changes its business plan;;Virgin America will sub-lease four of its 10 aircraft to other carriers as the US start-up awaits a final ruling on its bid to run domestic US airline services this year after offering to ditch both its name and its chief executive to win approval.The fledgling San Francisco-based airline this week attempted to distance itself from Sir Richard Branson and the Virgin Group in an effort to overturn regulatory opposition to a plan which has become mired in domestic and international political conflicts.Fred Reid, the former Delta Air Lines and Lufthansa executive hired to run the airline, said it had made “unprecedented” changes to the plan turned down last month by the US Department of Transportation.“I think we’ve done back flips and jumped through hoops of fire,” Mr Reid told the Financial Times, pointing to a range of amendments which he said went beyond the concerns voiced by the department.He said four Airbus aircraft would be leased while it awaited the final ruling. It has 33 aircraft on order.The application, first made in December 2005, generated intense lobbying from rival US airlines, which argued that Virgin America had failed to prove its US credentials and was overly-influenced by the minority stake held by Virgin Group companies. Opponents, which have been accused by Virgin America of stifling competition, on Thursday declined to comment while they reviewed the proposal.Mr Reid insisted the revised plan met all current US ownership rules after Virgin Group reduced its board representation, and its principal backers replaced some overseas investment with domestic funds.The department had cited Sir Richard’s close relationship with Mr Reid – who he recruited to head his latest airline venture in April 2004 – in its December decision. Mr Reid said he was willing to step down if required.Regulators had also questioned the licensing deal between Virgin America and the Virgin Group. The airline said it was prepared to amend the deal and even drop the “Virgin” name, though Mr Reid said a move which could reduce its brand awareness was “unlikely”. The original business plan used the name Best Air.Mr Reid said flights could start two to three months after it receives final clearance, with initial services from San Francisco to New York, with other coast-to-coast and shorter-haul routes being added as more aircraft arrive. He insisted Virgin America had not missed its window of opportunity.
575;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-12T17:36:19Z;Northwest seeks extension for bankruptcy plan;;Northwest Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, on Friday asked for more time to file its bankruptcy reorganisation plan in a move which that will intensify speculation that it is seeking a buyer or merger partner.The Minneapolis-based airline has held preliminary talks with fellow bankrupt carrier Delta Air Lines, which is seeking an alternative to the hostile $10.3bn bid from US Airways.Northwest is highly prized because of its strong Asian network and a domestic business with relatively little competition from low-cost rivals. The airline has aimed to emerge from bankruptcy later this year as a standalone carrier, but last month hired advisors to assess “strategic combinations”.The company on Friday filed a reorganisation plan which omitted details of the prospective payout to creditors, and won permission to delay its so-called “disclosure statement” containing further details until February 15.US Airways has set a deadline of February 1 for Delta’s creditors to consider its cash-and-stock offer and force management to the negotiating table. Delta rejected the bid made on November 15 and remained lukewarm to an offer raised this week by almost a quarter. The Atlanta-based carrier argued US Airways’ bid was flawed and would be turned down by antitrust regulators.US Airways disputes the assessment, and said regulators are now more favourable towards deals involving the six large network airlines.Delta has entertained discussions with both Northwest and United Airlines, which have less route overlap and would be more likely to secure regulatory approval. A Delta-Northwest combination would likely involve a takeover by the larger Atlanta-based carrier, but not until both have emerged from bankruptcy protection.Any deal involving Northwest would also invalidate a golden share which it holds in Continental Airlines, which has also held talks with United.Although the formal decision over Delta’s fate lies with creditors of the bankrupt carrier, antitrust officials and the availability of finance are expected to determine the immediate shape of a sector recovering from five years of heavy losses.US Airways sought to accelerate the offer process by asking Delta creditors to back its call to start due diligence on the Atlanta-based airline. However, Delta has rejected the overtures in pursuit of a plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection as an independent carrier later in the year.Delta’s pilots indicated on Friday that they remained opposed to the revised offer, which they are currently reviewing. The pilots’ union is one of nine members of an official creditors committee which is being asked by US Airways to evaluate the proposal. A two-thirds majority is required to push any of the competing plans.
576;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;AirTran steps up pressure on Midwest;;AirTran, the US low-cost airline, on Thursday took its hostile offer for rival Midwest Airlines direct to the shareholders of its smaller rival in a further sign of looming consolidation among domestic carriers.Florida-based AirTran wants to create a coast-to-coast operation ranking second to Southwest Airlines, the profitable leader of the low-cost segment which is now the largest domestic passenger carrier.While the contested offer is dwarfed by the battle for control of Delta Air Lines, the emergence of larger low-cost rivals could be a crucial factor in securing antitrust clearance for deals between the six network carriers.US Airways’ hostile offer for Delta, which was lifted to $10.3bn on Wednesday, would require clearance from regulators which have blocked previous large-scale deals.Delta has argued that a combination with US Airways would also be blocked because both carriers have a large presence in the south-eastern US.However, many airline executives believe the regulatory climate has changed over the past six years because of the growth of low-cost rivals such as Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue, which now account for more than a third of domestic traffic.Bob Fornaro, AirTran’s president, told the FT last month that it could help facilitate some of the larger deals by picking up assets to assuage regulatory concerns and promote competition. “We create solutions in some of the major [deal] scenarios,” he said.However, AirTran said its ability to compete in a consolidating industry hinges on boosting its own scale and expanding its focus on the south-east served from its Atlanta hub, where it competes with Delta.AirTran recently announced a marketing deal with Denver-based Frontier Airlines, and wants to add Midwest’s network in the north and central US.Joe Leonard, AirTran’s chairman and chief executive, said this would create a “formidable” business which could “compete no matter what happens with airline consolidation [elsewhere]”.Midwest operates from its hubs at Milwaukee and Kansas City, focusing on higher-yield business passengers in a region with relatively little penetration by other low-cost carriers. AirTran is one of the few low-cost operators to offer business-class service on its flights.Both carriers operate Boeing 717 aircraft, while AirTran has 60 more 737s on order to join its existing fleet of 40, which it said would be used to replace Midwest’s less fuel-efficient MD-80s.Mr Leonard said AirTran had “reluctantly” taken the offer direct to Midwest shareholders. “Quite frankly, we’ve been stonewalled,” he said.AirTran raised its offer from $11.25 to $13.25 a share, incorporating $6.625 in cash and 0.58884 shares, valuing Midwest at $345m. It runs until midnight on February 8. Midwest shares rose 1 per cent to $13.05 in early trading on Thursday.Midwest, which on Thursday reported a 21 per cent rise in traffic for 2006, declined to comment, but has been promoting a standalone plan involving the expansion of its regional jet fleet.
577;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-10T21:02:36Z;Northwest steps into Delta fight;;The battle for control of Delta Air Lines intensified on Wednesday as US Airways boosted its hostile offer by a quarter and Northwest Airlines emerged as a potential rival suitor for the third-largest US carrier.The offer by US Airways to Delta creditors on November 15 has triggered what one rival executive described as a “feeding frenzy” of exploratory discussions among the largest carriers.Although the formal decision over Delta’s fate lies with creditors of the bankrupt carrier, antitrust officials and the availability of finance are expected to determine the immediate shape of a sector recovering from five years of heavy losses.US Airways sought to accelerate the offer process by asking Delta creditors to back its call to start due diligence on the Atlanta-based airline. However, Delta has rejected the overtures in pursuit of a plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection as an independent carrier later in the year.Doug Parker, US Airways’ chairman and chief executive, told the FT the revised offer – which values Delta at about $10.2bn – was not intended to deter rival bids.However, US Airways’ advisers privately forecast that as many as three rival offers could emerge. The prospect of a shift in antitrust policy to allow large-scale mergers has seen United Airlines hold talks with Delta and Continental Airlines.Northwest Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta in September 2005, also has held talks with Delta officials after hiring strategic advisers last month.The discussions, reported in The Wall Street Journal, have included a potential combination after both carriers emerge from bankruptcy, according to people close to the situation.While Delta has said publicly that it would not seek a white knight buyer, the emergence of other suitors – including potential interest from private equity groups – has helped deflect attention from US Airways’ revised offer.Mr Parker had ruled out raising the offer, which stood at about $8.5bn. The sharp increase was intended to provide clarity for Delta creditors, who he said had been “struggling” in their assessment of the risks associated with the competing plans.Delta, which wants its plan to be reviewed by the bankruptcy court on February 7, said it would review the revised proposal, though it still had “significant doubts” about its viability.The new offer raised the cash component from $4bn to $5bn, and boosted the number of shares on offer from 78.5m to 89.5m, giving the Delta creditors 49 per cent of the enlarged company.US Airways has lined up $8.3bn in funding from Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.
578;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Airline consolidation;;It’s a dogfight. Doug Parker of US Airways remains on the tail of bankrupt rival Delta, with its new supercharged offer. Delta’s Jerry Grinstein is trying to dodge him with a plan to go it alone.Mr Parker on Wednesday upped his bid by 20 per cent to $10.2bn, almost half in cash. He hopes to force Delta’s creditors into action. US Airways’ credible-looking numbers for a combination leave Mr Grinstein’s solo plan looking short on value. But, with airlines, financial logic doesn’t always win the day. There are the usual public relations, antitrust and integration risks. Jobs would be lost, given overlapping operations. Some customers would protest. And airline mergers are tricky to pull off.To complicate matters further, Mr Grinstein and his colleagues are heavily invested in piloting Delta out of bankruptcy and stand to gain financially if they are successful. Among others with different agendas, the official creditors’ committee includes Boeing – which presumably does not want an Airbus customer buying Delta. That said, investors welcomed Mr Parker’s original offer in November and pushed Delta’s bonds higher still on Wednesday. This suggests there is a good chance creditors could push Delta into talks with US Airways instead of bowing to its stand-alone plan.US Airways is hoping to force the issue by setting a February 1 deadline. It wants creditors to postpone a court hearing scheduled for the next week on Delta management’s plan. Otherwise, a clear financial case could get smothered by airline industry sensitivities and the complexities of bankruptcy.But if US Airways succeeds, others could swoop in. For example, the networks of United or Northwest, itself in bankruptcy, overlap less with Delta’s, which could make a merger easier to sell. Either way, it is time for more airline consolidation.
579;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2007-01-08T14:26:36Z;US Airways strengthens Delta bid finance;;US Airways said on Monday that it had beefed up the financing for its unsolicited $8.6bn bid for Delta Air Lines in a move which could pave the way for an increased offer.The Phoenix-based carrier said Morgan Stanley will join Citigroup as joint underwriter for the proposed offer, which is being reviewed by Delta’s creditors alongside a standalone restructuring plan from the Atlanta-based airline.US Airways has maintained it will not increase the cash-and-stock offer outlined last October, but said in a statement that the $7.3bn financing commitment “has also been revised to provide significantly improved financial terms”.Delta, the third largest US carrier, is currently reviewing bids to provide it with funding to exit more than 18 months of bankruptcy protection in the second quarter of 2007. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have both been active in this segment, alongside JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.US Airways’ announcement comes amid pressure on US airline stocks following announcements from a number of carriers that the year-long surge in revenues is easing, leading some to forecast losses in the traditionally weak fourth calendar quarter.US Airways is offering $4bn in cash and 78.5m of its own shares for its larger rival, a combination that would create the world’s largest airline by revenues. However, it would also require antitrust clearance. A positive signal from regulators is expected to trigger further deal-making, with United and Continental closely monitoring the outcome.Delta’s unsecured creditors’ committee and an unofficial grouping of bondholders are both reviewing the competing bids, and Delta is seeking a court hearing next month to secure backing for its standalone plan, which currently lacks a cash component.Delta’s unsecured creditors last month hired former Continental chairman Gordon Bethune as an adviser to evaluate the competing claims.Mr Bethune was chairman and chief executive of Continental from 1994 until the end of 2004, and is credited with leading the revival of the company after two spells in bankruptcy protection.Mr Bethune, a former Boeing executive, currently chairs the parent of Aloha Airlines and is also on the board of Honeywell. Delta and US Airways are vying for the support of two-thirds of the nine-member official committee – and 50 per cent of the estimated $15bn in claims – needed to secure approval for their competing plans, which must also be cleared by the court.US Airways has made a detailed rebuttal of Delta’s standalone plan, and dismissed its estimates for valuation and financial performance as “unrealistic”.The carrier also sought to defuse concern that regulators would block or delay a combination of the third and fifth-largest US carriers. Delta rejected the US Airways bid last month, citing the likelihood of a lengthy regulatory review and citing a range of “flaws” with the cash and stock proposal.US Airways said last month that antitrust regulators could provide “substantive feedback in a matter of weeks” on its offer if Delta agreed to due diligence and allowed a formal review to begin.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, told the FT that his board would not agree to US Airways’ request to conduct due diligence even if, as many analysts expect, its smaller rival returns with a revised offer.
580;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-12-27T00:05:10Z;FL seeks talks with American Airlines;;An Icelandic investment group is to request a meeting with American Airlines’ management after disclosing on Tuesday that it had built a stake of almost 6 per cent in the parent of the world’s largest carrier by revenues.FL Group, which is best known for its investment in UK-based EasyJet, amassed the holding in AMR Corp over the past few weeks after identifying the Dallas-based group as its first big investment outside Europe.The listed Icelandic group has a strong track record as an opportunistic investor in the airline industry, and it is not planning any takeover bid for AMR, with federal law limiting overseas interest to 25 per cent of the voting rights in US carriers.“There are a number of macro things that we found positive [about the US industry],” said Hannes Smarason, FL Group’s chief executive, in an interview with the FT.The company has emerged as the third-largest shareholder in AMR at a time of unprecedented flux in the US airline industry, triggered by the hostile $8.3bn offer for Delta Air Lines by US Airways, its smaller rival.The bid has forced other carriers to review their strategic options and hold talks with rivals in case regulators allow consolidation among the six US network carriers. This has also pushed up share prices as the industry nears the end of its first profitable year since 2000. AMR’s share price has climbed 36 per cent this year while Continental’s stock has almost doubled and US Airways is up 49 per cent. AMR shares rose 1.5 per cent on Tuesday to close at $30.70, below the 52-week peak of $34.40.Mr Smarason said he believed consolidation would take place, though this was not the primary motivation for its investment, and AMR is its only US airline investment.“We think [American] have good revenue momentum, and they have one of the best brands,” said Mr Smarason.American’s management team has steered the carrier clear of the bankruptcy protection sought by almost all of its major rivals over the past five years.Mr Smarason said there were some strategic issues he would like to discuss with American’s management team, though declined to detail them ahead of a formal meeting. However, he viewed building on its revenue momentum as a key factor. AMR declined to comment.The listed Icelandic group’s 5.98 per cent stake in AMR – valued at $400m-plus – takes the share of airlines in its $3.4bn portfolio to 25 per cent.FL Group made a profit of $590m from the sale this year of its stakes in EasyJet and Icelandair, the country’s flag carrier. It also holds a 23 per cent stake in Finnair – a partner of American in the oneworld global alliance – and owns Denmark’s Sterling Airways.

Delta and US Airways are vying for the support of two-thirds of the nine-member official committee - and 50 per cent of the estimated $15bn in claims – needed to secure approval for their competing plans, which must also be cleared by the court.US Airways on Thursday launched a detailed rebuttal of Delta’s stand-alone plan, and dismissed its estimates for valuation and financial performance as “unrealistic”.The carrier also sought to defuse concern that regulators would block or delay a combination of the third and fifth-largest US carriers. Delta rejected the US Airways bid this week, citing the likelihood of a lengthy regulatory review and citing a range of “flaws” with the cash and stock proposal.US Airways on Thursday said that antitrust regulators could provide “substantive feedback in a matter of weeks” on its offer if Delta agreed to due diligence and allowed a formal review to begin.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, told the FT this week that his board would not agree to US Airways’ request to conduct due diligence even if, as many analysts expect, its smaller rival returns with a revised offer. ends

583;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta refuses to open books to rival;;The official committee representing creditors at Delta Air Lines on Wednesday backed the carrier’s decision to press head with its standalone restructuring plan but stressed it would continue to evaluate alternatives, including the hostile $8.3bn bid from US Airways.The two carriers are engaged in intense talks with the committee - and a second ad hoc group of claimants in the wake of the unsolicited bid which was formally rejected on Tuesday by Delta’s board.Delta has declined to open its books to its smaller rivals and has maintained that industry conditions still prevailed against any large-scale deals despite ongoing talks among a number of carriers. It unveiled its own reorganisation plan to emerge from more than 18 months of bankruptcy protection in the second quarter of next yearUS Airways made its offer direct creditors on November 15 after Delta management had twice rejected its approaches, and said it remains committed to the proposed deal despite potential regulatory and labour hurdles.The nine-member official creditors’ committee said in a brief statement that it “supported” Delta’s decision to file its proposed reorganisation plan, though a number of issues “remained open”.Sources close to the committee said those included any potential cash component in Delta’s payout to creditors. The plan filed on Tuesday was all in equity, while US Airways is offering a mix of cash and stock.“At the same time, the committee will continue to consider potential alternatives in order to maximise the ultimate recoveries for the unsecured creditors in the Delta bankruptcy,” said the statement in a clear reference to the US Airways’ offer and the potential for rival bids to emerge.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, told the FT this week that his board would not agree to US Airways’ request to conduct due diligence even if, as many analysts expect, its smaller rival returns with a revised offer.Mr Grinstein outlined a raft of “flaws” with the US Airways’ proposal, citing the likelihood of a lengthy regulatory review, opposition from labour and what he viewed as the poor strategic fit between the two airlines.He also remained cautious about the potential for deals involving any of the six large US networks, despite the emergence of talks between other carriers triggred by US Airways’ surprise move last month.Mr Grinstein presided over what is viewed as one of the few successful airline mergers – between Delta and Western in the late 1980s - and said cultural and regulatory barriers continued to tip against short-term consolidation. “I think it’s more complex [now] but some of the principles that applied then, apply now,” he said.His comments will be monitored by United, the US number two, which has made indicative approaches to Delta while holding tentative talks with Continental. Northwest, which filed for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta 15 months ago, is also viewed as a potential partner.Mr Grinstein said he hoped the “superior” terms of Delta’s plan would over-ride any political and regulatory opposition to rival merger plans.Delta plans to continue the recovery plan launched last year, which saw its domestic network shrunk in favour of more profitable international routes, alongside intense cost-cutting and efforts to revive the airline’s service levels.Ed Bastian, chief financial officer, said Delta continued to back a standalone plan despite continued interest from third-party investors offering cash, but had yet to finalise details of the potential payout to Delta’s $15bn in unsecured claims. He told the FT that it remained on good relations with both the official and unofficial committees - the latter includes a number of “new” creditors, likely to include hedge funds.Delta said the current restructuring plan would be entirely in equity, valuing the carrier at $8.4bn-$12bn when it emerged from bankruptcy and paying 63-80 per cent of claims.US Airways is offering $4bn in cash and 78.5m of its own shares to Delta creditors, who would control 45 per cent of what would become the world’s largest carrier by revenues. US Airways said it remained committed to the details of its merger plan, which it offered “significantly greater” value than Delta’s proposal.
584;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-12-19T19:23:10Z;Delta rejects US Airways merger plan;;Delta Air Lines formally rejected US Airways’ unsolicited merger plan on Tuesday and unveiled a standalone restructuring plan acknowledging interest from other potential investors.The third-largest US airline by revenues said it aimed to emerge from more than 18 months of bankruptcy protection in the second quarter of next year with a plan offering better value and more chances of success for its creditors than that unveiled by its smaller rival on November 15.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, cited a raft of “flaws” with US Airways’ $8.3bn offer and said the Delta board would not accede to a request for due diligence from its largest competitor.The creditors are being courted by both sides in a contest that has triggered consolidation talks among rivals including United and Continental, with the industry split about the likelihood of deals between big carriers securing regulatory approval.US Airways has already conceded that a hostile bid is unlikely to succeed, and Mr Grinstein left little doubt about strains with US Airways’ executives as the two sides present their rival proposals. “US Airways’ proposal is not in the best interest of Delta and its creditors,” said Mr Grinstein on a call with analysts, citing a raft of regulatory, labour and structural challenges faced by the hostile proposal. US Airways made its cash and stock offer direct to creditors after twice being rebuffed by Delta.Mr Grinstein said any merger would face at least 12 months of regulatory review, a delay that could “unwind all the progress made” in reversing losses at Delta through cutting costs and refocusing its fleet towards more profitable routes.His irritation at the proposal from Doug Parker, his opposite number at US Airways, was evident as he discussed the impact of saddling what would be the world’s largest airline by revenues with higher debt.Executives at other carriers are more sanguine about the chances of regulatory clearance for big deals, citing the expansion of low-cost rivals such as Southwest and the need to create sustainable profitability for a business that has lost more than $40bn over the past five years.But Mr Grinstein’s appeal to creditors also included what he viewed as better terms that would give Delta an equity value of $8.4bn-$12bn when it emerged from bankruptcy and paid creditors from 63-80 per cent of the $15bn in outstanding claims.This compares with the 15-cent level of claims when it filed for protection on September 14 2005. US Airways is offering $4bn in cash and 78.5m of its own shares for Delta, a proposal worth $8bn when first made, which climbed to almost $9bn before the carrier’s share price retreated.Delta’s initial plan does not include a cash component, though the carrier said this would be reviewed. “We’ve received interest from others interested in investing cash into the business,” added Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief financial officer, though reiterated the commitment to go it alone without a white knight or strategic investor.Private equity groups have revived their interest in the airline industry in recent weeks – notably the buyout of Australia’s Qantas– after moving to monetize investments made over the past three years.Delta’s restructuring plan continues the efforts already made by Mr Grinstein and his team, cutting costs and boosting revenues and service levels in a bid to reverse losses of more than $10bn over the past four years. The carrier expects to lose about $500m this year, despite higher fuel costs, and return to profitability in 2008.US Airways on Tuesday said it remained committed to the details of its merger plan, which it said offered “significantly greater” value than Delta’s proposal.
585;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-12-13T19:41:07Z;Airline consolidation;;Passengers may have been horrified to learn of the traces of polonium 210 found recently on commercial aircraft, but many fund managers have viewed airlines as radioactive for years. Plagued by overcapacity and cyclicality, they have been the best example of an industry destined to make sub-economic returns.Might this change? United Airlines and Continental Airlines, America’s second and fourth biggest carriers respectively, are in merger talks. This follows US Airways’ $8bn hostile bid for Delta and, in Europe, Ryanair’s tilt at Aer Lingus. In Australia, Macquarie Bank’s attempt at a leveraged buy-out of Qantas suggests healthy profits are no longer treated as a blip.The big picture still looks grim. According to the International Air Transport Association, global industry operating profits will be $10bn in 2006, representing a 2 per cent margin and a 4 per cent lease-adjusted post-tax return on invested capital (ROIC). Since the start of 2003, industry revenues have risen by $124bn, or a third, but, incredibly, 90 per cent of this boost has been consumed by higher costs, mainly fuel.If both US deals occurred, returns there would probably leap. The top three carriers’ revenue market shares would rise from 52 per cent to 73 per cent. Potential synergies from cutting capacity and costs are big, if high risk. US Airways, which merged with America West in 2005, thinks a Delta combination would yield, within two years, annual benefits equivalent to 6 per cent of combined sales. If a United and Continental deal also achieved this level, the overall benefit would be $3.4bn, taking US 2006 ROIC from 4 per cent to 6 per cent.Returns in Asia are now close to the cost of capital. In Europe, they are nowhere near it. Carriers must legally retain national identities, making it hard to integrate businesses fully. Synergies were only 2 per cent of sales after two years at Air France-KLM. An “open skies” agreement, which could change this, looks some way off. Given that the economic and aircraft order cycles are near peaks, fund managers should keep their Geiger counters handy.
586;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;AirTran $290m offer for Midwest rejected;;AirTran on Wednesday launched an unsolicited offer for rival Midwest Airlines in a move which highlights the growing pains facing US low-cost carriers following three years of rapid expansion. The bid, valuing Midwest at around $290m, or a $11.25 a share in cash and stock, has been rebuffed by Midwest’s board.Florida-based AirTran has been pursuing Midwest for a year, pre-dating the recent frenzy of proposed deal-making among the larger network carriers triggered by US Airways’ hostile bid for Delta Air Lines.The proposed deal represents a further evolution in the low-cost model pioneered by Southwest Airlines, which has seen carriers such as AirTran and JetBlue focus on point-to-point services, eschewing deals and alliances with other carriers.AirTran recently announced a marketing deal with Denver-based Frontier Airlines, and wants to add Midwest’s network in the north and central US to its existing focus on the south-east from its Atlanta hub.Midwest operates a profitable network from its hubs at Milwaukee and Kansas City, focusing on higher-yield business passengers in a region with relatively little penetration by other low-cost carriers. AirTran is one of the few low-cost operators to offer business-class service on its flights.Joe Leonard, AirTran’s chairman and chief executive, told analysts on Wednesday that the proposal represented a unique opportunity to create a new national airline with combined annual revenues of $3bn. “It’s a very, very strong strategic combination,” he said, pointing to the similar cost structures, cultures and aircraft fleets of the two carriers. “[And] the network balances out north-south, east-west.”Mr Leonard said the approach was “unsolicited, yet friendly”, and hoped Midwest would reconsider the offer, which could be raised if due diligence uncovered further value. The proposed bid represents a 37 per cent premium to Midwest’s 30-day average closing price.AirTran, JetBlue and others have trimmed their growth plans in recent weeks, in part because of increased competition from larger rivals which have narrowed the operating cost gap between the market segments. However, analysts have also questioned how much room there was for the low-cost operators to expand without upsetting the delicate balance between supply and demand which has returned some pricing power to the industry.Both carriers operate Boeing 717 aircraft, while AirTran has 60 more 737s on order to join its existing fleet of 40, which it said would be used to replace Midwest’s less fuel-efficient MD-80s.
587;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-12-13T12:50:36Z;United in merger talks with Continental;;United Airlines is pursuing exploratory merger talks with Continental Airlines, the FT has learned, amid what one executive called “a feeding frenzy” of potential consolidation among US carriers.Glenn Tilton, United’s chairman and chief executive, has been the most outspoken proponent of the need for deals to aid the recovery of the domestic industry, a process fired into life by US Airways’ unsolicited bid for Delta Air Lines.United and Continental are also looking at alternative tie-ups, according to people with knowledge of the discussions, but a combination of the second and fourth-largest US carriers has long been viewed as the most complementary in terms of their route networks, fleet and cost structures.Continental recently overtook Northwest Airlines as the fourth-largest US carrier by revenue, and a combination with United would create a group with pro forma sales of $32.7bn, making it by far the largest airline in the world.However, people close to the discussions stressed that no deal is imminent amid a merry-go-round of talks between all of the major carriers. “Everybody is doing something at the last moment,” said one executive.US Airways’ surprise move for Delta has forced executives at rival carriers to re-examine the competitive and regulatory landscape in the US, six years after antitrust officials blocked a potential round of deals between the six remaining network airlines, including United’s bid for US Airways and American Airlines' approach to Northwest.The $8.8bn offer to Delta’s creditors – the airline filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2005 – could attract as many as three counter-offers, according to industry financiers, with United, Northwest and Continental all seen as potential candidates.The potential deal-making has also extended to the low-cost sector, with AirTran launching a hostile $290m offer on Wednesday for Milwaukeee-based Midwest Air, which operates business class-focused services throughout the central US.Officials at the major carriers declined to comment on the manoeuvring, though all remain cautious about the chances of completing any of the proposed transactions because of the complexities which have dogged US airline mergers for decades.The strong voice of labour in the highly-specialised and unionised US airline industry is still viewed as the major barrier to near-term consolidation. Delta’s pilots will hold a rally on Wednesday to voice their opposition to the US Airways’ bid, backed by senior Congressional figures.Continental and American are the only two major carriers to avoid a spell in bankruptcy protection during the current industry downturn.Any deal involving the two Texas-based carriers would heighten tensions with staff after years of costs cuts to maintain competitiveness with rivals which have used the bankruptcy process to restructure.Larry Kellner, Continental’s chairman and chief executive, has made it clear in recent weeks that he would prefer an independent future for the Houston-based carrier, but that he is also aware that an evolving industry landscape could leave it vulnerable to the emergence of new, larger rivals.United emerged from more than three years of bankruptcy protection last February, but analysts still believe it still has to cut more costs to remain competitive. The carrier has successfully pursued a focus on premium passengers – a strategy shared with Continental – but remains dogged by a simmering dispute with pilots unhappy at a management compensation scheme.John Prater, a Continental captain who will take over as president of the Air Line Pilots Association in January, has also signalled a more activist approach by labour, which could impact any merger plans.“After five years of concessionary bargaining, lost pensions, and battered work rules, our pilots are primed to take offensive action,” he said following his election in October over an incumbent seen by analysts as more moderate. “This may mean a return to the hard-nosed tactics of earlier years and a grassroots mobilisation of each and every one of our members.”

All the large carriers have been closely monitoring how to respond to the move.Northwest, which like Delta is operating under bankruptcy protection, is considered a leading candidate to participate in the consolidation of the industry, along with United Airlines, which recently hired bankers at Goldman Sachs to advise it.Northwest has chosen Evercore, the New York-based boutique bank run by Roger Altman, a former senior Treasury official, to study its options. In a court filing, Northwest specifically refers to the possibility of an “M&A transaction” as an outcome of the process.Some observers believe that Northwest could bid for Delta, which is much larger, with the backing of a private equity group.Delta has said it would not seek a white knight to defend itself against US Airways’ offer.The bankers at Evercore that will be working with Northwest are Mr Altman and William Hiltz, who advised on the reorganisation of Continental Airlines in the early 1990s but is otherwise best known as an energy banker. Also on the deal team is David Ying, co-head of the firm’s restructuring business.“Evercore’s work will be focused on broad strategic alternatives in the airline industry generally and is not related to aircraft financing, the debtor’s finances or other day-to-day restructuring work being performed by Seabury [a management consulting adviser]”, Northwest said in a filing.Evercore will receive an upfront fee of $275,000, a monthly retainer of $75,000, a $3m fee when Northwest emerges from bankruptcy and $2m if it closes an “M&A transaction”.US Airways claimed on Thursday that its proposed merger with Delta would create “the most profitable airline in the world”, as it provided fresh details on the unsolicited $8.7bn bid launched last month.The carrier intensified its pitch to win support from Delta creditors and regulators for a deal that would create the largest US airline, despite opposition from management and employees at its Atlanta-based target.Delta plans to file its standalone restructuring plans with a US bankruptcy court next week, continuing a strategy that would be markedly different from that proposed on Wednesday by Scott Kirby, president of US Airways.The takeover plan is based on securing $1.65bn in synergies, with $935m of this coming from combining and trimming the networks of the third and fifth-largest US carriers.

Delta is turning JFK into a hub to feed its expanding international network in competition with Continental’s routes from nearby Newark airport.It would also downgrade its Charlotte hub in favour of feeding more traffic through Delta’s Atlanta base, and back Delta’s Cincinnati operation over its Pittsburgh business.US Airways has said it would cut combined capacity by 10 per cent in the two carrier’s south-east strongholds, trimming the aircraft fleet.That part of the plan has infuriated pilots at Delta, who have rejected the merger plan because of potential job cuts. US Airways said it would honour the pilots’ existing contract.Delta management is being asked to open its books to allow US Airways to conduct due diligence.The takeover battle is being closely watched by rivals, because any go-ahead from antitrust authorities is expected to trigger a merry-go-round of attempted deal-making between the largest US airlines.US Airways believes that the rise of low-cost rivals such as Southwest will lead regulators to reverse their previous opposition to large-scale mergers in the industry.Delta has said it will not seek a white knight to defend itself against US Airways’ offer, which was pitched directly to its creditors after management twice rejected overtures from Doug Parker, the Phoenix-based carrier’s chairman.However, there is growing speculation that another airline could step in with a counterbid in partnership with a private-equity group.
590;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Small fry stir corporate waters;;Chief executives are increasingly inclined to plot bids for companies that are far bigger than their own, thanks to the availability of cheap debt and creative structures devised by investment banks.In recent weeks smaller companies in several sectors, surprising many investors with their audacity, have made bids for larger rivals that they could not have pursued in earlier times.The moves, mainly made in the US, highlight how the world of debt-fuelled dealmaking has expanded from its traditional practitioners in the private equity industry.Now it also includes publicly traded companies with aggressive mergers and acquisitions strategies.Last week Penn National Gaming, a casino and racetrack owner worth $3.3bn in market value and $1.4bn in annual revenues, entered discussions to buy Harrah’s Entertainment, the largest US casino operator, with a market value of $14.7bn.The move by Penn came on the heels of Freeport-McMoRan’s $26bn deal to buy Phelps Dodge and create the world’s largest publicly traded copper miner. Freeport is not even half the size of Phelps.November also saw US Airways, which has a market value of $5bn, make an $8bn bid to take over rival Delta Air Lines, which is still in bankruptcy.Outside the US, Corus, the UK steel group, is being courted by two smaller rivals in terms of production – Tata Steel of India and CSN of Brazil.Investment banks are fuelling these more audacious bids by writing the same big financing cheques with generous lending terms to corporate clients that they have been offering private equity firms in recent years.Participating in Penn’s talks to buy Harrah’s are hedge fund DE Shaw as well as Lehman Brothers and Wachovia, which could help finance the deal and provide some of the equity.JPMorgan is funding Freeport’s takeover of Phelps with an $18bn financing package, while Citigroup is backing US Airways in its hostile bid for Delta.Jim Morphy, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York corporate law firm, says the “aspirational level” of deals has increased with the increase in funding sources.But he warns: “It’s still tough for the minnow to swallow the whale, especially if the minnow is a public company.“The strategic benefits have to be weighed against the combined debt load in a way that benefits the minnow’s stockholders.”
591;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-23T12:53:47Z;Air France-KLM in early talks with Alitalia;;Air France-KLM is in exploratory talks with Alitalia that could lead to an eventual takeover of the loss-making, partly state-owned Italian flag carrier.Prospects for closer co-operation between Alitalia and Air France will figure prominently in talks on Friday between Romano Prodi, Italian prime minister, and president Jacques Chirac of France in the Italian city of Lucca.Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chairman and chief executive of Air France KLM, the world’s biggest airline by turnover, said on Thursday that at the request of Alitalia the group was examining whether the “prerequisites” yet existed for opening formal negotiations.He said that Air France KLM had to be satisfied that the Italian airline was financially stable, that it shared a common strategic vision with the Franco-Dutch group and that significant synergies could be achieved.The Air France KLM share price fell heavily after the statement, closing €2.11, or 6.5 per cent lower, at €30.14 in spite of the group announcing higher first-half profits.An eventual acquisition of Alitalia would further enhance the Air France KLM group’s position as the leading European carrier, but any deal would still face formidable obstacles. “It [Alitalia] needs to be restructured, before we get involved,” said Mr Spinetta on Thursday.When Air France announced the takeover of KLM in late 2003, it said Alitalia could also eventually become part of the enlarged group but any such move has since been held up by the parlous financial performance of the Italian carrier, which is still making heavy losses in spite of a series of Italian state-led rescue attempts.Alitalia is already a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance led by Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines of the US, and Air France-KLM and Alitalia have held symbolic 2 per cent cross-shareholdings in each other and have had membership of each other’s boards since 2003. They also operate in an alliance on the main trunk routes between France and Italy.Alitalia said that “exploratory exchanges” were under way with Air France KLM. The talks were “aimed at finding satisfactory answers to some strategic issues” and were “still at an early stage and not exclusive”.News of the talks came as Air France-KLM reported a 30.5 per cent increase in operating profits from €750m to €979m ($1.27bn) in the first half, although operating profits rose by only 7.8 per cent in the second quarter to €568mMr Spinetta, who led the first takeover of a European flag carrier three years ago with the acquisition of KLM, said the deal had shown that airline mergers could create value.“Consolidation is playing a major role in improving the economic performance of European carriers,” he said.The Air France KLM lead has since been followed by last year’s agreement for Germany’s Lufthansa to take over Swiss, and Mr Spinetta said that the process of consolidation in Europe was “not yet complete”.In the most recent move Ireland’s Ryanair, the leading European low cost carrier, last month launched a €1.48bn hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival.Ryanair has built a 19.2 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, but the bid appears to be foundering in the face of strong opposition by shareholders holding around 46 per cent of the Aer Lingus equity, including the Irish government with 25.4 per cent and the employee share ownership trust with 12.6 per cent.
592;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-23T00:30:18Z;Qantas finance lined up from bank trio;;Texas Pacific Group and Macquarie Bank have lined up financing from a trio of investment banks for an A$11bn ($8.5bn, €6.6bn, £4.5bn) bid to take Qantas, the Australian airline, private in one of the biggest aviation deals.Qantas and Macquarie, the acquisitive Australian financial services group, were forced to reveal the talks on Wednesday after speculation about a buyout caused the Sydney-based carrier’s shares to jump more than 3 per cent on Tuesday.Macquarie said any proposal would be conditional upon the support of the Qantas board and both sides emphasised that the discussions were at an early stage with the airline calling the approach “confidential and incomplete”.But people close to the situation said both the TPG/Macquarie consortium and Qantas were “deadly serious” about clinching a deal with the potential buyers believing Qantas’s strong cash flow was ideal for a leveraged bid.The airline has dominated the Australian market since the 2001 collapse of rival Ansett and under Geoff Dixon, chief executive, had maintained a high level of profitability and steady earnings growth until issuing a rare profits warning this year.“There are many political hurdles to negotiate but the Qantas board is willing to take this seriously. This is no Coles Myer,” said one person familiar with details of the deal, referring to the Australian retailer whose board recently fought off an unsolicited $14bn bid from a private equity consortium.The TPG/Macquarie consortium is believed to be considering a bid in the A$5.20 to A$5.50 range, valuing Qantas at up to A$10.9bn. The potential buyers have lined up bid financing from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Credit Suisse. Qantas is being advised by UBS and Carnegie Wylie. The advisers declined to comment on Wednesday.A buyout deal would give David Bonderman, TPG’s founding partner and a veteran investor in the global airline sector, a powerful platform for further expansion into Asia, the industry’s fastest growing market. Mr Bonderman is understood to have given the go-ahead for an approach to Qantas during a visit to Australia this month, which included a trip to the Melbourne Cup horse race.A takeover of Qantas would be one of the highest profile private equity deals of recent times and by far the biggest such deal in Australia. It follows both a spate of buyouts in Australia, a market that until recently lagged behind others in attracting private equity, and renewed consolidation in the global aviation sector.US Airways last week unveiled a $8bn bid for Delta Air Lines, while last month Ryanair, the Irish low cost carrier chaired by Mr Bonderman, made a tilt at Aer Lingus.Any deal would have to comply with ownership limits on Qantas, a strategic company that has 37,000 employees and more than a 60 per cent share of Australia’s domestic aviation market. The government reiterated on Wednesday that it had no intention of lifting its 49.9 per cent cap on foreign ownership.“I can confidently predict that you will never see the kangaroo moved off the tail of Qantas aircraft,” said Mark Vaile, deputy prime minister.A Qantas deal would be one of the largest in which Macquarie, the world’s biggest private infrastructure operator, has been involved and would add to its other investments in the aviation sector, including Sydney airport and GATX, the aircraft leasing group.An investment in an airline as successful as Qantas would also mark a new departure for Mr Bonderman, a turnround specialist.“This deal would be very different to what [TPG] has done before,” said Matthew Crowe, at JPMorgan in Sydney.Qantas shares have in recent years been held back by the uncertainties facing airlines globally and underperformed local benchmarks but have risen by more than a third since August largely due to falling oil prices.Qantas shares jumped 15 per cent to close at A$5.00 on Wednesday.
593;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-21T00:27:51Z;Airline consolidation still grounded;;"The $8.7bn hostile bid by US Airways for Delta Air Lines last week has only served to underline how mergers and acquisitions activity in the airline sector is still largely bound by national or regional boundaries.The consolidation of the global airline industry remains on hold, constrained by an arcane regulatory system dating from the mid-1940s, in spite of the gradual progress that is being made in individual regions around the world to reduce fragmentation.In the US, America West succeeded last year in taking over US Airways, albeit largely because the latter was again stranded in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.In Europe, Air France succeeded in 2004 in taking over KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, although the airlines were forced to adopt a cumbersome structure providing a figleaf semblance of KLM remaining ultimately under Dutch national control to allow the deal to go ahead.Last year, Germany’s Lufthansa reached agreement on the takeover of Swiss International Air Lines, the Swiss carrier. But once again the deal was complicated by rules governing international traffic rights.In the Asia-Pacific region, the Japanese airline industry was consolidated in 2002 through the takeover of Japan Air System by Japan Airlines, and this year has seen the alignment of Cathay Pacific, the de facto Hong Kong flag carrier, and Air China.As yet, however, the consolidation process has not managed to break out of the national-regional straitjacket.The international aviation industry remains an unusual business. The normal rules of global consolidation do not yet apply and cross-border acquisitions have been almost excluded by a web of regulations dating from the Chicago Convention of 1944.This largely ties bilateral traffic rights between two countries to their respective national carriers. The system is underpinned in most cases by rules limiting foreign ownership of airlines to minority stakes.The creation of the single market within the European Union has removed any ownership obstacles to takeovers within the EU, as long as the airlines are flying on intra-European routes.If the airlines are flying on long-haul routes, however, where traffic rights are a key to their operations, any change of ownership beyond national boundaries remains a fraught issue.It had been hoped that progress would be made in breaking down some of these barriers by the negotiations between the US and the EU to create an open aviation area across the North Atlantic.Problems in Washington forced these ambitions to be reduced to a more traditional template of a liberalised “open skies” deal, and an agreement was initialled a year ago.This deal, if enacted, would mean that the US would accept the national designation of an “EU carrier”, meaning, for example, that a change from Dutch to French ownership would not jeopardise a Dutch carrier’s traffic rights on its US routes.But the US-EU deal to liberalise air services has stalled this year as European member states have been forced to wait for the final wording of a US proposal to ease slightly its interpretation of what influence a foreign carrier can exercise in a US airline.A further blow to hopes for the reform was dealt by the recent US elections. The new Democratic leadership in Congress has already called for a rethink of the plans to give overseas investors more say in the running of US airlines.The tentative transatlantic “open skies” pact had already met fierce opposition in Congress to the parallel investment reforms, led by James Oberstar, the ranking Democrat on the House transportation and infrastructure committee.Mr Oberstar is set to take over the chairmanship of the committee in January, and has reaffirmed his opposition in the wake of the election to the proposed changes first detailed by the US administration a year ago.The inability to consolidate across borders gave birth a few years ago to the system of global airline marketing alliances, now dominated by three groupings – Star, led by Lufthansa and United Airlines; SkyTeam led by Air France-KLM and Delta ; and Oneworld, led by British Airways and American Airlines.The alliances are a poor substitute for real consolidation, however, and they remain fragile and vulnerable to changes of ownership within the various regions.Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, says that “after 60 years change is long overdue”. He says: “The flags on the tails of our aircraft are so heavy they are sinking our industry. It prevents meaningful consolidation and it perpetuates inefficiency. The only way to be successful is to run the industry as a real business. Who cares who owns an airline as long as markets are served with safe operations?” The truth is that too many vested interests do still care. And they are blocking the road to reform."

595;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-19T22:06:42Z;Delta rules out seeking a white knight;;Delta Air Lines has ruled out seeking a white knight in favour of filing its own restructuring plan next month to fend off the hostile $8.7bn merger proposal from US Airways.Executives at the third-largest US airline have highlighted the execution risks of the US Airways’ plan revealed last week, and insist it will progress with the exclusive right to reorganise and exit almost two years of bankruptcy protection in mid-2007 as a stand-alone carrier.“We’ll come out with a strong plan [in mid-December] that our creditors will view with much more confidence and certainty [than US Airways’],” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief financial officer, in an interview with the FT.The unfolding takeover battle is being closely watched in an industry emerging from five years of heavy losses, and any positive signals from antitrust regulators could lead to efforts to combine other large carriers such as American, United and Northwest.Mr Bastian declined to outline details of the Delta proposal, but said there were “no plans” to solicit a white knight or strengthen its balance sheet with capital from a stronger carrier such as Air France KLM, its partner in the SkyTeam alliance.He said Delta was focused on talks with key creditors such as the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which assumed some of Delta’s terminated employee plan, and on exit financing. “We are in deep discussions with a number of lenders who are anxious to finance our plan,” said Mr Bastian.US Airways made its proposal directly to creditors after Delta rebuffed merger talks, and has seen the indicative value of the cash-and-stock rise 8 per cent since the November 15 announcement.The airline and its advisers, Citigroup and Skadden Arps, hope to meet Delta creditors this week. They maintain Delta’s exclusivity – which runs until February 15 next year – is a “red herring” as the airline and its nine-strong creditors’ committee have a fiduciary duty to advance the best plan. Mr Bastian insisted Delta would exercise its right, although creditors would be free to consider alternatives when its term expires.US Airways said its offer was superior because of the $1.65bn in synergies released by a merger creating the largest US carrier, and points to its management track record in creating the airline from last year’s combination of America West and the old US Airways.The airline on Friday sought to quell concerns that any deal would be struck down by antitrust officials, although Delta and its advisers – Blackstone, Giuliani Capital and Davis, Polk & Wardwell – said regulatory issues were a substantial challenge.“There is significant transaction risk due to the degree of overlap,” said Mr Bastian, a leading internal candidate to succeed Gerald Grinstein when he steps down next year as Delta’s chief executive. “They are our largest competitor.”
596;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-17T21:38:21Z;Wall St rallies as earnings season winds down;;It was a good week for big and small cap stocks as the earnings season began winding down and several blockbuster deals and new listings ignited bursts of activity.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the small cap Russell 2000 set record highs while the S&P 500 ultimately closed above the 1,400 threshold for the first time since November 2000.Softer inflation data, and moderating growth figures suggest the Federal Reserve is engineering a soft landing for the economy in 2007, a boon for equities.Analysts said investors who had previously shunned stocks were now chasing performance before the end of the year. “There are people who were offside and they are now trying to catch up,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “Stocks have the potential to push higher with the S&P looking at 1,430 to 1,440.”Boosting activity on Friday was the blockbuster debut of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after the energy exchange listed at $59 a share and briefly soared 156.4 per cent to a high of $151.26. In mid-afternoon trade in New York, it was trading at $132.99, a gain of 125.4 per cent on the day.Another new listing was KBR, a unit of Halliburton, which gained 29.1 per cent to $21.95 after a debut at $17 a share. Shares in Hertz listed at $15 and were up 4.4 per cent at $15.66.Shares in US Steel, surged 11.4 per cent on Friday amid talk of further global consolidation. Shares were 6.1 per cent higher for the week at $70.57.Consolidation among airlines was another talking point. US Airways launched an $8bn unsolicited cash and stock offer for Delta Air Lines, which is in bankruptcy protection. Shares in US Airways hit a 52-week high of $62.57 and were up 20.6 per cent at $59.45. The American Stock Exchange airline index notched a 52-week high of 62.04 and was 7.9 per cent higher at 60.03.The Dow Jones Transportation Average index led broader indices and was 2.4 per cent higher for the week. “It is unlikely only one airline merger will be proposed. Given the potential economies of scale, we believe that no airline wants to be left as a niche carrier,” noted UBS.Other airline shares rose sharply, including Continental, up 16.7 per cent at $42.49. JetBlue, up 9.9 per cent to $14.58, and AirTran, which gained 26.3 per cent to $13.03, helped in part by upgrades.Radio station operator Clear Channel Communications agreed to a $19bn purchase at a share price of $37.60 by a consortium of private equity firms. Its shares were 0.7 per cent higher for the week at $35.22.Magazine publisher Readers Digest rose 11.4 per cent to $16.89 after it agreed to be acquired by an investor group led by Ripplewood Holdings in a $2.4bn deal (including assumption of debt).Gene-testing technology company Illumina announced it would buy Solexa in a $600m stock deal. Solexa shares gained 33.9 per cent to $12.99 while Illumina fell 8.4 per cent to $40.33.Shares in Black & Decker jumped 5.2 per cent to $88.06 after activist investor Bill Ackman disclosed he had bought a 1.9 per cent stake.Shares in Dell endured a mixed week and closed up 0.5 per cent at $25.02.After an upgrade from Deutsche early in the week, the company held back its third-quarter results as the Securities and Exchange Commission widened its probe into the computer manufacturer’s accounting.Despite posting a 51 per cent fall in fiscal fourth-quarter profit, homebuilder DR Horton still beat consensus forecasts and its shares rallied 11.7 per cent to $25.10.The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 5.7 per cent for the week after Citigroup upgraded the sector. Intel rose 7.4 per cent to $22.10, boosted in part by Citigroup adding the stock to its recommended list.Vanda Pharmaceuticals rose 45.7 per cent to $14.88, buoyed by its experimental insomnia drug proving effective in trials.Boeing gained 4.6 per cent to $89.52 on reports it may soon receive $10bn in new aircraft sales. At the close in New York on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent for the week at 1,401.2, the Dow had gained 1.9 per cent to a record close of 12,342.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.3 per cent firmer at 2,445.86.The Amex Broker/Dealer index rose 3.1 per cent, and set a new 52-week high at 242.99.
597;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-17T19:02:48Z;Market Overview: Weaker oil spurs US gains;;"Benign economic data, falling oil prices and a positive flow of corporate news helped US stocks power ahead this week, although equity markets elsewhere were far less sanguine.Even grim news on the housing market on Friday failed to dent hopes that the US economy was heading for a soft landing.“This week has been a win-win scenario for the markets; inflation easing, oil dropping to one-year lows, good retailer earnings and plenty of M&A activity have all combined to create a bullish mix for the markets,” said Martin Slaney, at GFT Global Markets. “Right now it’s difficult to see where the bad news could come from to induce the pull-back many analysts are saying is overdue.”There was certainly only a muted impact from data showing that US housing starts had tumbled 14.6 per cent in October to their lowest level for six years.The decline was “a sharp poke in the eye for those who argued that September’s jump in starts was a signal that the housing crunch is coming to an end”, said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.But the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an opening decline to record yet another new all-time peak, and closed at a new record high, and was up 1.9 per cent over the week.The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3 per cent over the week, touching a 5½-year high in the process, while the S&P 500 touched a six-year peak and closed above the 1,400 threshold, gaining 1.5 per cent.Technical strategists said a close above the 1,400 level for the S&P index would send a very bullish signal to investors.Merger activity, including an $8bn offer for Delta Air Lines and the $18.8bn private equity purchase of Clear Channel Communications, underpinned the strength in the US. The bullish mood was enhanced by an extremely strong stock market debut for shares in Nymex, the US energy exchange, on Friday.Traders said the fact that both the Dow and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks had hit record highs indicated the breadth of the equity market’s strength.The equity gains came as the Vix volatility index – described as Wall Street’s fear gauge – dropped to its lowest since July last year and looked likely to test its all-time closing low struck in January 1994.A recent rally in European stocks ran out of steam, in spite of some positive earnings reports and talk of a possible bid for Volkswagen, the carmaker. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended the week down
0.1 per cent, after touching a fresh 5½ year high earlier in the week.In Tokyo, strong third-quarter Japanese gross domestic product data provided only a temporary fillip for the stock market, and the Nikkei 225 ended the week with a loss of 0.1 per cent.Ian Harwood, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said that while the growth data had been surprisingly strong, the past few months’ real economy news flow had tended to disappoint.“Looking ahead, we expect such negative surprises to persist as exports and capital spending slow, inventory corrects and consumer spending fails to revive,” he said.But other Asian markets put in more positive performances, with Hong Kong, Singapore and Mumbai all setting record highs.A steady slide in oil prices provided support for equities through the week. Benchmark US crude futures fell below $56 a barrel, their lowest since mid-2005 as funds rushed to sell amid forecasts for a mild winter on the east coast.Treasuries had a volatile week as some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials countered the largely bond-friendly data. Late on Friday, the yield on 10-year paper was up 3 basis points on the week, in spite of sliding nearly 7bp on Friday as the US housing data rekindled talk of an early cut in US interest rates.The dollar held firm for much of the week but succumbed to selling on Friday as worries about the US economic slowdown were exacerbated by rumours that a large hedge fund was in trouble."
598;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Delta looks to block US Airways bid;;Delta Air Linesi could accelerate its planned exit from bankruptcy and sweeten the terms offered to creditors to thwart the unsolicited $8.8bn offer proposed by US Airways, according to people close to the carrier.US Airways’ efforts to create the largest US airline by revenues is being closely watched by an industry viewed as ripe for consolidation after five years of heavy losses.Delta declined to comment on its planned defence but reiterated its intention to remain independent by highlighting the protection afforded by the new US bankruptcy code and marshalling political support against any takeover.The airline also fired the opening salvo in what experts expect to be a protracted battle by announcing plans to launch its first service from New York to US Airways’ base in Tempe, Arizona.Delta said the route had been planned for some time but the announcement deftly chips away at US Airways’ assertion that competition would not be reduced by the planned merger.JetBlue is currently the lone competitor on the route to US Airways, which plans to eliminate any overlaps with Delta.US Airways admitted that it had a narrow window of opportunity to secure a deal as it would lose half of its forecast $1.65bn in synergies if a transaction is not consummated before Delta leaves Chapter 11.The bankruptcy code gives companies more freedom to reject contracts and secure favourable deals.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, on Thursday told employees that it remained committed to emerging as an independent entity in the first half of next year.Bankers suggested Delta might look to accelerate its planned exit to narrow US Airways’ window even further and perhaps sweeten the current terms expected to provide creditors with more than the 40-45 per cent of the carrier’s equity on exit.US Airways has championed the premium offered by its proposal, appealing directly to Delta’s unsecured creditors, represented by a nine-strong committee whose members include Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, the airline’s pilots and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which inherited obligations terminated by the airline earlier this year.One complicating factor could be the presence on the creditors’ committee of Coca-Cola that, like Delta, is headquartered in Atlanta.The companies are considered twin pillars of the city’s business community and Coca-Cola could face pressure from civic leaders to use its influence to thwart the deal.
599;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-16T01:09:19Z;US Airways presses Delta over $8bn offer;;US Airways on Wednesday insisted that Delta Air Lines’ management would be forced to consider its $8bn offer to create the biggest US airline by revenues, in spite of its rival’s pledge to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent company.Doug Parker, US Airways chairman and chief executive, launched his second effort in 18 months to buy a bankrupt carrier and push an enlarged US Airways into the global airline elite.However, Delta quickly repeated its opposition to the move after rebuffing an approach this year, forcing US Airways to appeal directly to its unsecured creditors.Mr Parker insisted that Delta’s executives would be forced to hold talks as the premium offered to creditors was superior to their existing plan.“We have put a proposal to them that would be better than anything else, certainly their own plan [and as a result] we will get management support,” Mr Parker said in an interview with the Financial Times.Gerald Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, has rebuffed approaches from US Airways and United in favour of restructuring the carrier to leave bankruptcy next year, when he plans to step down.Mr Grinstein favours leveraging Delta’s domestic strength in Atlanta and New York to expand its international services after restructuring to give it costs a quarter below rivals such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.“Jerry has enormous credibility with the Delta employees, [and] labour integration is essential to the success of these things,” said Michael E. Levine, distinguished research scholar at the New York University School of Law.US Airways’ cash and stock proposal represents a 25 per cent premium over the pre-announcement value of Delta creditors’ claims, which rose more than 40 per cent on Wednesday as US Airways’ own stock price climbed 15 per cent to a record $58.42.Mr Parker said there was “a unique opportunity” to combine networks viewed by analysts as complementary.Mr Parker maintained that the rise of low-cost carriers in the US meant there would be no antitrust issues with the proposed takeover. He intends to close the deal by mid-2007 when Delta aims to emerge from the bankruptcy protection it sought in September last year. The US justice department blocked an attempt by United to acquire the old US Airways in 2000 on competition grounds, scuppering another proposed combination between American and Northwest.“There’s much less concern [now] with the DoJ about the impact on consumers,” said Mr Parker.Additional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington and James Politi in New York
600;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;‘New Delta’ puts Parker in uncharted territory;;Doug Parker is moving into new territory with his unsolicited $8bn offer for Delta, and admits he will need the support of his larger rival’s executives and workforce to make his second merger in any many years work.The “new Delta”, as he terms the proposed carrier, would incorporate the largest US domestic network with his Atlanta’s based target’s expanded international network to Europe and Latin America.It is also expected to move him from a minor role in the Star global alliance into the SkyTeam grouping headed by Air France-KLM, Delta and more than a dozen other carriers, though he has yet to reveal a preference.“They are doing very well in their international network,” he said of Delta’s strategy in an interview with the FT on Wednesday. “We would work with management on both sides to get the best of the best.”However, he faces a tight timetable to convince creditors and turn around a Delta management which has rejected his overtures in favour of independence, and which has exclusivity over its reorganisation until next February. It hopes to exit bankruptcy protection in mid-2007, just when Mr Parker aims to complete the integration of the old US Airways with Phoenix-based America West.“If we do this after bankruptcy, 50 per cent of the synergies would be lost,” said Mr Parker, who joined America West in 1995 from Northwest Airlines before taking the chairman and CEO position in September 2001.“This is such a unique opportunity, we needed to inject ourselves,” he said of the decision to appeal directly to creditors over the heads of Delta management. Gerald Grinstein, his opposite number at Delta, is crafting a succession plan for the carrier after announcing his decision to step down next year, and associates said he favoured internal candidates, which could strengthen management resolve to fight Mr Parker.
601;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-15T21:41:58Z;Wall Street pushes further into record zone;;"Wall Street stocks settled off their peaks in New York on Wednesday, as the transport sector soared following a huge proposed deal between two US airlines.Fresh from setting new record closes for large and small capitalisation stock indices on Tuesday, equities attracted further buying, and the S&P 500 index broke the 1,400 barrier for the first time in six years, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 index advanced deeper into record territory.Stocks rose further after the Federal Reserve’s October meeting minutes were released, only for gains to erode into the close. The S&P 500 settled 3.35 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 1,396.57. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 12.09 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 2,442.75. The Dow rose 33.7 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 12,251.71, a new record close after establishing a new all-time high of 12,291.73.The small-cap Russell 2000 settled up 6.50 points, or 0.8 per cent, at a new record close of 791.56, shy of its new intra-day record of 794.18.In deal news, US Airways launched an $8bn unsolicited cash and stock offer for Delta Air Lines, currently in bankruptcy protection.Shares in US Airways soared to a high of $59.65 before easing back to $59.50, up 16.8 per cent.The news boosted hopes of further consolidation in the industry. The American Stock Exchange airline index was 5.2 per cent higher at a new 52-week high.Other airline shares rose sharply, including Continental, up 12.3 per cent at $43.08, and SouthWest, up 4.6 per cent at $15.94.JetBlue, up 7.4 per cent at $15.13, and AirTran, up 15.9 per cent to $12.83, were helped in part by upgrades to “outperform” from Bear Stearns.United Airlines’ parent, UAL, rose 9 per cent to $39.99 while AMR, American Airlines’ parent, rose 5.4 per cent to $32.33.The Dow Jones Transportation Average index led broader indices, rising 1.4 per cent to 4,830.43.Meanwhile, Boeing was 1.6 per cent higher at $87.08 on reports that it could soon receive $10bn in new aircraft sales.A Goldman Sachs upgrade of Altria from “neutral” to “buy” pushed the stock up
1.4 per cent to $82.25.Shares in RailAmerica jumped 27.8 per cent, to $15.82 after railroad operator agreed to a $1.bn, or 16.35 per share offer from hedge fund Fortress Investment Group.Google briefly benefited from positive broker comment, reaching a new intra-day high of $499.85, before closing up 0.5 per cent at $491.93.It was a rough and tumble day for technology stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index made a new 52-week high of 488.01 earlier yesterday, and pulled back, settling 0.4 per cent firmer at 483.85.Shares in Black&Decker, jumped 4.2 per cent to $89.30 after activist investor Bill Ackman disclosed he had bought a 1.9 per cent stake.Late last week, the Russell 2000 index moved ahead of the S&P 500 and Dow indices, having lagged their rise of late as the slowing economy is seen favouring larger companies with diversified earnings streams.“The message from small caps is that the economy is going to accelerate, not slow,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.Despite signs of small caps gathering renewed momentum, some analysts say their run is set to lag larger companies.David Antonelli, co-director of global research at MFS Investment Management favours large caps stocks over small companies and says “at this stage of the cycle the emphasis - of investors - should be on companies that can grow their earnings.

602;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;US Airways tries to clear Delta deal for take-off;;US Airways shares soared by 12 per cent on Wednesday after it revealed its $8bn offer for rival Delta Air Lines.It reflects pent-up expectations for consolidation in an industry emerging from five years of heavy losses and transformation by low-cost players such as Southwest.However, Doug Parker , US Airways’ chairman and chief executive, will face huge challenges in piloting his carrier from the fifth-largest in the US by revenues into a leadership position above American Airlines.Potential opposition from regulators, labour and Delta management all have the potential to derail a transaction with strategic logic but heavy political baggage.Mr Parker was quick to defend the competitive impact of his proposal, saying consumers, employees and investors would all gain from his group’s second purchase in as many years. “This is a uniquely fragmented industry, and it will remain so when [the new] Delta starts flying,” he said.Last year’s acquisition of US Airways by America West was cleared by regulators because of the lack of overlap in their two networks and the potential liquidation of its target after two stays in bankruptcy.While Mr Parker and other advocates of consolidation, such as Glenn Tilton at United, maintain the industry has changed, they also have to contend with a new Democratic leadership in Congress which vehemently opposed planned deals in 2000. No signs yet exist that the political climate towards mergers has warmed, in spite of Mr Parker’s assertion that he foresees no antitrust barriers.He also sought to win over employees by pledging there would be no compulsory job losses, saying the combined company would secure synergies from natural attrition.Passengers were promised a seamless network, albeit one in which overlaps were eliminated and one of the two competing East Coast shuttles sold off.However, US Airways has yet to complete the integration of its own two workforces – scheduled for the first quarter of next year – at a time when unions are seeking a greater share of the upside from the return to profitability. The pilots are the only unionised group at Delta, and the national leadership for flight crew has just been replaced with a team calling for more militant action, milking lingering discontent over executive pay. The relative popularity of Delta’s management – in spite of its cost-cutting and job losses – will make securing their support a crucial element.The one hurdle that Mr Parker and his team have cleared is access to finance, buoyed by a stock price which has climbed by 39 per cent so far this year as higher fares and buoyant traffic growth returned US Airways to profitability.The pledge of a 25 per cent premium to unsecured creditors is the lure as he tries to pull off the rarest of moves in the US – a hostile bid for a large bankrupt company.Companies and assets are routinely bought and sold under bankruptcy protection, but this is usually arranged with the support of the debtors. Having failed to garner that backing directly earlier this year, US Airways is now launching a direct appeal to Delta creditors, an array of large groups ranging from Boeing to General Electric, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which oversees Delta’s terminated pension funds.The hope is that the premium will see creditors force Delta’s management to open the company’s books for due diligence. This could lead to a fully fledged auction for Delta, which could bring in other potential buyers such as United, which made a tentative approach last year.Even after a period of diligence, the road to a deal could be strewn with pitfalls.To start with, US Airways will need to make sure that a majority of Delta’s creditors are supportive and willing to take a portion of their pay-out in the form of shares in the new company, rather than just in cash.This is often difficult because of the different agendas and personalities on the creditors’ committee.The diffuse and sometimes conflicting agendas of the interested parties will be enough to generate a mini-travel boom of lawyers, financiers and government and union officials.Mr Parker will be hoping their bags arrive on time.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 17.18 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 2,47.84. The Dow was up 48.50 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 12,266.51, after establishing a new all-time high of 12,275.40.The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 7.48 points, or 1 per cent, at 792.54, near a new recently set intra-day record.In deal news, US Airways launched an $8bn unsolicited cash and stock offer for Delta Air Lines, currently in bankruptcy protection.Shares in US Airways soared to a high of $59.50 before easing back to $59.22, up 16.3 per cent.The news boosted hopes of further consolidation in the industry. The American Stock Exchange airline index was 5.7 per cent higher at a new 52-week high.Other airline shares rose sharply, includingContinental, up 12.3 per cent at $43.06, and SouthWest, up 4.5 per cent at $15.92.JetBlue, up 9 per cent at $15.36, and AirTran, up 17.4 per cent to $13, were helped in part by upgrades to “outperform” from Bear Stearns.United Airlines’ parent, UAL, rose 10.2 per cent to $40.04 while AMR, American Airlines’ parent, rose 5.4 per cent to $32.35.The Dow Jones Transportation Average index led broader indices – up 1.4 per cent at 4,829.66 – after earlier reaching a peak of 4,842.59.Meanwhile, Boeing was 1.4 per cent higher at $86.96 on reports that it could soon receive $10bn in new aircraft sales.A Goldman Sachs upgrade of Altria from “neutral” to “buy” pushed the stock up 2 per cent to $82.73.Google also benefited from positive broker comment, rising 1.6 per cent to $497.26, after earlier reaching a new intra-day high of $498.37.Technology stocks rebounded from mid-morning softness and the Philadelphia semiconductor index was 1 per cent firmer at 486.49, still off a new 52-week high of 487.77 made earlier on Wednesday.Shares in Black&Decker, jumped 5.7 per cent to $90.61 after activist investor Bill Ackman disclosed he had bought a 1.9 per cent stake.Financial stocks also continued to lag behind the broader market. In spite of the prospect of record earnings this year, the Amex broker/dealer index was trading at 240.65, adrift of a peak of 241.38 set on April 19.Late last week, the Russell 2000 index moved ahead of the S&P 500 and Dow indices, having lagged their rise of late as the slowing economy is seen favouring larger companies with diversified earnings streams..Despite signs of small caps gathering renewed momentum, some analysts say their run is set to lag larger companies.David Antonelli, co-director of global research at MFS Investment Management favours large caps stocks over small companies and says “at this stage of the cycle the emphasis - of investors - should be on companies that can grow their earnings. We lean harder on big cap growth.”Of note for some analysts is how the American Stock Exchange broker/dealer index is lagging the recent rise in the broad market, despite expectations of record earnings for this year. The index was recently trading at 238.67, adrift of its peak of 241.38 set on April 19.“That the index isn’t making new highs now could just be a particularly long pause in the uptrend. But for now it is a warning signal,” noted Ken Tower, senior market strategist at CyberTrader.The ongoing rally in stocks continues to dull measures of risk aversion. Implied market volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, VIX, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” currently settled at a new low low for the year of 10.50 on Tuesday. In recent trade, VIX was quoted at 10.58.Beyond earnings and deals, investors will focus on the Fed meeting minutes.“We suspect with the ongoing debate amongst the committee, the conversation was devoted to the risk to higher inflation, as well as slowing growth, but more to the former than the market might be currently pricing in,” said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“The Fed funds futures market continues to price in a 28 per cent chance of an ease at the March meeting,” he said, adding that he believed this outlook to be “still premature at this point.”Still, the tone of the consumer price index for September, due on Thursday, should take precedence over the minutes in setting the near term direction of Fed policy, according to economists.Investors cheered a sharp fall in wholesale inflation for October on Tuesday. Together with a mixed retail sales report and comments that current policy is “about right” from St. Louis Fed President William Poole, stocks rallied, sending the Dow to a new record close.
604;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US Airways/Delta;;Is Doug Parker flying too close to the sun? Having still not finished integrating America West into US Airways – which he bought out of bankruptcy last year – he is already after a bigger challenge. His bid for bankrupt Delta is also hostile.There are serious risks. By making his rejected offer public, Mr Parker could unleash forces beyond his control. After all, Delta creditors will want to maximise their returns and are likely to sound out other potential partners. Deals out of bankruptcy are notoriously complex. The reaction of regulators is unpredictable. And there would be the usual integration risks of putting two large airlines together. His success so far with America West/US Airways has been during a rare sweet spot in the airline cycle, with improved traffic figures and rising prices helping to boost profitability after some very tough years. That might not continue.However, US Airways’ merger experience counts for a lot. And the benefits on offer make it worth the leap. If US Airways can agree a deal to buy Delta before it emerges from bankruptcy, it claims there are savings of about $1.65bn a year on offer. The capitalised value of those dwarfs the estimated premium of 25 per cent being offered to Delta creditors. There could also be a positive knock-on effect on ticket pricing because the combined company would remove about 10 per cent of its least productive capacity. That impact would be magnified if other airlines saw this as a signal to attempt similar deals.Securing a deal will be tricky, and there is a danger that employees will claw back a chunk of the benefits when they renegotiate labour agreements in a few years. But given Mr Parker’s record, his lofty ambitions should not be discounted.
605;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-15T18:52:43Z;Hostile bid for Delta to face tough antitrust probe;;US Airways’ hostile bid for Delta will face a tough antitrust review by the Department of Justice, according to Washington experts who say authorities are likely to take into account the companies’ concentration of routes along the east coast.US Air is likely to approach an antitrust probe with an arsenal of arguments to support the proposed deal. These include the changing dynamics of the troubled airline industry, the fact that it is willing to divest one of the companies’ north-east shuttles and that the emergence of cheaper airlines has given passengers more options.The airline may also highlight proposed synergies of $1.65bn a year – an argument that has resonated in the past with Thomas Barnett, the head of the antitrust division.But one Washington source with knowledge about such investigations said the division has historically not always been swayed by divestiture offers from airlines, because they may not create enough competition in the marketplace.Although the justice department would not make an antitrust ruling based on Delta’s willingness to be taken over, an unwilling merger partner could offer ammunition to build a case against the deal.Although the Bush administration has largely been seen as taking a hands-off approach to antitrust reviews, one notable exception was the antitrust division’s 2001 rejection of the proposed US Air-United merger.In a July interview with the Financial Times, Mr Barnett said he did not believe that the justice department needed to rethink its approach to airline mergers, but that it was worth considering whether the underlying “facts” of the industry had changed “so that applying [antitrust] principles might lead to a different result” in some cases.“Certainly we take into account issues such as the competitive health or viability of an individual company or competitor, whether there are efficiencies that can be gained, whether the regulatory environment is changing to create new sources of competition [and] whether they have better access to consumers than before,” he said.Mr Barnett also noted, however, that some factors – including some city pair routes where airlines have a high market share – “cut in another direction”.

They advanced a further 2.5 per cent to 152p on Wednesday.Elsewhere in the sector, South-African insurer Old Mutual rose 3.6 per cent to 178½p after Bear Stearns increased its target price to 215p, citing the strength of the rand and strong figures from its Nedbank subsidiary. Old Mutual reports results later this month.In the wider market, leading shares closed in positive territory for the first time in six sessions.The FTSE 100 ended 43.2 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 6,229.8, with British Airways spearheading the advance. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to a seven-year high of 485p after agreeing a funding plan with the trustees of its main pension fund scheme.BA, which lifted its stake in Iberia to 10 per cent, was also helped by news of a bid for Delta Air Lines by US Airways.The backbone for London’s gains came from Vodafone. Shares in the mobile phone operator climbed 2.6 per cent to 139p as analysts upgraded recommendations and forecasts after Tuesday’s figures.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 gained 79 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 10,797.2. The mid-cap index has now outperformed the FTSE 100 for seven consecutive sessions, its best run since September 2004.Kingfisher, owner of the B&Q DIY chain, was one of the main talking points yesterday. Its shares eased 2 per cent to 266¼p on rumours that the company has been talking down 2007-08 profit forecasts.The company is due to issue a third-quarter trading statement at the end of the month and joint house broker UBS cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”.UBS said it had downgraded because Kingfisher shares had almost reached its 280p target price. However, it added that profits in 2007-08 could be impacted by further store refurbishments.UBS was not the only broker to downgrade Kingfisher. Merrill Lynch and Man Securities both removed their “buy” ratings on the stock, citing among other factors rising costs.Elsewhere in the retail sector, J Sainsbury eased 1 per cent to 408¼p as investors banked profits after half-year results and rumours circulated that Asda was planning to cut prices in the run-up to Christmas.However, late in the session there was talk that a consortium of Icelandic investors had been building a stake in Sainsbury.Icap, the inter-dealer broker, was also under pressure, sliding 3.2 per cent to 490p after Morgan Stanley cut forecasts by 5 per cent to reflect the impact of a weaker dollar and tougher trading in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.London Stock Exchange was the FTSE 250’s biggest faller. Its shares were marked 5.6 per cent lower at £12.34 after news that a group of leading investment banks are planning to build a platform for trading the shares of Europe’s biggest companies.Engineer FKIimproved 4 per cent to 96¼p on bid rumours. However, analysts were sceptical given FKI’s debt burden and pension fund deficit.Weir added 3.1 per cent to 551¼p on rumours that the pumps and values maker has been talking up guidance. Analysts expect Weir to record pretax profits of £79m in 2006. However, thanks to strong demand from the mining industry for its slurry pumps profits are likely to come in at about £82m-£84m.Informa firmed up 1.1 per cent to 569p on late rumours that Springer Science & Business Media could return with a higher offer. Earlier this month Informa rebuffed a 630p-a-share from Springer.

Atlanta, GA 30354Dear Jerry:It has been a few months since I called to let you know that US Airways would be interested in talking with Delta about a potential merger. At the time you indicated you had some internal issues you needed to address before you would be in a position to talk with anyone about alternatives to your standalone plan. Given the substantial progress you have made with your restructuring, I am hopeful your internal issues have been addressed and we can begin a meaningful dialog about entering into a transaction.Let me begin by saying we are very impressed by the restructuring progress you and your team have engineered and are implementing. Delta seems well on its way to being able to emerge from bankruptcy as a standalone airline and I am sure you are extremely proud of your team. We also believe, however, that a merger with US Airways would, for Delta’s stakeholders, be a superior alternative to any standalone plan, because of the considerable synergies a merger could produce. Our experience suggests a transaction completed before Delta emerges from bankruptcy would create significantly more value than any transaction that closes post-emergence.Our beliefs are based on US Airways’ strong stock price performance since completing our transaction in September 2005. The merger combined one airline with a market capitalization of approximately $150 million with another airline on the brink of liquidation and created an airline with a current market value over $4 billion. The former US Airways’ creditors have seen the value of their equity increase 140% since its emergence through a merger while UAL’s equity value has declined more than 15% since its standalone emergence. US Airways’ equity market value is now about 40% higher than UAL despite being only half as large. We believe the reason for this difference is due in large part to US Airways being able to generate synergy value through the bankruptcy/merger process which carriers that emerge as standalones cannot. Furthermore, based on current valuation multiples, we believe there is still significant upside in US Airways’ stock price as we execute on our plan and deliver the merger synergies we originally communicated to the market.As we have completed significant internal analysis of a potential combination, our interest in pursuing a transaction has grown. This analysis is based upon publicly available information and our experiences with the America West-US Airways merger. While access to only publicly available information creates some analytical challenges, we feel confident about the quality of the work we have done so far and believe it paints a reasonable picture of the potential value to be created by a merger of our companies and our ability to consummate such a transaction.The primary components of our analysis to date have been estimating synergy value, investigating antitrust implications, and researching labor contract issues:Synergy Value: We believe a merger of Delta and US Airways could generate annual synergies of approximately $1.5 billion. This would create value neither of our teams, no matter how well managed, could create independently. These synergies would be generated only through an appropriately timed transaction and would come from the following sources:• Approximately $675 million would be realized through expense reductions. The largest savings would be in consolidation of information systems, the reduction of management overhead and consolidation of facilities. Additional savings are expected through lower distribution costs and the renegotiation of our collective contracts with vendors. Based upon our experience with AWA/US, we believe this synergy estimate is conservative.• Another $825 million would be realized through network rationalization and revenue synergies. Network rationalization savings are generated by managing the combined networks to ensure the combined fleet size is appropriately tied to passenger demand. Revenue synergies would also arise from better serving our current customers by increasing our competitive presence, and attracting new customers and corporate accounts in markets where neither carrier today is a significant competitor.Our analysis presumes a merger would proceed in the same fashion as the US Airways-America West transaction, with the closing prior to Delta’s emergence from bankruptcy. If we model a merger of our combined companies after Delta emerges from bankruptcy standalone, we estimate that we would lose the majority of these synergies. This is because the opportunity bankruptcy provides to align the fleet, combine facilities, and renegotiate vendor contracts would be lost.Antitrust: We have worked with antitrust counsel at Fried Frank to analyze this transaction based upon traditional Department of Justice merger analysis criteria. We believe the transaction would be approved, although we anticipate the need to divest some assets in the Eastern United States, which we believe is fully manageable.Labor: We have reviewed all of our labor contracts and Delta’s pilot contract. Based upon our understandings of those agreements, we do not believe any union must consent in order for us to close on a merger transaction. (Implementation of a full codeshare, similar to the one between US Airways and America West, would require the consent of the Delta and US Airways pilots, but we believe a merger is manageable without a full and immediate codeshare, if the pilots do not consent). The wage rates of Delta and US Airways employees are not so markedly different so as to anticipate any material negative synergies in getting our employees to common pay scales, even if we were to move to the higher of the two scales in every labor group.US Airways is very excited about the potential of a merger with Delta. Because of the very large projected synergies, we believe such a transaction would allow your creditors to receive significantly more value than they would in a standalone plan or any other potential merger partner’s plan. We understand the antitrust concerns and labor issues and believe those hurdles are manageable. Additionally, we know the technical, operational and customer service challenges in merging airlines. Our experiences over the past year make us confident these challenges can be managed.We would very much like to begin discussions with your team and are prepared to move quickly. The US Airways Board of Directors has reviewed this letter and is fully supportive of moving forward. We are working with Citigroup and Skadden Arps as financial and legal advisors, respectively, and have a team of senior management employees prepared to devote time to this important project. We and our advisors are highly confident significant capital could be raised in support of this transaction, if necessary.Time is of the essence. As Delta proceeds with a standalone plan, decisions may be made that are appropriate for a standalone plan, but that would be different were Delta to be merging (for example, assuming or entering into regional jet contracts, aircraft leases, facility leases, IT outsourcing agreements, and credit card processing or affinity agreements). During the US Airways transaction, some contracts were assumed in pursuit of a standalone model that ended up decreasing the value of the merged entity. If we defer a joint investigation of a potential merger, only to find many of the synergies are no longer achievable because of actions taken in support of a standalone plan, your stakeholders could lose significant potential value.In light of the very significant benefits this transaction would provide your stakeholders, we ask you and your board of directors give careful consideration to our interest in pursuing a transaction. As a next step, we propose a meeting to identify the information needed to develop a definitive proposal for combining our two companies. We also view a meeting as an opportunity to exchange views on the strategic vision of a combined entity, the potential issues with integration of the businesses, and the challenges of closing the transaction.We believe we are both better served by working towards a transaction without public disclosure and the attendant press and employee distraction. Accordingly, we currently intend to treat this letter as confidential, and do not believe that public disclosure by Delta is required.Jerry, thank you in advance for your consideration of our proposal. I have tremendous respect for you personally and have been impressed by the results from your team. I firmly believe that if we work together we can build the strongest airline in the world. The combined airline would have the ability to thrive in any industry consolidation scenario and that would be in the best interest of both of our `airlines’ employees, customers, stakeholders and the communities that we serve.Respectfully,(signed) W.

Phoenix, AZ 85034Dear Doug:I have shared your letter of September 29, 2006 with the Delta Board of Directors and reviewed with them this response to you.As a preliminary matter let me thank you for your kind words about the Delta team and the restructuring progress we have made to date. Important milestones have been reached in our reorganization plan and we are confident of Delta’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy as a strong, viable airline. Given the work that remains, we believe it would not be productive to engage in the type of exploratory discussions that you propose at this time.The Board and management of Delta have been, and will remain, focused on enhancing value for our stakeholders. It is in this context that we will continue our work on our reorganization plan and we will determine if and when it would be in the interests of our stakeholders to initiate discussions regarding possible extraordinary transactions with third parties.We have also discussed your letter with our official creditors committee and its advisers, who have expressed support for this response.Respectfully,(signed) Gerald Grinstein* * *November 15 2006Mr Gerald Grinstein,

Delta Air Lines, Inc.
Atlanta, GA 30320-6001Dear Jerry:Last Spring we had a conversation about a potential merger of US Airways and Delta. As you know, following that conversation, I sent you a letter on September 29, 2006, outlining our thoughts about a transaction, describing the significant benefits that could be achieved for both of our respective stakeholder groups from this type of transaction, and proposing to meet with you and your team to work together to further consider and develop our proposal. I was disappointed that you declined to meet or even enter into discussions in your letter of October 17, 2006. Because the benefits of a merger of US Airways and Delta are so compelling to both of our companies’ stakeholders, we believe it is important to inform them about our proposal. Therefore, we are simultaneously releasing this letter to the public.The Board of Directors and management team of US Airways believe that a combination of Delta and US Airways presents a significantly greater value for Delta’s creditors, customers, employees and partners than a plan to emerge from bankruptcy on a standalone basis. We also believe that, unless we act quickly to pursue a combination through the actions that can be taken during Delta’s bankruptcy process, our respective stakeholders will not be able to realize what we believe are substantial economic benefits from such a combination.Merger Proposal. We propose a merger of Delta and US Airways in a transaction in which Delta prepetition unsecured creditors would receive $4.0 billion in cash plus 78.5 million shares of US Airways’ common stock. Based upon the closing price of US Airways’ common stock of $50.93 on November 14, 2006, the equity component represents a value of approximately $4.0 billion. As a result of this transaction, immediately following the merger, Delta unsecured creditors would own approximately 45 percent of the combined company.This proposal represents an aggregate of approximately $8.0 billion in value to Delta’s prepetition unsecured creditors, before taking into account realization of any of the significant additional value from the synergies we believe are achievable. Even prior to the realization of any synergy value, this proposal represents a 25 percent premium over the current trading price of Delta’s prepetition unsecured claims as of November 14, 2006 (40 cents/dollar), assuming that there will ultimately be $16.0 billion of unsecured claims. The proposal also represents a 40 percent premium over the average trading price for Delta unsecured claims over the last thirty days. We believe that this proposal, which is based on publicly available information, fully values Delta.Synergy Value. What makes this proposal most compelling for both Delta creditors and US Airways shareholders are the significant synergies that we believe can be readily achieved in this proposed transaction. We have preliminarily identified annual network and cost synergies in excess of $1.65 billion, which at a median industry EBITDAR multiple of 5.0x translates into approximately $8.3 billion of additional value creation. This is value that neither of our teams, no matter how well managed, could create independently. Under the combination, these synergies would be shared by Delta creditors and US Airways shareholders in proportion to their initial ownership in the combined company.The synergies would be generated only through an appropriately timed transaction, and under our current analysis we believe would be as follows:• Approximately $710 million would be realized through expense reductions. The largest savings would be in consolidation of information systems, reduction of overhead and consolidation of facilities. Additional savings are expected through lower distribution costs and renegotiation of our collective contracts with vendors. Based upon our experience and synergies achieved with the merger of US Airways and America West, we believe this estimate is conservative.• Another $935 million would be realized through network rationalization synergies. Network rationalization savings would be generated by managing the combined networks to ensure that the combined fleet size is better matched to passenger demand. Network synergies would also arise from better serving our current customers, and by increasing our competitive presence, attracting new customers and corporate accounts in markets where neither carrier today is a significant competitor.In our US Airways/America West merger, we preliminarily identified approximately $250 million in potential annual cost synergies that we believed could be realized in that transaction. After having successfully completed that transaction over a year ago, we have now identified over $300 million in cost synergies, outperforming our expectations. Year-to-date, US Airways’ RASM is up 17.1 percent versus the industry being up 9.1 percent, which translates into $425 million in network synergies already this year. Accordingly, we have a high level of confidence that we can achieve at a minimum the synergies that we have identified in a potential Delta / US Airways merger.Our analysis presumes that a merger would proceed in the same fashion as the US Airways / America West transaction, with the closing in conjunction with Delta’s emergence from bankruptcy. As I have previously indicated to you, if we model a merger of our companies after Delta emerges from bankruptcy standalone, our synergy estimates are cut in half. We do not believe that simply allowing that potential value to evaporate is in the best interests of any constituency.Financing and Structure. We have obtained a financing commitment from Citigroup to provide $7.2 billion in new financing for this transaction. This funding would be utilized to refinance Delta’s debtor-in-possession credit facility, refinance US Airways’ existing senior secured facility with GE Capital, and provide the funding for the $4.0 billion cash portion of our offer. All other allowed secured debt and administrative claims would be assumed or paid in full.Preliminarily, we would intend to follow the model used successfully in the US Airways/America West merger for this transaction. We would, of course, seek to structure the transaction in a tax efficient manner for our respective stakeholders, maximizing Delta’s net operating loss carryforwards.Integration. Our proposal contemplates the creation of the leading global airline operating under the “Delta” name and brand. To streamline our operations and capitalize on potential synergies, we would expect to develop together an integration plan, and identify areas in which efficiencies can be maximized, including appropriate rationalization of operational centers.Regulatory Matters. We have worked with antitrust counsel to analyze this transaction and believe that any antitrust issues can be resolved.Labor Matters. We believe that this transaction is in the best interests of the employees of US Airways and Delta because of the strength and stability of the company that the transaction will produce. Also, we expect that we would move to the highest of the existing labor costs in every group. Because the wage rates for Delta and US Airways employees are not markedly different, we do not anticipate that this action will have a material negative impact, and that fact has been included in our analysis. Similar to the US Airways/America West merger in which there were no furloughs of mainline operating group employees, our current model does not assume furloughs of employees in the mainline operating groups.Conditions. Our proposal is conditioned on satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation, which we believe can be completed expeditiously. In addition, the proposed transaction would be conditioned on the bankruptcy court’s approval of a mutually agreeable plan of reorganization that would be predicated upon the merger, regulatory approvals and approval of the shareholders of US Airways. Given our analysis to date, we are confident that our joint efforts would result in satisfaction of these conditions and a successful combination of our companies in a timely manner.This proposal presents an opportunity for Delta creditors to receive significantly higher recoveries than they can receive under any standalone plan for Delta. It is also an opportunity for US Airways shareholders to benefit from the significant upside potential of the combination. Consumers will benefit from expanded choice as well as the reach and services of a large-scale provider within the cost structure of a low-fare carrier. Our employees will benefit from a more competitive employer and our willingness to adopt highest common denominator employee costs.As I expressed to you previously, I understand that you and your team have worked extremely hard on your own restructuring, and greatly respect all that you have accomplished to make Delta a healthy, viable airline. We simply believe that a combination with US Airways will produce even more value for your creditors and our shareholders, and that this is a unique opportunity to create an airline that is even better positioned to thrive long into the future, whatever that future might bring to the industry, greatly benefiting our employees and customers.We and our advisors, Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, are ready to commence due diligence and to negotiate definitive documentation immediately, and request that you agree to work with us so that this alternative to your standalone plan can be quickly and fully developed. We are prepared to meet with you, Delta’s Board, Delta’s Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, and any major Delta creditor or other stakeholder, to achieve this outcome. I believe we owe it to our respective stakeholders to pursue this opportunity vigorously.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Respectfully,(signed) Doug Parker"

Apple is leaving no stone unturned in its quest to cement the iPod’s dominance of the personal music player market. This morning, the company announced a deal to let passengers of six big airlines play music and video from their iPods over the airlines’ in-flight entertainment systems. Air France, KLM, Emirates, Continental, United and Delta Air Lines will install special iPod connectors that allow passengers to charge their iPods in flight.The move to lock in captive audiences – and presumably lock out competitors, such as the Microsoft Zune – is nothing new; Apple has already struck similar deals with carmakers.What is remarkable is that the cash-starved airlines are willing to play along with a new feature that will divert users from existing in-flight entertainment. A United spokeswoman just told me that the iPod deal does not include cash. She said the iPod deal was part of a broader effort to upgrade entertainment options available to international first class and business travelers.It seems the iPod has become such an important part of the digital culture that airlines believe the very promise of being able to listen to Radiohead or watch Desperate Housewives on their iPods on a transatlantic flight will be enough to draw hordes of high-paying customers."
609;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-13T19:33:03Z;IBM/Investing in customers;;IBM is considering joining the Citigroup-led consortium bidding for Guangdong Development Bank. The idea, presumably, is to get its paws on more of the Chinese lender’s IT budget but the tactic feels a little uncomfortable. It’s hard to imagine Pfizer taking a stake in HCA, the hospital operator that was bought out this year, or Airbus parent EADS buying Delta Air Lines shares.Owning stakes in suppliers is common. And vertical integration – for example, taking over intermediaries that distribute your goods – has its adherents. But buying minority positions in customers is rare. Some European and Asian banks own positions in corporations but these are typically defensive cross-shareholdings and not just ways of securing revenue. The flurry of investment banks taking stakes in their hedge fund clients is probably the best contemporary example.For the customer, if other sources of capital are available, such deals are unattractive. The interests of all shareholders are best promoted by objective purchasing decisions. On the other side of the table, there are pitfalls too. Motorola sold its portfolio of stakes in cellular operators when they began to compete head-on with its other customers.An alternative short cut to customers’ hearts is to lend to them, but there have been accidents. French engineer Alstom reached the point in March 2002 where such loans were equivalent to 45 per cent of market capitalisation. According to McKinsey, the telecoms equipment sector had $26bn of mainly ill-judged vendor financing outstanding in 2000.IBM is no stranger to such techniques. It had $20bn of external client financing on its balance sheet at December 2005. To justify going one stage further and taking an equity stake, it will have to demonstrate tangible benefits to its shareholders. How consistent those might be with the agenda of Guangdong’s other investors remains to be seen.
610;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-11-03T18:25:10Z;Nigeria oil industry attack fears resurface;;Strong fears of attacks in Nigeria’s oil producing delta region resurfaced on Friday with US officials warning militants may have finalised plans to attack oil facilities and take expatriate workers hostage.The US consulate in Nigeria issued a statement saying Nigerian militants had plans to strike between 10 and 20 land-based targets and take hostages in coordinated attacks on oil facilities in the first week of November.Such threat assessments by industry watchers have become increasingly common after major attacks on oil facilities earlier this year which were followed by waves of hostage taking in recent weeks.But many apparent threats have not been carried out. Last month, the US consulate said it had information about a planned attack on Bonny Island, a major oil and gas hub in the delta, but no attack has materialised.The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (Mend), the group claiming responsibility for attacks earlier this year which have cut about 500,000 barrels per day of production, said it was ready to strike again.“We will resume our attacks next week. It will not be the major one I have often bragged about, but this will suffice for now,” said the movement’s anonymous spokesman in an email to the FT earlier this week.Mend has been promising a huge crippling blow to Nigeria’s oil industry for months, but has faced divisions amongst its collaborators whose motivations range from the purely criminal to the politically ideological.Militant forces are keen to carry out an attack to prove they have not been paid off by the Nigerian government, which often employs such strategies to limit short term damage to its oil industry.The promised attacks are set to take place as Nigeria’s ruling party gears up for crucial party primaries to select candidates for national elections due next April.Attacks or the threat of them could be an important tool to extract political concessions from dominant politicians at the apex of the central government and ruling party structures.“We seek to convince the Nigerian government and international community of our capability to halt Nigerian oil exports. That should be sufficient reason to negotiate,” Mend’s spokesman told the FT last month. “We will stop a bit short of going for broke”.
611;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-10-24T17:18:39Z;JetBlue to begin code-sharing programme;;JetBlue announced plans on Tuesday to start code-sharing with international carriers, in another departure by the US airline from the low-cost business model adopted by rivals such as Southwest and AirTran.JetBlue said it was in talks with “large international carriers” to cross-sell seats for services from its base at New York’s JFK airport, the largest US gateway.Dave Neeleman, chief executive, said the partners would be announced in the coming months, in a move that will increase pressure on Delta Air Lines, which is expanding its domestic network from JFK to feed its own international routes. JetBlue is constructing its own terminal at the airport.The airline has captured market share from established rivals such as Delta and Continental with a mix of low costs and high service levels, but has already deviated from the industry’s standard business model by introducing 100-seat Embraer 190s alongside its fleet of larger Airbus A320s.The low-cost carriers have avoided code shares because of the added cost and complexity of selling seats for other airlines, and have also tended to use only one aircraft type to maximise efficiencies and lower expenses.The Embraer aircraft have been used to open new routes over the past year, although JetBlue said on Tuesday it would cut deliveries alongside existing plans to sell some of its A320s, defer deliveries and shift more capacity to short-haul routes. The airline – which said it could still make a pre-tax profit this year – trimmed capacity expansion from 25 per cent in 2005 and 20 per cent this year to 14-17 per cent for 2007.JetBlue’s rapid growth had made it one of the most exposed in the industry to high jet-fuel prices. Domestic US airline capacity is forecast to drop by 1-2 per cent next year, with most legacy carriers trimming their schedules in favour of more international flying.Mr Neeleman said the revenue environment “re-mained challenging” during the September quarter, traditionally the busiest for US carriers.■ JetBlue on Tuesday reported a narrow loss of $500,000 for the three months to September 30, from net income of $2.7m in the year-ago period.
612;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-10-19T23:19:58Z;Air alliances are ‘under threat’;;The head of United Airlines on Thursday suggested the industry’s network of global alliances may be breaking down, prompting the US carrier to examine overseas investments to support its international strategy.Glenn Tilton, United’s chairman and chief executive, stressed no deals were imminent, but provided the clearest warning to date of the strains facing the system of three international alliances which dominate the industry.“Air-France-KLM and Cathay Pacific are sending signals that the alliance structure is under threat,” Mr Tilton told an aviation symposium organised by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.Cathay, a member of the oneworld alliance headed by British Airways and American Airlines, recently completed an equity swap with Air China, which remains in the Star grouping led by United and Lufthansa. Analysts speculate that the airlines will have to choose between a single alliance as members co-operate on marketing and route development to capture global business.Air-France-KLM is a leading member of the rival SkyTeam alliance alongside Delta Air Lines, and the US carrier’s recent rapid expansion of transatlantic routes has riled its French partner by increasing competition and reducing shared traffic. “There is a potential tension between alliance partners as you move more and more into the markets they serve,” Gerald Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive told the FT earlier this year.The alliance structure was developed because of international rules limiting airlines to minority stakes in overseas rivals, and Mr Tilton has been the most outspoken US industry advocate of administration efforts to ease domestic restrictions to improve the competitiveness of the American carriers.He said “something is going to replace the existing alliance structure” if the system continues to be challenged by consolidation in Europe and Asia, and suggested United could seek equity stakes overseas to support its business.“I don’t have a clear imagined transaction,” stressed Mr Tilton, who is also an outspoken proponent of domestic industry consolidation which has seen the carrier linked with both Continental and Delta.Industry watchers suggested United is more likely to court investment from Lufthansa than make any overseas moves as its financially-stronger partner could help it to rebuild a balance sheet weakened by three years in bankruptcy protection.Antitrust regulators blocked a bid by United to buy US Airways six years ago, but Mr Tilton – who arrived at the airline in 2003 – has called on regulators to rethink their policies to improve the competitiveness of the US industry.“Today, it can be unequivocally stated, we no longer lead,” he said of the US industry, which he contrasted with the creation of regional “champions” such as Air France-KLM, the product of the merger of the French and Dutch national carriers. “In our view its time to abandon the policy of fragmentation.”Mr Tilton also called on international regulators to rethink their objectives in pursuing “stalled” efforts to redesign the 60-year old system that governs the industry and restricts route rights and investment. The audience included the lead US and European Union negotiators involved in long-running efforts to establish a transatlantic open skies deal.“Once more, it might be time to take a victory lap around open skies and [ask] ‘What comes next?’” he said.
613;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-08-29T18:23:01Z;Flights from US to Africa open up business frontiers;;"Linda Perniciaro took the Houston Express to work last month. The Texas oil capital is not renowned for its public transport, and the Express is in fact a converted MD-11 jet flying three times a week to Luanda.Ms Perniciaro’s 14-hour journey to oil-rich Angola on an aircraft kitted out with business-class seats and personal TVs represents the plusher end of the expanding market for airline services between the US and Africa.However, the mother-of-two admits she would not have made the journey to provide computer training for an energy client had she been forced to rely on the limited number of direct services between the continents. Most passengers face a gruelling 24-plus hour trip with a stop in Europe. The additional security restrictions after British authorities claimed to have foiled a plot to blow up airlines heading to the US, add to the discomfort facing transfer passengers, though airlines maintain that international bookings remain in line with expectations, in spite
of the recent disruption.There are just a handful of non-stop flights between the US and Africa – most operated by non-US carriers. Despite the high-margin business traffic created by rising oil and gas production in west Africa and initiatives to boost trade such as the US-African Growth and Opportunity Act, “it’s not easy to get there right now”, says Glen Hauenstein, the executive vice-president in charge of network development at Delta Air Lines. Delta plans to start a service from its Atlanta hub to Johannesburg in December, with a stop in Dakar, the Senegalese capital. This would make it the first major US carrier to tap the region since the disappearance of Pan Am and TWA more than a decade ago.“Africa-US is growing much faster than even Asia. It’s outpacing every other region,” says Mr Hauenstein. He notes that passenger traffic is rising at 14 per cent a year, well above the 2.7 per cent growth in official statistics based on the limited number of non-stop flights.“West Africa is the most underserved,” says Robert Binns, chief marketing officer at World Airways, which operates the thrice-weekly Houston Express charter. The shortage of seats has been exacerbated by the collapse of African carriers such as Nigeria Airways, and the failure of subsequent attempts to revive other struggling flag carriers in the region.World – also the largest commercial operator for the US military – spotted African opportunities when it acquired North American Airlines, a New York-based rival, last year. The airline started its scheduled African service in July 2005, with flights to Accra. It has since tripled the frequency and added Banjul in the Gambia and, last month, Lagos.Mr Binns says 130,000 passengers a year fly to Lagos from the New York area alone, with another 80,000 heading to Ghana, highlighting the large ethnic African populations in the US which provide the bulk of its passenger base.Mr Binns says the reluctance of US carriers to serve the market reflects perceptions that Africa is a more difficult operating environment, but one in which World – which flies to Iraq and Afghanistan for the military – is well equipped for.“It’s not just Houston,” says Mr Hauenstein, referring to the traffic generated by the energy business. “It’s the United Nations, aid relief, visiting friends and relatives. And Africa is the next frontier for tourism.”Delta is the only major US carrier planning Africa services, with rivals opting instead to feed passengers via their alliance partners in Europe. “US airlines have lost their imagination,” says Mr Hauenstein. While admitting he is unsure as to how profitable the new Dakar-Johannesburg route will be, he identifies Cairo, Casablanca and Nairobi as potentially attractive destinations, alongside the oil-rich nations of west Africa.For its part, Virgin Nigeria says its application remains on hold since being filed with the US authorities last December. Dave Schaffer, the carrier’s US counsel, believes the airline’s UK link has made it a hostage to the long-suffering efforts to liberalise aviation links between the US and Europe."
614;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-08-27T20:18:47Z;Private jet hire soars after terror plot news;;"Private jet companies in the US have seen a sharp rise in demand since the terror alert in London this month as executives and the rich look for ways to avoid crowded airports and tight security restrictions.Those in the US private jet business have said that interest in memberships spiked immediately after the incident in London – with some of the interest translating into sales.Joe Moeggenberg, president of US-based Aviation Research Group, said interest in private jets also surged five years ago after the terrorist attacks of September 11, but did not translate into increased sales.He said changes in the private jet business that makes it easier for people to afford such services have led to a different outcome in recent days. “This time, there is increased interest and usage.”Delta AirElite, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, said bookings were up about 30 per cent from the same time last year.Delta AirElite said call volumes were running 70 per cent higher since authorities said on August 10 that they had uncovered a plot to blow up airliners flying from London to the US.Steve Hankin, chief executive of Sentient, a leading membership-based private jet company, said revenues at his company were up 150 per cent from the previous year. He said business was usually slower in the summer.Mr Moeggenberg said more people were able to afford private jets because of the introduction of such features as fractional ownerships and jet cards.It is possible to fly privately for as little as $41,000 by purchasing a 10-hour jet card.Florida-based DayJet said that by the end of this year mid-level managers would be able to fly privately for as little as $1 per mile per seat.Mr Moeggenberg said: “You can buy a fractional share of an airline; you can use a membership programme, where you buy flight time; you can purchase an aircraft and turn it over to a management company and they will put up a charter and help you offset a cost, or you can buy 10 hours at a time or just charter when you need it. With so many options out there, travellers can find the most cost effective way to fly and they do.”Fractional ownership is a more expensive and lengthier commitment than buying a jet card.At NetJets, the leader of the fractional ownership business controlled by investor Warren Buffett, shares start at $406,250 for a 6 per cent stake – the equivalent of 50 hours annual flying time in a seven-seater aircraft.Makers of private jets also report robust demand. Gulfstream, a General Dynamics unit that supplies aircraft to most private jet companies, has sold 89 jets in 2005 and expects to sell 111 this year, a 24 per cent increase, said Robert Bougriet, director of corporate communications"
615;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Northwest’s passage to the appeal court;;The ageing Northwest Airlines DC-10 forced to return to Amsterdam after another security scare this week symbolises the old and new threats facing the US carrier.Passengers look to the professionalism of the crew to enhance their safety, but Northwest’s reliance on a gas-guzzling McDonnell Douglas aircraft – most of whose cousins are parked in the desert – highlights the financial difficulties threatening its survival.Northwest management needs to placate staff who have endured years of pay cuts to keep the airline flying. It also needs to replace the DC-10 and more than 160 DC-9s which have plied domestic routes, on average, for more than 35 years.The two issues are linked, and Northwest will on Friday afternoon appeal against the ruling by its bankruptcy judge allowing 9,000 flight attendants, angered by the latest pay cuts, to launch industrial action as early as Friday.Management argues that the disruption threatens its fragile financial recovery, or could even lead to liquidation. The talk on Wall Street is that wildcat strikes driving passengers away could flush out a potential bidder. Some put the chances of this as high as 50 per cent, though others remain less certain.“The likelihood that the company will be broken up over the flight attendants’ contract is possible, but remote,” says one key lender to the airline. “I’d put the chances at no more than 10 per cent.”Northwest insists it is focused on independence and emerging from Chapter 11 protection early next year, helped by recent reform of pension legislation and the restructuring which has shrunk the carrier over the past year and generated profits in each of the past four months.Doug Steenland, chief executive, has walked a negotiating tightrope with pilots and ground staff to secure cuts, but the flight attendants’ dispute could unbalance matters.Cabin crew have twice turned down deals, though a bankruptcy judge allowed Northwest to impose the terms of a tentative agreement and close in on its target of $1.4bn in annualised benefits.Financiers and investors continue to believe the latest round of brinksmanship will not ground Northwest forever, and a deal will be reached. Shareholders may have been wiped out by bankruptcy, but its bonds trade above par and three banks this month stepped forward with $1.375bn in fresh debtor-in-possession financing, albeit on slightly tougher terms as the labour dispute rumbled on.Roger King, airline analyst at CreditSights, says bondholders take comfort from the perceived value of Northwest’s route authorities to Asia, which some estimate to have been appraised at around $2bn. “I really think the airline is going to get sold,” he says. “They have a beautiful asset in the Pacific [routes]. I don’t know what the price will be, but it will be pretty cheap.”The diverted DC-10 was heading for Mumbai, but the markets between the US, Japan and most of north-east Asia remain heavily regulated, and Northwest’s traffic rights to the region remain its key competitive strength and source of revenues. The attractions of the market are highlighted by the latest scramble among US carriers for a new allocation of route rights to China.American Airlines, the only legacy carrier to escape bankruptcy, is among those vying for the China routes to expand its Asian network. The Dallas-based carrier has had a bite at Northwest before, but regulators blocked a merger in 2000.The financial malaise of the US industry leads many to believe the regulatory landscape has changed to permit mergers on the scale of last year’s combination of America West and bankrupt US Airways. which employed the same restructuring adviser as Northwest.The fleet-replacement challenge is shared by American and Delta Air Lines, but for now, Northwest’s fate lies again in the hands of the bankruptcy judge and the cabin crew, who are swapping blue uniforms for green T-shirts emblazoned with one word: Chaos.

The software company already is facing a probe into possible accounting irregularities, has delayed its full-year results and is in discussions about new covenants with its banks and partners on the National Health Service IT (NPfIT) project.Not so. Isoft has now gone on the attack to defend its reputation in Malta, where it is currently bidding for a significant integrated health service IT system at Mater Dei hospital on the Mediterranean island.A row has blown up this week in which John White, Isoft’s director of corporate communications, took issue with Malta Today’s reporting of issues at the Manchester company.In a letter to the newspaper, White blamed “inaccurate overseas media sources”, in part, for what he called “inaccurate reporting” of Isoft’s woes.Isoft denied on Wednesday that it had complained about the coverage through the British High Commission in Valletta, although it said the legation was helping it with the bid.Even so, White’s assertion in his letter that the NPfIT’s objective is “to improve efficiencies and reduce costs through the use of integrated information solutions” may seem unfortunate, in its timing at least, as the programme in north-west England and the Midlands copes with a three-day shut-down to patient administration systems because of a power cut.Still, investors will be reassured that rumours in the UK that Isoft would be cut out of the NPfIT project “are entirely without foundation”. White told the Maltese that Isoft was a “strong” company.Investors who have seen the value of their shares drop by 90 per cent this year will be pleased that Isoft, White says, “is future-

617;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Northwest faces prospect of industrial action;;Northwest Airlines faces the prospect of industrial action after flight attendants on Monday rejected a proposed new contract for the second time and warned passengers to expect disruption if the US carrier imposes the new terms on employees.The airline, which has extensive services to Asia and Europe, said in a statement it was preparing to implement the terms rejected by its cabin crew despite efforts by their new union to block the move in bankruptcy court.The Association of Flight Attendants said Northwest might impose the terms of the rejected contract as early as Tuesday, and while the airline did not provide a timescale, union officials said they were preparing for industrial action. Similar threats at rival Delta Air Lines earlier this year had led to a drop in bookings.Northwest, the fourth-largest US airline by revenues, has a troubled labour-relations record, and the latest round of brinkmanship caps 10 months of turmoil since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last September.The latest woes add to the pressure on Northwest management caused by continuing delays in the passing of new pension-reform legislation which would ease the financial burden of its under-funded schemes.The carrier had hoped to emerge from Chapter 11 in the first quarter of next year after securing deals with other employee groups, including pilots and ground staff. However, the other labour deals hinge on an agreement with the cabin crew. Northwest has already returned aircraft and renegotiated terms with lenders and leasing companies, while the general improvement in US airline revenues helped it return to profit in March and April.Northwest flight attendants switched from the Professional Flight Attendants’ Association to the AFA in July after 80 per cent of voters rejected a tentative deal negotiated by the PFAA in March.The latest offer by the airline was backed by the new union and would deliver the same $195m in annualised savings over five years, though with different terms. It was rejected by 55 per cent of the staff.Northwest said it was now “implementing new contract terms and conditions” in line with the March deal – as approved by the bankruptcy judge in June. The AFA called on the court to limit the airline to the terms of the latest rejected deal agreed with union officials on July 17.The union maintains its members have the right to strike – a move which Northwest has said would be illegal.
618;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;United Airlines gets ready for China rush;;United Airlines plans to consolidate its position as the largest carrier between the US and Asia by shifting aircraft from transatlantic service ahead of an expected scramble for additional flights to China next year.The second-largest US carrier by revenues plans to launch an extra 40 flights a week to Asia, and last Friday agreed to sell the authority to operate its loss-making New York-London route to rival Delta Air Lines and switch its New York JFK-Tokyo service to its hub at Washington Dulles.The twin moves reflect the focus by the US legacy carriers on building the strength of their key hub airports and switching resources to more profitable international routes, despite the improvement in domestic fare levels which have allowed most carriers to make a profit in the latest quarter.Domestic US capacity is expected to drop by more than 1 per cent this year, despite continued expansion by low-fare rivals such as Southwest, but international capacity will rise by around 3 per cent.Delta has embarked on the most aggressive expansion, converting aircraft flying on domestic routes to boost its presence to Latin America and Europe, increasing its international capacity by a quarter in an effort to lift the share of overseas routes from 20 per cent to 35 per cent by next year, when it hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection.The capture of a London service from JFK, still subject to regulatory approval, is a key part of the plan as it builds up the largest US international gateway into a true hub by adding connecting services. “We have the biggest feeder network of any US carrier at JFK,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s executive vice-president network and revenue management:United will drop its single service from JFK to London Heathrow in October, cutting its total flights to the airport to nine from the 13 operated during the 2005 summer season. “As we improve our financial performance, we must make certain that we take full advantage of our network strength and fly routes that provide the best revenue opportunities for United and the greatest benefits to our customers,” said John Tague, United’s executive vice-president and chief revenue officer.The airline also hopes to capture some of the additional flights to China being allocated next year by the US transportation department. American, Northwest and Continental, which also operate US-China passenger services, are expected to launch fierce bids for the seven extra passenger flights a week.
619;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-07-28T19:50:16Z;UAL drops London to New York flights;;United Airlines (UAL), the second largest US carrier, is withdrawing from the London to New York aviation market and is selling its London/New York route authority to its US rival Delta Air Lines in a deal worth up to $21m.The decision by UAL to drop its daily service between London Heathrow and New York JFK will reduce competition on the one of the world’s most lucrative air routes.The UK/US bilateral air services treaty remains one of the most restrictive in world aviation, and under the terms of the so-called Bermuda II accord only four carriers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic from the UK and American Airlines and United Airlines from the US are allowed to operate direct services between Heathrow and the US.Delta Air Lines has bought only the London/New York route authority but remains unable to operate from Heathrow under the terms of the Bermuda II treaty, and will instead launch its service between New York JFK and London Gatwick.Delta, along with Continental Airlines of the US and BMI British Midland, has campaigned for years to break the stranglehold of the so-called Heathrow Four carriers on routes to the US, but its entry to the Heathrow market remains dependent on the outcome of negotiations under way between the US and the European Union on creating a liberalised transatlantic open aviation area.Delta said that it had paid UAL an initial fee of $13m for the London/New York route authority and would make further payments of $2m a year for four years, as long as there is no open skies deal in the meantime between Europe and the US.It said the deal was still subject to approval by the US transportation department, but it planned to begin its first daily service between Gatwick and JFK later this year and would add a second daily frequency on the route next spring.The contraction of UAL’s services at Heathrow has made it one of the most active players in the so-called grey market for take off and landing slots at one of the world’s most congested airports.It is understood that UAL has agreed to transfer its surplus slot pair at Heathrow to Air Canada in a three-year lease deal.Recently British Airways, the biggest operator at Heathrow, managed to buy two pairs of daily take off and landing slots for about £7m from Malev, the Hungarian flag carrier, which is moving its Budapest service from Heathrow to Gatwick.Late last year Virgin Atlantic, the UK long-haul airline controlled by Sir Richard Branson, agreed a five-year lease with United for a pair of Heathrow slots.Three years ago United sold two pairs of slots to British Airways for about £12m and subsequently agreed a three-year lease deal for another pair of slots with India’s Jet Airways.United, which emerged from three years in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January, has been reducing its Heathrow operations as part of its restructuring and next winter could be operating only nine daily flights from Heathrow, down from 13 during the summer of 2005 and 17 in 2000.UAL is restructuring its international network and is concentrating its efforts on its main US hubs including Chicago, Washington Dulles and San Francisco with more services to Asia/Pacific, as it consolidates its position as the largest transpacific passenger carrier.While UAL is dropping services from New York JFK to both London and Tokyo, Delta is expanding at JFK, which it is developing as one of its most important US hubs.Delta is the largest airline between the US and Europe and has been trying for a decade to expand into the New York to London market, the world’s most popular international route. It is the largest airline at JFK, which next year will become its second largest US hub by revenues after Atlanta and ahead of Cincinnati.With the addition of London it will serve 22 transatlantic markets from JFK including eight announced or launched this year.Delta, which collapsed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September last year, is expanding its international capacity by about 25 per cent in 2006 as its transfers capacity from the domestic market in the search for more profitable routes.
620;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-07-19T22:14:42Z;US airlines debate effects of higher fares;;American Airlines and rival Southwest on Wednesday expressed differing views on whether fare increases will drive some passengers away after the combination of price hikes and cost-cutting helped both report higher second-quarter profits.Southwest, the largest domestic US passenger carrier, said it had seen softness in some markets following a round of fare increases across the industry this year which have helped offset the impact of higher fuel prices.“I don’t think we’ve witnessed it,” countered Gerard Arpey, chief executive of American, the largest US carrier by revenues. “The demand has remained very strong despite a number of price increases.”The lack of pricing power has seen the US industry run up losses of more than $30bn since 2001, in spite of the global industry recovery that has fuelled record profits at many international rivals.US carriers have pulled hundreds of aircraft from the market over the past three years, and the capacity cuts have combined with buoyant traffic growth to generate record load factors and hopes that the industry could return to profitability this year for the first time since 2000.However, the sustainability of the recovery hinges on capacity discipline and the prospects for the economy, as well as the path of fuel prices which have forced carriers to find more innovative ways to cut costs and boost revenues.“There is some risk that further increases in oil prices could squeeze profits later this year, because airlines would face higher costs but have less ability to raise fares in a slowing U.S. economy,” noted Phil Baggaley, airline analyst at Standard & Poor’s.Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said load factors had softened in a “very small” number of markets, “implying that fares can be pushed as far as they can be pushed”. However, the carrier remained optimistic about the outlook and said it would “easily exceed” its target of lifting earnings per share by 15 per cent this year after net profits in the June quarter rose from $146m to $273m, excluding the impact of fuel hedges. Its shares closed up 8.2 per cent at $17.24.American, the only one of the six large US legacy carriers to escape bankruptcy, steered clear of offering any guidance as it’s profits climbed from $58m to $291m, only its second surplus in 22 quarters. Its shares ended 1.1 per cent higher at $24.62.Southwest carried 11.1 per cent more passengers in the latest quarter and has continued its rapid expansion at a time when cuts by legacy carriers such as Delta Air Lines and Northwest – which are both in bankruptcy protection – have reduced industry capacity by about 1 per cent year-on-year.Mr Kelly said he expected the domestic capacity environment to remain “benign”, but the switch of aircraft from the US market to international routes – notably to Europe – has led to some softness in transatlantic markets, said Tom Horton, American’s chief financial officer.Fuel remains the dominant theme for US airlines, and Southwest said its average cost rose 39.2 per cent to $1.42 per gallon in the latest quarter, including the benefit of the hedges. US airlines are currently paying about $2.30 a gallon for fuel, and American revised its full-year estimate for average costs from $2.07 to $2.18.Fuel-saving measures, new labour agreements and other efficiency gains are expected to help all of the major US carriers reach profitability in the June quarter, and the industry remains hopeful that it can secure special treatment in proposed reform of US pension regulations before Congress recesses next month.Under-funded schemes continue to weigh on balance sheets, and carriers have been lobbying to secure extra time and more generous terms to address their deficits. Delta and Northwest on Wednesday staged a joint lobbying effort in Congress to press for speedy reform.
621;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Mineta quits as transportation chief;;Norman Mineta, the only Democrat in the Bush administration cabinet, will leave next month as transportation secretary, having overseen the woes of the aviation industry after 9/11 and the bankruptcies of some of the biggest US airlines, United, Delta and Northwest.Mr Mineta, 74, a congressman for 20 years, was appointed by President Bill Clinton as secretary of commerce, becoming the first Asian-American cabinet member. He moved to transportation under Mr Clinton before becoming the first cabinet member to switch directly to a Republican administration.Tony Snow, White House spokesman, said Mr Mineta, the longest-serving transportation secretary, “put in five and a half years. That’s a long time.”Any successor will inherit two sensitive issues. The first concerns changing the definition governing the foreign ownership of US airlines, which could help kick-start the stalled open skies agreement with the European Union to deregulate transatlantic routes. Although the White House backs the proposed changes, the House last week voted 291 to 137 against a change, with 97 Republicans snubbing the White House.“Will a new transportation secretary be able to defy an overwhelming vote of the House that, if enacted into law, would prevent the DoT from issuing new rules on foreign ownership?” asked one airline lobbyist. “He could do that in August by proceeding with the rule change when the comment period is over. It would provide some window-dressing for the EU in the talks.”A second issue is the battle between the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association over contracts. “Members of Congress have called for arbitration between the two sides. It is an ongoing conflict and could become contentious,” the lobbyist said. Marion Blakey, FAA director, has been mooted as a possible successor to Mr Mineta.During his tenure, Mr Mineta “cut regulation and red tape to liberalise the commercial aviation market, established the Transportation Security Agency, [and] helped shape the highway bill”, said Mr Snow. “[He] has been working on highway safety and increasing seat belt use, trying to introduce financial discipline and sound economic principles to our passenger rail system.”Mr Mineta received bipartisan praise. Harry Reid, Senate minority leader hailed him as a “dedicated public servant”, while Bill Frist, Senate majority leader, called him an “effective partner for President Bush from the beginning of this administration”.
622;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-06-14T20:40:15Z;Airline chief warns of open-sky setback;;The head of Air France-KLM on Wednesday warned that European Union governments were likely to turn down a US proposal on airline ownership and control, endangering plans for a new transatlantic aviation pact.Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chairman and chief executive of the world’s largest airline by revenues, also said he could help Continental Airlines secure slots at London’s congested Heathrow airport. Continental, which has an alliance with the European carrier, has been the most vociferous opponent of the so-called open-skies deal.Mr Spinetta said in a speech in New York that the failure to secure open skies after three attempts would be “a disaster” for the industry, and was likely to trigger action by the European Commission to unwind existing deals between member states and the US. These have been deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice in 2002, but would have been superceded by a new agreement which the tow sides hope to implement next year.Mr Spinetta’s comments offered a stark warning to US officials that their attempts to deal with domestic opposition to proposed changes in the role of foreign investors in US carriers had backfired.The EU and the US reached a tentative deal on a new aviation treaty last November, but this hinges on the US transportation department coming up with a change in the control rules deemed “acceptable” by European transport ministers.The proposed changes unleashed a storm of criticism from US unions and Continental, which claimed they threatened jobs and posed a threat to national security as foreign investors may be more reluctant to transport US troops on their aircraft.He said the administration had taken “a step in the wrong direction” by refining the planned rule change last month. “I doubt the language in the supplemental proposal will be acceptable to the European side in its present form,” said Mr Spinetta.The DoT hopes to finalise its plan by the end of the summer, in time to present to EU transport ministers in October. However, the administration still has to overcome some domestic hurdles, notably lingering opposition in Congress.Continental Airlines, which is a member of the SkyTeam alliance alongside Air France-KLM, Northwest and Delta, has been the key driver of opposition on Capitol Hill, and Mr Spinetta’s speech was watched by Larry Kellner, Continental’s chairman and CEO.Mr Spinetta told the FT afterwards that its partner’s position had not created tension in the alliance, but said it could help dilute Continental’s key concern over its lack of access to slots at Heathrow, the world’s busiest international airport.An open-skies deal would not guarantee carriers suitable access to Heathrow unless they bought the slots on a grey market. Air France has already made an informal offer to help Delta access the airport, and Mr Spinetta said this could be extended to Continental. “Why not? We could consider it,” he told the FT.
623;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Northwest flight attendants reject new pay deal;;Northwest Airlines’ flight attendants on Tuesday rejected a proposed new pay deal which threatens its plan to exit bankruptcy protection next year, and could trigger a strike if the two sides fail to reach a fresh agreement.The overwhelming vote against the tentative pact agreed in March ends a run of recent labour deals in the US airline industry and could stir up existing tensions at other carriers.The Professional Flight Attendants’ Association, which is involved in a bitter battle to retain representation of Northwest’s flight attendants, said 80.4 per cent of the voters had rejected a pact which would have provided the carrier with $195m in annualised concessions.Northwest responded by asking the court for permission to cancel its existing deal and impose a new contract in its quest to secure $1.4bn in annual benefits and savings. Union leaders have warned that the move could lead to industrial action, and Northwest has sought an injunction to prevent a strike in an effort to reassure passengers making advance bookings.The flight attendants’ vote also threatens the new contract agreed with Northwest’s pilots, which hinges on fresh deals with all employee groups, and will delay efforts to secure debtor-in-possession financing from a group of banks.“We continue to urge the judge to deny NWA’s application to reject our contract,” said PFAA president Guy Meek said in a statement. “The carrier’s proposals are harsh and overreaching. They are misguided attempts by NWA management,” he added, pointing out that the airline had made an operating profit in March and April.Northwest and its larger rival Delta Air Lines filed for bankruptcy protection on the same day last September, and have been renegotiating financial and labour deals in a bid to cut costs closer to those of carriers such as US Airways and United, which have both emerged from court protection. Delta secured agreement from its pilots last week.Minneapolis-based Northwest had already withdrawn one request to cancel the existing cabin crew deal after the sides reached a tentative agreement. It has argued that a strike would be illegal, but there is also no guarantee that a judge will back its request. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Mesaba Airlines, a regional partner of Northwest, last month rejected a request from management to void its contract and sent the two sides back for further negotiations.
624;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-05-19T18:19:11Z;Northwest avoids strike with machinists deal;;Northwest Airlines on Friday secured another last-minute wage deal from staff to head off the threat of industrial action and lock-in potential cost savings.The US carrier’s baggage handlers and ramp workers reached a tentative new pay and benefits deal ahead of a court hearing scheduled for Friday where management planned to ask a bankruptcy judge for permission to void the existing contract and impose their own terms.The proposed pact with the International Association of Machinists, which represents 5,600 Northwest ground staff, marks the latest round of brinksmanship between airline executives and union officials at Northwest and Delta Air Lines, which both filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2005.Management at both airlines have threatened to use the courts to push through new deals if necessary, while unions leaders have pledged to strike if new wage and benefit terms are imposed, a move which Delta admitted had hit forward bookings.The proposed deal with the IAM means that Northwest and Delta have agreements in place with all staff, though some groups have yet to ratify deals made by their unions.“We are not recommending ratification because the terms are favorable, but because the alternative is worse,’” said Bobby DePace, president of District 143 of the IAM in a statement.Northwest pilots voted in favour of a new deal earlier this month, but this hinges on the airline securing agreement on new pay and conditions from its ground staff and flight attendants. Cabin crew are due to vote by June 9 in what labour experts believe will be the tightest ballot. The pilots voted in favour of their deal by a majority of two-to-one. Delta’s pilots are due to finish voting on their deal by May 31.Delta and Northwest continue to lose money, but capacity cuts across the US airline industry have allowed airlines to regain some pricing power and improve their financial performance, despite soaring fuel prices.
625;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Northwest pilots accept pay cuts to avert strike;;"Pilots at Northwest Airlines on Wednesday agreed to pay cuts and other concessions, heading off the potential for strike action at the fourth-largest US carrier by revenues.The package will save the airline $358m annually, and adds to other restructuring measures since it filed for bankruptcy protection last year. However, the narrow, two-to-one majority reflects continuing acrimony between labour and management in parts of the US airline industry.Northwest pilots had already agreed to a 15 per cent pay cut in December 2004 in an unsuccessful effort to keep the carrier out of bankruptcy. Their counterparts at Delta Air Lines are voting on a tentative new deal agreed last month, having also threatened to strike if management sought to impose cuts. A decision is due May 31.The Air Line Pilots’ Association at Northwest said 63 per cent of voters backed the new deal, which extends a temporary 23.9 per cent pay cut agreed last November.However, the deal hinges on Northwest securing agreements on pay and conditions from other labour groups. Union officials expect a June 6 vote by flight attendants to be very close. Some ground staff have already accepted revised terms, but baggage handlers rejected management proposals; a trial is set for May 15 to determine whether fresh terms can be imposed.Negotiations at Northwest and Delta dragged on for several months amid strike threats which caused some passengers to book elsewhere. However, the negotiating power of airline workers has been reduced by the sector’s financial distress which has seen more than 100,000 staff laid off over the past five years.Northwest pilots had been concerned about the company’s efforts to outsource some flying to a new subsidiary, but have won assurances that they will operate most of the flights on the proposed start-up."

It will also defer 12 of the A320s due to arrive in 2007-09 until 2010-12. It has 82 Airbus aircraft on order, and will keep its E-190 deliveries unchanged.“We are going to cut our cost and figure out how our average fares can go up a bit,” chief executive David Neeleman said.Capacity cuts by airlines including Delta, Northwest and US Airways have helped carriers push up fares across the US industry, though only Southwest – which has accelerated its own growth plans – and Alaska Airlines managed to record a profit in the first quarter. AirTran, another fast-growing low-fare carrier, reports on Thursday.JetBlue forecast a profit in the second quarter but would still record a full-year loss. The airline reported a net loss of $32m for the quarter to March 31 compared with a profit of $6m in the same period last year.The loss per share of 18 cents was slightly better than analysts’ forecasts, as a 4 per cent rise in passenger yields lifted revenues by 31 per cent to 490m.JetBlue ended the quarter with $419m in cash and investment securities.

628;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-04-23T13:57:53Z;Union leaders back new Delta pay deal;;The threat of a catastrophic strike at Delta Air Lines receded further late on Friday night when the leaders of its pilots’ union agreed to support a tentative new pay deal.Pilots will start voting on the proposed pact in mid-May and complete the process by May 31 having pledged to strike if management at the bankrupt airline pressed ahead and tore up their existing contract in an effort to cut costs.The threat of industrial action has already hurt bookings at the third-largest US airline by revenues, and labour experts said the 5,930 unionised pilots remain split on the proposed new deal after more than six months of often bitter wrangling with management.However, people with close knowledge of the situation said Delta’s pilots tended to follow their leadership’s recommendations despite misgivings at being required to make another round of concessions. A temporary wage deal agreed last December was passed with only 58 per cent support.Delta, which is also shedding 12,000 staff as it shrinks its network in a bid to exit bankruptcy protection next year, has already imposed pay and benefit cuts on its non-unionised and salaried staff.The airline confirmed on Saturday that the proposed pilots’ deal would provide around $280m in annualised savings, short of the $325m which Delta had sought from flight crew. Delta said the overall package had been amended to take account of “the likelihood” that it would terminate its pension plan and turn it over to the Federal pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The four-year pact also requires bankruptcy court approval.Pilot leaders had been scathing about Delta’s negotiating tactics since talks began last year, and an arbitration panel was eventually called in to resolve the conflict after Delta threatened to impose a new pay deal. Pilots promised to strike if this happened, a move which would have grounded the carrier within 48 hours.Pilots at Northwest Airlines - which filed for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta last September - are due to finish voting on a tentative contract on May 3 and have threatened to strike if management imposes new terms. The division among pilots over whether to accept the proposal will be highlighted at a meeting on April 25 when union leaders will vote on whether to recall the chairman and vice-chairman of the union. Flight attendants are also considering a proposal, with voting due to conclude next month.Industrial action at either Delta or Northwest would cause global disruption as both have extensive international networks, with Northwest focused on Asian routes and Delta seeking to become the largest transatlantic operator.
629;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-04-14T22:53:29Z;Delta pilots’ agreement could avert strike;;The threat of a catastrophic strike at Delta Air Lines, the third biggest US airline by revenues, receded on Friday when the bankrupt carrier secured a tentative restructuring agreement with its pilots.The proposed pact has yet to be put to Delta’s 5,930 pilots, a significant hurdle given the widespread discontent with the airline’s management after weeks of intense negotiations. But if approved, the deal would mark a crucial step in the carrier’s reorganisation as it seeks to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and set a benchmark for other struggling airlines.Pilots at Northwest Airlines – which filed for bankruptcy protection on the same day as Delta last September – are due to finish voting on a tentative contract on May 3 and have threatened to strike if management imposes new terms. Flight attendants are also considering a proposal. Union officials indicated both pilots and attendants were evenly divided over acceptance.Delta and its pilots’ union gave no details of their proposed deal, part of the carrier’s efforts to cut costs after suffering $10bn in losses over six years.The sides have been negotiating for six months over pay cuts, rule changes and compensation for pilots if Delta terminates its defined-benefit pension scheme.The union said it would review the proposal before deciding whether to recommend it to members. Experts said Delta’s pilots tended to follow the leadership, but noted that a temporary wage deal last December was passed with only 58 per cent support. A mediation panel drafted in to broker a deal will postpone a decision due today on whether Delta can impose its own terms on pilots. The union had said it would strike if the panel allowed Delta to tear up the existing contract, a disruption that both sides agree would put the airline out of business. The airline and the union declined to comment.
630;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-04-04T22:28:54Z;Delta pilots vote to authorise strike;;Delta Air Lines on Tuesday faced a greater threat of going out of business as its pilots voted overwhelmingly in favour of a strike to be called if the bankrupt carrier is allowed to tear up its labour agreements.The airline, the third-largest US carrier by revenues, has said a strike of more than 48 hours would force it to shut down because of a debt covenant that would call on Delta to pay back more than $2bn in debtor-in-possession financing.The 95 per cent vote in favour of a strike allows the pilots’ union to set a strike date and comes days before a three-person intermediation panel is expected to rule whether Delta can tear up its contract with the pilots.Delta has said the threat of industrial action has already slowed new reservations for this month and for May, but said that yesterday’s vote would not disrupt services and that it continued to seek an agreement with the union.The carrier, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September last year, has asked courts to allow it to cancel contracts with its pilots unless they consent to an 18 per cent reduction in pay.That would come in addition to an already agreed 14 per cent temporary pay cut aimed at saving Delta $143m per year.Delta’s pilots previously agreed to $1bn in annual concessions, including a 32.5 per cent wage cut, in a five-year deal in 2004.Delta said the additional concessions from the union, part of a $3bn cost-cutting plan, are essential for its survival, but Lee Moak, chairman of the pilots’ union, called the demands “over-reaching”.“We will not capitulate to these demands based on a fear of what may lie ahead,” he wrote in a message to Delta’s 6,000 pilots.Delta’s talks with its pilots reached a stalemate last month, when the two sides went to the arbitration panel they agreed to consult if they failed to reach a permanent accord by March 1.There have been warnings of strikes in support by pilots at other airlines in the SkyTeam alliance in which Delta is a member. Pilots at Delta and Northwest, another bankrupt US carrier, have secured support for their cause from pilot representatives at other SkyTeam members, which includes AirFrance-KLM, Continental, Alitalia and Czech Republic’s ČSA.Under its restructuring plan, Delta has simplified its fare system and shifted more capacity towards more lucrative transatlantic routes, decreasing flights in its domestic US network.
631;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-30T23:56:21Z;Northwest to launch regional carrier in June;;Northwest Airlines confirmed on Thursday that it planned to launch a new standalone subsidiary in June using regional jets flown by pilots currently on furlough.The new unit, dubbed Compass Airlines, is a scaled-down version of Northwest's original plan to outsource much of its short-haul domestic flying, a move dropped after fierce opposition from pilots.The disclosure comes amid a series of beauty contests by US carriers seeking new contracts from the independent regional airlines which handle much of their shorthaul routes.Northwest has asked its regional partners, Mesaba Airlines and Pinnacle Airlines, to rebid for their business. Continental Airlines could announce a replacement for the operator it plans to withdraw from ExpressJet as soon as next week, according to people close to the discussions.The Houston-based carrier said in January that it would withdraw 69 of the 274 Embraer aircraft which it subleases to ExpressJet after the two failed to agree on new contract terms.Continental and other major carriers have enjoyed a relatively harmonious relationship with the regional carriers in recent years, but the pressure to cut costs has created strains.The large carriers typically control the aircraft and cover fuel costs, but subcontract the flying to take advantage of the lower labour costs available at the regionals, who have remained profitable through the industry downturn.Mesa Airlines, one of the largest regional carriers, is viewed as the frontrunner to take on the additional Continental business, according to people close to the talks. Mesa, which recently expanded its flying for Delta Air Lines, declined to comment though confirmed it had bid for the Continental and Northwest contracts.Phoenix-based Mesa’s rapid expansion also saw it make abortive bids for Independence Air, a Washington-based low-cost carrier which folded in January.Northwest has acquired the failed airline’s operating licence in an effort to speed up the regulatory approval of Compass. Northwest said in a regulatory filing that it would make a decision next month on the Compass fleet between the Bombardier CRJ-900 and the Embraer EMB-175.The inaugural service in June will be with a single aircraft.”The expansion of Northwest’s regional flying through the proposed Compass Airlines operation is an essential part of Northwest’s restructuring plan,” it said in a statement.Mesa has since turned its attention to the fast-growing Hawaiian market with the launch in June of intra-island services through a new unit called go!, sparking a fare war with the two incumbents, Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines, which have both emerged as from bankruptcy protection.Curiously, both Mesa and Northwest have chosen failed or discontinued brands for their new units. EasyJet, the UK-based low-cost carrier, acquired the British Airways-offshoot Go in 2002. Compass Airlines was a twice-failed new entrant in the Australian market which finally liquidated in 1993.
632;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-30T00:51:17Z;Tom Horton returns as CFO to American Airlines;;Tom Horton is leaving AT&T to become chief financial officer at American Airlines, a position he vacated four years ago to join the telecommunications group.The US airline had initially said it was focused on an internal hire to fill the slot left by James Beer, who resigned in February to join Symantec, the software security group.He becomes American’s fourth CFO in as many years, and the departure of his predecessors to other sectors – coupled to a parade of senior departures at other airlines – had fuelled the concern in recent months about executive retention within the industry, a debate intensified by union opposition to management pay agreements.Delta Air Lines has warned that management attrition had risen eight-fold since the group filed for bankruptcy protection last September, and fellow Chapter 11 carrier Northwest has also lost staff.Mr Horton spent 17 years at American before joining AT&T, where he rose to become vice-chairman ahead of the group’s $67bn bid for rival BellSouth earlier this month. The airline described the hire as “a bold move” to position the company “with a strong leader from outside the airline industry.The airline also announced the planned retirement of Pete Dolara, who spearheaded its expansion to become the largest airline flying into central America. Craig Kreeger, the head of its European and Asian business, has been promoted to become senior vice-president international.UK-born Mr Beer joined AMR, American’s parent, in 1991 from Andersen Consulting and assumed the CFO role in December 2003 when Jeff Campbell left to join McKesson, the consulting firm. He in turn took over from Mr Horton in 2002.Mr Beer’s base salary at AMR was about half that of Gregory Myers, who retired as Symantec’s CFO at the end of last year.American has pledged to review its executive compensation strategy amid widespread employee discontent over plans that could result in 1,000 top managers receiving more than $70m in cash bonuses this year.
633;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-27T22:00:24Z;American Airlines to hold back summer expansion;;American Airlines, the largest US carrier by revenue, has decided to restrict the traditional expansion of domestic routes during the busy summer months as part of wide-ranging effort to break even for the first time in six years.“Our levels of flying don’t peak up as much this summer,” said Henry Joyner, American’s senior vice-president for planning.The move will test rival US carriers’ new-found discipline of limiting additional capacity to push through fare increases as the airlines try to cut costs and boost revenues.Mr Joyner said increasing the number of flights operational in peak season meant airport gates, as well as staff, were running at sub-optimal levels at other times. “You can’t sustain that year round,” he told the FT.The combination of cutting costs and buoyant traffic has left analysts hopeful that the US airline industry can reach breakeven this year after soaring fuel costs led to a combined loss of more than $5bn in 2005.However, the outlook hinges on both fuel prices and whether carriers are tempted to add more flights to capture revenue from a recent round of fare increases, a move that could dilute earnings.Domestic capacity, which fell 3.9 per cent in the past 12 months, is forecast to remain flat over the year. Legacy airlines such as American and Delta are cutting US routes in favour of more international flying, though low-cost rivals such as Southwest and JetBlue continue to add dozens of aircraft.The impact of fare rises saw the average revenue per seat jump 17.5 per cent in February, while more efficient use of aircraft enabled carriers to grow traffic slightly in spite of offering less capacity.However, rising load factors – the amount of seats filled that rose to 75.9 per cent in February– will also provide a challenge for airlines during the peak season, said executives.“We’ve reached about the limit of where we want to put load factors,” said Jim Whitehurst, Delta’s chief operating officer.Delta, which hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection in 2007, has launched its largest international expansion in an effort to capture more profitable passengers. However, rivals on both sides of the Atlantic and in Latin America are taking a similar approach, leading to concerns that industry margins could be squeezed.“The growth of capacity over the north Atlantic is going to bear watching,” said Mr Joyner, though he added early bookings for summer travel were “good”.
634;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-22T23:44:44Z;Airlines to climb out of six-year loss-making run;;The global aviation industry is forecast to return to profit in 2007, ending six years of net losses.The International Air Transport Association (Iata) on Wednesday almost halved its previous forecast for losses this year, published three months ago, from $4.3bn to $2.2bn (€1.8bn, £1.3bn), largely as a result of stronger economic growth prospects in Asia and Europe. It raised its forecast net profit for 2007 from $6.2bn to $7.2bn, as rising revenues and further cost-cutting are expected to offset high oil prices.Giovanni Bisignani, Iata director-general, said in a speech at the Wings Club in New York that there was “a new cautious optimism” in the industry.The global airline industry is emerging from the worst recession in its history after suffering accumulated net losses of $43.6bn in the five years from 2001 to 2005.It plunged into loss in 2001, as the weakening US economy and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US hit demand for air travel, and it has subsequently been further hit by the war in Iraq, the outbreak of Sars, a surge in the oil price as well as the challenge of the rapid growth of low-cost carriers.The US industry has been worst hit with four of the top seven US airlines forced to seek bankruptcy protection from their creditors. US Airways and United Airlines have since emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, but both Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are still in the midst of Chapter 11 restructuring.Mr Bisignani said that while the trend was positive, the industry was “nowhere near sustainability”. The net profit of $7.2bn forecast for 2007 still represents a return on capital of only 3 per cent.This would be far below the 7-8 per cent return expected by investors in other sectors of similar risk. The aviation industry would still be failing to cover its cost of capital.Mr Bisignani said the improving financial prospects were at risk from pandemic health scares, including avian flu, a further surge in oil prices or by the addition of excessive new capacity. Global airlines ordered a record number of new aircraft last year, led by carriers in China, India and the Middle East.The revised Iata profit and loss forecasts are based on an average crude oil price (Brent crude) of $57 a barrel in 2006 and $52 in 2007. Mr Bisignani said oil remained “the single biggest challenge for airline profitability”.Iata said economic growth had been stronger than expected in recent months. This, coupled with capacity reductions, had finally started to increase airlines’ pricing power in US domestic markets.The most significant rate of improvement is forecast for North American carriers, as they benefit from the deep restructuring in bankruptcy protection, reduced domestic capacity and increased pricing power. Estimated net losses of $10.8bn in 2005 should be halved to $5.4bn this year, with the North American industry forecast to return to a profit of $1.1bn in 2007.
635;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-20T20:32:17Z;Observer - US;;"Delta’s plan to get its service off the rocksDelta Air Lines has been leading the field when it comes to raising domestic fares. But Gerald Grinstein, the struggling carrier’s chief executive, has an idea that may make the rising prices easier to swallow.After admitting Delta’s service has become a bit tired, he announced a revamp, which includes a pepped-up drinks list for passengers.But Observer isn’t sure that Grinstein should wield the swizzle stick. “I’m not one who deviates much from Scotch whisky, but there are those who like things called mojitos,” he told reporters on Monday.Just so you’ll know, Jerry, a first-class mojito is made by muddling sugar and soda with plenty of fresh mint. Then add the rum and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.A nice mojito might be just the ticket as Grinstein negotiates with Delta pilots, who are threatening to strike over a contract dispute.Grinstein says the threat of a pilot strike is starting to hurt bookings. Perhaps an added incentive – say a 2-for-1 special – will help to lure those reluctant passengers.The political strain in Thailand is beginning to bear down on Bangkok’s taxi drivers, a constituency Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand’s prime minister, has assiduously cultivated over the years.Many of the city’s taxi drivers come from the countryside, which has received considerable largesse from the premier.They have often been granted state bank loans to buy their own cabs, instead of renting the vehicles each day from bosses. Taxi drivers were even invited en masse to Government House to lunch with the premier a couple of years ago, an unprecedented event. In December, the prime minister also hosted 10,000 cabbies
at a Bangkok stadium, and giving away three taxis and 10 houses – valued at a total Bt3.5m ($90,000) – to winners of a lucky draw.It has paid off. Bangkok residents and newspapers have reported that taxi drivers are frequently ejecting passengers who criticise the prime minister.Even cabbies who consent to drive passengers from the other side of the political divide have made their position clear, by turning up pro-Thaksin radio stations.With a deadlock between Thaksin and the determined Bangkok protesters demanding his resignation showing no sign of ending any time soon, any little bit helps.Thaksin has relied on them to shore up support in the past, too. Several years ago, he urged Bangkok cabbies to report if their passengers spoke ill of the government.Things must really be desperate in the Felipe Calderón camp. The growing evidence that he is trailing by at least 10 points in the race to become Mexico’s next president has forced the centre-right candidate to resort to unorthodox tactics.Visitors to his website – www.felipe-calderon.org – may have noticed a new addition: a video game called “race for the presidency”.No doubt designed to invigorate Calderón’s lacklustre campaign, the game involves trying to get the candidate to the presidential palace by slaying his two main rivals, Roberto Madrazo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) and Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the leftwing Democratic Revolution Party (PRD).Losing out to López Obrador ends with the PRD candidate trampling all over Mexico’s law book. Falling victim to Madrazo, portrayed as an ageing dinosaur, leads to the PRI’s candidate stealing ballot boxes. “Just like old times,” says the Madrazaurus as he sips a cocktail on a beach surrounded by sacks of cash.Successfully negotiating the pitfalls, of course, leads to Calderón safely inside the presidential palace ready to guide Mexico to a dynamic and prosperous future. Nice idea? Perhaps. But there’s one small problem: it’s very hard to win. Observer tried and failed at least 10 times.Microsoft veteran Jeff Raikes, who runs the company’s business software group, knows better than most how personal computers have transformed the way huge corporations do business.But even before joining Microsoft 25 years ago, he had seen what computing could do to change the most traditional of small businesses: his family’s cattle farm.“I was a farm kid and I bought an IBM PC to help run the farm with my brother,” he says.His brother, who still runs the farm, has been using a portable PC and radio ID tags to keep track of the cows at the stalls.But rather than buy a specially ruggedised machine for the job, Jeff says his brother has wrapped the screen and keyboard of an ordinary laptop in bubble-wrap.“He doesn’t like to spend money,” he confides."
636;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-20T17:13:40Z;Delta warns of damage from strike threat;;Delta Air Lines on Monday warned that a threatened strike by its pilots was scaring away passengers, though its chief executive said he expected a deal to head off any industrial action.The third-largest US carrier by revenue is an embroiled in a heated dispute with its pilots over extra concessions being sought as part of a turnaround plan after filing for bankruptcy protection last September.Delta’s pilots’ union has said it will strike if an arbitration panel gives management the go-ahead to void their existing contracts, with a decision due by April 15. The airline said such a move would force it out of business as a covenant from lenders providing more than $2bn in debtor-in-possession financing allows the loan to be called if a strike lasts more than 48 hours.“The threat of a possible strike has affected bookings [in April and May],” said Gerald Grinstein, Delta’s chief executive, at a briefing with reporters. However, he said the strike ballot was part of the pilots’ negotiating stance and that a walkout was unlikely. “I think the pilot will agree that they have to get it done. I would be very surprised if it’s not done by late spring.”Delta’s restructuring has also seen it shift aircraft from the domestic US market towards more profitable international routes, notably to Europe and Latin America. Other carriers are following the same path, and analysts believe margins are already being compressed in overseas markets, while US airlines’ alliance partners are concerned that their own profits are being affected.“I wouldn’t say that Air France-KLM is necessarily thrilled by our level of transatlantic growth,” said Jim Whitehurst, Delta’s chief operating officer. The two airlines are leading members of the SkyTeam alliance alongside Northwest and Continental, which are also boosting international flights.“There is a potential tension between alliance partners as you move more and more into the markets they serve,” Mr Grinstein told the FT. “But Air France needs a strong US partner, and I think they understand what we are doing and why we are doing it.” He declined to comment on speculation that the French carrier could provide it with financial support.Delta said it remained committed to gaining access to London’s Heathrow airport following the planned liberalisation of routes between the US and the European Union, but said a deal was unlikely before next year.A EU-US framework deal was agreed last December, but has been bogged down by domestic US opposition to the administration’s plans to give foreign investors more say in the running of US airlines.“I think there is only a 30 per cent chance that something will be done this year, and a little bit better than a 50 per cent chance next year,” said Mr Grinstein.
637;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-03-12T19:43:27Z;Delta pilots ready to defy tribunal;;Delta Air Lines’ attempt to impose a new contract on pilots will be presented to an independent tribunal on Monday amid warnings that threatened strike action could spill over to other members of the SkyTeam alliance.The Atlanta-based carrier and its flight crew failed after five months of talks to reach agreement on a new round of concessions, which Delta maintains are essential for its survival.The two sides agreed to turn over the final decision to a three-person panel due to rule by April 15, but Delta pilots insist they will strike for the first time in their history if the panel sides with management.“We are looking forward to presenting our case [but] we are going to fight and we are going to strike,” said Lee Moak, chairman of the Delta pilots’ committee in an interview with the FT.The union and pilots at fellow bankrupt Northwest Airlines last week secured support from pilot representatives at other members of SkyTeam, which includes Air France-KLM, Alitalia, Continental and Korean Air.“We believe this is also a global problem,” said Capt Moak, who suggested that flying by SkyTeam members could become concentrated in countries with the lowest operating costs.The pilot pact calls for “specific and extensive measures” from other SkyTeam pilots if Delta or Northwest succeed in imposing new deals. Pilot union leaders at Northwest will this week decide whether to recommend a tentative agreement on a new contract, and its flight attendants also reached a preliminary deal after months of talks.The Northwest pilots deal would shift some domestic flying to a standalone unit, but keep most of the work in-house and preserve the carrier’s defined-benefits pension plan.United Airlines and US Airways both used bankruptcy protection to transfer legacy pension costs to a federal agency, and Capt Moak said Delta will follow.The airline has already frozen payments to the pilot plan, which is underfunded by around $8bn.“The management team has told us that they intend to have the pension terminated in the near future. They were very explicit,” he said.Delta maintains it is committed to an agreement with the pilots and said no final decision has been taken on the pension plan.The third-largest US carrier by revenues, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection last Septemberand hopes to stem five years of heavy losses by cutting labour and financing costs and shifting aircraft from the domestic market toward focusing on more profitable international routes.

The company had a splashy IPO that raised $1.86bn and Carpenter was called on frequently to talk about the internet and where everything was going.But her name never really came up on Monday during the discussion of NBC’s $600m agreement to buy iVillage. This omission was not due to the usual reason – that the founder or former chief executive had brought shame on the company – but because Carpenter had done such a good job of dropping out of sight completely.She quit the company in 2001 following a serious slide in its shares. It appeared she was taking advice straight from iVillage by stepping out of the corporate world to focus on her family and to write a self-help book. She married Peter Olson, the uxorious chief executive of Random House, and has kept a low profile since.

640;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Venezuela delays plan to restrict US flights;;Venezuela has delayed planned restrictions on US civilian and cargo flights until March 31 while the government of President Hugo Chávez seeks to settle a dispute with the US over access for Venezuelan carriers.The government said last week that it would ban Continental and Delta from flying to the country, and severely restrict services by American Airlines, from March 1 because a limitation on Venezuelan airlines, imposed by the Federation Aviation Administration in 1995, remained in force.The National Aviation Institute said at the weekend that it would embark on negotiations with the three US carriers, as well as Fedex, the cargo transporter, to search for an agreement.Venezuela wants the US to give it access for its airlines that is equivalent to the frequency that currently is permitted for US carriers to fly to Venezuela.Continental and Delta on Friday pledged they would continue services to Venezuela despite the Venezuela threat, which inflamed already tense relations between the countries.Officials from the two governments and the airlines met on Friday in a bid to resolve the impasse.Continental and Delta acknowledged that the final decision rested with the two governments.Venezuelan officials said the threatened move was in response to the failure by the US to lift restrictions on flights by Venezuelan carriers to the US, imposed in 1994 on safety grounds. This bars Venezuelan airlines from adding new capacity or aircraft, while US carriers have continued to build services and dominate traffic between the two countries.Francisco Paz, president of the National Aviation Institute, said last week the US had turned down numerous requests to increase flights by Venezuelan airlines. Aside from Aeropostal and Santa Barbara, President Chavez is also expanding Conviasa, a new state-backed carrier.“US authorities have failed to give Venezuelan airlines the rights they deserve in line with bilateral accords,” said the aviation institute.The US government introduced a new aviation oversight programme in 1994 which placed Venezuela in category 2, implying problems in the country’s airline safety and security systems. A number of other Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Peru, were put in the same category but have since been upgraded to category 1, allowing their airlines to expand services to and from the US.US officials made no comment on the current talks, but said the Federal Aviation Administration had worked for a decade to help their counterparts in Venezuela improve safety, and offered further technical support last year.The strained relations between Venezuela and the US have deteriorated markedly in recent weeks. Mr Chávez has started to reiterate his allegations that Washington is conspiring against his “revolution’’, while US officials have begun to step up their claims that Mr Chávez is a “problem’’ for Latin America.Venezuelan officials have also angered western oil groups by imposing a new tax and ownership regime on operators in the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter, and accused Washington of trying to block its attempts to buy military aircraft from Brazil.Earlier this year, Venezuela took state control over 32 privately operated oilfields in preparation for their conversion into jointventures that will have state ownership of up to 70 per cent. ExxonMobil was the only oil company that refused to convertto the new legal framework, resulting in its removal from a $3bnpetrochemical project with the Venezuelan government.The ban and restrictions on US carriers will add to travel difficulties between Caracas and the US, if not the rest of the world. Since the start of the year, international travel in and out of the capital has become anepic journey after the closure of a bridge that supports the main highwaybetween Caracas and the international airport.
641;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-02-21T18:52:56Z;Virgin America’s battle to get off the ground;;"The wanderlust of Silicon Valley wannabes and prospective investors made San Francisco-Atlanta the most profitable route in Fred Reid’s network when he was president of Delta Air Lines.Five years after the dotcom bubble burst, the Californian native is criss-
crossing the country himself in an attempt to launch a new domestic low-cost airline, Virgin America, before the end of the year.Mr Reid, an industry veteran with previous stints at Lufthansa, Pan Am and American, left Delta to become Virgin America’s chief executive in April 2004, and had hoped to launch the San Francisco-based airline a year ago.However, investor roadshows in the spring of 2004 coincided with a deteriorating industry environment as rising fuel prices and fierce fare wars frustrated efforts by most US carriers to reverse the heavy losses suffered since 2001.The Virgin America story illustrates the difficulty of keeping complex management projects on track in a volatile industry. For Mr Reid, the delay has meant finding new investors, renegotiating aircraft contracts and keeping employees motivated while the company aligns itself for takeoff.Since the 2004 setback, though, some prospects for the business have improved. The industry is now awash with cash, as a mix of private equity groups, hedge funds and traditional investors have pumped up stock prices and helped other carriers emerge from bankruptcy protection.Virgin America announced its own financial backers last December – two private equity funds and assorted Virgin Group companies – allowing management to launch its bid for regulatory approval. For now, the application lies beached in Washington despite Virgin America’s insistence that it meets all the criteria of a “US-controlled airline”, a point some established rivals challenge.Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin has long held ambitions to break into the US domestic airline market. Its plan was to avoid the traditional losses in the sector with an innovative business model and heavy exploitation of the Virgin brand.Yet US ownership rules require domestic investors to control 75 per cent of the voting stock and US nationals to control its operations. While Mr Branson continued to make optimistic noises about Virgin America, Mr Reid and his small executive team were left to find the cash and develop the business strategy as the launch date slipped.“It was slightly worrisome...We felt we were on the finish line on a number of occasions and we ended up not being for a number of reasons,” says Mr Reid.Seated outside a San Francisco coffee shop and dressed casually in a fleece, Mr Reid displays many of the relaxed qualities you would expect from a Branson company chief, from a shared love of surfing to business cards printed simply with “Fred” and his e-mail address.If the doubts of many in the airline industry are to be believed, though, he might have been better to stay on the beach. They argue that the power of the Virgin brand is not enough to guarantee success in the cut-throat US market. Moreover, other carriers such as Jet­Blue appeared to have stolen a march on any attempt to differentiate their operation through passenger service, by providing live seat-back television and satellite radio.This is Mr Reid’s second attempt to establish a low-cost carrier. While at Delta he launched Song, a low-cost airline within an airline that the bankrupt carrier is now folding into its own operations, he says, because of clashes with the company culture. “Song was a noble experiment and very, very popular with the customers,” he argues.Virgin America, by contrast, was an opportunity to start “with an absolute clean sheet”. Mr Reid says that the airline has a chance to avoid the inherited and unnecessary overheads that caused Song’s demise. It has adopted a guiding principle of building a cost structure that is 25 to 30 per cent below that of rival operators. “What we discarded was lots of unnecessary infrastructure,” he explains.The use of new aircraft would help to minimise operating expenses while information technology has been bought off-the-shelf and customised with open architecture. This avoids the need for the expensive mainframe computers that big carriers use for tasks such as accounting and reservations.Mr Reid says Virgin America was able to take advantage of package deals offered by vendors for services such as maintenance, in-flight entertainment and catering. The last two, he says, will allow the airline to differentiate itself from competitors, alongside user-friendly new booking systems.The delays forced renegotiation of aircraft contracts with Airbus and Gecas, the leasing company owned by General Electric, which include firm orders for 35 aircraft and options to increase the fleet to 105.However, Virgin America benefited from locking in deliveries and prices before the record orders of last year – mainly fuelled by low-cost operators in Asia – filled up factories while rising raw material costs lifted prices. Boeing and Airbus have few spare narrow-body aircraft available before the end of 2008.Mr Reid has expanded employee numbers from a handful of executives to more than 40 since he joined, and they could reach 200 by the end of the year. All are based near San Francisco International Airport.“I had a very, very specific idea of what I wanted – different ages and genders [but], first and foremost, I was looking for a personal attitude,” he says, describing qualities of self-deprecation and professional focus that characterise other parts of the Virgin Group.Unusually, he looked outside the airline industry for candidates to fill some of the venture’s most senior posts. For the role of marketing chief he refused to interview any seasoned airline candidates, opting instead for Spence Kramer, an advertising vice-president at ESPN, the US sports channel. The mix also includes Bob Dana, a former Credit Suisse banker hired before Mr Reid to develop the business strategy and now chief financial officer. Don Carty, a former chief executive of American Airlines, was appointed as chairman.Mr Reid admits the long gestation period took its toll at times: “The challenge was keeping people focused on a theoretical launch date and not losing touch, and then every now and again a pizza party and copious amounts of beer seems to help.”He sought employees who were good at handling blurred lines of responsibility. “We had so many things to do, and so few people. The in-flight person does a lot for flight operations, who [in turn] does a lot for safety and security. The airport guy has become our facilities guru – everything down to ordering furniture.”The tables and chairs come, partly at least, with the financial backing of San Francisco officials keen to reinvigorate an airport that lost one-third of its premium traffic when the technology travellers downgraded to economy or stayed at home to nurse their ailing stock options. From its San Francisco base, Virgin America is expected to link other large west coast markets such as Los Angeles, Seattle and San Diego with Boston, New York and Washington.Mr Reid says there are no plans to link directly with Virgin Atlantic – which flies to most of these cities – and says he is open to marketing relationships both inside and outside the Branson sphere. One possible link is with Virgin Blue, the Australia-based carrier that is eyeing routes to the US west coast.“I think the Virgin brand is the largest single differentiating factor that we have,” says Mr Reid. “We’re going to be a very clear sibling.”FRED REID’S LAWS OF AIRLINE SUCCESSVirgin America CEO Fred Reid is an industry veteran, having held executive positions at Delta and Lufthansa. He offers four “federal laws” for airlines to succeed.■Operations: “Ninety-nine per cent completion and good on-time performance.”■Costs: “We have gone out and hired a very talented team in order to keep costs low.”■Customer service: “You can operate an airline with poor customer service – and a lot of people have proved that – but when it comes to a wing-to-wing choice, they will gravitate to better service.”■Employee relations: “This is an industry where people work largely unsupervised. They have to believe in the values of the company, and if your values are just slogans they are going to catch you and nail you on it.”"
642;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-02-15T04:10:47Z;Airlines raided in worldwide cargo cartel probe;;A worldwide cartel probe has seen European, US and South Korean antitrust officials jointly raiding the offices of British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and several other air cargo companies.Airline officials said the investigation focused on the way in which the industry imposes surcharges for items such as fuel and security, a process that some shippers said lacked transparency.The European Commission said its officials had ?carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of several air cargo carriers in several EU member states?. The Brussels-based regulator added that it had ?reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated? European rules that prohibit price-fixing agreements and other cartel abuses.The US Department of Justice said it was also investigating the industry. Some US freight operators such as American Airlines have received subpoenas and were co-operating with the authorities, though American ? which partners BA in the oneworld alliance ? said it was not the target of the investigation.?I can confirm that the antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the air cargo industry. We are co-ordinating with the EU and other foreign competition authorities,? a spokeswoman for the department said.Japan Airlines, Asia?s leading carrier, confirmed on Wednesday that officials from both the EC and the DoJ had visited one of its cargo offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and a cargo branch office New York?s John F Kennedy airport.?We will full cooperate with any investigation,? said a JAL spokesman in Tokyo. The airline said that its operations in Japan were running as usual, and that no inquiries or visits had been made by Japan?s Fair Trade Commission, the local anti-monopoly watchdog.JAL is ranked twelve in the international cargo industry, in terms of tonnes carried, by the International Air Transport Association.All Nippon Airways, Japan?s second-biggest carrier, said that its cargo operations abroad had not been questioned by officials.Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, said on Wednesday that EC and DoJ officials visited its Frankfurt, Los Angeles and San Francisco offices.?Cathay Pacific Airways is in cooperation with the European Commission and United States Department of Justine in respect of their investigation into air cargo operations?, it said in a statement.In South Korea, the local antitrust commission raided the offices of the country?s two airlines as part of the worldwide investigation. Korean Air and its smaller rival Asiana Airlines said officials from the Korean Fair Trade Commission made an unscheduled visit to their cargo offices in Seoul on Tuesday to inquire over freight shipment charges. But they said their overseas offices had not been investigated by either European or US officials.An Asiana spokesman said the KFTC officials carried out inspections into fuel surcharges on cargo shipments. A KFTC spokesman declined to comment on the details of the investigation but said that the targeted airlines could face corrective measures or financial penalties of up to 10 per cent of sales if they were found guilty of operating a price-fixing or market-sharing cartel.The EC does not reveal the names of the companies it has raided, but several groups said they were under investigation or had received ?requests for information?.BA said that it had received information requests both from the EC and the DoJ. It is understood that antitrust officials raided the British carrier?s offices at Heathrow airport and in New York, while United said that its cargo office in Frankfurt was targeted by European officials.Lufthansa, United?s partner in the Star airline alliance, issued a statement saying that cartel authorities were investigating the air cargo sector and that the group would ?fully support? the inquiries. It did not say explicitly whether Lufthansa offices had been raided.SAS, the Scandinavian carrier and another member of Star, also confirmed it was part of the investigation as did Cargolux, the Luxembourg-based group, and Air-France-KLM, though its US partners ? Delta and Northwest ? have not been notified.FedEx and UPS, the world?s largest air cargo operators by revenue, said they had not been contacted in the probe, and Deutsche Post said its carrier, DHL, was not targeted.The rise in fuel prices over the past 18 months has pushed up passenger and freight charges across the airline industry, leading operators to impose surcharges on customers.Lobby groups such as the European Shippers? Council have expressed concern about the methodology used in calculating extra fees, noting that in some cases last year the surcharge exceeded the transport cost.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, has said repeatedly that she wants to make the fight against cartels a ?priority? of her five-year tenure. At present, cartel probes normally last several years before the Commission imposes a fine. The regulator stressed on Tuesdat that the ?fact that the European Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation?.

Virgin America joins his Virgin Atlantic business and start-ups in Belgium, Australia and Nigeria.Mr Carty, a Canadian, has 20 years’ experience in the airline industry but was ousted from American in 2003 amid uproar from unions over an executive compensation plan.He currently serves on the boards of Hawaiian Airlines, Dell and Sears. He will oversee a management team at Virgin America led by Fred Reid, a former senior executive at Lufthansa and Delta Air Lines.Virgin America has secured $177.3m in funding, including $88.9m from Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners, two US private equity firms. Virgin companies will invest $29.8m in equity and provide $58.6m in debt financing to conform with US law limiting foreign investors in a US airline to 25 per cent of the voting rights.However, the business plan and foreign ownership interests have been challenged by a number of airlines, and the US Department of Transportation has yet to rule on a request for additional information to confirm its adherence to investment laws.
644;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-01-24T13:11:18Z;AirTran reports full-year income of $2.7m;;AirTran, the fast-growing US low-fare airline, on Tuesday reported a net profit of $2.7m for 2005, though its tiny margin contrasted with the fortunes of low-cost carriers in Europe and Asia.The Atlanta-based airline has benefited from capacity cuts by rivals US Airways and Delta Air Lines and the improving revenue environment in key East Coast markets. It contained non-fuel costs while boosting capacity by 28 per cent over the year.US airlines are forecast to report a collective net loss of $4.7bn for 2005, and AirTran becomes only the second carrier to report a full-year profit after Southwest, the largest US domestic operator by passenger numbers.However, AirTran’s net margin of 0.2 per cent contrasts with the 21 per cent margin which Ryanair, the largest low-fare carrier in Europe, is expected to report for its financial year to the end of March.AirTran’s own costs undercut those of Southwest and rival JetBlue – which expects to report a full-year loss next week – and its fleet of 106 aircraft is due to rise to 125 at the end of the year and 162 in 2008, the fastest rate of capacity growth in the US..Unit costs rose 1.8 per cent to 6.1 cents per available seat mile in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel, which rose 96.5 per cent year on year. However, unit revenues were 15.7 per cent higher over the same period, accelerating the trend seen in the previous two quarters. Further gains are expected following the liquidation of Washington-based rival Independence Air at the start of the year, which will take more capacity out of East Coast markets.The higher fuel costs and a marketing promotion saw AirTran swing from a net profit of $1.1m to a loss of $400,000 in the three months to December 31. The full-year profit compared with a $12.3m surplus in 2004, though still represented its seventh consecutive year of profit.
645;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
646;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-01-11T23:53:21Z;Northwest Airlines attacks DoT over SkyTeam;;"Northwest Airlines on Wednesday launched a stinging attack on US regulators over their refusal to grant antitrust immunity to the US carrier and some of its partners in the SkyTeam alliance.The airline described the Department of Transportation’s actions as “arbitrary, capricious and inconsistent with established DoT precedent and US international aviation policy”, as the SkyTeam members formally withdrew their request.The SkyTeam members had sought to link existing immunities granted by the DoT to some members, allowing them to share pricing information and co-ordinate sales and marketing efforts. Northwest already has permission to co-operate with KLM while SkyTeam partner Delta Air Lines has similar links with Air France. The alliance wanted to combine the immunities following the merger of the Dutch and French airlines.The DoT refused the request in late December – some 15 months after it was initially filed – but approved expanded code-sharing between the four airlines, as well as Alitalia and CSA Czech. Rivals such as American Airlines had campaigned against such a move, arguing that immunity would reduce competition on domestic and international routes. Although the department did not rule against the application on competition grounds, it questioned the potential benefits.The airline industry is dominated by members of the three main alliances: SkyTeam; the Star group, led by Lufthansa and United; and Oneworld, which includes British Airways and American. Lufthansa and United already have immunity, but BA and American withdrew an application after European regulators demanded the surrender of slots at London Heathrow airport in return for approval.While competition policy on both sides of the Atlantic has become more receptive to the developing of alliances, some airline executives fear it has become overshadowed by wider efforts to forge a new transatlantic air services agreement between the US and the European Union.The granting of antitrust immunity is seen as a key bargaining chip as governments on both sides of the Atlantic review a tentative EU-US deal agreed last November. The DoT has already come under fire from some US carriers, labour groups and politicians for its proposal to relax strict rules governing the participation of foreign national and airlines in the running of US carriers.The EU has made it clear that the proposed transatlantic deal hinges on a “favourable” outcome to the review of ownership and control rules. The DoT is reviewing comments, and is expected to finalise its proposal in March."
647;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2006-01-02T22:46:00Z;Independence Air to stop operating this week;;"Independence Air on Monday said that it will cease operations on Thursday after the US low-fare carrier’s bankrupt parent failed to find a buyer, removing one competitive hurdle for rivals in East Coast markets.The planned closure comes just 19 months after the former regional feeder cut its ties with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, and fought off a hostile takeover bid from rival Mesa Air to establish a new jet operation based at Washington Dulles Airport.The former Atlantic Coast Airlines expanded rapidly after remodelling itself and relaunching as Independence with a fleet of Airbus A320s and Bombardier regional jets. Though it carried just 5m passengers in the 11 months to end November 2005 – ranking it 25th among US commercial carriers - it had a disproportionate impact on the Washington market, sparking a series of fare wars in short-haul and transcontinental markets.However, the carrier shrunk dramatically since the start of the year in the wake of mounting losses and falling liquidity, and Flyi, its parent, filed for bankruptcy protection on November 7.Flyi said last month that it had received interest from parties in acquiring some or all of its assets, but admitted on Monday that there had been no firm offer that would allow it to continue operating.United was among those looking to take part in any auction of assets, and is expected to be among the main beneficiaries of its rival’s demise; Dulles ranks as its third-largest hub, and Flyi has a lease on 36 gates at the congested airport running until 2014. Mesa has also re-examined plans to expand from its western US market by acquiring Independence assets.Fare levels in the highly-competitive East Coast market have been improving since last May. While low-fare competitors such as AirTran and JetBlue are expected to fill the capacity gap left by Independence, executives have indicated that ultra-low fares are being withdrawn.Flyi was the third US airline to declare bankruptcy last year following filings by Delta and Northwest, and listed $455.4m in liabilities and $378.5m in assets. Holders of $125m in notes were listed as its largest creditor, followed by $55m owed to Canada’s Export Development Corporation, which backs sales of Bombardier jets."
648;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Northwest says $2bn needed to exit bankruptcy;;Northwest Airlines said it would need at least $2bn in fresh funding to exit bankruptcy protection and finance new aircraft in a bid to return to profitability.The carrier declined to comment on talks with potential lenders, but the funding needs, outlined in new court documents, offer fresh evidence that Northwest may seek debtor-in-possession financing to exit bankruptcy.Delta Air Lines, its larger rival, filed for bankruptcy on the same day as Northwest in September, and has secured $2.2bn in DIP financing from General Electric, Morgan Stanley and others to support a planned exit in late 2006 or early 2007.Northwest elected to work with the $1.4bn in cash it had at the time of filing, but conceded in the filings that liquidity was falling as it entered the traditionally slow winter travel season.“Accordingly it will be likely be necessary to obtain liquidity through the capital markets in the form of a [DIP] loan during the pendency of the Chapter 11 case,” said the filing from John Luth, chairman of the Seabury Group, Northwest’s financial adviser.Northwest has only said that it wants to exit Chapter 11 “expeditiously”, but Mr Luth said the airline will not generate “significant liquidity” from operations until 2009 or 2010, and required $5bn-$7bn to replace its ageing aircraft fleet over the next seven to ten years.Northwest, which has lost almost $4bn since 2001, is laying off staff, cutting capacity by 15 per cent and shifting aircraft from the domestic market to more profitable international routes. It also plans to transfer some domestic flights to a new standalone entity branded “Newco” requiring $3bn in new regional jets, a move which has angered its existing pilots.The airline plans to cut $2.5bn from its cost base and has been pushing for new deals with employees. Temporary agreements with its pilots and flight attendants expire next month, and the carrier could still opt to ask the bankruptcy court to impose new deals to lower its costs and attract lenders.
649;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-12-13T20:58:52Z;Pilots in demand at US airlines;;The major US airlines are expected to recruit about 2,500 new pilots next year, with the demand pushing up wage levels in spite of recent personnel and salary cuts at bankrupt carriers.The US commercial sector is expected to take on 10,000-11,000 new flight crew in 2006, a return to the levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, driven by the expansion of low-fare carriers and rapid growth in segments such as regional airlines and business jets.Airline labour experts said the recent focus on pilot cuts at Delta and Northwest, which on Wednesday enter their fourth month in bankruptcy protection, masks the buoyancy of the sector.“There are really two sides to the market,” said Kit Darby, president of AIR Inc, an Atlanta-based pilot recruitment specialist who estimates that half of the 16 majors, defined as companies with annual revenues of $1bn or more, are hiring.Southwest, the biggest of the low-fare operators, plans to add 460 new pilots next year, and rivals such as JetBlue and AirTran are expanding rapidly, while start-ups such as Virgin America will add to demand.However, the buoyancy of the pilot market has not improved the bargaining power of employees at the bankrupt carriers. Pilot leaders at Delta agreed at the weekend to a temporary 15 per cent wage cut while they attempt to thrash out a new contract, with management seeking steeper reductions in a bid to restore profitability by 2007.Pilots are due to vote on the proposal by the end of the year. Meanwhile, flight crew at Northwest elected by a margin of two-to-one to take a temporary cut in the face of a management threat to impose a new deal.Mr Darby said the pilots’ resolve was diluted by the recognition that their current jobs were not very portable because of different pay scales and seniority levels at more solvent rival carriers. “There really is no comparison out there to what they currently have,” he said, referring to the reluctance of pilots to return to what some refer to as the “boot camp” of retraining at another carrier.The major airlines have more than 8,000 pilots on furlough, some 12 per cent of the total roster, with more expected to join the ranks from Northwest and Delta as they shrink during restructuring.However, profitable operators such as FedEx, UPS and Southwest are lifting wage levels, and there is intensifying competition from the “fractional” operators of business aircraft, which have recently agreed to wage increases of 40-60 per cent and are expected to recruit 800-1,000 pilots next year.The tightness of the market has amplified the calls for the mandatory retirement age to be raised from 60, particularly as the bubble of military-trained flight crew who served in Vietnam is now reaching maturity.
650;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;United plans to issue equity after Chapter 11 exit;;Glenn Tilton, chairman and chief executive of United Airlines, said on Wednesday that the US carrier planned to make a substantial equity issue in the middle of next year in order to transform its balance sheet after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors.The exit from Chapter 11 was still scheduled to take place around February 1, Mr Tilton said in a speech to the UK Aviation Club in London.The number two US carrier collapsed into bankruptcy protection three years ago, but Mr Tilton said that the radical restructuring it had undergone in Chapter 11 would allow the group to emerge as one of the world’s most competitive carriers.“We have constructed a solid competitive platform for United,” he said.Three years ago the group had been losing $3bn a year, but it was forecasting that it would return to a net profit in 2006 as part of the business plan for exiting from bankruptcy protection.The group had managed to reduce its unit costs, excluding fuel, by 20 per cent, which, combined with the reduction in the size of the airline, would result in $7bn of average annual costs savings by 2010.Productivity had been improved by 27 per cent and its fleet costs had been cut by $850m a year.Mr Tilton attacked European criticism, most recently voiced by British Airways, that the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules offered “a safe harbour” for failing US carriers, providing protection from competition and giving an unfair advantage in relation to the rest of the world industry.He said that out of the 166 airline bankruptcy filings since the 1978 deregulation of the US aviation industry, only two passenger carriers and one cargo airline had successfully restructured and exited as viable businesses.Of the 15 largest US carriers in 1980 only five survived today, said Mr Tilton, and two of those, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, had just entered Chapter 11 with “their futures uncertain”.By contrast, 11 of the 15 largest carriers operating in Europe in 1980 were still flying today.“There is no free ride in Chapter 11,” said Mr Tilton, and it had proven a very effective tool for enabling market exit.“In contrast, carriers in Europe have the opportunity for repeated infusions of state aid with no meaningful, market-tested plan for restructuring.”
651;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-11-11T00:00:20Z;Delta posts loss after busy travel season;;Delta Air Lines on Thursday reported a net loss of $1.13bn for the third quarter ahead of a crucial court hearing next week on the bankrupt US carrier’s efforts to impose a new contract on its pilots.The third-largest US airline by revenue filed for bankruptcy protection in September as rising fuel costs and looming pension payments drained liquidity, and is seeking an additional $3bn a year in improvements to boost its competitive position against lower-cost rivals such as AirTran and JetBlue.The airline lost $438m in the quarter – traditionally one of the strongest for US industry – excluding restructuring charges, compared with a $592m deficit a year ago. An operating loss of $240m was driven by higher jet fuel charges, a pattern repeated among most of its major rivals, all of whom expect to report substantial losses for the fourth quarter and full year.Revenue in the quarter rose 8.9 per cent to $4.22bn, but gave no other financial details, with a further regulatory filing expected on Monday.Analysts and creditors will be keenly watching its unit revenue and cost performance amid signs that capacity cuts are starting to give airlines more pricing power to pass on the higher fuel prices to passengers.Delta’s own restructuring plan envisages a cut in unprofitable domestic routes and expanding services to overseas destinations, but said it needs fresh cuts from its pilots to compate with rivals and secure $2.2bn in debtor-in-possession financing.The carrier has already imposed wage and benefit cuts on non-unionised employees. Delta has asked pilots for an additional $325m in annual savings as part of its restructuring plan, having secured $1bn in cuts last year as it sought to avoid a bankruptcy filing.The pilots have offered $91m in cuts and have threatened possible strike action if Delta presses ahead with efforts to force a deal through the bankruptcy court.Northwest Airlines, which also filed for bankruptcy protection in September, has secured tentative deals with its pilots and flight attendants to cut costs having withdrawn its effort to seek a court-imposed settlement.
652;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Showdown looms on Delta deal;;Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said it remained committed to securing a new deal with its pilots, despite the breakdown of talks and its request for a bankruptcy court to void its existing contract.The third-largest US carrier also warned it could breach covenants on $2.2bn in fresh funding by February without a cheaper pilots’ deal and a respite from high jet fuel costs.Such costs, it said, threatened to undermine its business plan to return to profitability in 2007. The airline has run up losses of $10bn over the past five years.Atlanta-based Delta said it had made almost no progress in efforts to secure $325m in annualised savings from pilots, its only major union, having imposed $625m in cost-saving measures on other employees this week.The threat of a bankruptcy court imposing a new deal is likely to intensify pressure on the pilots - who characterised Delta’s offer as “an ultimatum”.Northwest, which like Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, has already asked a court to terminate deals with its three main unions. Talks with pilots are ongoing, but flight attendants on Wednesday said they would accept part of the cuts which management are looking for on a temporary basis.Bankruptcy lawyers said Northwest was taking a tougher stance than Delta in wringing more concessions from employees. “Northwest got the show on the road and then [aimed] to talk afterwards,” admitted one Delta insider. “I hope and trust that we will cut a deal [with pilots outside court].”Delta also said it remained undecided about terminating its defined benefit pension plan, a move that would save hundreds of millions of dollars a years and mirror similar efforts by rivals United and US Airways while in bankruptcy.“We don’t know if it needs to be terminated,” said a person close to the airline. “We just don’t know what the landscape looks like,” he added, a reference to various attempts to push pension reform through Congress which would alleviate the strain on airlines.Lawyers involved in other airline bankruptcies have expressed surprise that Delta and Northwest have not moved quicker to terminate their underfunded pensions.The Atlanta-based carrier said it could breach covenants on the loans from General Electric and American Express unless it secures an additional $325m in annualised savings from pilots. Non-pilot employees saw wage and benefit cuts amounting to $625m a year imposed on Monday.The airline said the spike in jet fuel had already brought it close to breaching the profitability targets set out in the finance agreements. It argued in a court filing that its pilots were already among the best paid in the industry, despite agreeing to $1bn in cuts last year when the carrier sought to avoid bankruptcy protection.
653;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-10-17T22:15:24Z;Delta given permission to halt pension contributions;;Delta Air Lines was on Monday given permission to halt contributions to its pilots’ pension fund and regular top-up payments to retirees.The decision by a US bankruptcy judge will improve the US airline’s liquidity, but anger pilots’ leaders who argued the change broke its existing collective bargaining agreement with flight crew.Judge Patricia Beatty Carter rejected an attempt by a group representing retired Delta pilots to force the carrier to make the top-up payments, ruling that the claims pre-dated its bankruptcy filing on September 14 and didn’t rank above those from other creditors.The judge had delayed a ruling following a hearing on October 6, and accepted Delta’s argument that bankruptcy laws protected it from making contributions to its pilots' pension fund and direct top-up payments of $84m a year to retirees.The airline skipped a $160m payment to the pilots’ plan due on October 15. The size of the quarterly contribution had swelled five-fold after a large number of Delta pilots opted to take early retirement ahead of the bankruptcy filing, qualifying them for lump-sum payments from the $1.89bn fund.The pension fund will continue to receive regular monthly payments from Delta, but pilots will now be unable to withdraw lump sums from the main fund. The judge did not rule out requiring Delta to reinstate both sets of payments at a later date, and asked all sides to negotiate.Delta’s current and retired pilots are concerned that the carrier - and fellow bankrupt Northwest Airlines - may opt to terminate their defined benefit pension plans.This route was taken by both United Airlines and US Airways while in bankruptcy, cutting their own costs but reducing potential pay-outs to staff after the plans were transferred to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.Delta said it was not near such a termination. Atlanta-based Delta, the country’s third-largest airline, is seeking additional concessions from its pilots as part of its restructuring and has argued that it should be allowed to make up the shortfall in its pension plan over 20 years.The US Senate is considering a broader pension reform bill that would grant airlines a special exemption giving them 14 years to make up any shortfall.
654;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Fed receives commitment on CDS;;"Leading credit derivatives banks have pledged to improve practices and cut backlogs of trade confirmations in the fast-expanding credit derivatives industry, where the total volume of outstanding contracts is now estimated to top $12,000bn.The banks made the commitment in a letter sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and copied to European and other US regulators, on Tuesday evening.The processing backlogs reflect the complexity of products such as credit default swaps ? which allow investors to trade a company?s credit risk without owning its debt ? and the failure of systems to keep pace with the market for credit derivatives instruments, which is roughly doubling every year.Following earlier moves from the UK?s Financial Services Authority, Timothy Geithner, president of the New York Fed, has put pressure on the banks to address the problems. That reflects concerns that the backlogs could be a dangerous operational risk, especially if credit markets were disrupted by an event such as an unexpected wave of corporate bankruptcies.The workings of the credit derivatives market are sometimes opaque, and the systems challenges arcane. But yesterday?s pledges are expected to trigger concrete, practical actions in the coming months, both with banks and with their customers, especially hedge funds, some of which have criticised the proposed new practices.The banks made pledges in five broad areas:
?A commitment to cutting backlogs. By the end of January, the banks promise to reduce the number of trades outstanding for more than 30 days by 30 per cent, compared with the number outstanding at the end of last month. Further targets will be set in December.At one stage, regulators appeared to be seeking more aggressive targets, said people involved in discussions on the text of the letter. But bank sources see the deadline as challenging. One reason is the scale of the existing problem, with many confirmations outstanding more than six months, and some for years. Another is that new trades are being added to the list every day.To accelerate the process, the banks are planning to hold ?lock-ins? ? sessions where representatives of two dealers meet to clear the backlog of trades between their respective institutions.
?A promise to provide regulators with figures on their progress, including trade volumes, confirmations, settlements and ?fails? ? trades that did not match when the two sides? entries were compared. These data will be provided to regulators 10 business days after the end of each month. These submissions are likely to be similar to what the FSA requested from banks in the London markets.
?A commitment to use a new procedure for assigning, or transferring, trades. Hedge funds frequently assign their side of a trade to a third party, usually a dealer. Partly because assignments involve three parties, they have thrown up more than their share of processing problems. Strictly, written notice of assignments is required, but market practice has evolved to accept oral consent ? and sometimes none at all, with dealers only learning a trade has been assigned when payments arrive from the new counterparty.Last month the International Swaps and Derivatives Association produced a protocol to resolve this issue, although the Managed Funds Association, which represents some hedge funds, called parts of it ?unworkable?. Nonetheless, the dealers have told the New York Fed they will follow the protocol from October 24, saying they ?will not accept? assignments from a hedge fund that has not adopted the ISDA protocol unless they receive written consent from the other party to the trade.
?A plan to increase automation of trade processing. All 14 dealers are already signed up with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which provides electronic trade matching and settlement services. In the letter, the dealers say DTCC?s services are ?already driving significant improvements?. But many hedge funds and other customers are not signed up with DTCC.The banks have promised that ?active? clients ? those who trade on average at least five times a week ? are signed up with DTCC by mid-January. Less active clients trading at least weekly will have to be on the system by the end of March.
?A proposal to consider other moves to smooth the functioning of the market. The recent bankruptcies of Delta and Northwest, the US airlines, as well as an earlier default at car parts maker Collins & Aikman, led to one-off ISDA procedures for settling credit default swap index trades with cash rather than the physical delivery of bonds. The banks propose that cash settlement become the standard.Meanwhile, the dealers also want to make more use of the industry?s so-called ?tear-up? process, in which offsetting trades between the same parties are cancelled."
655;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-30T19:12:43Z;Airline industry’s problems on Walsh’s shoulders;;The accent will be different, so too will the management style. But the early agenda for youthful Irishman Willie Walsh, as he takes over the leadership of British Airways on Saturday, has already been largely set by his much-lauded Australian predecessor Sir Rod Eddington.The in-tray awaiting on Monday morning would be recognisable to most of his competitors and counterparts around the world, from record oil prices and fuel bills to creaking infrastructure, on the ground and in the air, intensifying environmental pressures, fragile labour relations, legacy pensions burdens, overcapacity and falling yields, the rapid growth of low-cost, start-up competitors, industry consolidation and deregulation.The starting point for Mr Walsh is better, at least, than for many of his rivals. Names such as Belgium’s Sabena, Swissair and Australia’s Ansett have disappeared during the latest aviation recession. In the US, United Airlines, the world’s second largest carrier, still languishes in its third year in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors. Two other top five US carriers, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, have only just collapsed into Chapter 11, while US Airways has finally emerged this week from its second period in court administration in three years through its takeover by America West.By contrast, BA, the UK flag carrier, is in stronger shape than it was five years ago. Its profits are up, its debt has been cut by more than half. It may not yet be paying a dividend again – the last was in 2000/01 – but it currently boasts the highest operating profit of any airline worldwide.By accident of geography it also operates from the heart of probably the richest aviation market in the world. The downside of the location is that its global hub, London Heathrow, is one of the most congested airports in the world. The upside is that Heathrow has some of the world’s most profitable routes and BA controls more than 40 per cent of the take off and landing slots.Admittedly that is a smaller share than most of its rivals have at their global hubs, whether Air France-KLM at Paris Charles de Gaulle, Lufthansa at Frankfurt or Delta at Atlanta, but the lack of free slots helps to keep competiitors at bay. BA is also protected for the moment by the restrictive UK/US air services treaty, which strictly limits the number of airlines that can compete on lucrative direct Heathrow/US routes to four, BA and Virgin Atlantic from the UK and American Airlines and United from the US.Much of the global aviation industry was plunged into crisis by the decline in demand for air travel after the that followed the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US. The fall severely compounded the problems that were already emerging from a weakening economy and the earlier bursting of the dotcom bubble. Globally, aviation is still in crisis, as it endures a fifth successive year of losses in 2005. The International Air Transport Association Iataestimates industry losses this year at $7.4bn (€6.1bn), with most of the latest deficit blamed on the record cost of fuel and most of it still accumulated in the US. It The deficit comes on top of losses totalling $36bn for 2001 to 2004. for in the four years 2001-04. Cumulatively, airlines have been cash negative since the Wright brothers took their first flight in 1903.For a while after 9/11, BA too haemorrhaged cash and some questioned its ability to survive. The threat has passed and successful remedial action has been taken during the Eddington era, but much remains to be done on the Walsh watch.He inherits from Sir Rod the target of trying to hit a 10 per cent operating margin over the trading cycle, the holy grail, that the group has never previously achieved. He must plot the renewal of the BA long-haul fleet including a an eventual decision on whether to buy the 555-seat Airbus A380 superjumbo, the world’s biggest ever jetliner, which will start landing at Heathrow in Singapore Airlines livery from December 2006, to be followed by at least eight more carriers flying the A380 into Heathrow.More immediately, he must prepare BA for its transfer in just two-and-a-half years time to a brandnew operating base at Terminal Five at Heathrow. The move is of huge significance for BA. Airlines around the world are struggling with infrastructure issues on the ground at airports and in the air with air traffic control. The £4.2bn T5 project is much more than just a nother terminal Alone It will have the capacity for to handle 30-3530-35m passengers a year, more than all but the biggest airports in Europe, and will is set to raise Heathrow’s capacity to more than 90m passengers a year. For the first time in its modern history it will have all its operations under one roof, rather than spread across two terminals. It is a chance n once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rationalise its operations, to increase efficiency and save costs, while also also transforming the passenger experience.But the benefits will only be realised if at the same time BA can reform its many outdated working practices at Heathrow. The airport, with its workforce of close to 70,000, is the biggest remaining bastion of highly unionised labour on a single site in the UK. The long-running industrial conflict at Gate Gourmet, BA’s sole catering supplier at Heathrow, has offered a stark reminder , if any was needed, of the size of the challenge facing the airline and Mr Walsh. A wildcat strike by 1,000 BA workers, staged in sympathy for the more than 700 workers sacked by Gate Gourmet, paralysed the airline’s operations at Heathrow last month.Mr Walsh, a former pilot and chief executive of Ireland’s Aer Lingus, is stepping up into the aviation premier league and into one of the hottest seats in the industry. BA’s fortunes have been improving, but its margins are still inadequate and there is little room for complacency in a loss-making global industry still facing deep-seated problems. “Being in the most comfortable deckchair on the Titanic was still not a good place to be,” said Sir Rod earlier this year. “To relax would be fatal, absolutely fatal.”The writer is the FT’s aerospace correspondent
656;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-26T18:58:54Z;John Kay: Canine features of unprofitable industries;;Warren Buffett observed that the world airline industry has not made a dime for investors in a century of manned flight. He said this in 1991, acknowledging his mistake in buying stock in US Air (now known as US Airways). Although Mr Buffett engineered a profitable exit from his investment, matters are no better. US Air is under Chapter 11 protection, along with United Airlines and now Delta and Northwest Airlines. The bankruptcy court judge is as essential to your flight as the pilot.The Sage of Omaha argues that industry factors generally dominate profitability: “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.” But what gives an industry a reputation for bad economics?I have always favoured the efficient industry hypothesis, the business analogue of the efficient market hypothesis. If an industry looks particularly attractive, or unattractive, companies will enter, or leave, until that attractiveness or unattractiveness disappears. The efficient industry hypothesis explains why you can make money in tobacco and lose it in electronics.But, like the efficient market hypothesis, the efficient industry hypothesis is a tendency, not a universal truth. There is debate over whether company or industry effects are more important to persistent profitability but little doubt that some industries are persistent dogs.Some businesses attract too many entrants because people like being part of them. Newspapers, for one. Publishing and bookselling have always attracted people who love books more than they love money. They tend to accumulate the former and lose the latter, to the benefit of customers and despair of investors. With antique shops, wine retailing and restaurants you can always sit on a Louis XV chair and eat your own cooking with choice vintages, even if customers won’t. And frequently this is what happens.Some businesses have too much capacity because governments favour them. Politicians are convinced that steel is the product on which all economic activity ultimately depends and that the expansion of steel production is a measure of industrial success. When the Soviet Union collapsed, its gross national product was perhaps a tenth that of the US but its steelmaking capacity was greater. If steel is the totemic raw material, cars are the totemic manufactured product. Governments support more car plants than the market can justify. Good news for drivers but bad news for efficient autocar manufacturers and their shareholders.The dollar bill auction is an unpleasant party game played by economists. The rule is that a dollar bill goes to the highest bidder, but both highest and second-highest bidder must pay. The game can continue until the resources of the players are exhausted. Even if you are already hopelessly in the red – you have spent more than a dollar to gain a dollar – you may go on raising the stakes. Another cent might win you a dollar: not to put up another cent involves certain loss.The game describes wars of attrition in military strategy – and in commercial life. If the market will ultimately be profitable for those businesses that remain, companies go on spending in order to be among them. The total amount that can be lost in this process may, as in the dollar bill auction, greatly exceed the profits anyone will ever derive.The misfortune of the airline business is that it combines all these characteristics. Being an airline executive seems to offer the company of glamorous hostesses and the allure of exotic locations, even if the reality is meetings with insolvency practitioners and visits to the commercial courts. Governments want to see an airline carry their flag: Italy and Greece fight the European Commission to allow their taxpayers to pour ever more money into black holes called Alitalia and Olympic Airlines. Few other industries could have expected the speed and scale of assistance that Congress offered America’s airlines after September 11.Perhaps there is, ultimately, a profitable airline business for those who stay the course. That is what Northwest and Delta are telling their creditors, what Olympic is telling its sponsoring government. But as solong as such claims are accepted, the day the airline industry earns a dime for investors less shrewd than Mr Buffett will never dawn.www.johnkay.com
657;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-26T18:38:14Z;ISDA issues new settlement procedure;;The derivatives industry is moving to head off potential confusion in the booming credit derivatives market following the bankruptcy filings of Delta and Northwest, the US airlines, earlier this month.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has issued a new procedure for cash settlement of credit default swap index trades involving the two airlines, with notional underlying bond prices to be set at an auction next month.The credit derivatives industry’s agreement on a cash settlement process is evidence of its increasing maturity.But as in an earlier process after the May bankruptcy of Collins & Aikman, the US car parts supplier, ISDA’s latest procedure is a one-off solution that does not ensure the relatively young industry is equipped to deal quickly with corporate defaults on a larger scale.Delta and Northwest are referenced in CDS index products, which are based on the credit standing of dozens of companies. A default by an index constituent would usually trigger partial settlement involving the physical delivery of the defaulted company’s bonds.But with index trading often outpacing the availability of underlying corporate bonds, that could cause a scramble among investors for a finite – and insufficient – supply of the physical securities.“While numerous Delta and Northwest reference obligations are available for physical settlement, the principal aim of today’s protocol is to facilitate a swift, orderly and efficient cash settlement process,” said Robert Pickel, chief executive of ISDA.
658;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-22T22:07:51Z;Delta to slash more than 9,000 jobs;;Delta Air Lines on Thursday announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs and shed almost a fifth of its aircraft fleet in a bid to restore profitability in two years time.The moves follow last week’s bankruptcy filing by the third-largest US airline, which has run up losses of almost $10bn over the past four years as it lost ground to lower-cost competitors.Gerald Grinstein, chief executive, said the measures were intended to “save Delta in the short term” by eliminating unprofitable routes and moving its cost structure closer to that of rivals such as Southwest and AirTran.The scale of the cuts was in line with analysts’ expectations, and follows the pattern of other carriers which have used the bankruptcy process to shrink and restructure.Almost 50 per cent of US domestic capacity is provided by airlines in bankruptcy protection. Delta’s filing on September 14 was swiftly followed by Northwest Airlines: both faced a liquidity squeeze as the price of jet fuel pushed towards $100 a barrel and pension and debt payments loomed. United Airlines has been in Chapter 11 for almost three years and US Airways hopes to emerge next week. Continental Airlines has twice sought protection.Critics of the US bankruptcy system believe it has prevented a fundamental realignment of the industry by allowing bankrupt airlines to keep flying, rather than liquidating to reduce the chronic domestic overcapacity which has driven down fares. “If 50 years of post-war economics has taught us anything, it’s this: state subsidies preserve bad habits,” said Rod Eddington, the outgoing chief executive of British Airways.“We all know the answer: let the market clear. America would do itself a favour by going back to the principles of real and honest competiton.”Delta is the most exposed of the six US network carriers to low-cost rivals, and has the smallest proportion of international flights. It plans to cut its domestic capacity by 15-20 per cent and boost international flying by a quarter. This will cut total capacity by 7 per cent and see it drop more than 80 aircraft in addition to the 40 already taken out of service.The Atlanta-based airline aims to generate $3bn in annual financial benefits by 2007, on top of the $5bn a year in savings it said it was on track to make by 2006 before rising fuel prices wiped out the gains.The bankruptcy process is expected to generate a third of the new benefits, while network and fleet restructuring and lower staff costs would each generate a further third. It plans to shed 7,000-9,000 staff from its full-time equivalent workforce of 52,339 by 2007, of which 1,000 had already been announced. It has already cut 24,000 workers over the past four years, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.Northwest plans to lay off 1,400 flight attendants and 400 pilots as part of its restructuring, with further reductions expected from elsewhere in its workforce of 37,500.Delta is in talks with its unionised pilots to secure an extra $325m in annual concessions after securing $1bn a year in savings last year. It has imposed $605m in cuts on other employees, including management. Front-line staff will see pay cut by 7-10 per cent, while Mr Grinstein’s pay will fall by a quarter.Additional reporting by James Boxell in London
659;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-20T18:21:22Z;Simon London: Alternatives to harsh negotiations;;Karl Marx was right about one thing: capital and labour are engaged in a seemingly endless struggle over who should get the spoils when things go well and who should take the pain when things turn sour. You can see it in the quarterly economic statistics, as wages and profits fight over every last tenth of a percentage point of national income. You can see it in the news as companies such as Delphi and Delta Air Lines ask workers to take deep cuts in pay and pensions. If labour declines to co-operate? Downsizing, bankruptcy or liquidation looms.To be sure, these companies have to cut costs to regain competitiveness. Investors will not provide capital unless they believe they can earn a decent return. Yet the “gun to the head” negotiating style adopted by most management teams in these circumstances shows a startling lack of imagination. Playing Marxian Roulette with the workers may result in a lower cost structure but you have to wonder what it will do to the human side of the enterprise – morale, culture and trust.There is an alternative. Instead of asking employees to sacrifice future benefits “or else”, offer them a meaningful stake in the business.The arguments in favour of such equity-for-concessions deals are twofold. First, it is a question of justice. Workers who signed employment contracts many years ago had no idea that the pension promises made by the company were contingent. If these promises are now to be broken, recompense is due.Second, you do not need to be a lily-livered lefty (disclosure: I do not belomg, and never have, to a union) to wonder whether employee share ownership could become a source of competitive advantage for at least one of these troubled companies. A constructive relationship between labour and capital would make it much easier to explore new technology and working practices. Heck, it might even increase the value of the company.Sceptics respond that employee share ownership in the US has been tried many times before and found wanting. In the late 19th century, Leland Stanford, the railroad tycoon and founder of Stanford University, was an unlikely enthusiast for worker-owned businesses. In the 1920s and 1930s, employee ownership was seen as a way of encouraging workers to embrace capitalism rather than communism. Then, in the 1970s, came Esops, tax-advantaged vehicles for employee shareholding that were later adopted in the UK and elsewhere.Look across the US corporate landscape today, however, and you see few large companies in which workers own a significant stake. Neither is there statistical evidence that this handful has outperformed the rest. Decades of Darwinian competition has established, or so it seems, the supremacy of publicly owned companies with strict separation of capital and labour.Not surprising, say economists. They point to any number of reasons why employee ownership will not work. For example, since every employee shareholder shares in the financial upside of a company’s success, there is a strong incentive to let others do the work. Then there is the problem of how to deal with new employees. If newcomers are granted stock when they are hired, old-timers will see their stake in the enterprise gradually diluted. If newcomers are excluded from stock ownership, a two-tier system results.There is also the very real issue of investment risk. Do employees really want the great majority of their personal financial assets tied up in the company on which they already depend for wages? The 1994 employee buy-out of UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, illustrated many of these problems. The deal, by far the largest of its kind, gave employees a 55 per cent stake in the company and representation on the board of directors in return for concessions in pay and benefits. Management and unions alike saw the transaction as a landmark – a chance for a fresh start as United looked for ways to compete with low-cost rivals such as Southwest Airlines.For a while, all went well. But when the business travel market collapsed following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, United was no more able to cope than its publicly owned rivals. Even after the attacks, the mechanics’ union continued to press for better terms in contract negotiations – and called a strike to back its claim. Never mind that mechanics owned more than 15 per cent of the stock and knew full well, thanks to board representation, that the trading position was dire. UAL filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in December 2002, where it remains to this day.But the failure of UAL’s experiment is hardly proof that employee ownership is doomed – any more than Enron, Tyco and Adelphia prove that publicly held companies are bound to be undermined by malfeasance. The complex truth is that all forms of corporate ownership have strengths and weaknesses. The trick is designing a system of governance that compensates for the shortcomings.“Employee ownership is not a unitary thing, but rather a transactional framework that needs to be filled in with key institutional design parameters,” wrote Jeffrey Gordon, a professor at Columbia Law School, in a prescient paper* published in 1998. “It would be a mistake to take the UAL precedent as a standard form.”At this time of friction between capital and labour, there is surely value to be created by trying to go further than United – and well beyond Karl Marx.*Employee Stock Ownership in Economic Transitions: The Case of United Airlines.

661;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Growing fears over airline pensions;;Concern about the impact of the bankruptcies of Delta and Northwest airlines on workers' pensions has led to urgent calls in Washington for immediate pension relief.Harry Reid, Senate minority leader, said: “Congress has an immediate opportunity to pass legislation enabling both companies to keep pension plans for workers in place.”Johnny Isakson, senator from Georgia, where Delta is based, told the Financial Times on Thursday: “We want to bring the bill to the floor as early as next week. The airlines stated they wanted to preserve their defined benefit plans and their ability to do that is tied to whether we can get pension reform passed.” On Thursday night Delta warned that it might miss pension payments for 3,500 retirees.The sense of urgency comes as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that insures defined benefit pension plans, said it could assume liabilities of $8.4bn from Delta's pension plan if it was terminated. That would mark its biggest pension termination. Northwest's liabilities were smaller, at $2.8bn, the PBGC said on Thursday.Lawmakers have proposed extending the time for companies with underfunded pension plans to make up the gap from four years. Mr Isakson has suggested 20 years. The Bush administration had backed seven years.Delta has told lawmakers that the only way it can avoid an immediate termination is if the 20-year proposal is passed. That has the support of Northwest and American, but not Continental. Although support is building in the Senate, the proposals have had little backing in the House, according to one airline lobbyist.A report from the Congressional Budget Office on Thursday underlined the risks the PBGC faces. The report estimates the PBGC's accumulated deficit could climb to $142bn over the next 20 years, if it is calculated in the way that a private insurer calculates risk.While some analysts dispute that number, they agree with the Center On Federal Financial Institutions that without reform, such as changing the way the agency charges premiums to corporations, the PBGC will run out of money by 2022. Doug Elliott, the Center's president, said: “The real problem is a systematic imbalance for 30 years in the premiums they were allowed to charge and how Congress set up the funding and other rules. They are hitting a period when bigger companies are going under.”Claims from failed pension plans reached $14.3bn in 2000-04, 18 times larger than the $783m in claims booked between 1995 and 1999. Airline pension failures would easily top those figures. United has already dumped $6.6bn of liabilities. If Northwest and Delta do so the total airlines' liability would hit $17.8bn.Employees could also lose out. If the PBGC takes over a plan, it typically pays pensions up to a cap of about $46,000. That is far lower than a typical pilot's pension.
662;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-15T22:45:36Z;Senators call for urgent action;;Concern about the potential fall-out for workers' pensions has led to renewed calls in Washington for immediate pension relief.Harry Reid, senate minority leader, said: “Congress has an immediate opportunity to pass legislation enabling both companies to keep pension plans for workers in place. We must not sit by and do nothing while thousands of hard-working Americans’ retirement security is at risk.” The call was echoed by Johnny Isakson, a senator from Georgia, where Delta is based. In the wake of the largest ever termination of pension plans by United Airlines in April, he jointly introduced the Employee Pension Preservation Act of 2005.The PBGC yesterday estimated that it could be forced to assume liabilities of $8.4bn from Delta's pension plan if it terminated its pensions. That would mark the largest ever pension termination. Northwest's liabilities were smaller, at $2.8bn, it said yesterday.Employees would also lose. If the PBGC takes over a pension plan, it typically pays pensions up to a cap of about $46,000 – far lower than a typical pilot pension. The PBGC said the effective pension loss for employees at Delta would be $2.2bn and $2.9bn at Northwest.In June the agency, whose deficit in 2004 reached $23.3bn, warned that the total level of underfunding by US corporations had risen to a record $353.7bn. The size of the plans it has been forced to assume has also jumped. Claims from failed single employer pension plans totalled $14.3bn in 2000-2004, 18 times the $783m in 1995-1999.Putting it in perspective, the total claims from the wave of airline bankruptcies could easily surpass historical terminations. Including the United termination of $6.6bn in claims, the three airlines’ claims could easily swamp that at $17.8bn.To avert that danger, lawmakers have proposed changing the time period under which companies with underfunded pension plans have to make up the gap. It is currently four years. For loss-making airlines, that means having to make cash contributions at a time they can least afford it.In June, David Strine, managing director at Bear Stearns, estimated that airlines would have to make $1.2bn of cash contributions to their pensions in 2005. With fuel then at $50 a barrrel, he said that figure “would represent 90 per cent of our operating cash flow forecast”.The Bush administration has proposed spreading the funding over seven years. Mr Isakson has proposed 25 years. On that basis, Mr Strine estimated in June that “contributions would fall 87 per cent to $300m from $2.4bn in 2006”.He warned that if both Delta and Northwest did terminate their pensions in bankruptcy, that could force the bankruptcy of American and Continental, as it would mean “45 per cent of the industry’s capacity was operating with the advantage of having eliminated defined benefit pension plans”.

Delta and Northwest Airlines this week became the latest US airlines to file for Chapter 11, following United and US Airways through the revolving door of bankruptcy protection.Good morning, and on behalf of the management and crew can I welcome you aboard this Delta/Northwest/ United/US Airways flight into Chapter 11 and out again at some suitably propitious moment.As members of our frequent filer programme know, this is a tricky manoeuvre and things can get a bit bumpy. But don’t worry, our staff are hugely experienced and have practised this operation many times.At this time we would ask your attention as we acquaint you with some of the safety features. Please take a moment to locate your nearest emergency exit – believe me, we already have.Should it become necessary for us to seek bankruptcy protection, please leave the airline by the evacuation slides. We would ask shareholders, bondholders and unsecured creditors to make their way quickly to the exits leaving all investment behind you.Members of the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may experience some turbulence as they take on extra stock in the airline in return for helping us unload the excess baggage that is our pension fund. PBGC passengers who already hold airline stock should be aware that it may depressurise at some speed as we descend into Chapter 11. Should this happen, oxygen masks will fall from the ceiling for those passengers at this time. We recommend you attach them to your face and breathe deeply.Once we arrive at bankruptcy protection we will be disembarking you in strict order. Shareholders and low-grade creditors will be offloaded first. Leasing companies and other partner businesses with contracts we find just that teensy bit burdensome will also be assisted off the aircraft, although they may be allowed to return later once we have carefully examined their terms and conditions.I should warn you that we have been advised there is a lot of congestion heading into Chapter 11 this morning. We may be kept in a holding pattern behind other airlines for some time. But don’t worry; as soon as one of those ahead of us gets out, we’ll be straight in.We apologise for this not entirely unscheduled stop, but if it is any consolation you should know that our main rivals will be following our lead once we have used our Chapter 11 slot to stiff our creditors and generally evade market forces. We still offer the most comprehensive network across the US, as long as you don’t mind changing at Cincinnati.Some of you have asked what will happen to senior management. Don’t worry. We’ll be fine. We’ve made our own arrangements.A barrister has been paid more than £1m in legal aid fees in one year, while 12 briefs shared nearly £9m in fees from the Criminal Defence Service.The scene: A wine bar near Lincoln’s Inn.First barrister: Ah, there you are. So how is the public defender? You should stick to civil law, old boy. I’m making a fortune. Bottle of bubbly? Don’t worry, it’s on me. I know how strapped you legal aid boys are.Second barrister: Oh, I get by.First barrister: I dare say, but you must be taking quite a hit, financially.Second barrister: I don’t earn as much as I could, but it’s important to give something back to society.First: Very noble, I’m sure.Second: Legal aid is the cornerstone of a fair justice system. At least I can hold my head up high and say I do my bit. When I tell people I’m a lawyer I can look them in the eye and say it’s not just the money, that I actually do this to help people. I tell you, legal aid cases leave me feeling good about myself. (Bollinger arrives) Let me get this one.First: No, not on what you earn.Second: Oh don’t worry, I’ll manage.Charles Clarke on Thursday unveiled his tough new package of anti-terror measures. It listed several new offences to stop dangerous radicals slipping through the net, including:1) Being guilty of terrorism.2) Looking guilty of terrorism.3) Possession of an offensive opinion in a built-up area.

664;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-15T16:45:25Z;David Bowen: Airlines relate sad tales on the web;;"When Delta and Northwest Airlines filed for Chapter 11 protection this week, I went to their websites to see what I could find out. I was amazed – they are using them to keep customers, suppliers and even (to a miserly extent) investors informed. This is a great leap forward: it may be a blindingly obvious use for the web, but very few companies have so far thought to use their sites as emergency noticeboards.Maybe where US airlines have led, others will follow. I checked UK oil company websites this week to see if there was any guidance on fuel availability (panic-buying and great queues on Tuesday), and was unsurprised to find nothing. A few hints would have been useful.Back to the airlines. Both Northwest (www.nwa.com) and Delta (www.delta.com) had links on their home pages to ‘restructuring updates’. So does United (www.united.com), which has been in Chapter 11 for three years. I looked at the three sites to see how they were treating three sets of ‘stakeholder’: customer, supplier and investor.I looked at US Airways (www.usairways.com), which is also in Chapter 11 but is merging with America West to drag itself out of its troubles. Less luck there – it prefers to concentrate on the happy prospects for its marriage.Not surprisingly, given the core role of their websites as booking offices, the airlines focus most of their attention on customers. Northwest’s home page link leads to ‘An important message to customers’ from the CEO, who says everything is just fine. Links lead to a longer letter saying much the same, and to an FAQ section, which provides point by point reassurance; mostly importantly, that the WorldPerks programme will not be affected.Delta’s restructuring section is headed by a short statement emphasising that ‘Your travel plans are secure’ and ‘Your SkyMiles are secure’ (phew). It has a series of useful FAQs, four of which are aimed at passengers and one at cargo customers. United provides letters to general customers as well as Mileage Plus members, while a Customer Service FAQ underlines just how marvellous everything is.Suppliers get a good deal from the Delta website, if not from the airline itself. A comprehensive suppliers’ FAQ is clearly signposted within the restructuring area, and includes pertinent questions such as ‘Why should I continue to provide goods and services to you?’, as well as valuable detail such as the fact that non-US suppliers should be paid even if US ones are not. There is a link to a special legal site, which, the FAQ says, will have information about the claims process for suppliers. This site , www.deltadocket.com, is currently rather forbidding – it will be interesting to see if the claims information will be translated from legalese into language suppliers can understand.United also a link to a Supplier section within its restructuring area. This has a reasonably full letter, with a contact phone number, but no FAQs. That means it is likely to get more calls than Delta from, for example, non-US suppliers.Curiously, I found information aimed at Northwest’s suppliers by going to the Investor section. There is a Partners Suppliers link in the About Northwest area, but this leads only to a page where ‘technology vendors’ are allowed to give themselves a little plug. I wonder why. Anyway, there is a ‘For our suppliers’ section within a special mini-site, www.nwa-restructuring.com, which I found from the IR area. This is another letter, but a rather less upbeat one: ‘Unfortunately, US Bankruptcy law prohibits payments for goods and services received before today’s filing date,’ it says. It also gives a phone number for accounts payable, for what that is worth.If customers are well served and suppliers adequately, investors get slim pickings. There is a link from United’s restructuring page to the investor section, but from there on the poor old investor gets a raw deal. This is unsurprising, as it is one of the worst IR areas I have ever encountered. The problem starts on the home page, if it can be called that. It is simply a list of links such as Overview, Calendar and Financial Reports. I clicked on Overview, which is a hymn of self praise without any mention of Chapter 11. I then found I could not move around within the section, so had to return to its home page; very odd.After some false starts, I finally found something. The FAQs link turns out to be all about the restructuring: the first question is ‘What is a Plan of Reorganization?’ Trouble is, the FAQs are written as though they are supplementary to some other content, which does not appear to exist. More bafflement.Delta is better. The investor section is not exactly state of the art, but a link leads to the restructuring section, which in turn leads to an FAQ page for investors. This does not have the same orphaned feeling as United’s. The first question is straightforward, if depressing: ‘What value with Delta’s common stock have in the future? Is it now worthless?’ (Answer: We don’t know).But Northwest … oh dear. The investor section (like the others, tucked away in the About Us area) has a promising link on its home page, pointing to ‘information or questions’ about the restructuring. This leads to www.nwa-restructuring.com, with its information for customers and suppliers, but nothing at all for shareholders.It is quite surprising, this. In the country that is supposed to worship most faithfully at the altar of shareholder value, investors are being in put in third place, after customers and suppliers. Good thing too, you might say, but it’s still odd, isn’t it?David Bowen is a website effectiveness consultant for Bowen Craggs Co (www.bowencraggs.com). dbowen@bowencraggs.com."
665;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-15T12:20:41Z;Lex: Airlines;;Flying tends to bring out the worst in people. The same is true when it comes to how different countries deal with ailing airlines. Together with other bankruptcies, the ones of Northwest and Delta will leave about half the passengers travelling in the US flying under court protection.US legacy airlines are not alone in their suffering. Despite steady growth in air travel, most of the world's airlines have been unable to cover their cost of capital for decades. That has more to do with arcane regulation and government handouts than such recent threats as low-cost competition and soaring oil prices. Several European flag-carriers would have gone bust many times over, had it not been for state aid in various guises.But US bankruptcy law has long had pretty much the same result: keeping corpses flying to the detriment of everyone's health. Giving ailing businesses a chance to recover is a sound idea. When it comes to airlines, however, it has mainly benefited US bankruptcy lawyers. As for real savings, most come from offloading pension obligations and squeezing employees. This has usually done little to reduce sector capacity and only makes staff more militant during the next mini-boom. Until then, most savings may well lead to even lower fares, while a harsher bankruptcy regime will only start to bite after the next crisis. For now investing in airline stock looks set to remain a dreary experience, sprinkled with a few seconds of sheer terror after every temporary spike.
666;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-15T00:02:37Z;Pension agency faces new burden;;The bankruptcies of Delta and Northwest threaten to widen dramatically the deficit faced by the federal agency that insures pensions if they both opt to terminate their defined benefit pension plans.In April, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, whose deficit hit $23.3bn in 2004, was forced to assume its largest ever pension termination, when United Airlines terminated its defined benefit plans, transferring $6.6bn in liabilities. Initial PBGC estimates suggest that could be trumped by Delta, with $8.4bn in liabilities.United's controversial decision prompted fears of a domino effect, with rivals being forced to follow suit to remain competitive. Heavy losses since 2001 have caused airline pension plans at major carriers to be underfunded by more than $20bn, including $3.8bn for Northwest at the end of 2004.The PBGC is increasingly faced with assuming the costs of middle-class benefits across different sectors from steel to airlines.Delta and Northwest have been pressing for a legislative solution to ease their pension burden and have not said they will copy United. But the PBGC has been seeking financial and legal advisers to represent it in the event of a Delta and Northwest termination.The agency is also concerned about potential liabilities from Delphi, the automotive parts maker, which on Monday warned it could file for bankruptcy by October 17. In return for taking over United's plans, the PBGC is expected to end up as the biggest shareholder, possibly owning as much as 20 per cent. The PBGC also has about a 7 per cent stake in the merged America West-US Airways. If Delta and Northwest copy United, that could raise profound questions about the merits of a government agency holding significant stakes in four large US airlines nearly 30 years after deregulation in 1978.

The broader S&P 500 declined 0.3 per cent to 1,227.16. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1 per cent to 2,149.33.The US Department of Commerce said retail sales fell by a larger-than-expected 2.1 per cent in August, the biggest fall in nearly four years, as car sales dropped from the previous month’s lofty levels.A separate report showed that industrial production rose just 0.1 per cent last month, against expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise in output from US factories and mines.Bulls took solace in upbeat results from Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, whose shares rose 1.3 per cent to $113.75 after it reported a 74 per cent increase in quarterly profits.Lehman, the first of the big banks to report earnings this quarter, was also upbeat about the rest of the year, saying its deal pipeline was “at a record high”.Lehman’s results set a high bar for other banking rivals.Plunging shares in Baidu, the Chinese internet company, weighed on internet stocks. The shares, which increased in value more than four-fold after Baidu’s meteoric public offering last month, fell almost 28 per cent to $81.32 after two banks that helped underwrite the IPO said they were overvalued.Northwest Airlines rose 19 per cent and Delta Air Lines fell 9 per cent ahead of possible bankruptcy filings.Energy companies were in focus as oil prices regained ground following their slide from recent highs.

668;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-14T20:21:10Z;Airlines stuck in a never-ending holding pattern;;"The latest crisis in the US aviation saga brings to mind a new punchline for one of those bumper sticker or coffee mug slogans: “Old airlines never die …they just circle around and try again.”As Northwest and Delta hover on the brink of bankruptcy, the last big carrier to try this route, United Airlines, is about to come out the other side. American and Continental look stuck in a holding pattern wondering whether to go in next. All hope to survive and emerge stronger than before.To some extent, this is how the US bankruptcy
system is meant to work. One of its great advantages compared with legal approaches elsewhere is that it allows troubled industries, such as steel or coal, to restructure in the face of changing economic conditions.But the queue of airlines choosing to seek Chapter 11 protection raises fears that the industry is trapped in a domino effect. Each time one company is able to jettison debt or pass on pension obligations to a federal insurance scheme, it raises the competitive pressures on those still trying to fly their way out of the storm.Bankruptcy is not as straightforward as it looks either. The experience to date suggests the process may still leave companies resembling the walking dead rather than allow a phoenix-like rebirth.When United filed its plan of reorganisation with a bankruptcy court last week, analysts got a detailed glimpse into the airline’s plans after nearly three years under Chapter 11 protection. Yet, ironically, one major concern was whether United will be able to generate enough cash to meet it debt obligations.If all goes to plan, United will emerge from bankruptcy in February with a much reduced cost structure, including a 45 per cent cut in salary costs and a 41 per cent reduction in aircraft lease payments compared with 2002. It will have about $11bn in debt, down from about $20bn in 2002.“UAL remains highly leveraged in a cyclical commodity business,” says Roger King, analyst at CreditSights. “Three years of shedding obligations in bankruptcy did not return UAL to its former investment-grade status.”Although the second-biggest US carrier has made significant progress, its post-bankruptcy business model also contains bold assumptions about the future price of jet fuel and its ability to generate cash.United’s business plan assumes an average price of $50 a barrel for oil in 2006 and beyond. “That implies a relatively dramatic correction for jet fuel over the coming months,” says Bill Warlick, airlines analyst at Fitch Ratings. Crude oil, which topped $70 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, rose 12 cents to $64.49 in New York on Friday.For the time being, United’s assumptions seem to have the confidence of the investment community. Four big financial institutions have offered proposals for up to $3bn in exit financing.Jake Brace, chief financial officer, says the proposals “are a significant vote of confidence in the progress we have made…and in our ability to manage through a complex industry environment, including unpredictable fuel costs”.Whether those assumptions prove correct could have big implications – not only for United, but also for struggling rivals such as Delta and Northwest, which may be forced to draw up new business plans of their own."

The S&P 500 lost 9.35 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,231.21, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 11.08 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,171.75.The slide followed a mixed performance on Monday as investors struggled to get to grips with a wave of mergers and acquisitions.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said a slow period for earnings news and technical trading patterns indicated that stocks would remain rangebound over the next four to six weeks.“Outside of crude oil and energy prices, there is little out there to act as a catalyst for the market,” he said. “It’s a market that is better for traders than investors.”The leading US indices failed to rally in early trading on Tuesday after economic data came in better than expected. A government report showed that producer prices rose 0.6 per cent last month, less than the expected 0.7 per cent.A separate report showed that the US trade deficit narrowed by 2.6 per cent in August to $57.9bn. Analysts said the unexpected pullback would likely be reversed by the recent spike in oil prices, which tends to increase the dollar value of US imports.Retailers were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after Best Buy, the electronics retailer, issued disappointing third-quarter guidance. Shares in Best Buy, which reported a 47 per cent rise in earnings in the second quarter, slipped 11 per cent to $44.79. Circuit City, a rival, lost 2.7 per cent to $16.46, while RadioShack fell 2 per cent to $25.68.Other retailers also fell on fears that high petrol prices could hit consumer spending in the second half. Wal-Mart, which last month warned about the impact of higher fuel prices, fell 1.8 per cent to $45.07, while rival Target fell 2.2 per cent to $54.19.Airlines suffered steep losses amid concerns that Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines were preparing to file for bankruptcy. Northwest plummeted 52.6 per cent to $1.57. Delta shares fell 8.2 per cent to 78 cents. Both carriers have been hit hard by soaring fuel costs.Semiconductors bucked the downward trend to notch the strongest performance on the S&P, with Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, rising 2.5 per cent.Ford Motor gave up early gains to slip 1 per cent to $9.82 as investors assessed the carmaker’s decision to sell its Hertz car rental unit to a consortium of private equity groups for $5.6bn.Knight Ridder, the newspaper group, fell 5.3 per cent to $61.46 after it said third-quarter profits would fall about 20 per cent.Home Depot, the building supplies retailer, was among the biggest drags on the Dow, with shares off 1.8 per cent at $40.60.
670;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-12T23:07:23Z;Airlines blame oil price for forecast $7bn losses;;The global airline industry is expected to suffer losses of $7.4bn this year owing to the latest surge in oil prices in recent months.Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said yesterday that oil was “once again robbing the industry of a return to profitability”.The airline industry has been in loss for five years, with the latest deficit coming on top of cumulative losses of $36bn (€29bn, £20bn) suffered in the four years 2001-04.The bulk of the losses has been accumulated in the US, where two of the leading US carriers, United Airlines and US Airways, are still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from their creditors – in the case of United since December 2002 – and where speculation is growing that Delta Air Lines will also shortly file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy administration.The regional financial performance of airlines is varying greatly, with European carriers forecast by Iata to break even this year, while Asia-Pacific airlines are expected to make profits of around $1bn.By contrast Iata said that the losses by North American carriers alone could exceed $8bn in 2005 and would come on top of losses of $32bn already accumulated by North American airlines from 2001 to 2004.Mr Bisignani said that on top of the jump in crude oil prices, the refinery margins for jet fuel had increased from $6 per barrel in 2003 to $17 this year. He accused the oil industry of staging “a $14bn cash grab”.The latest forecast of global airline losses of $7.4bn is based on an average Brent crude oil price over the 12 months of 2005 of $57 a barrel, and is up from the last forecast made in May of losses of $6bn based on an average price of $47 a barrel.Fuel is accounting for close to 25 per cent of total airline industry costs, second only to labour costs.The aviation sector’s fuel bill has risen from $44bn in 2003, at an average Brent crude price of $29 a barrel to $63bn last year at an average of $38 a barrel, and it is forecast to reach $97bn this year at an average price of $57 a barrel.On Monday the oil price fell back, but the Brent crude October contract was still trading at $61.80 a barrel, albeit $1.04 lower and at a one-month low.Mr Bisignani said “cost reduction and efficiency gains had never been more critical” for the industry, although carriers had already made great progress. Iata had added $10bn to its forecast of industry costs for this year, but the incremental impact on the industry’s bottom line had been limited to $1.4bn.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

The S&P 500 slipped a fraction of a point to 1,240.57, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 7.3 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,182.83.The flat performance followed a strong gains last week as investors expressed optimism that Hurricane Katrina could spark a construction boom.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors were already beginning to look beyond the storm’s immediate impact and to refocus on fundamentals.“The stock market has been going slowly higher, but profits have been going up much faster,” leaving stocks looking relatively undervalued even though they are up sharply from cycle lows, Mr Paulsen said. “It says something about the strength of the undertow in this market that we could have Katrina and it barely made a dent.”Three new multi-billion dollar deals set the early tone. Ebay announced a deal to buy Skype, the European internet telephony group, for $2.6bn in cash and stock. Shares in the online auction site rose 0.8 per cent to $38.94.Siebel Systems, the business software group, jumped 12.7 per cent to $10.29 after a $10.66 per share offer from Oracle, a rival. The $5.9bn deal would create the world’s biggest customer relations management software company. Oracle rose 1.6 per cent to $13.49.Elsewhere, Wachovia, the banking and brokerage group, fell 1.6 per cent to $49.57 after it announced a $3.9bn decision to buy WFS Financial, an auto lending business. Westcorp, the bank that owns 84 per cent of WFS, rose 0.4 per cent to $61.58, while shares in WFS jumped 8 per cent o $70.15.Dynegy, the natural gas producer, fell 1.9 per cent to $4.66. The company had warned that two of its natural gas facilities were damaged by Katrina.Oil groups fell as crude prices continued to retreat from record highs. Sunoco, the oil refiner, fell 4.5 per cent to $76.09. Exxon Mobil fell 1.1 per cent to $62.52.Shares in Delta Air Lines fell 22.7 per cent to 85 cents amid reports that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent. Northwest Airlines, a rival that is also struggling to avoid bankruptcy, fell 3.3 per cent to $3.31 after talks with its striking mechanics collapsed.Ford Motorrose 0.2 per cent after the automaker struck a tentative labour deal with the Canadian Auto Workers union.

673;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-09-07T22:25:57Z;Northwest and Delta battle for survival;;Talks are set to resume on Thursday between Northwest Airlines and its mechanics union after the fourth biggest US carrier warned it might begin hiring permanent replacements for its striking mechanics as early as next week.Northwest, which is struggling to avoid bankrutpcy, has been using temporary workers, managers and outside contractors to maintain and clean its aircraft since members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association went on strike on August 20.In a letter to Amfa on Tuesday, Northwest said: “Given the rapidly changing environment in which we must compete, the company now needs to adopt a permanent solution.” It said it may start filling permanent vacancies by September 13.Meanwhile, the airline said on Wednesday it would suspend non-stop services from New York to Tokyo because of the high cost of jet fuel. Northwest said fuel prices were “severely affecting the financial viability of some routes and forcing us to make some difficult decisions”. The airline said it would continue offering connecting services from New York to Tokyo through Detroit and Minneapolis.Northwest said its worsening financial position meant its “last best offer” made to Amfa on August 18 was no longer on the table. That would have created cost savings of $176m by cutting the mechanics’ ranks by 53 per cent. Remaining workers would have faced a 26 per cent pay cut. In a bulletin to union members on Wednesday, Steve MacFarlane, Amfa’s assistant national director, confirmed talks were scheduled and said the union’s ranks “continued to hold strong”.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines is to sell aircraft, expand international flights and scale back operations at its Cincinnati, Ohio, hub to raise cash and cut costs.The shake-up, part of a year-old transformation plan, comes amid concerns that the sharp rise in fuel prices that followed Hurricane Katrina could accelerate a likely Chapter 11 filing.Delta said on Wednesday it would sell 11 Boeing 767 jets to ABX Air, a cargo carrier. It will also cut capacity in Cincinnati, its second biggest hub, by 26 per cent and accelerate its transition to more profitable international routes.James Corridore, analyst at Standard Poor’s, said that although the changes were welcome, Delta’s short-term outlook remained bleak. “I fail to see how, with jet fuel having risen so much in the past few days and with the company continuing to lose money, it can possibly save the airline from bankruptcy at this point,” he said.Delta, which was considered to be among the strongest US carriers at the beginning of the recent airline downturn in 2001, has been battered this year by soaring fuel prices, a heavy debt burden, and fierce competition from low-cost rivals on crowded east-coast routes.Delta last month offered a grim assessment of its prospects as it announced the sale of one of its jet subsidiaries to raise $425m.in much-needed cash. It warned there was “significant uncertainty” that it would be able to implement changes to its business model before it runs out of cash.Delta has also scaled back operations at its Dallas hub and has simplified its fare structure in an attempt to cut costs and boost revenues – part of its plan to trim $5bn in costs by the end of next year.The latest efforts to avoid bankruptcy at Delta and Northwest came as United Airlines, the second biggest carrier, detailed plans to emerge from Chapter 11 as early as February 1.Pending approval by a bankruptcy judge, unsecured creditors will receive new stock in the recapitalised company. The airline might also offer creditors the right to buy an additional $500m in stock, with proceeds to be used to pay down debt or fund operations.Bill Warlick, airlines analyst at Fitch Ratings, said fuel prices would continue to present a challenge to United even after bankruptcy. The airline’s reorganisation plan assumes a price of $1.48 a gallon for jet fuel, well below the record of $2.23 reached last week.Glenn Tilton, chief executive of UAL, United’s parent, agreed that fuel prices were a top concern but said “our restructuring work has earned us the opportunity to compete”.

United’s move to emerge from bankruptcy comes as many traditional carriers are struggling to stay aloft amid record fuel prices and fierce competition from low-cost rivals.US Airways, a rival, expects to emerge from bankruptcy this autumn by merging with America West, a West Coast carrier.Meanwhile, analysts have said that Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, the third- and fourth-biggest US carriers respectively, could be forced to file for Chapter 11 protection this year.Soaring fuel prices, which hit a new record last week amid supply fears sparked by Hurricane Katrina, have increased concerns that weaker carriers could be pushed into bankruptcy.Yesterday, Ted Stevens, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said his panel might recommend that the government waive the gasoline tax to help airlines cope with the rising price of fuel.United is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 with about $11bn in debt, including up to $3bn in all-debt exit financing.It United said it was still negotiating terms of the exit financing with potential lenders including Citigroup, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and General Electric’s aircraft finance arm.United’s plan is not expected to include any new equity financing. Such financing would dilute its creditors’ share in the recapitalised company. Although private equity groups were thought to have been investigating the possiblility of such financing, unsecured creditors usually prefer debt-only financing because it does not dilute their final share of the recapitalised company.United said its restructuring should give it some of the lowest costs of any of the legacy carriers. It said that It had trimmed about $7bn in costs since it filed for bankruptcy in December 2002. including $845m from the restructuring of aircraft leases.The company earlier this year terminated its defined-benefit pension plans and transferred $6.6bn in pension obligations to the PBGC.

Nymex crude futures finished the day up $2.61 at $69.81.Retailers and restaurants dominated the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500 with Staples, the office supply chain, falling 2.9 per cent to $21.85 and Darden Restaurants fell 2.8 per cent to $30.61. Tiffany, the jewellers, fell 2.6 per cent to $33.31. Wal-Mart also fell 1 per cent to $45.19 after announcing that 123 stores had been shut down due to a power cut.Insurers and re-insurers suffered. Shares of American International Group fell 0.4 per cent $59.28 and Hartford Financial Services dropped almost 0.3 per cent to $73.15.The transport sector, another area of the US economy that will see profits squeezed by higher oil prices, was also well down. United Parcel Service was 1.1 per cent down at $70.42 and CSX, a rail freight company, slipped 1.7 per cent to $44.85.The oil price was bad news for long-suffering airlines with Delta Air Lines, the cash strapped carrier widely expected to be the next airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, down 5.5 per cent to $1.20. The Amex airline index dipped 3 per cent at 46.75.All of which left the indices lower by the close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.5 per cent at 10,412.82 and the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at 1,208.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,129.76.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the bears need not despair, however, citing a “longer-term rally”.“That rally is a series of higher-lows. Even the weakest market average remains above its June low. If this decline bottoms out around these levels, it will appear to be just a normal pullback within the context of that ongoing rally.”The news that a measure of consumer confidence showed that Americans’ attitudes about the economy improved in August only gave the most brief of respites to indices. While the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in August the US Commerce Department released a report showing a less than expected decline in factory orders in July.Oil producers continued to benefit from high prices with ConocoPhillips, the largest US refiner, gaining 2.1 per cent to $64.41. Halliburton, the world’s biggest oilfield services company, rose 3.5 per cent to $59.84.After rising, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile-telephone company, which announced it had agreed to buy an affiliate for $427m, fell 1.3 per cent to $25.25.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 10,623.23.A slight fall in oil prices helped bolster the market, which had been concerned about several consecutive days of record highs, culminating with Friday’s peak of $67.10. The September crude contract fell 21 cents to $66.65 a barrel.“We are now firmly in the doldrums part of the year,” said Sarah Hunt, senior vice president at Capital Management Associates. “We’re through the earnings season, a lot of people have simply left town and there isn’t much information coming out at the moment.”Two of the day’s most dramatic moves were triggered by unconfirmed stories in the press.

681;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-27T00:04:19Z;Struggling US airlines thrown a lifeline;;Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have been struggling to avoid a slide into bankrupcty this year, may have been thrown a lifeline on Tuesday.Just hours after Northwest reported a widened second-quarter loss, and a week after Delta reported losses of more than $300m last quarter, the Senate Finance Committee approved a draft bill that would give airlines more time to make up for funding gaps in their pension plans.The influential committee’s endorsement of airline pensions relief marked a victory for both Northwest and Delta, which have lobbied fiercely to extend the current four-year deadline for funding the shortfalls in their underfunded pension plans. If the bill becomes law, it could save both carriers billions of dollars in badly needed cash.But neither carrier is out of the woods yet. The airlines provision in the finance committee bill still must wind its way through the legislative process and past the desk of President George W. Bush, whose administration has expressed scepticism about pensions reform targeted at specific sectors. And analysts say that even if the measure passes and Delta and Northwest get the pensions relief they have been seeking this year, other factors could push them into Chapter 11.“If this [provision] goes through, I think it would be a considerable help for both Delta and Northwest, but that alone won’t determine whether they can avert bankruptcy,” says Phil Baggaley, airlines analyst at Standard & Poors, the ratings agency.Northwest on Tuesday reinforced its need to secure $1.1bn in labour cost savings in addition to pension reforms this year. The airline, which says its labour costs are the highest in the airline industry, has been in talks with its unions for years, but progress has been slight - the company acheived just $300m of a hoped-for $1bn in labour cost savings last year.In an attempt to prop up its haemorrhaging balance sheet, the airline said on Tuesday that it would freeze pension plans for management and other salaried employees and replace them with new defined benefit plans beginning September 1. Pension schemes for pilots and other non-salaried workers that make up the majority of the airline’s workforce remain unaffected, however, and meaningful relief may take time.Moreover, thousands of Northwest mechanics and other ground staff have threatened to strike next month to protest against Northwest’s calls for $176m in pay and benefit cuts - part of an effort to create $1.1bn in labour cost savings this year. On Tuesday, Doug Steenland, Northwest’s chief exeuctive, said it was “imperative” that Northwest reach labour agreements with all of its unions as quickly as possible.Analysts point out that Northwest maintains a healthy cash pile. The group ended the second quarter with a respectable $2.1bn in unrestricted cash and is thought to be a viable candidate for additional debt financing. But unless it is able to wring more concessions from its increasingly disgruntled workers, Northwest may be forced to call time.Analysts say Delta’s positions appears even more precarious.“In my view, [the proposed fiance committee bill] is probably enough for Northwest to bring its annual cash contribution levels down to the point where they can be sustained,’ says Bill Warlick at Fitch Ratings. “Delta is more of an open question.”The third-biggest US carrier by revenues last week reported a second-quarter net losse of $382m - well below the staggering $2bn loss it reported in the second-quarter of 2004, but still worrisome given the company’s given the company’s tremendous cash obligations. The group ended the quarter with just $1.7bn in unrestriced cash, and analysts have expressed scepticism about whether the airline will be able to secure the financing needed to maintain sufficient liquidity if losses continue to mount.All this makes the need for pensions reform more pressing than ever. But US airlines are hardly of one voice when it comes to the appropriate prescription for their pensions woes.Low cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines and AirTran have criticised the legacy carriers’ calls to Congress for pensions reform.“You can’t be against people’s pensions, and consequences are pretty severe here, so while it doesn’t make any economic sense of public policy sense to bail the airlines out, something is going to happen,” says Joe Leonard, AirTran’s chairman and chief executive. Mr Leonard said he was hopeful that whatever reform eventually becomes law would require airlines to put up collateral and take out commercial loans in order to get pensions relief.Meawhile, Gerard Arpey, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, has said he is not in favour of any pensions reform that requires airlines to freeze their traditional pension plans.
682;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-26T14:48:20Z;Senate vote on pensions lifts airline hopes;;Struggling US airlines on Tuesday received a boost in their efforts to secure pensions reform this year, when an influential Senate committee unanimously approved a proposal that would extend the time airlines have to make up the shortfall in underfunded pension plans.The news came as Northwest Airlines, whose financial position is among the weakest of the US legacy carriers, reported a widened quarterly loss and repeated warnings that it might face bankruptcy unless Congress acted quickly to change pensions rules.If the finance committee bill becomes law, it would allow airlines to stretch payments for underfunded pension liabilities from the current four-year period to 14 years plus a seven-year transition period.Northwest hailed the proposed law, which was approved just hours after Doug Steenland, Northwest's chief executive, repeated warnings that the airline could face bankruptcy unless it secured pensions reform this year. Shares in Northwest jumped 9.7 per cent by the close in New York.Pensions reform has taken on a new sense of urgency since April, when a court ruled that United Airlines, the bankrupt carrier, could offload $6.6bn in pension liabilities on the government-backed Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the largest such pension termination.The move sparked fears that other airlines might seek refuge from pensions burdens by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Northwest said on Tuesday that it lost an average of $4ma day in the first half, as losses for the second quarter widened from $182m a year earlier to $225m. Like other US legacy airlines, Northwest has been struggling under record fuel costs and soaring pensions obligations.Thousands of Northwest mechanics and other ground staff have threatened to strike next month to protest against Northwest's calls for $176m in pay and benefit cuts.Delta Air Lines, which has also warned that its efforts to avoid bankruptcy hinge on whether Congress approves pensions reform this year, last week reported a narrowed quarterly loss.A Delta spokesman said the finance committee bill was “a good start”.Phil Baggaley, airlines analyst at Standard & Poors, said the finance committee's bill still faced several political obstacles, including votes by the full Senate and the House and the Bush administration's opposition to an industry-specific solution to pension problems.
683;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;High fuel costs weigh on AirTran earnings;;AirTran reported a modest profit on Tuesday, after record passenger numbers helped the US low-cost carrier beat expectations in spite of sharply higher fuel costs in the second quarter.The results came after JetBlue, AirTran’s east coast low-cost rival, reported a fall in quarterly profits last week. Southwest Airlines, the biggest US low-cost carrier, earlier this month reported sharply higher profits.AirTran, which has been expanding aggressively this year from its Atlanta hub, recorded a net profit of $11.4m in the three months ended in June, compared with net income of $16.8m in the year-ago period.Joe Leonard, AirTran’s chairman and chief executive officer, hailed the results, but said the airline’s competitive environment remained “challenging”.AirTran’s results come on the heels of a series of upbeat reports from across the airline industry. Along with low-cost rivals such as JetBlue and Southwest, several US legacy carriers have reported an improvement in fortunes in the second quarter.Delta Air Lines, thought to be among the the weakest US airlines financially, last week reported a narrowed quarterly loss. American Airlines and Continental Airlines last week reported modest profits. Northwest Airlines, which along with Delta is thought to be near bankruptcy, reports today.At AirTran, net profits slipped 32 per cent, dragged down by a 97 per cent increase in fuel expense. Revenues grew 33 per cent, boosted by a healthy improvement in passenger traffic and a slight improvement in yields, or average fares.Stan Gadek, chief financial officer, said the rising cost of jet fuel, which touched a new record in the second quarter, had offset improvements in non-fuel unit costs. The airline’s cost per available seat mile (casm) increased 6.6 per cent. Excluding fuel, casm fell 5 per cent.
684;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-21T17:56:52Z;EBay surge not enough to lift wary Wall St;;Wall Street shares dipped on Thursday as traders debated the benefits of a revaluation of the renminbi, the implications of four explosions in London and a blizzard of earnings news.Before trade began, stock futures surged on the news that China was to adjust its currency in the hope that it could help tame the US trade deficit by pushing up the price of Chinese exports.Another school of thought feared it could slow down growth in China and all gains were quickly lost on a day that was set to be dominated by earnings news from big companies, including Coca-Cola and eBay.Dennis Gartman, who publishes an influential daily newsletter for traders, said China’s 2 per cent revaluation was “far, far too little to have any major effect upon the imbalance of trade”.He added that some US exporters would benefit from the move, but retailers such as Wal-Mart were likely to suffer as Chinese goods become dearer in dollar terms. The effect could be either higher prices for consumers, or depressed margins for Wal-Mart and other retailers. Wal-Mart ended down 1.2 per cent to $49.39.The news of four more attacks on London’s transport system just two weeks after the July 7 attacks also pressured the main indices.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6 per cent to 10,627.77, the S&P was down 0.7 per cent at 1,227.04 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent down at 2,178.6.Travel stocks were hit, the Amex airline index falling 3 per cent to 51.78, with Delta Air Lines dropping 9.2 per cent to $3.55.Bob Baur, head of equities trading and lead economist at Principal Global Investors, questioned whether the market would recover as quickly as it did after July 7.“One event is one thing, but two events in one month makes you think about how often it can happen and its ramifications for the future.”Adding to the weight of news were Alan Greenspan’s remarks about the US economy before the Senate Banking Committee and important earning news from some of corporate America’s biggest beasts.EBay was the day’s star turn, with its shares climbing 20.4 per cent to $41.98 after the online auctioneer announced that profits soared 53 per cent.Dow component Coca-Cola was up 1.4 per cent at $43.95 after better than expected sales in North America boosted earnings.McDonald’s was down 0.4 per cent at $30.78 after the burger chain reported a 10 per cent fall in second-quarter earnings.There were disappointments in the pharmaceutical sector. Eli Lilly was down 1.8 per cent at $56.25 after reporting a quarterly loss due to a legal settlement, while Merck fell 1.5 per cent to $31.38. The group’s second-quarter earnings were hurt by the withdrawal of its hugely popular Vioxx painkiller.
685;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-21T13:43:57Z;Delta reports narrowed quarterly loss;;Delta Air Lines, which trimmed its quarterly loss on Thursday, said it was still hoping to stay out of bankruptcy protection as the struggling US legacy carrier waited for action from Congress concerning pension rules.The results came a day after Delta announced the departure of its chief financial officer. The airline, whose financial position is considered to be among the weakest of the traditional US carriers, declined to be drawn by analysts who questioned whether the airline may declare bankrupcty this year.“We continue to believe an out-of-court restructuring is the best way,” said Gerald Grinstein, chief executive. Delta ended the second quarter with $1.7bn in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.Analysts have said the airline may be forced to declare bankruptcy unless Congress acts to reform pension rules this year.Rising pensions burdens have sapped cash reserves and put many airlines under pressure.Mr Grinstein on Wednesday said a bill currently before the Senate “may be close enough to give us the breathing room that we need”, but warned that a second bill before the House would complicate, rather than address, airlines' pension problems.The Atlanta-based carrier said that an aggressive programme of cost cuts helped narrow its second quarter net loss to $382m, from nearly $2bn one year ago when the airline suffered a $1.6bn non-cash charge related to deferred tax benefits.Excluding exceptional items, Delta's loss last quarter was $304m, or $2.11 a share, better than most analysts' estimates of a $2.39 loss, and slightly ahead of operating losses of $312m in the year-ago period.Cost per available seat-mile (casm), the common measure of cost in the airline industry, fell 2 per cent in spite of soaring jet fuel costs. Excluding fuel, casm fell 11.6 per cent.Along with cutting costs, Delta said it was refitting some of its domestic aircraft to fly on more profitable international routes. Last week, the company raised its maximum fares for one-way walk-up flights, held in place at $499 since January, by $100 to account for the rising cost of fuel. Delta said its jet fuel prices had averaged $1.60 per gallon last quarter, a 53 per cent increase over last year. Its net fuel expense for the second quarter increased by $385m year-on-year.Delta's better-than-expected results followed upbeat reports this week from two other traditional carriers, as American Airlines and Continental Airlines beat expectations by reporting modest profits.
686;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-20T14:34:15Z;Cost savings help lift Continental and American;;American Airlines and Continental Airlines, two US legacy carriers, reported modest profits yesterday as seasonally strong revenues and cost savings from labour agreements offset higher fuel prices.The results came as many traditional airlines struggle to stay afloat amid record jet-fuel prices, a trend expected to contribute to billions of dollars of losses in the airline industry this year.Soaring pension obligations and fierce price competition from low-cost rivals such as Southwest Airlines, which last week reported a 41 per cent increase in quarterly profits, have also hurt the legacy carriers.Larry Kellner, Continental chief executive, said the group's return to profit was a direct result of cost savings from new contracts agreed by most of the airline's labour groups in March.He warned that the high cost of jet fuel, which topped $70 a barrel last quarter, was likely to lead to a “substantial” net loss this year.Jeff Misner, chief financial officer, said: “Our cost restructuring continues to show solid results but we're not out of the woods yet.” Mr Kellner said the airline would continue its expansion into more profitable international markets this year.American also warned that fuel costs would continue to cast a shadow over results.Cut-throat price competition has left US carriers unable to pass along rising fuel costs to their customers. Both Continental and American on Wednesday reported increased yields, or average fares, in the second quarter.Last week several carriers matched a significant fare increase by Delta Air Lines after the third-biggest US carrier lifted its self-imposed cap on fares for one-way business flights. However, Continental warned yesterday that these increases had still failed to match the rising cost of fuel.AMR, the parent company of American, made a profit of $58m, or 30 cents a share, in the second quarter its first profitable quarter, excluding exceptional items, in nearly five years. In the second quarter of 2004, the airline reported profits of $6m, including $31m in exceptional gains.Continental reported a second-quarter net profit of $100m, or $1.26 a share, including an exceptional gain of $47m related to the treatment of shares in ExpressJet, a subsidiary. Excluding that gain, Continental made a quarterly profit of $53m, or 69 cents a share, well ahead of most estimates.Other US airlines will release quarterly results this week. Delta, widely thought to be near bankruptcy, reports on Thursday. Northwest Airlines, which has said it might seek bankruptcy protection if it is unable to cut costs this year, reports next week.

Citigroup shares fell 2.5 per cent to $45.26.After the S&P rallied to new bull-market highs last week, it fell back yesterday to 1,224.28 – a fall of 0.3 per cent. By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones was also down 0.3 per cent at 10,609.94 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 per cent to 2,149.55.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, was optimistic, despite the market’s early slide.“There has been a bit of profit-taking and perhaps some apprehension about today’s earnings, but the fact that the S&P hit a four-year high last Friday is a demonstration that investors are optimistic about this week’s earnings news.”There was better earnings news from Bank of America and MBNA, which both topped expectations. However, shares in Bank of America, which agreed to acquire MBNA for $35bn last month, were down 1.5 per cent at $45.27.A good performance by Charles Schwab was rewarded by its shares rising 4.8 per cent to $13.35 after the discount brokerage announced an increase in quarterly profits.3M, the technology conglomerate, and another Dow component company reporting results yesterday, said second-quarter earnings were higher and revenue met forecasts. Shares fell 0.7 per cent to $74.93.By mid-afternoon, industrial stocks were given a lift by rising oil prices after weather experts said Hurricane Emily would skirt oil fields off the south Texas coast.On the Nymex energy market crude for August delivery was trading $1.09 at $57 per barrel after sliding to an earlier low of $56.80.Eaton was one of the best performers in the S&P after the world’s second-biggest maker of hydraulic equipment said its second-quarter earnings climbed 30 per cent and raised its full year forecasts. Shares in the company rose 7.7 per cent to $66.83.Airlines were also bolstered by the slip in oil prices. The Amex airline index gained 1.2 per cent to 51.50 while the best performing airline stocks were Delta, which gained 2.6 per cent to $3.95, and Southwest Airlines which was up 2 per cent to $14.49.The fading popularity of Barbie dolls lowered second-quarter earnings at Mattel, which said it expected the rest of the year to be challenging. The toymaker’s shares were down 2.4 per cent at $18.99.Whirlpool said that it had offered to buy rival Maytag for more than $1.3bn, beating an existing offer for the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and possibly beginning a bidding war. Whirlpool gained 4.8 per cent to $73.38, while Maytag gained 12.9 per cent to $17.45.
688;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-13T08:14:53Z;Self-service boarding cards take off;;What could be simpler? As you check out of the hotel using a self-service express kiosk you swipe your frequent flyer card to print out the boarding pass for your next destination. At the airport there is a drop-off point for luggage and then it is straight to the aircraft: no queues, no hassles. Easy.This is no futurist dream, but reality at a Holiday Inn in Duluth, Georgia. The trial, which started earlier this year, allows guests heading for Atlanta airport to produce their boarding cards for Delta Airways and AirTrans flights.“Around 30 per cent of guests are using the kiosk in some way,” says Mark Snyder, senior vice-president of brand management for Holiday Inn Hotels and Resorts in the Americas. “Of those around 18 per cent are printing out boarding passes. The system is most popular with business travellers during weekdays.”Later this year Holiday Inn plans to promote the technology - developed with Micros Systems and Kinetics (a division of NCR) - to its global franchisees. “The pilot has gone very well and fits well with our strategy of giving more convenience and control to travellers,” says Mr Snyder.“The system enables self-service check-in to be completed within two minutes,” adds Michael Webster, NCR’s vice-president and general manager, self service. “Consumers are starved of time and each typically spends 100 hours a year standing in queues - self-service systems not only free up time but also deliver a consistent experience.”While self-check-in kiosks have been familiar at airports since the late 1990s, most are airline specific with non-standard interfaces and protocols. Some require passengers to swipe frequent flyer cards, others the credit card used to make the original booking or else passengers need to key in ticket codes or other ID - all of which can be confusing for users. Kiosks have also tended to be placed close to conventional check-in desks adding to congestion in busy airports. Common use self-service (CUSS) kiosks - operating to an industry standard - are seen by many as an ideal solution. These tend to be managed by the airport and - thanks to broadband Wi-Fi networks - can also be more easily placed in car parks, railway stations or other off-site locations.Frankfurt Airport goes live with its CUSS kiosks this month and airport operator, Fraport, expects at least half its travellers to be using the units by 2010. The project is unusual in that instead of Fraport running the scheme, it is being managed by a community of 42 airlines using the airport. “CUSS is a further building block in simplifying passenger travel,” says Michael Schwarz, infrastructure manager in the traffic and terminal management division at Fraport. “It is a quick and safe process.”Just as check-in staff ask those standard questions about sharp objects and baggage security, so too does the kiosk providing a digital record of the replies. Passengers at Frankfurt can print out their boarding passes at any kiosk for any of the participating airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France and KLM. Any baggage is then left at the drop off point where it is screened through an X-ray machine.Athens International Airport (AIA) has been using CUSS since its redevelopment in the run-up to last year’s Olympics. “Around 15-20 per cent of passengers use the kiosks,” says Fotis Karonis, chief information officer at AIA. “Some airlines have experimented with printing baggage tags as well as boarding passes but passengers don’t always apply the tags correctly, which can lead to problems so until that can be improved drop-off points are better.”Athens airport also uses Cisco’s Intelligent Airport Solution with a single infrastructure for voice, data and video, based on IP [Internet protocol] standards. There are more than 100 wireless LAN access points and IP telephony will ultimately be extended to cover the entire complex. Both staff and passengers have easy internet access via laptops and PDAs while IP telephones at checkpoint gates brings immediate computer access to all areas.During peak travel times for the Olympics, the airport was able to install mobile check-in units to cope with tour groups at any location in the airport - as well as at the Olympic Village 35 km away where teams could be checked in prior to their departure for the airport.“Once we have a standard European biometric passport then these can also be checked at the CUSS terminals to authenticate travellers,” adds Fotis Karonis. “With biometric ID then the frequent flyer card could easily become the transport document for domestic travel. That could cut down time to board even further.”An additional benefit of self-service is that passengers can check in whenever they like - at Frankfurt that could be up to 24 hours before the flight, while Athens has found that encouraging people to arrive three or four hours before their flight, with immediate check-in, also increases sales for the airport’s shops and restaurants.United Airlines in the US has carried this flexibility even further allowing passengers to check in and print their boarding passes from a home PC via the company website, a resource British Airways is also marketing heavily in 2005.United’s Easy Check kiosks, introduced in 1999, are now in 108 airports - mostly in the US, although airports in Japan and Vietnam have also been added this year and usage rates are high. The system, developed by IBM and Kinetics, allows travellers to upgrade tickets, rebook flights and change seats from those they requested when checking in from home.And the future? With fingerprint ID linked to the reservation system and biometric readers which display flight and seat numbers, who needs a boarding pass?
689;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-07T16:38:39Z;Market Overview: Turmoil on markets after London attacks;;European and UK markets were thrown into turmoil on Thursday by the terrorist attacks in London, prompting a wide-spread sell-off in equities and a flight to safe haven assets such as bonds, gold and the Swiss franc.But markets rallied as relief spread that the disruption was not greater and as investors decided the tragedy would have limited long-term effect.The FTSE 100 index finished the session down 1.4 per cent at 5,158.3, having been off 4 per cent at one point. Even with the recovery, the index had its worst one-day performance since August 6 last year. Most European bourses were off more than 3 per cent at their session lows, but recovered to close less than 2 per cent down.Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, said the markets were becoming more used to such events. “Obviously there is a human cost but on financial markets, people are putting things into perspective and sensibly not over-reacting,” he said.High up on the list of weak performers were airlines and hotels. In Britain, British Airways shed 4.2 per cent and the Hilton Group fell 3.3 per cent. In the US, Delta Airlines skidded 5.2 per cent in early US trade.Only two FTSE100 stocks finished in positive territory: possible takeover candidate Amvescap rose another 3.3 per cent and Shire Pharmaceuticals edged up 0.2 per cent.Participants said the initial spikes in activity were the result of the early confusion about what had actually happened. This injected a sense of panic and worried investors cut risk sharply. As the events became clearer, markets steadied somewhat and focused on the implications of the attacks.In bond markets, yields initially fell sharply as traders speculated the attacks would increase the likelihood of cuts in European and UK interest rates, while possibly slowing further US monetary tightening.Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at scheduled meetings yesterday.Sterling fell to $1.7403 against the dollar, an 18-month low, but steadied around $1.743 late in New York. Both the pound and the greenback slid sharply against the Swiss franc, a traditional safe haven in time of market uncertainty, but managed to recover.Brent crude in London hit a record high of $60.70, then fell more than $5 to its low of the day at $55.55 after the attacks before closing at $59.28 a barrel. In New York, Nymex crude dropped as low as $57.20 in electronic trade but closed the day 55 cents lower at $60.73By the end of trade, major US stock indices had recovered losses and were little changed on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent.US strategists saw little reason for the tragedy to cause investors much long-term worry. “Historically markets in the US have not responded to overseas attacks on foreign interests,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Smith Barney. “As long as there is a response and determination to move on, and nothing else happens, markets tend to come back within two months.”Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America, said the rapid stabilisation in the US suggested that markets had largely priced in this type of risk and were taking a longer-term view.“Assuming there are no other near-term attacks, we would expect the markets to stabilise further and focus on other issues, such as quarterly earnings releases, in coming weeks,” he added.
690;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-07-01T20:57:06Z;Wall Street ends half on a positive note;;Wall Street concluded a modestly positive quarter with gains this week, as traders took an optimistic view despite a further increase in interest rates that at first caused concern.A sharp decline in crude oil futures helped the indices finish the week higher, alongside the view that the US, the world’s largest economy, might be able to grow despite the central bank’s commitment to tightening borrowing costs.By Friday’s close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent up at 10,303.44 while the broader S&P 500 index gained 0.3 per cent to 1,194.44. The Nasdaq was virtually unchanged to 2,057.37.Over the five sessions the Dow gained 0.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.2 per cent each. The second quarter ended on an uninspiring note, with the S&P 500 registering a 0.9 per cent fall over the three months, while the narrower Dow advanced 2.2 per cent and the technology-laced Nasdaq put on 2.9 per cent.Crude prices, which were about $60 at the start of the week, fell throughout the week, removing one concern from traders’ agenda. But gains were held in check by the markets’ other chief preoccupation, the Federal Reserve and what it intends to do to monetary policy.The question had less to do with the maths than with the literature component of Thursday’s meeting of Fed policymakers.While the quarter-point increase had been expected, some market participants had hoped Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues might hint at the end of the cycle of monetary tightening. When the hint failed to materialise, bearish fears that rising borrowing costs would affect already-slowing corporate profit growth weighed on stocks.However, on Friday the market’s structural optimism, combined with what some older traders call its tendency to demonstrate the attention span of a two-year-old, came into force. A batch of positive data signalled the economy continued to grow despite recent interest rate increases, and buying ensued.Among stocks in the news this week, airline stocks rose as crude futures cooled. The Amex airline index climbed 6.3 per cent on Tuesday, lifted by Delta Air Lines’s 12.8 per cent surge, along with a 9.3 per cent jump in AMR, the parent of American Airlines, and AirTran Holdings, the parent of a low-cost carrier that added 6.1 per cent. For the week Delta was off 0.3 per cent as AMR added 0.8 per cent and AirTran gained 2.7 per cent.A high-profile legal spat in the technology sector put semiconductors in the spotlight. In a move reminiscent of battles against Microsoft last decade, Advanced Micro Devices accused its larger rival Intel of coercive tactics and forcing clients to use its own chips as opposed to AMD’s. Shares in AMD rose 6.3 per cent for the session. Intel added 1.8 per cent. On the week AMD put on 1.6 per cent as Intel added 0.4 per cent.Deal-making continued to attract attention, but bids did not have to be completed to generate excitement. The stock of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gained 12.9 per cent to more than $300 per share amid reports the CME was pursuing its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. For the week, CME was 15.8 per cent up.The banking sector provided most of the merger and acquisition excitement. Bank of America on Thursday said it was taking over MBNA, a credit card issuer, in a $35bn cash-and-stock deal that sent BofA’s shares 2.8 per cent lower, while MBNA’s soared 24.2 per cent, and ended the week 20.1 per cent up as BofA was 3.7 per cent lower for the same period.Executive appointments attracted attention but generated more subtle market reactions.The appointment of John Mack as Morgan Stanley’s chief executive officer and chairman led to a 1.6 per pent decline in the bank’s shares on Thursday.The appointment of James McNerney as Boeing chief executive sent its shares up 6.8 per cent on the week, while shares of 3M, whence Mr McNerney hails, fell 4.9 per cent on Thursday and were down 3.3 per cent on the week.
691;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-06-28T20:28:56Z;Wall Street boosted by data and lower crude;;Positive data on consumer confidence and a retreat in crude oil futures helped Wall Street stocks higher as a high-profile lawsuit put the semiconductor sector under the spotlight.Profit-taking ended the run that sent Nymex crude oil contracts above $60 on Monday. The benchmark WTI contract fell more than $1 on Tuesday as John Snow, the Treasury secretary, acknowledged that high fuel prices were hurting the world’s largest economy.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent up at 10,405.63, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.9 per cent at 1,201.57. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2 per cent at 2,069.89.An index of consumer confidence reached a three-year high. Steve Wieting, the US economist at Citigroup, said the data pointed to continued strength in consumer spending despite rising fuel prices, adding that labour market conditions also appeared to be improving.Economists fear that high crude will mean higher costs, but they are more worried about the impact it could have on consumer spending if it forces Americans to fill up their cars using money they would have otherwise spent in shops. The consumer sector accounts for about two-thirds of activity.Marc Pado, US market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told clients that some technical market indicators pointed to oversold conditions and concluded that “with oil below $60, stocks are worth a nibble”.In a predictable market reaction to the declining oil price, airline stocks saw broad gains and some were among the top performers on the New York Stock Exchange. The Amex sector index rose 6.3 per cent as Delta Air Lines put on 12.8 per cent to $3.97. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, was 9.3 per cent higher at $12.3, while AirTran Holdings, the parent of a low-cost carrier, added 6.1 per cent to $9.47.Some energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the laggards on the NYSE as decreased oil prices appeared to be seen as a threat to their profits. Amerada Hess declined 3.8 per cent to $106.26 while Marathon Oil lost 2.9 per cent to $53.96.Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.3 per cent to $17.70 after the chipmaker said it had filed a lawsuit against its large arch-rival Intel, whose shares inched up 1.8 per cent to $26.33. The suit alleges that Intel forced clients to use its chips at the expense of AMD’s.IBM shares rose 1.9 per cent to $75.30 amid a broad rally for Dow stocks and despite news that regulators were looking into the disclosure of disappointing figures in the spring.Sun Microsystems put on 1.4 per cent to $3.74 on news it had agreed to buy SeeBeyond Technologies, a software company, for $387m. Shares in SeeBeyond jumped 30.8 per cent to $4.29.Meanwhile, shares in Apollo Group, an education company, gave up 1.4 per cent to $79.13 after the company reported a 40 per cent increase in profits, but gave a cautious earnings forecast.Also reporting earnings was Paychex, whose shares rose 10 per cent to $33.01 after the payroll processor said new clients and higher prices helped it increase profits in the last quarter.
692;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-06-24T20:42:54Z;Crude price keeps Wall Street in the red;;Jitters over the upward creep in oil prices kept US equities under pressure this week as crude hit the important, and largely psychological, $60 a barrel level.Modest gains earlier in the week, on the back of a succession of positive economic news, were thrown into reverse after oil hit the record high on Thursday afternoon, and dealers, many of whom had set up automatic trading triggers, rushed to offload stock.By the end of trade on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at its owest for nearly six weeks, having dropped 1.2 per cent to 10,297.84. The broader S&P 500 index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,191.54 while the technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.8 per cent to 2,053.27.Over the week, the Dow was 2.1 per cent lower, with the S&P losing 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq was also down1.3 per cent.Compounding the effect of higher oil prices was that of attractive offers elsewhere.“To paraphrase Marilyn Monroe, gentlemen prefer bonds,” said Bob Baur, managing director of trading and economics at Principal Global Investors. “There’s been good news this week for bonds with Treasuries up 8 ticks, yields down and inflation still not a problem.”As ever, oil producers gained the most from higher prices while energy-dependent companies, particularly airlines, took a kicking.The airline index was down 3.4 per cent at 47.24, while Delta Airlines was down 3.4 per cent at $3.72. Northwest dropped 3.4 per cent to $4.88.Boeing shares were hit on Monday after Air Canada announced it had cancelled an order for 32 aircraft worth $6bn. Boeing shares were down 2 per cent at $60.59.FedEx was prominent among companies blaming high energy costs for predicted lower profits, suffering a 7.8 per cent fall in its share price on Thursday on warnings that its profits would fall in the current quarter. On Friday it was down another 0.8 per cent at $80.10.Higher energy costs will also add to the bottom line of metal manufacturers, steelmakers in particular, which were hit on Friday by news that Morgan Stanley had cut its view on the sector. Steel Dynamics, one of the two companies it downgraded, was down 2.2 per cent to $25.70.Automakers also had an unhappy week. Ford announced late on Tuesday that it had reduced its profit outlook for the year. The share price fell 4.3 per cent on Wednesday and was down another 1.8 per cent on Friday at $10.21. Its main suppliers were also pulled down, particularly Visteon, which fell 4 per cent yesterday to $6.01.The oil majors did better, with Unocal becoming the focus of much attention after it became the subject of a $19.6bn unsolicited bid by the Chinese state oil producer CNOOC. On Thursday the US oil producer said it had received a waiver from merger partner Chevron that will allow it to talk to CNOOC. Unocal was up 0.2 per cent yesterday to $65.20, while CNOOC’s New York listed shares were also up 0.5 per cent at $54.90.For Mr Baur the market falls indicated a far from disastrous retreat but simply reflected a “natural slowdown” in the economy.“We have had a lot of good news that shows the US economy is resilient – consumer sentiment ticked up, household incomes are doing very well and oil prices keep trying to go down but worldwide demand for oil is still just too strong.“There will be a slowdown but it’s a natural and expected thing,” he said.Ebay had a mixed week after the share price was set back on Monday over concerns Google was targeting its PayPal system with an alternative online payment system. It received another 5 per cent hit on Thursday with the loss of one of its key technologists, rumoured to be heading for Froogle, Google’s shopping arm.Its shares made a modest recovery after the company announced a new system called ProStores, designed to keep its high-value traders within the Ebay fold by offering them Ebay technology that can be used on other sites. The stock was up down slightly yesterday at $34.37, while Google gained 2.6 per cent at $297.25.

British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Austrian Airlines increased fuel surcharges. Delta Airlines moved closer to bankruptcy as it sees savings achieved last year eradicated by higher fuel costs, according to Douglas Runte, analyst at Morgan Stanley.Members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls 40 per cent of the world's oil, are considering increasing their production quota for a second time in less than two weeks. But they have limited capacity to boost production. Nauman Barakat, a senior vice-president of energy trading at Refco in New York, said: “There is no sign of demand slowing despite high prices; and demand is going to get stronger in the fourth quarter.” Economists, including Leo Drollas at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, do not expect prices to fall significantly until economic growth is undermined, in turn reducing the demand for fuel.But some politicians believe signs of damped growth are beginning to show. Heizo Takenaka, Japan's economics minister, said: “Japan's economy is showing positive signs of emerging from a soft patch, but oil prices may become a risk factor.”High oil prices prompted the yen to fall against the dollar and euro on Friday. Sam Bodman, energy secretary, said this week: “The supply of oil is having considerable difficulty keeping pace with demand.”

694;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Earnings and oil fears take toll on Wall St;;US stocks fell on Thursday as investors balked at another surge in oil prices, compounding the effect of weak earnings announced earlier in the day.Crude oil futures surged by nearly $2 to a record $60 a barrel, increasing concerns about falling corporate profits and consumer spending.The major airlines were particularly damaged, with the Amex Airline index falling 3.7 per cent to 48.7. Delta was the worst off, sinking 6.3 to $3.85.Logistics company, Covenant Transport, also blamed higher oil prices on a predicted fall in second-quarter earnings. Its shares fell 5.6 per cent to $12.22.By the close, the S&P 500 index was at 1,200.73, down 1.1 per while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6 per cent at 10,421.44. After earlier gains the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 per cent to 2,070.66.“The market was given a slap in the face when we hit $60,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co., who believed much of the selling may have been sparked by automate triggers set up by traders. “We have had that disconect with the market largely ignoring oil prices creeping up all week. However, when a market like that changes direction it is very hard to stop the momentum.”In economic news, better-than-expected jobless figures were released showing new applications for unemployment benefits had fallen to their lowest in two months. However, the news was balanced by a separate report that said home sales slipped in May.FedEx and ATI Technologies both fell in early trading before the oil surge.Despite announcing strong growth in its fourth quarter, FedEx’s share price sank 8.3 per cent $80.77 after it also revealed that high oil prices would eat into its profits in the current quarter.The chipmaker ATI fell 7.7 per cent to $11.80 after it reduced its guidance for the fourth quarter.The market also reacted to developments in the major oil companies after the Chinese state-run oil group CNOOC said it was confident its $18.5bn cash offer for Unocal would beat Chevron’s bid. Chevron shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $57.33 while Unocal was at $65.02, up 0.3 per cent. And CNOOC’s New York-listed shares were up 3.5 per cent at $55.15.In other deal news, shares in Ameritrade Holding climbed 2.1 per cent to $18.25 on Wednesday’s announcement that it would buy rival TD Waterhouse USA from Toronto-Dominion Bank.General Electric also lost ground after the conglomerate announced plans to streamline its operations, reorganising its 11 business units into six.After initial slight gains, shares were down 2.4 per cent at $34.66.Research in Motion, the company behind the BlackBerry device, fell 1 per cent to $77.60 after earlier gains following news that the US Patent Office struck down two patents held by NTP as part of a dispute between the companies.

Investors were also grappling with disappointing results from Wal-Mart and a report showing a bigger-than-expected gain in sales across the retail sector last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,189.04, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,159.27, and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,159.27.The price of a barrel of crude oil fell $1.91 in New York, dragging shares in the energy sector down with it. Exxon Mobil, the biggest US oil producer, fell 4.3 per cent to $54.82. Marathon Oil, a rival, fell 5.1 per cent to $46.02. National Oilwell Varco, the bigggest US maker of oilfield equipment, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.63.An official report said that retail sales rose 1.4 per cent last month. The gain was twice what most economists had expected, but the country’s biggest retailer failed to get a boost from the news.Wal-Mart shares fell 2 per cent to $47.65 after the retailer said second-quarter results would probably miss forecasts. The company also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profits. Wal-Mart said unusually cold spring weather and high oil prices were partly to blame for tepid sales.Target, Wal-Mart’s chief US rival, rose 1.2 per cent after it reported higher earnings. The Minnesota-based group reported earnings of 55 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates.An undertow of economic uncertainty continued on Thursday after data showing a shrinking trade deficit pushed the leading indices modestly higher on Wednesday.Jitters over the potential impacts on hedge funds of last week’s unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of General Motors and Ford, the struggling US automakers, led stocks to fall sharply on Tuesday. On Thursday, a report showed that the number of people filing for initial unemployment benefits rose last week.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the lack of direction in the stock market was surprising given the generally upbeat tone of economic and corporate news this earnings season. “This is still a market that is looking for what can go wrong rather than what’s going to go right,” he said.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, rose 0.3 per cent to $26.75 after it reported profits up 30 per cent for the quarter, driven by strong DVD sales.Shares in UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, edged 1 per cent to $1.00 a day after the company reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss. A court earlier this week ruled that the government should assume billions of dollars worth of pensions liabilities from the struggling commercial carrier. United said the move was necessary to avert bankruptcy.FedEx, the express shipper, slipped 2.6 per cent after it reaffirmed its second-quarter guidance. The company said that it expected earnings of between $1.40 and $1.50 a share.Ford Motor, the second-biggest US carmaker, fell 3 per cent to $9.35 after it suspended sales of unsecured short-term loans. Losses sharpened after Moody’s, the ratings agency, cut the company’s debt ratings to just above junk. General Motors, Ford’s bigger rival, fell 1.2 per cent to $30.62.Shares in US airlines were mixed. Delta Air Lines rose 1.1 per cent while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.8 per cent. Investors were keeping a close eye on developments at United, the bankrupt US carrier. A court earlier this week relieved United’s parent, UAL, of billions of dollars in pension obligations.

The S&P 500 index was 1.1 per cent off at 1,166.15.Arthur Hogan, the US market analyst at Jefferies, said the declines owed much to crude oil reaching $53 per barrel amid concerns about supplies of fuel ahead of an expected rise in demand.“Oil at this price is enough to make us take some gains off the top of this market,” Mr Hogan said.General Motors added 0.6 per cent to $31.53 amid reports that the recent downgrade of the carmaker’s debt to junk and the bid by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian for a large stake in the company could lead to a large-scale hedge-fund collapse. Some funds were thought to be selling GM stock short while buying the debt, thereby being caught against the market two days in a row last week.“It’s certainly possible that some people got caught wrong-footed,” said Mr Hogan. However, he added that the timing of the two announcements may “have helped as many people as it hurt” if other investors were on the other side of the same trade.Delta Air Lines sank 10 per cent to $2.97 after it revealed the extent of its financial straits in a regulatory filing that said rising fuel costs would contribute to a large loss for the remainder of the year. The Amex airline sector index lost 2.8 per cent on the news.Cisco Systems closed virtually unchanged at $18.21 as investors awaited the networking group’s quarterly earnings results, due after the close.Retailers reporting results this week included the Greater Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, a regional grocer, which announced a narrower loss than expected and saw shares add 23.4 per cent to $22.55. The stock has more than trebled in the past seven months.Shares in Priceline.com fell 10.1 per cent to $23.94 after the online travel services site said profits and revenues fell below forecasts.On a more upbeat note, Audible jumped 17.5 per cent to $16.78 after the digital audio content company reported quarterly earnings that exceeded expectations.In deal news, Nuance Communications surged 39 per cent to $4.31 after it said it would be taken over by ScanSoft, a rival developer of speech-recognition technology in computers. ScanSoft lost 16.8 per cent to $3.77.Toll Brothers, the housing company, saw shares decline by 2.5 per cent to $79.30 even after it reported a rise in the value and number of contracts signed in the latest quarter.
697;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.7 per cent to 2,005.40.Throughout the morning the market had been weighed by news of the US trade deficit in February widened to a bigger-than-expected $61bn, an all-time record. Some market watchers have warned that the rising trend in the US trade gap undermines the sustainability of the economy’s recovery.However, the bulls stepped in after minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Open market Market Committee, the monetary policy body of the US central bank, showed the Federal Reserve was unlikely to tighten monetary policy sooner and harder than anticipated.The minutes said Fed policymakers concluded that “an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time”. In addition, market participants perceived the minutes as an assurance that the Fed would stick to its strategy of quarter-point interest rates increases for the time being.Market participants were expecting to glean insight into the Fed’s intention on interest rates from the minutes. Richard Iley at BNP Paribas said: “We cannot predict how hawkish today’s minutes will be but . . . expect a clear signal that real policy rates remain too low for the FOMC’s comfort against a backdrop of mounting inflation risks.”Stocks in companies that were facing lawsuits for asbestos-related liability saw broad buying after leading senators raised hopes that those liabilities might be capped by legislation.Shares in WR Grace shot up 32.2 per cent to $10.63 while USG put on 24.5 per cent to $43.90.Among the Dow industrials, Boeing declined 1.6 per cent to $58.45 despite reports that Northwest Airlines had ordered 18 of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

The S&P was off 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4 per cent.Friday’s slump followed a closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the computer chip group. Intel raised its sales guidance and said profit margins were better than expected, but shares slipped 2.6 per cent yesterday to end the week at $24.20The report failed to breathe life into the beleaguered chips sector, which fell sharply after Texas Instruments narrowed its quarterly guidance on Tuesday. TI shares fell 2.6 per cent for the week.National Semiconductor, a rival, fared better. Its shares rose more than 5 per cent on Thursday after profits beat expectations. They gained 3.6 per cent for the week.Xilinx fell 0.7 per cent to $30.66 for the week in spite of issuing improved guidance for the fourth quarter. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which tracks chip stocks, fell 1.2 per cent to 427.92.Qwest fell 1 per cent for the week as it mulled a sweetened bid for MCI, the rival telecoms group.

Its shares fell 4.1 per cent for the week to $32.56.Delta Air Lines fell 14 per cent for the week after the company warned on Thursday that lower margins and high fuel costs would lead to significant losses in 2005. Oil prices and inflation held sway over market sentiment throughout the five-session period, as the price of the US crude benchmark approached the $55 a barrel mark.Analysts said that inflation fears, fuelled in part by the rising price of oil, were the key culprits behind the market’s steep mid-week losses. Those fears sparked a steep jump in bond yields on Wednesday and prompted a flight from equities.Among other stocks making news this week, the International Securities Exchange turned heads when its shares shot up 69 per cent on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering. Shares in the US’s first publicly listed options exchange closed 69 per cent higher for the week at $30.40.Energy stocks found little joy in rising oil prices as investors moved to cash-in positions. Devon Energy was hit by a downgrade on Thursday, sending shares 3.9 per cent lower for the week.ExxonMobil slipped 3.9 per cent for the week. Merrill Lynch on Wednesday was rumoured to have bought $897m worth of Exxon stock at a discount to the market price to execute a trade for an anonymous client. Traders said the move was probably the result of a big institutional investor liquidating its position in the company.Energy groups have been among the best-performing stocks over the past year.Mergers and acquisitions were also in the spotlight after two big deals were revealed on Monday. United Defense Industries agreed to a $4.2bn takeover by the US arm of BAE Systems, the UK defence group, sending shares up 25 per cent for the week to $73.08.Capital One Financial slipped 0.2 per cent for the week after it announced a $5.3bn takeover of Hibernia, the Louisiana-based bank. Hibernia shares ended the week 23 per cent higher at $32.70.Colgate-Palmolive added to the M&A buzz by dropping an anti-takeover provision three years earlier than originally planned. The move followed a big shake-up at the company and followed the $57bn merger between Procter & Gamble and Gillette, which has put pressure on other groups in the sector.Colgate shares fell 0.9 per cent for the week.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,059.72.Falling oil prices helped stem midday losses and helped break the pattern of weakening share prices that has dominated trading in recent sessions.Rising oil prices earlier this week fuelled inflation fears that sent bond yields sharply higher on Wednesday, sparking a flight from equities.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said the market was pricing in an expectation that oil would eventually fall back towards the $40-$50 level.“If it is ’s not and if oil goes to $55-$60, that changes the whole equation,” he said.Energy groups were the leading laggards on the S&P 500 as they followed the price of oil lower.

702;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-02-23T00:29:59Z;Continental and American win China route;;"Continental and American Airlines have tentatively won one of the hardest- fought route battles in the US, securing the right to fly from the US to China from 2005 and 2006, the first new awards to China for passenger airlines in more than 20 years.The Department of Transportation announcement follows an aggressive lobbying campaign. American Airlines marshalled the support of 26 senators, seven governors, 24 mayors and 38 airports, while Delta and Continental submitted at least 10,000 employee letters to underpin their application.The new allocations are the result of the US-China bilateral agreement signed in July, which expands flying between the countries.US carriers United and Northwest operate flights between the US and China: United operates 28 non-stop weekly roundtrips; Northwest offers flights via Tokyo. Continental could from March offer up to seven weekly flights from Newark to Beijing. The DOT concluded: “The most serious service deficiency is the lack of US carrier non-stop service to China from New York, which represents by far the largest US-China origin and destination [O&D] market in this proceeding.”Continental was awarded the service from 2005 a decision which was a blow to American, the world's largest airline. It lost out to United in previous route battles over China, and had argued that its OneWorld Alliance was the only international alliance without direct access to China. It expects to start its Chicago to Shanghai service from March 2006.Delta, which came up empty-handed said: “We are extremely disappointed at today's news. For the 2006 award, Delta would have provided more service, to more passengers, in more cities, through Atlanta.” Delta said it would file an objection with DOT by March 8, and lobby the administration to negotiate a 2007 designation from the Chinese government. Passenger traffic from the US to China has boomed. The DOT said from 1993 to 2002, passenger traffic grew by an average of 23 per cent.China ranked first in the US-foreign country O&D for market growth rates between 1998 and 2002.Cargo routes have also been expanded, with 12 new frequencies being added from 2006. According to the Department of Commerce, air exports to China increased 19.1 per cent in 2003 compared with 2002, while air imports from China rose 9.6 per cent.However, the DOT was quick to downplay optimism about this export trend, adding: “The market continues to be highly directional, with approximately 85 per cent of the traffic moving in the eastbound direction from China and 15 per cent westbound from the United States to China.” The DOT reiterated its call for further liberalisation, calling for “an Open Skies relationship as quickly as possible, to ensure that air transportation services help to facilitate, rather than bottleneck, continued bilateral economic growth.”Jeff Shane, under-secretary of policy at the DOT, has attacked the restrictions on routes which required a “tedious, anachronistic carrier selection process.”"
703;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-02-06T16:21:49Z;Book review: Scandal of America's top executive pay;;"PAY WITHOUT PERFORMANCE
The Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation
By Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse M.Fried
Harvard University Press, $24.95, £16.95In 1997, Delta Air Lines awarded Ronald Allen, its retiring chief executive, a $3.5m seven-year consulting contract. What did Delta expect from Mr Allen in return? That he ""perform his consulting services at such times, and in such places, and for such periods as will result in the least inconvenience to him"".What if he became too ill to do even those convenient pieces of consulting? He would still get the money. And if he died? His heirs would get the money.By contrast, the conditions AOL Time Warner imposed on Gerald Levin when he stepped down as chief executive were draconian. In return for an annual fee of $1m, Mr Levin had to provide the company with five days of consulting a month.There are several such nuggets in this comprehensive account of the scandal that is US executive pay. Yet what astonishes are not the big perks that companies give their departing bosses - it is the small ones. When Jacques Nasser was sacked from Ford in 2001, the company gave him one free car a year, as well as the option of buying more at a discount. All that for someone with a pension of $1.27m of year.The authors - both US law professors - are not outraged by the levels of chief executive remuneration. Indeed, they would not mind chief executives earning even more. What they object to is the way companies camouflage their top executives' pay - by, for example, providing absurdly inflated post-retirement perks, as in the examples above.Their second objection is that executive pay is often unrelated to performance. This is particularly true when it comes to share options, which allow senior executives to benefit from rising share prices that owe more to market movements than to anything they have done for their companies. The authors are unimpressed by the move away from share options to restricted stock. A restricted stock, they say, is simply a share option with an exercise price of zero.The third objection, and the one that underlies their carefully constructed case, is that chief executives' remuneration is decided by outside directors with no real interest in safeguarding shareholders' interests.Many argue that recent US corporate governance reforms will change all that. Compensation committees, for example, now have to be composed of independent directors. The authors welcome the reforms. They accept they will make some difference to remuneration practices, but not much.Whatever the committee set-up, independent directors will continue to do chief executives' bidding when it comes to pay, they predict. The social pressures to conform are strong on any board. No one likes to be the perpetual dissenter; strong bonds of collegiality develop in any group.Also, outside directors' pay is now sufficiently high that they will not want to lose it. Nor will they want to undermine their chances of being appointed to other boards. Which board will want to appoint a trouble-maker, one who is going to start objecting to the structure and level of the chief executive's pay?Most of the corporate governance reforms have concentrated on making directors more independent. What is really needed, the authors say, is to make directors more dependent - on shareholders. They propose various reforms, including making it easier for shareholders to dismiss directors and elect their own representatives. They point out, however, that companies' furious objections to the tepid board election reforms proposed so far do not inspire optimism.For anyone looking for a guide to the debate over American top pay, this book will be indispensable. It is clear, well-argued, fully researched and deeply felt. But it is a guide to American pay, and this is also its principal weakness.Looking beyond the US might have helped the authors deal with the question of how to mobilise shareholders who may see little reason to engage with a particular board over the company's remuneration policy. They would have benefited, for example, from looking at how, in the UK, the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds have forced the pace of reform. Given that shareholders are often temporary residents of company share registers, it often takes the bigger players or representative organisations to have an effect."
704;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-02-02T00:59:58Z;Delta pursues low-cost structure;;Delta Air Lines, which nearly filed for bankruptcy last year, has set itself the ambitious goal of reaching within 10 per cent of the cost structure of low-cost carriers within the next year, according to a senior executive.Michael Palumbo, finance director, said Delta's costs were about 30-40 per cent higher than low-cost carriers. “We are trying to drive ourselves, within the next 12 months, to within 10 per cent of that competitive disparity, and in 2006 to the moderate to low single digits differential. Our plan is about that level of change. Delta's is a unique solution, where we can deliver unique productivity.”The comments follow Delta's biggest loss in its 75-year history of $5.2bn in 2004. That has forced it to rethink its business model.Last month it shook up its fare structures. Delta's fourth-quarter costs per available seat mile, after neutralising the cost of fuel, were 10.15 cents, against low-cost rivals JetBlue's 5.89 cents and AirTran's 7.64 cents.Robert Ashcroft, analyst at UBS, said: “This is a highly aggressive, but likely necessary goal. We would expect to see Delta adopting many of the same tactics pioneered by American [Airlines] to adapt low-cost carrier techniques.”On Monday, Delta moved in that direction when it overhauled 51 per cent of its flight schedule, quit its unprofitable hub in Dallas, and changed its hub operations in Atlanta to make them more efficient. With better utilisation of its aircraft and gates, it expects to free 19 additional aircraft which, in turn, will generate up to $100m in new revenue.However, to meet its costs goals, especially for 2006, Delta must secure a legislative solution for its burdensome defined benefit pension costs. It also needs to review its mixed fleet of aircraft, which bring costs in complexity and pilot training. “They have introduced a Southwest-type pricing approach, yet Southwest does not have big hubs, regional jets or a mixed network,” says Hubert Horan, an industry consultant.Mr Palumbo acknowledged that bankrupt airlines could emerge with lower labour costs, but said: “We don't need to match up line item by line item. We need to match up in the aggregate.”Although fuel prices at $46 are above Delta's earlier assumptions of $40 per barrel in 2005, Mr Palumbo said: “Last year there were multiple attempts at price increases [to pass on higher fuel prices to passengers], none of which stuck. That changed in the fourth quarter, when fuel was above $45. We saw four to five price increases, some led by low-cost carriers, which did stick.” Delta has already drawn down $811m of its most recent $1.13bn credit facility. Mr Palumbo said: “The liquidity facility was important to have in place to permit the implementation of our plan.”
705;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-01-25T21:41:15Z;Wall St cheers as heavyweights post earnings;;"US stocks closed firmly higher on Tuesday as investors cheered a bevy of upbeat earnings from Wall Street heavyweights.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 10,460.16 - its biggest single-day gain this year. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,168.44 and the Nasdaq Composite finished 0.6 per cent higher at 2,019.95.The top US indices have been mired in a bearish cycle recently in spite of a strong start to the earnings season. Two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings this season have beaten expectations, according to Thomson Financial. With almost a quarter of companies having reported, 17 per cent have missed forecasts while 18 per cent have hit their earnings targets.Profit-taking and a lack of fresh cash have pushed US stocks lower for most of January, however, raising fears for Wall Street's prospects in the months ahead.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said expectations of improved earnings had already been priced in after the market's strong performance late last year. ""[There were] some pretty meaningful expectations out there for companies to beat,"" he said.A series of upbeat earnings reports from leading US companies and a survey showing an unexpected rise in consumer confidence in January gave fresh cheer to bullish investors yesterday after the recent sell-off.Merck, the drugs group that pulled its Vioxx pain-killer from the shelves late last year citing health concerns, rose 3.7 per cent to $30.95 after it reported fourth-quarter profits in line with expectations.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare and drugs group, rose 3.6 per cent to $63.72 after its fourth-quarter sales beat forecasts.DuPont, the chemicals group, rose 1.2 per cent to $46.58 after it beat expectations with earnings of 37 cents a share.Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, rose 2.1 per cent to $57.99 even though it recorded a slight fall in fourth-quarter profits. Revenues at the bank were sharply higher for the year.Semiconductors led gainers on the S&P 500, propelled by earnings news from Fairchild. The computer chip maker rose 3.9 per cent to $13.49 after it reported improved fourth-quarter profits. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which has fallen more than 14 per cent since December, climbed 1.8 per cent to 389.87.Leading airline stocks soared, led by Continental, which rose 8.9 per cent to $9.51 after JPMorgan added the company to its ""focus list"" of stocks to watch. Delta Air Lines rose 6.6 per cent and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, climbed 5.2 per cent. John O'Donoghue, managing director of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said some of the rise might have been due to a lack of supply and pent-up demand from short-sellers."
706;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2005-01-20T12:38:41Z;Delta sees biggest loss in its history;;Delta Air Lines underscored the need for a radical shake-up in the way it operates, including its recent fare initiatives, when it reported net losses for 2004 of $5.2bn, easily dwarfing previous losses at other carriers.The huge loss was the worst performance for Delta in its 75-year history, though it was exacerbated by unusual items, including a $1.9bn goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these items, the annual loss was $2.3bn, and the quarterly net loss $780m, more than four times its quarterly loss a year ago.The results, and the weak balance sheet - cash balances stood at $1.8bn at the end of the year, compared with Northwest's $2.6bn - gives Delta little room for mistakes as it tries to drive through its transformation plans.This month it said it would simplify its fares, cutting some of the highest by up to 50 per cent, and abandoning Saturday night stay requirements.That proposal is expected to put pressure on revenues across the industry in 2005, adding to an already tough marketplace.In the fourth quarter, Delta's yields tumbled 7.7 per cent, the steepest decline of any of the major airlines to have reported so far.Continental Airlines, by contrast, said its domestic adjusted yields remained at a premium to the rest of the industry, falling just 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter. Its quarterly loss was $206m and annual loss in 2004 was $363m, compared with earnings of $38m in 2003.Both airlines said 2005 would continue to be difficult, and blamed the rising cost of fuel and competition from low-cost carriers for their losses. Although Continental has performed better - aided by its more competitive labour costs, a legacy of its two bankruptcy filings - it recently said it needed a further $500m in labour cuts. It has agreements in place for $169m of these cuts.Continental's balance sheet is among the weakest in the industry. It closed the year with $1.46bn in cash.Delta, which narrowly averted bankruptcy last year, after securing concessions from its pilots, will at the end of the month redesign its main hub in Atlanta, as it moves to transform its hub network and retrench from Dallas Fort Worth.The shift of capacity to Atlanta is expected to put more pressure on AirTran, a low-cost rival, which operates from the same hub.Analysts were surprised by Delta's aggressive expansion plans for 2005. It said it expected to expand capacity by 6 to 8 per cent this year, nearly twice what JPMorgan Chase had been forecasting.Continental's shares rose 1.4 per cent to $9.58. Delta's shares fell 6.5 per cent to $5.56.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.8 per cent to 1,201.79 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,151.94.Bulls continued to be frustrated at the lack of a traditional post-Christmas bounce, which eluded investors as the stock market sputtered in the last trading sessions of 2004.US stocks remain near 3½-year highs, in spite of their lacklustre year-end run. And, although the rate of economic growth is expected to moderate this year as the effects of interest rate rises take hold and inflationary pressure mounts, many analysts expect the market to continue its forward momentum into early 2005.Anirvan Banerji, director of research at the Economic Cycle Research Institute, said: ""We have an ongoing global industrial slowdown, but the outlook is fairly resilient.""Mr Banerji said that, in spite of uncertainties about the US twin deficits and the weakening dollar, ""for the time being we are likely to see global expansion"".A mixed bag of economic news greeted investors on Monday, with one report showing rising orders and declining employment at US factories. Separate figures showed that construction spending slowed in November, confounding expectations of a modest rise.Early attention fell on Merck, the embattled drugs group, which was forced to withdraw its painkiller Vioxx from the market in November because of health concerns. Merck shares slipped 2.8 per cent to $31.25 after the Financial Times reported that research on Vioxx may be published in a medical journal.Pfizer, whose Celebrex painkiller is part of the same drug class as Vioxx, fell 1.6 per cent to $26.45.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 1.1 per cent to $53.40 after it raised its December sales outlook. The company said it expected same-store sales to rise 3 per cent after post-Christmas trading beat expectations.Kmart, a rival, rose 1.2 per cent to $100.10 after its same-store sales fell by less than expected, while Walgreen, the drugstore chain, jumped 5 per cent to $40.29 after its quarterly earnings came in ahead of analysts' estimates.Energy stocks led decliners, with mild weather pushing oil prices lower. Valero Energy, the Texas-based oil refining group, fell 5.2 per cent to $43.06, while rival Sunoco slipped 5 per cent to $77.62.Among other stocks making news, Delta Air Lines, the third-biggest US carrier, rose 1.1 per cent to $7.56 after reports that the company planned to slash fares.Delta shares had plunged after its Comair subsidiary was forced to cancel all of its flights on Christmas, stranding thousands of passengers.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, the biggest US carrier, rose 0.8 per cent to $11.04.Hollinger International, the media group, rose 0.1 per cent to $15.70 after the New York Stock Exchange gave the company until March to file its 2003 annual report.Dow Chemical,the chemicals group, slipped 0.1 per cent to $49.94, erasing early gains, after the company said it would sell its remaining stake in its DuPont Dow Elastomers joint venture."

Other action was limited amid a dearth of corporate news.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 10,800.82. The S&P 500 was marginally firmer at 1,213.55, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1 per cent to 2,178.34.Traders, pundits and investors brimming with anticipation at the prospect of a so-called ""Santa Claus rally"" to end the year have been disappointed by the stock market's lacklustre performance in the first days of post-Christmas trading.Bulls took heart in the penultimate trading session of the year, however, as oil briefly fell back below $42 per barrel and US figures showed a bigger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims.Boeing, the aerospace group, took centre stage after it announced it had won a $1.3bn order for 10 of its new 7E7 Dreamliner commercial jets from Continental. But Boeing shares gave up early gains to fall 0.3 per cent to $51.90.Defence stocks edged higher despite a New York Times report that the Pentagon plans drastic spending cuts. Lockheed Martin rose 0.6 per cent to $55.60. Northrop Grumman edged up 0.3 per cent to $54.76.Airlines recovered some of their recent losses, with AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, up 1.6 per cent to $10.98. Continental Airlines rose 1.9 per cent to $13.70 and Delta Air Lines jumped 0.8 per cent to $7.51. US Airways fell 6.6 per cent to $1.14, however, as its Comair subsidiary continued to struggle to clear a backlog of lost luggage from cancelled flights on Christmas.Steelmakers led decliners amid mounting concerns that a flood of Chinese steel exports could lead to falling prices. US Steel fell 5.5 per cent to $50.04, while Nucor, a rival, dropped 6.4 per cent to $51.38.

The Nasdaq Composite was barely changed at 2,177.01.The stock market's sputtering performance confounded bullish investors seeking to extend Tuesday's rally, which led all three main US indices to fresh multi-year highs.By the end of Wednesday's session, the Dow was down for the week while both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher, stoking investors' hopes that the stock market would regain momentum to finish the year on a high note.Joe McAlinden, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said: ""It's possible that the strength we saw starting in late October and continuing to mid-December has sapped some of the potential of this final week before the new year.""Mr McAlinden stressed, however, that market fundamentals remained solid, with a ""pretty good"" outlook for corporate earnings in early 2005.Amid a quiet week for corporate news, investor attention remained fixed on oil prices, which edged higher after car bombs exloded in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Investors also digested an update on the US crude oil and distillate stockpile.Aerospace stocks led decliners after a string of downbeat reports from the defence and commercial aircraft sectors. Lockheed Martin, the defence group, fell 2.7 per cent to $55.25 after the New York Times reported that the Pentagon planned cuts in its F/A-22 stealth fighter programme. The US air force had planned to buy 277 fighters at $258m each.Boeing, the leading US aerospace group, fell 2.2 per cent to $52.09 after the Wall Street Journal reported that China planned to suspend new aircraft purchases.Airline stocks were also lower one day after the US government announced it would open an investigation into the severe delays and cancellations that affected flights over the Christmas holiday.US Airways fell 4.7 per cent to $1.22 after it called on employees to volunteer to work without pay at the weekend. The airline was forced to cancel flights and thousands of passengers lost their luggage after large numbers of employees called in sick over Christmas.Delta Air Lines, the parent company of Comair, which stranded thousands of passengers when it cancelled all of its flights on Christmas owing to a computer glitch, fell 1.3 per cent to $7.45.Semiconductor stocks led gainers. Advanced Micro Devices was among the best-performing stocks in the sector, rising as much as 2.3 per cent before falling back to close up 1 per cent at $21.96.Intel, the chip maker, gave up early gains to close down 0.1 per cent at $23.25 after it said it would invest in three companies developing digital devices for the home.Genzyme, the biotechnology group, rose 1.1 per cent to $58.16 after US regulators approved the company's leukaemia treatment.Satellite radio stocks continued their bumpy ride, with shares in Sirius Satellite Radio down 6.7 per cent at $7.29.Shares in rival XM Satellite Radio fell 3.2 per cent to $37.63. Both companies have garnered attention in recent months as they attempt to carve a niche in the market for radios that receive music broadcast by satellite.Toys R Us rose 2.6 per cent to $20.59 after the company said it would offer executives bonuses if they chose to stay on after the company completed its restructuring programme."

Marsh & McLennan rose 0.4 per cent to $32.49.Bullish investors looking for signs of a post-Christmas rally pounced on tech stocks in pre-market trading, sending industry bellwethers Intel and Apple Computer higher.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, rose 0.4 per cent to $23.63, while Apple, the personal computer group, rose 1.4 per cent to $64.88.Sharper Image, the specialty gadget chain, plunged more than 17 per cent to $19.05 after it lowered its earnings estimates and reported weaker-than-expected holiday sales.Delta Air Lines, America’s third-largest airline by revenue, fell 3.4 per cent to $7.30 after computer problems forced its Comair subsidiary to cancel all of its Christmas day flights.WR Grace, the materials group, was flat at $13.77 after US Senator Arlen Specter called for Congress to act quickly to set up a fund to compensate victims of asbestos poisoning. WR Grace has a number of outstanding liabilities related to the dangerous insulation material.
711;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-12-16T04:10:42Z;Southwest wins battle for ATA assets;;Southwest Airlines emerged on Wednesday as the victor in the battle for the assets of ATA, the bankrupt low-cost carrier, beating a rival offer from AirTran and underscoring its position as the largest and most successful low-cost airline in the US.The airline has received backing from the creditors committee of ATA and from its management for its offer, worth about $100m. The plan must now receive approval in the bankruptcy court.Southwest?s offer includes paying about $50m to take over six of ATA?s gates at Chicago?s Midway airport - its most important hub and where Southwest is already the leading airline. The package also includes $40m of debtor in possession financing to help ATA restructure, according to several people involved in the talks.Southwest has further promised to provide permanent funding to ATA once it exits from bankruptcy, carrying over its DIP money as well as providing around $30m in the form of an equity injection. In return, it could take a stake of about 27 per cent in ATA, down from the 35 per cent it had originally sought.Southwest does not expect to take over board seats in ATA while the creditors committee is expected to appoint a new management team to replace George Mikelsons, ATA?s founder, as chief executive. Mr Mikelsons may stay on in a non-executive role, however.Assuming the deal is approved in the bankruptcy court, it marks a significant tactical achievement for Southwest?s management team under the leadership of its new chief executive, Gary Kelly. By adding more gates at the Chicago airport, Southwest has effectively seen off the threat of a serious rival emerging at Midway.The deal would represent a significant blow for AirTran, which made an alternative offer of $90m to take over ATA?s 14 gates at Midway airport, and now faces the challenge of where it will put its substantial order of Boeing aircraft deliveries. It is also expected to face further pressure in its Atlanta hub from Delta Airlines.Although the amount of cash offered by AirTran and Southwest were similar, Southwest is taking over fewer ATA gates than AirTran would. It is also offering a code-sharing deal with ATA, which could generate about $25m in net income per year for the bankrupt carrier. The code-sharing agreement, expected to last eight years, will be signed once ATA has restructured its costs and debt.One person involved with the talks said, ?the problem for AirTran is their deal gave the creditors nothing. At least with Southwest they get a code-sharing deal, and ATA keeps more of the gates. If they had put more cash in, Southwest could always match it and outbid them.?The deal still leaves ATA in a precarious financial position, with uncertainty about what it will look like once it has restructured. America West, which had been interested in buying the whole airline, pulled out on Friday after warning that it was unable to secure new leasing deals with ATA?s lessors on acceptable terms, raising doubts about which aircraft will still be available to ATA as it restructures.America West?s withdrawal thwarted hopes among creditors that there would be a bidding war. The auction process, which has lasted for the last few days, resulted in few significant improvements in the bids from Southwest and AirTran, except for Southwest?s agreement to reduce its potential equity stake in ATA.According to several people, AirTran had in the last few days initiated talks with America West to discuss the possibility of a joint bid. However, the two parties ran out of time since ATA faces an important deadline of December 23rd, when it will need to secure money from one of the bids in order to make aircraft payments.Under the section 1110 process in bankruptcy, airlines have 60 days to decide which planes they want to reject. ATA had filed for bankruptcy at the end of October.

The Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,143.07.Traders had one eye on Friday's key jobs report and were also hoping for upbeat news from Intel after the close.Just under two stocks declined for every stock that gained at the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.7bn shares traded by the closing bell. At the Nasdaq, the gaining issues and the losing stocks were just about evenly split.Data showing that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week appeared to weigh on sentiment. However, traders and investors were expected to focus on Friday's monthly job creation figures for a clearer insight into the US labour market, whose erratic trends have vexed market watchers this year.In other economic news, factory orders rose more than economists had expected in October, helped by defence expenditures.Stocks continued to receive support from a steadily declining oil price. Nymex WTI futures lost more than $2 on Friday morning after a drop of more than 7 per cent on Wednesday that eased concerns about economic growth and bolstered bulls' hopes for a year-end rally.Airline stocks were broadly higher on Thursday as the falling price of oil eased cost concerns. The Amex airline index climbed 3.6 per cent.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, led gainers, rising 9.1 per cent to $10.70. Northwest Airlines rose 3.1 per cent to $11.32 and Delta Air Lines was 8.2 per cent higher at $7.90.Chris Watling, managing director at Longview Economics, said he expected the current rally in the S&P 500 to last through the first quarter. ""Beyond that, we expect equities to struggle next year as the corporate profit outlook worsens relative to current expectations, and as valuation pressure increases from a rising real interest rate, a worsening equity volatility trend and a diminishing profit growth outlook,"" he said.An improving economic picture could also lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month.Intel fell 1.7 per cent to $22.71 ahead of its mid-quarter trading update, due after the close. The world's largest chipmaker was widely expected to raise earnings guidance.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, closed flat at $22.62. Semiconductors led Wednesday's rally and Mr Pado said this increased the pressure on the sector, especially on Intel.Some technology investors have warned that the sector has not adjusted to sluggish demand. Others have said the market was unprepared for higher interest rates and a possible dollar crisis. Stocks have largely ignored the greenback's latest decline.A host of retailers reported monthly same-store sales that painted a gloomy picture for the sector ahead of its vital Christmas shopping season.Albertsons, the grocer, slipped 6.1 per cent to $24.20 in spite of the retailer revealing higher quarterly profits boosted by stronger sales.Wet Seal, the clothing chain, said sales at stores open at least one year fell nearly 20 per cent in November. The company's shares rose 2.4 per cent to $1.68.Pier 1 Imports, the home goods retailer, fell 2.2 per cent to $18.30 after the company's earnings guidance disappointed investors. Same-store sales also fell as stagnant demand forced the imported furniture store to cut prices.Cendant, the travel and real estate group, slipped 1.2 per cent to $23.14 after it announced that it was set to buy Ebookers, the UK online travel group, in a deal worth at least $415m.Starbucks jumped 1.9 per cent to $58.65 as the world's biggest coffee chain unveiled same-store sales growth of 13 per cent in November.Away from the retail sector, Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment maker, edged higher after Scott Kriens, chief executive, said the company was considering using its $1.5bn cash pile to make acquisitions. Shares in Juniper rose 1.5 per cent to $28.70."
713;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-12-02T20:49:21Z;Doubt cast on Virgin's US-Nigeria flight plans;;"Sir Richard Branson's ambitious plans to start new airlines in the US and Nigeria were put in question on Thursday when a senior US aviation official suggested they could be in breach of US regulations.Paul Gretch, director of the office of international aviation in the US Department of Transportation (DoT), said it was ""puzzling"" that no application had been made by Virgin America for a certificate as a US carrier.The British entrepreneur's plans to start a new carrier in the US had been talked of for a long time, he said, and had been well publicised. ""But we have not seen an application by Virgin America to the DoT, and I don't think it is coming soon.""Majority ownership of a US airline must be in US hands, and even if that were formally the case, any application for a new carrier must show that ""control"" was also in US hands.Mr Gretch said the DoT would examine any application to see who was on the board, who was managing the company and what the debt structure was.In June, Virgin America announced its official name, presented a management team led by Fred Reid, formerly president and chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines, and unveiled plans to order a fleet of Airbus aircraft. It said it hoped to launch the business in the middle of 2005.A spokeswoman for Virgin America said yesterday that no application had yet been filed because of the complexity of the negotiations to raise private equity for the venture in the US.She said the group would follow US aviation rules ""to the letter of the law…we are not seeking to change US ownership laws"".Separately, Mr Gretch said the US would block any plan by Virgin Nigeria to start services to the US from Nigeria, on the grounds that the carrier would be deemed to be under the control of a UK airline, Virgin Atlantic.This would be in breach of the bilateral air services treaty between Nigeria and the US, which as in most of the world stipulates that national carriers of two countries must operate such services.Virgin Atlantic said in September it expected to own 49 per cent of Virgin Nigeria, but the US could still question the control of that airline too.Virgin said it would start with domestic routes in Nigeria, but later planned to include both regional routes in Africa and long-haul services, possibly starting with Lagos-New York, which currently had no direct service.The issue of foreign ownership and control of airlines is at the heart of the protracted negotiations between the US and the European Union to create a liberalised ""open aviation area"" across the North Atlantic.The last talks collapsed in June amid recriminations.Mr Gretch said yesterday the failure of the EU to agree to the reform deal negotiated by the European Commission and Washington last June had ""lost a golden near-term opportunity to liberalise the transatlantic market for mutual benefit""."
714;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-11-25T18:25:28Z;US airlines take action on finances;;United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both took further steps to tackle the US aviation industry's crippling financial crisis, despite the normally quiet Thanksgiving holiday period.United, which is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy protection, has asked a Chicago judge to allow it to scrap previous pay and benefit agreements with six unions if it fails to agree further voluntary cutbacks. More than $2.5bn of concessions have already been agreed with unions, and executives have also agreed to take pay cuts, but United said “urgent financial needs” meant it would need to negotiate more savings.This follows continued losses at the bankrupt carrier, high fuel prices and concerns that it was poised to breach covenants on its debtor-in-possession financing. The cuts form part of a new business plan it is finalising with its creditors committee.A hearing on the latest court motion is expected in January.Meanwhile, Delta, the third largest US carrier, announced progress in its efforts to stave off bankruptcy.The airline said enough investors had agreed with terms of a planned financial restructuring to allow it to go ahead with a debt exchange.Delta has signed agreements with aircraft lessors and lenders under which the company expects to receive average annual concessions of about $57m between 2005 and 2009.In exchange for these concessions, the company issued 4.3m shares of its common stock.In a statement, the company said: “Delta is continuing to work towards a closing and funding of its previously announced financing commitments from GE Commercial Finance and American Express Travel Related Services Company.”Despite achieving a number crucial agreements with its creditors and unions, challenges remain for the airline in achieving the cost cuts needed to restore profitability.

Further falls in oil prices during the day and a sanguine research report on Google also raised spirits.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,181.76 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9 per cent to 2,102.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 10,520.31. Trading was light, as expected - and will probably remain light for tomorrow's abbreviated post-holiday session.The dollar continued to decline against the euro, hitting a record low of $1.3170. While the sagging fortunes of the greenback may pose long-term challenges to the US economy, the positive effect on earnings of US multinationals is giving stocks a boost.Meanwhile, crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed as much as 1 per cent during the day to $48.50 before closing slightly higher after a late rally. Oil prices have been an important influence on US stocks in recent months, and the commodity's recent pullback has been a big contributor to the recent rally.Among leading stocks, Google gained 4.3 per cent to $174.76after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the internet-search company with a $215 price target. Yahoo and Ebay tacked on 3 per cent and 2 per cent to $37.61 and $111.71, respectively. The internet retailers have been among the strongest performers on the S&P 500 since August.In spite of yesterday's relatively quiet session, investors appear to have remained enthusiastic about the markets in the wake of the election - indeed, since the leading indices touched year-lows in early August. The S&P 500 has climbed 10 per cent since August 11, and many participants are confident the rally will continue through the year-end.""Investors have come to terms with the reality that the economy is plugging along just fine, with stocks putting in a big rally from the summer - when everyone was sure the 'soft patch' would escalate into a disastrous recession,"" said Cody Willard of CL Willard Partners, a tech-focused hedge fund. ""I'm still bullish, but the time to buy was this summer.""Indeed, the market's strong second-half performance has bulls taking a victory lap. ""I think the pessimists need a vacation. They've worked too hard this year,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Oak Associates, in his Thanksgiving commentary. ""They need a break. We can certainly use a break from them.""Of course, strategists with a more bearish perspective acknowledge the factors underpinning the rally - the election, the orderly dollar decline, easing oil prices, the ""terrorism-free"" year - but do not see the market as primed for a sustained rally.""I have a hard time buying that this is a breakout or a signal that now's the time to pour more money in the market,"" said Banc of America strategist Tom McManus, who added that the market had bounced back in November in part from the October weakness amid uncertainty surrounding a possible election upset.Nonetheless, Wall Street was not unduly concerned yesterday as a handful of stocks posted reasonable gains on good news and the market moved higher.Biogen Idec shares rose 2 per cent to $58.59 after the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for its multiple-sclerosis treatment. Shares of Elan, Biogen's partner in the development of the treatment, fell 0.1 per cent to $27.27.DeVry surged 19 per cent to $17.67 after the for-profit education company said it had received an inquiry about a potential takeover. The news helped fuel gains in the sector, with Apollo up 5 per cent at $79.33 and Career Education 5 per cent higher at $39.01.Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines surged 6.6 per cent to $6.98 on news that its debt-exchange plans look on course, another hopeful sign that the carrier can avert or at least forestall bankruptcy. American Airlines gained 5 per cent to $9.17 and Continental Airlines increased 2.5 per cent to $11.26.Among Dow industrials, General Electric eased 0.5 per cent to $35.64 as the industrial conglomerate unveiled another acquisition.

The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.04 per cent to 2,084.28.Crude oil closed just under $49 a barrel. Earlier, oil prices rose above $50 per barrel in morning trade amid concerns about lower reserves of heating oil as cold weather was forecast in the US northeast.In addition to rising oil prices, the falling dollar also weighed on stocks as it reached a new low against the euro. The dollar's decline has highlighted long-standing concerns about the potential effects of massive trade and fiscal deficits in the US.While it increases the competitiveness of US exporters, the weak dollar can also make those companies' earnings look better than they are, potentially causing investors to question the prices they pay for those shares.Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital, cautioned against overinterpreting yesterday's decline. He said investors could be closing positions ahead of a slow day today before Thanksgiving tomorrow and a short session on Friday.However, technical analysts have warned that a failure to put more volume behind the current rally might cause it to run out of steam, especially if crude oil resumes its rise. But just as low volume dents the credibility of an advance, it also exaggerates a retrenchment.Shares in McDonald's were up 2.5 per cent to $30.10 after the company announced that its chief executive had stepped down owing to health concerns after only seven months in the job. A replacement was appointed swiftly.Among technology shares, Intel eased 3 per cent to $23.37 after the stock received a downgrade to ""underperform"" from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston. Its rival LSI Logic fell 2.1 per cent to $5.60.Shares in Computer Network Technology surged 17.3 per cent to $5.63 on an upgrade by Bear Stearns analysts to ""peer perform"" from ""underperform"".In the same sector, and also among Dow stocks, Hewlett-Packard shares eased 0.2 per cent to $20.16 after the computer company told US regulators it was expecting to incur $200m from job cuts in the first half of next year.The higher price of crude oil buoyed ExxonMobil by 0.6 per cent to $51.21 but hit stocks such as Delta Air Lines, which fell 0.9 per cent to $6.55.Boeing shares were up 0.7 per cent to $54.33 despite reports that the aerospace company faces competition for its planned ""Dreamliner"" commercial jet from Airbus, its European rival.Meanwhile, shares in Time-Warner rose 2.8 per cent to $17.94 amid reports that the media conglomerate was close to settling charges of accounting irregularities at its internet division for $750m.TiVo, the maker of digital-recording technology for cable companies and consumers, saw its shares lose 11.6 per cent to $5.20 after it warned of a wider loss than previously expected in the fourth quarter.Among retailers, Mothers Work reported a quarterly loss for its fourth quarter, saying that oversupply of the maternity clothing it makes had led to depressed profit margins. Its shares fell 21.2 per cent to $13.85.HJ Heinz, the food company best known for its tomato ketchup, saw its shares give up 1.6 per cent to $37.78 after it reported rising net profits but missed analysts' estimates.Deere & Co, the tractor maker, reported results that exceeded analyst estimates thanks to strong sales, sending its shares 2.2 per cent up to $70.21 by mid-afternoon.Also reporting results, but to less upbeat reception, Dycom Industries had a 14 per cent tumble to $29.80 after it warned of declining revenue in its next quarter.In merger-and-acquisition news, Penn Virginia shares rose 3 per cent to $48.01 after the company announced it would buy a natural gas company from Cantera Resources.US Steel was down 2.1 per cent to $47.97 after a UBS report said monthly short interest in US steel stocks was near four-year highs."

If the contract is endorsed by November 11, it will come into effect in December, reducing pilot salaries by a third.Delta’s pilots have also agreed to freeze their defined benefit pension plans and replace them with defined contribution plans, which could set a significant precedent for American and Northwest, which also have heavily underfunded pension plans.The announcements mark the culmination of a strategy to achieve an out of court restructuring and avoid filing for bankruptcy for the first time in its 75-year history.Gerald Grinstein, chief executive, told employees: “Time is of the essence, but given the additional sacrifices that undoubtedly will be required if we file for bankruptcy, I believe it remains in our collective best interest to restructure on our own.”“Delta lives to fight another day,” said Mark Streeter, analyst at JP Morgan. “But they are throwing the dice into 2005 and hoping that yields will improve and fuel prices fall. If they don’t, they could face a liquidity crunch in the fourth quarter a year from now.”Last week Delta said American Express had agreed to provide up to $600m in financing by bringing forward payments on frequent flier miles. Delta is also close to a deal to secure additional financing, of $500m-$800m from other lenders, led by General Electric. This includes about $100m from the existing Amex agreement, according to people familiar with the discussions.Delta has also been seeking to restructure its $20.6bn debt burden. It had faced about $1.2bn in debt maturities next year, posing an impossible burden given its current cash balance, which has fallen to $1.45bn. Delta last week said it had deferred $135m of this debt, but it could also shortly announce that it has succeeded in deferring $238m in short-term maturities as part of its exchange offer. The airline is also understood to be close to an agreement to defer payments of $176m related to its D tranche EETCs, a form aircraft backed debt.Nevertheless, risks remain for Delta. To avoid bankruptcy, it is taking on significant amounts of new debt and still faces up to $650m in debt maturities in 2005. It is also using all its remaining collateral to secure these debt deals, leaving it with little flexibility if it faces cash problems next year. And, it must still pay down the underfunded portion of its defined benefit pension plans as well as funding its new defined contribution plans.
718;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-26T17:05:29Z;Wall St climbs as insurance stocks get boost;;Insurers staged a rally that led Wall Street higher on Tuesday morning amid relief about a wide-reaching probe by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,853.58 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 1 per cent at 1,105.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 1,920.08.The shares of Marsh & McLennan gained 8.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company’s chief executive resigned and Mr Spitzer said he would not pursue criminal charges against the company as part of his wide-reaching probe into the practices of the insurance industry.The ripples of the news gave a lift to the other so-called Spitzer stocks of insurance groups targeted by or involved in the investigation. Shares in American International Group rose 6.4 per cent to $59.73 while ACE gained 6.6 per cent to $37.09. MetLife was 3.4 per cent higher at $36.24 as Aetna put on 4.7 per cent to $88.80.Rob Arancio, trader at Lehman Brothers, said: “A lot of the market action had to do with the relief rally in insurance stocks and decreased concerns about lawsuits there.”Mr Arancio added that there was evidence of a “healthy rotation” of capital into stocks “that have been decimated” recently, such as airlines and homebuilders.The American Stock Exchange Airline index added 3.9 per cent, powered by a 23 per cent rise to $4.65 in Delta Air Lines after JP Morgan upgraded the stock. Also higher were Alaska Air, up 2.7 per cent at $26.31, and Northwest, up 2.8 per cent at $8.50.Among homebuilders’ stocks, Pulte Homes added 5.6 per cent to $54.40 as Lennar put on 2.7 per cent to $44.97 and Centex gained 3.4 per cent to $50.39.On the opposite end of the rotation mentioned by Mr Arancio were technology stocks, which saw selling.Silicon Laboratories saw shares tumble 18.6 per cent to $$28.05 after warning its fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations, reinforcing bearish views of the semiconductor sector. Hewlett-Packard, down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 and Intel, off fractionally at $21.30 were among the few declining Dow stocks.Bucking the downward trend in technology, Nvidia rose 12.7 per cent to $15.03 after the graphics chip designer reported strong quarterly results.The relief rally in insurers and other sectors helped offset a disappointing reading of the consumer confidence index for this month, which declined more than economists had expected. The Conference Board, the business research group which released the data, said the index was 92.8, its lowest level in seven months.Economists noted the worsening in consumer expectations component of the index and attributed to rising energy costs. While Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics predicted further declines in confidence because of energy costs, Stephen Gallagher at SG Investment Banking deemed that as a “known risk” and dwelled on evidence of increased consumer spending and improving labour markets, “which are key …in the performance of financial markets”.Meanwhile the crude oil price, which had weighed on stocks, retreated after the Norwegian government acted to avoid a strike that could have disrupted production at a time when the markets are jittery about supply-demand imbalances ahead winter.As the third-quarter earnings season continued, Sara Lee, the consumer goods group, saw shares add 2.1 per cent to $22.91 after it reported higher quarterly earnings that investors appeared to dismiss owing to the effect of a fee from an asset sale. Commodity prices and other factors would have caused the company’s earnings to be flat if the fee had been excluded.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin shares were up 1.1 per cent to $54.10 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, raised its 2004 full-year estimate but guided analysts below their forecasts for next year.Halliburton, the oil services group, reported a quarterly loss owing to charges it took to provide for asbestos-related liabilities. Shares were 2.7 per cent higher at $35.28.DuPont shares edged off 2.1 per cent to $41.29 in morning trading after the chemical company swung to profitability for the quarter thanks to growing demand that offset the effects of rising energy prices.
719;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-19T20:33:23Z;S&P warns ATA may be forced into Chapter 11;;The corporate credit rating of ATA, one of the US airlines facing serious liquidity problems, was downgraded on Tuesday by Standard & Poors to CCC-, only a couple of notches above default.S&P said the downgrade reflected the airline's weakening liquidity with an increasing likelihood that it would be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection “in the near future.”Two of the leading US carriers, United Airlines and US Airways, are already in Chapter 11, and Delta Air Lines, which will report a third quarter net loss of more than $625m on Wednesday, is also teetering on the edge of collapse.ATA is the tenth largest US carrier, the leading operator at Chicago Midway and Indianapolis airports and the largest US charter carrier. It has warned since August of a mounting liquidity crisis.S&P said that ATA's cash position, which had been deteriorating for the last several quarters, was expected to have declined further from the $150m reported at the end of June.The US airline industry has continued to be hit by weak revenues and soaring fuel costs with losses for many carriers during the summer months, normally the most profitable quarter for aviation.ATA has previously warned that it did not expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations in the first quarter of 2005, but S&P warned that the continuing losses could have brought the crunch forward to the current quarter.Recent speculation has suggested that ATA could be a candidate for takeover, possibly by America West, due to the attractiveness of some its assets, most importantly its Chicago-Midway hub, but S&P said such a move would not necessarily happen outside of a Chapter 11 filing.ATA has a heavy operating lease burden due to the acquisition of new aircraft in recent years. It is understood to face imminent payments to Boeing.S&P said that ATA relied primarily on internally generated cash to meet liquidity requirements.It had no credit facilities other than its state-guaranteed Air Transportation Stabilisation Board (ATSB) loan, which was fully drawn, and a large part of its assets were already encumbered.The airline was likely to breach a covenant in the ATSB loan, when its third quarter financial results statement was completed, said the credit rating agency. The airline said yesterday that no date had yet been set for releasing the results.
720;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-18T17:36:58Z;Stricken airlines seek shelter;;"In the next few weeks, the US airline industry may face a situation unprecedented in the years since it was deregulated in 1978. If Delta Airlines files for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it would mean that almost half the industry would be operating in bankruptcy.Bankruptcy courts have emerged as the most critical forum to decide the fate of big airlines - such as United and US Airways - offering a last ditch mechanism for making the cost reductions needed to survive the bleak revenue environment, soaring fuel costs and the threat from low-cost rivals.“The reality is that every major US airline is in bankruptcy now, whether they know it or not,” says David Siegel. He should know. As the former chief executive of US Airways, he led the airline into bankruptcy for the first time in 2003. “Delta will file - whether soon or a year or two from now,” he says. “American Airlines should have filed two years ago and will have to file within a year or two because of their debt burden and unfunded pension liabilities.”That gloomy prognosis reflects the scale of the escalating financial crisis. Since 2001, the big US airlines have racked up losses of more than $27bn. Meanwhile, debt levels have soared to more than $125bn. The seven largest carriers face debt maturities of $5.7bn in 2005 and $4.8bn in 2006, according to Fitch, the credit ratings agency.Even as airlines circle the courts, the record of emerging from bankruptcy is not illustrious. Of the seven US airlines that filed for chapter 11 in the early 1990s, only two - Continental and America West - re-emerged. Continental did so only after a second trip to the courts. As one analyst puts it: “Is this a health spa or a roach motel?”So it is worth asking what are the advantages and disadvantages of chapter 11 and what are the implications for the sector of having so many airlines in bankruptcy?Chapter 11 is a legal umbrella in the US that allows a company to reorganise. Management retains control and has the right to produce a plan to keep the company operating.“It allows secured creditors to pull the assets, and unsecured creditors to get in line and have a neutral arbiter listen to the plans to run the airline going forward to produce positive cash flow. And if not - it goes into liquidation,” explains Michael E. Levine, professor at the Yale law school and a former airline executive. “In other countries, bankruptcy means immediate liquidation, which is inefficient if it could be a going concern.”There is, however, something akin to this in the UK, where a company facing insolvency can petition a court to make an administration order to save the whole or any part of the company as a going concern.In the US, the first advantage of bankruptcy relates to labour contracts. Companies can ask the judge to impose interim wage relief and can invoke sections 1113 and 1114 (see below), which allow them to reject old collective bargaining agreements and rip up old retiree benefits respectively. On Friday, US Airways successfully imposed a 21 per cent pay cut on its employees through section 1113 while United warned that it may also impose wage cuts.For big airlines, age-old and highly uncompetitive labour contracts, which include work rules established over several decades, present a significant barrier to reform. In 2003, salaries at Delta averaged $68,698, whereas at low-cost carriers they averaged just $40,972.While it is possible to squeeze concessions outside bankruptcy, union politics often stymie deals. US Airways, for example, tried to persuade its pilots to accept further cuts, but a faction of hardliners refused to send the proposals to members for a vote, a move that helped trigger the airline's second bankruptcy in September.The threat of having interim contracts imposed in bankruptcy can give union leaders political cover to sell cuts to their members. “Sometimes chapter 11 is the only way an airline can get unions to come to grips with the economic realities,” says Dan Kasper, managing director of LEGC, a consulting company. “Unions are political organisations and signing concessionary agreements is not a ticket to get re-elected.” Companies can also use chapter 11 to terminate defined benefit pension plans. Given that the industry's total pension black hole amounts to $22bn, this is a big temptation. United says it plans to do so and US Airways has already.Bankruptcy also enables companies to dump unwanted assets and restructure debt. Airlines used to be able to restructure some debt outside bankruptcy as they relied on a handful of large banks for aircraft financing, making it easy to organise talks. But since the emergence of the newer, more sophisticated debt instruments of the past decade, no airline has succeeded in renegotiating big chunks of debt outside bankruptcy. Delta, faced with more than $20bn in debt, has been trying to do this but has not yet succeeded.Bankruptcy also carries disadvantages. Equity investors are typically wiped out; managers lose their ability to manage the company, as every significant decision has to be rubber stamped by the bankruptcy judge and debated in the court; and it imposes huge legal and consulting fees on companies - estimated at about $100m a year for United Airlines.Moreover, passengers, fearing the company could go out of business, may be scared off. So, too, managers: US Airways told the bankruptcy judge last week that monthly turnover of non-unionised employees was 20 per cent.As well as these drawbacks, there is the question of whether or not bankruptcy actually works. It cannot compensate for a flawed business plan. “TWA worked for a while, but floundered and never emerged again,” says Mr Levine. “PanAm had a whole series of bad strategies and never found a good one, while US Airways has not come up with a good story about why they should not liquidate,” says Mr Levine.Without deeper concessions, US Airways could liquidate by February. United Airlines, which filed in November 2002, saying it would be out within 18 months, has no clear plan or deadline for emergence from chapter 11.While bankruptcy does not necessarily save individual airlines, it can damage their well-run rivals, according to Bob Crandall, a former chief executive of American Airlines. US bankruptcy laws have enabled failed companies “to gain cost advantages versus more successful ventures [and to] function as a fail safe for imprudent managements and unions”.That argument is spiced with self-interest. “Crandall was hostile because he had cash reserves and he wanted to get the bozos off the stage to make lots of money,” says Mr Levine.Even amending the bankruptcy laws to ensure US Airways is forced into liquidation would not save the big airlines from the low-cost carriers, says Mr Kasper. “Getting rid of one high-cost airline by changing the bankruptcy law would not change their underlying economic problem. It's a palliative - like taking two aspirins to cure cancer.”Indeed, this month, the Business Travel Coalition warned that the percentage of companies operating in bankruptcy could rise to 70 per cent by mid-2005: “While financial reorganisation during a bankruptcy process can be helpful in reducing debt by 25 to 30 per cent, shedding pension liabilities and enabling more productive labour contracts, it is no panacea, especially with oil prices above $50 a barrel.”THE PROS AND CONS OF BANKRUPTCYTHE PROSCompanies:● are given the breathing space to reorganise.● can tear up labour contracts by invoking sections 1113 and 1114 of the bankruptcy code. Section 1113 sets out the conditions under which a company can terminate collective bargaining agreements, after going through a nine-part test. These include having an open court hearing. It must also show it engaged in good faith bargaining with its unions to try and negotiate a deal rather than use the courts to impose one.Section 1114 allows modifications of termination of certain retiree benefits if they are deemed necessary for reorganisation.● can terminate defined benefit pension schemes.● can shed unwanted assets and restructure their debt.THE CONS● Equity shareholders are wiped out.● Managers lose their power to manage the company as every decision has to be approved by a bankruptcy judge.● It requires the payment of substantial legal and consulting fees.● Potential passengers may be scared off booking flights."
721;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-15T17:55:33Z;Delta expects quarterly loss to quadruple;;Delta Air Lines, the third-largest US carrier which is fighting to stave off bankruptcy, warned on Friday that its financial performance was continuing to deteriorate.In a preliminary filing ahead of the release of its results next week, Delta said that its net loss for the third quarter was expected to quadruple from $164m to between $625m and $675m.It again warned that it might have to seek bankruptcy protection unless it could restructure its debt burden.The airline said its unrestricted cash balance had declined from $2bn at the end of June to only $1.45bn by the end of September.Delta said: “There is substantial uncertainty as to whether we will be able to obtain the necessary financing or deferrals on acceptable terms or at all.“If we are unable to …meet our liquidity needs, we would need to seek to restructure under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.”Two weeks ago Delta said it would cut pay by 10 per cent for most employees and executives, while its chief executive would decline his salary for the rest of the year.The move was part of its transformation plan set out last month, under which it is seeking to cut $5bn out of its annual operating costs. The latest wage cuts, combined with its plans to cut up to 7,000 jobs and withdraw from its Dallas hub, should help deliver $1bn in cost savings.Delta blamed the latest worsening in its fortunes on “historically high fuel prices” and a “significant decline” year-on-year in its yields, or average fare levels, in the domestic US market.The heavy impact of rising oil prices on the aviation industry was underlined by American Airlines, the biggest US carrier, which said yesterday it was increasing its fuel surcharges on all its international fares. American said the surge in the crude oil price this year, which has risen above $50 a barrel in recent days, would add an estimated $1.2bn to its full-year costs in 2004.American is raising the surcharges on its transatlantic fares from $8 to $25 each way and on its trans-Pacific fares from $5 to $25.Last week several European airlines increased fares for the third time this year. Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic raised the surcharges on long-haul flights booked in the UK by two-thirds, from £6 ($11) to £10 per flight leg. Air France raised its fuel surcharge on long-haul flights by €11 ($14) to €26 per flight leg or €52 per return trip..
722;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-14T18:34:20Z;Delta pushes back deadline for debt move;;Delta Air Lines, after a tepid response from its creditors, on Thursday extended the deadline for a debt exchange relating to $2.6bn of debt until November 18.Delta said it had received tenders of $24.2m in short-term securities, $18.1m in intermediate-term securities and $49.9m in long-term securities - about 3.5 per cent of the total. It encouraged its holders to contact them by October 26 and to “tender early so that we can have a better sense of the success rate of the [new] exchange offer earlier in the process”.The move underlines concerns about Delta’s ability to restructure its $2.6bn debt burden outside bankruptcy. No other large airline, including American Airlines and United Airlines, has yet succeeded in doing so. Delta, however, cannot ignore its debt: it has the highest net-debt-to-revenues ratio of the industry.The difficulties are a reflection of the increased complexity of airline debt instruments and the number of creditors involved.Dan Kasper, managing director at LEGC, an airline consultancy, said: “You have got a huge group of creditors with different tiers, and conflicting interests, with some well secured and others not. It is hard to get aircraft lenders to renegotiate outside of bankruptcy.”Gerry Grinstein, chief executive of Delta, has been trying to mimic American’s success in using the threat of bankruptcy to secure concessions. That tactic seems to be working with the Air Line Pilots Association, its only union.The two sides remain in talks over cutting at least $1bn in annual costs. Most analysts expect a deal: pilots lose most in bankruptcy filing and could face the prospect of pension plan terminations. Delta said its exchange offer was subject to a new contract with its pilots.However, even with concessions, Delta could still file for bankruptcy. It faces debt maturities in 2005 of $1.2bn and $799m in 2006. It had underfunded pension plans of $5.7bn at the end of December 2003, which will require big cash contributions to make up the gap.Even before fuel prices started to soar, Delta was expecting to make big losses and had warned that its unrestricted cash levels would soon fall below $1.4bn. Fuel costs will have eroded that cash position further.This week, Jim Higgins, analyst at CSFB, significantly widened his estimates for the third quarter from a loss of $2.65 per share to losses of $3.90, and for the fourth quarter from a loss of $3.55 to a loss of $5.Those losses raise concerns that Delta will need to cut deeper than its current pilot plans and that it will not get sufficient savings. Also, it will use up its diminishing collateral to finalise the current debt deal - by offering unencumbered aircraft, flight simulators and flight training equipment - leaving it with few assets to help secure a future debtor-in-possession financing if needed.One private equity executive said that Delta should exploit the benefits of a bankruptcy filing to get rid of aircraft and restructure more of its hubs beyond its current plans to pull out of Dallas Fort Worth. “It makes sense for them to downsize and get rid of aircraft, but Gerry is doing anything he can to try and avoid it. He has not thrown in the towel yet.”

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, the Nasdaq dropped 1.2 per cent, and the Dow industrials declined 1.5 per cent - giving back some of the previous week's strong rally.US stocks sold off on Friday afternoon as oil prices climbed on reports that Nigeria's supply might be constrained as labor-dispute talks broke down. Crude futures climbed 1.3 per cent to $53.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Meanwhile, the non-farm payrolls report for September provided further reason for market participants to fret about the economy. US non-farm payrolls grew by 96,000 in September, below the 150,000 expected, while August payroll numbers were revised down by 16,000 to 128,000. The jobs report, the last to be revealed before the presidential election next month, may further exacerbate the fortunes on President George W Bush's re-election bid - giving Wall Street even further reason to mull over the weak employment numbers.""These numbers are exactly in line with what our leading indicators have been showing - there is no acceleration in the economy,"" said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute.The slow jobs growth combined with rising commodities is causing some alarm these days on Wall Street. ""Can you spell stagflation?"" said Jes Black, hedge fund manager at Black Flag Capital. ""We're stimulating the heck out of the economy, and all it did was generate massive inflation - and it's not just oil.""Others took a more sanguine view of the economy and the markets. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said the job figures were a setback. But he has been buoyed by the market's strength in the face of rising oil prices, the peak of the earnings cycle, rising interest rates and China's concerted effort to slow growth. ""We had to get these four points off the checklist in the past few months, and odds are things will be better going forward.""Merck continued to suffer from last week's Vioxx recall, with the Dow 30 component falling 2 per cent to $30.35 on Friday, down roughly 9 per cent for the week. Rival Pfizer shed 0.6 per cent on Friday to $29.80, off 4 per cent for the week to $30.66 on concerns that its rival arthritis drug may face similar problems as Vioxx.Johnson & Johnson eased 1 per cent yesterday to $55.32, down 3 per cent for the week. The health care company reports earnings next week, as do Yahoo, Intel and a host of other companies - third-quarter earnings should take centre stage in the coming days.General Electric,meanwhile, shed 0.6 per cent yesterday to $33.74 after the nation's largest company posted an 11 per cent rise in earnings.Semiconductor stocks took a hit yesterday after a Prudential Securities analyst issued a cautionary note on chip-equipment companies.The group had been among the best performers so far this quarter. Applied Materials declined 5.5 per cent to $16.21. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 3.6 per cent.Elsewhere, Krispy Kreme skidded another 4.3 per cent to $12.51 after the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into its books had become a formal probe. The shares eased 5.1 per cent for the week.Shares of Fannie Mae,the mortgage-finance company facing regulatory scrutiny, managed to rally this week amid chief executive Frank Raines' defence of the company's accounting practices before Congress. The stock was flat on Friday at $69.05, up 5 per cent for the week. Another winner was Sirius Satellite Radio,which announced a $500m deal to have Howard Stern join its air waves. The stock eased 7.5 per cent to $3.70 on Friday, gaining 17 per cent for the week."
725;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-10-01T20:51:40Z;Wall St finishes on high after lacklustre quarter;;"If this week's action on Wall Street had been a football match, it would have been decided in overtime after a tedious game filled with more agony than ecstasy.Indices managed to finish the week higher, but that did not become apparent until Friday, when the onset of the fourth quarter and an eagerly awaited easing of crude oil prices brought buyers in from the sidelines.By Friday’s close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 1.1 per cent to 10,193.40 to be up 1.5 per cent for the week. The S&P500 index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,131.24, tacking on 1.9 per cent for the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.4 per cent to 1,942.04 - a two-month high - for a weekly gain of 3.3 per cent.Broadly based buying emerged after markets concluded a paltry quarter in which the Dow lost 3.4 per cent, the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 per cent and the Nasdaq gave up 7.4 per cent.Bulls began the week with battered hopes as a renewed rise in oil prices sent the Dow to its first close below 10,000 in almost six weeks. That sounded the death knell to yet another attempted rally and prompted some market watchers to say that investors of all convictions had become too frustrated and exhausted with the markets to care.However, hope springs eternal on Wall Street and a reason to sell one day becomes a reason to buy the next. Thus, by Tuesday energy and mining stocks led the market higher amid calculations that rising energy and metals prices were a sign of high demand and could help companies in those sectors achieve higher profits.Alcoa rose 4.3 per cent on Tuesday and copper mining group Phelps-Dodge rose 4.8 per cent for the session. Meanwhile energy stocks staged a 1.6 per cent rise paced by a 3 per cent advance in Unocal and a 3.6 per cent rise in Amerada Hess.In another reflection that any news can be good news on Wall Street, Thursday's announcement from Merck that it would withdraw from global markets a blockbuster drug was encouraging because damage was limited to Merck stock, which fell 26.8 per cent, sending the sector sub-index of the S&P 500 3.5 per cent lower.However, shares in Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, rose 1.4 per cent in the same session and market activity was described as ""orderly"" outside trading in Merck.Nevertheless, comments about listless markets and a lack of conviction continued throughout the week, market observers attributing the apathy to everything from oil prices to Thursday's presidential debate that had been expected to clarify the positions of the two contenders for the White House in next month's election.In addition, the end of the quarter caused talk of last-minute window-dressing by investment managers trying to improve the structure of their portfolios by shedding laggard stocks and buying outperformers.Throughout the week, the market proved to be one of stocks rather than sectors and broader trends.Orbitz shares on Wednesday surged 31 per cent amid reports Cendant was near a takeover of the fast-growing internet travel site. On the same day Biomira shares rose 35 per cent after federal regulators decided to give fast-track status to the company's application for selling a lung cancer treatment.Airline stocks were again battered by the crude oil spike amid growing concerns about their future with the slow winter months ahead. On Monday Delta Air Lines shares lost 9.5 per cent and Continental lost 5.5 per cent as part of a broad decline in the sector that session. In addition to high fuel costs, the carriers battle languid demand and several of them are under bankruptcy protection.Individual stock action pointed to the downside as well, with Fannie Mae shares losing 4.3 per cent on Thursday after reports that the US justice department had opened an investigation into potential accounting fraud at the government-sponsored housing lender.On a similar note, Tommy Hilfiger shares tumbled 22.9 per cent in the Monday session after the fashion group said it was the subject of a federal inquiry into the commissions it paid a subsidiary."

In the broader market, the S&P 500 index eased 0.6 per cent to 1,103.39 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.1 per cent to 1,859.75Crude oil rose amid concerns about supply disruptions and a renewed fall in US inventories as traders awaited official data.Bob Doll, president and chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, said: ""We believe that a further decline in the price of oil would be needed …to see a sustained equity market rally.""In addition to oil-related jitters, traders said that Thursday's debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, his challenger in the race to the White House, was seen as crucial in deciding the outcome of the November polls. Some predict that a Bush re-election will help stocks rally in the fourth quarter.As the rally that started in early August appears to have fizzled out, some market participants will have to revisit hopes of a run-up in the last quarter of the year. While bulls say stocks have ignored upbeat earnings throughout the year and will have to respond at some stage, bears worry that by the time that happens earnings news will no longer be particularly good.Standard & Poor's confirmed concerns about profit growth in corporate America just as those worries had been revived by the renewed rise in crude futures. Companies in the S&P 500 index achieved operating earnings growth of 13.9 per cent in the third quarter compared with last year, according to S&P. However, the index provider said profit margins were flat or slightly improved even as sales increased.This underscored the lack of pricing power for US corporations unable to pass on cost increases to customers. Meanwhile, energy prices are reaching record highs and consumer companies such as Colgate-Palmolive have warned of increased competitive pressures.Airline stocks saw widespread selling on worries that high fuel costs will further damage an industry in which some leading players are under bankruptcy protection and fuel prices are jeopardising attempts to control costs.Delta Air Lines shares lost 9.5 per cent to $2.95 while Continental Airlines gave up 5.5 per cent to $8.29. JetBlue, one of the few stock market darlings in the sector, lost 6 per cent to $20.56. The Amex sector index was 3.9 per cent lower.Insurance shares saw losses as Florida assessed the effects of a record fourth hurricane this season, with some estimates saying Hurricane Jeanne inflicted between $4bn and $8bn in damages, while Charley, Frances and Ivan had combined for about $18bn in damages. St Paul Travelers saw shares lose 46 per cent to $32.75 days after after it said earnings would be affected by hurricanes. Allstate shares lost 1.6 per cent to $47.56.Among other stocks in the news, shares in Tommy Hilfiger tumbled 22.9 per cent to $10.16 after the fashion group said it was the subject of a federal inquiry into commissions paid to one of its non-US subsidiaries since 1990.In merger and acquisition news, Cemex shares lost 7.5 per cent to $27.94 after the third-biggest cement group in the world, based in Mexico, announced the purchase of RMC, a UK-based maker of ready-mix concrete. Urban Larson, head of Latin America investments at ING Barings, said: ""This is a very big acquisition in a segment and in markets that are much less attractive than Cemex's current business. This will increase indebtedness significantly."""

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 1,888.56.Caution appeared to be the prevailing mood in the wake of the worst rout for US stocks since early August on Wednesday, which took market watchers by surprise. Crude futures spiked on Wednesday and were moderately higher on Thursday afternoon, resurrecting fears about a potential squeeze on corporate profits and consumer budgets.News that the Bush administration was looking to approve the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to quell prices was ignored because traders saw the quantity of oil to be used as insufficient.Chris Wolfe, market strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said he saw numerous indications that fundamentals-driven investors saw the market as fairly valued and were opting to stay on the sidelines, leading to low trading volumes. Whatever trading has taken place recently has mostly been by hedge funds seeking volatility, he said.On the economic front, an index of leading economic indicators fell for the third consecutive month, according to the Conference Board, the business research firm compiling the indicator. The data, which gauge future economic activity in the US, dented optimistic expectations that the summer ""soft patch"" of slow growth has passed.In addition, the US government said claims for unemployment benefits rose last week amid the effects of hurricanes in the southern US. The less-volatile four-week moving average of the indicator also rose, underscoring fears of continued weakness in the labour market following strong job creation earlier in the year.The news came a day after the quarterly results of Morgan Stanley shook investor confidence in the outlook for the financial services sector and equity markets.In addition, the results and pre-announcements of companies in other sectors have cast a pall over bullish hopes of a fourth-quarter rally.While optimists continue to say investors have ignored positive earnings all year and a rally might still occur, they admit those hopes could be undermined by more immediate - and less pleasant - realities.Airline stocks, which suffer from the high oil price, were broadly lower following a report from the Air Transport Association saying industry performance last month was far worse than initially expected, while the decline in traffic from July to August was the worst in 20 years. The news bodes ill for the winter months, traditionally slow for the sector.Delta Air Lines lost 3.5 per cent to $3.57 while American's parent AMR saw its shares lose 7.7 per cent to $8.07. The sector index was 2.8 per cent lower.In other corporate news, Rite Aid shares lost 4.5 per cent to $3.59 even after the pharmacy chain said it swung to profit and beat analyst expectations.Also reporting results was AG Edwards,whose shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $34.57 after the regional broker missed estimates, citing the languid pace of stock markets as a reason.In the retail sector, Bed Bath&Beyond said sales for the quarter reached $1.27bn, slightly below the medium analyst estimates. Its shares lost 5 per cent to $37.61 .In technology, PalmSource shares lost 5 per cent to $24.85 ahead of its quarterly earnings release, which is expected to say that the handheld computer software company lost 2 cents per share in the previous quarter. Its results come two days after shares in PalmOne saw broad selling on a weak profit outlook from the handheld computer maker.Also among software stocks, PeopleSoft shares were muted after Craig Conway, its chief executive, said earnings would be hit by efforts to escape a hostile bid from Oracle. PeopleSoft also said its sales have exceeded its rival's this quarter. Shares were off 0.4 per cent to $19.25.Exxon Mobil,the world's biggest public oil company, dropped 0.5 per cent to $47.78 after Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"", and moved the weighting of the oil sector to ""neutral"" from ""overweight""."
728;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-09-20T18:57:54Z;Lex: Airline regulation;;It is easier to fly when the skies are clear. But, for executives running the world's airlines, the view is clouded by arcane regulation. Northwest's and Delta's imminent application for antitrust immunity on international routes may clear some of the fog over transatlantic consolidation. If approved, it would allow the airlines to co-ordinate operations more closely with their transatlantic partners, KLM and Air France.This move was always part of the Air France/KLM merger plan, a step-by-step process initiated last year. Antitrust immunity essentially a green light to collude is offered by the US to countries with open skies agreements, such as France and the Netherlands. But Air France and KLM continue to compete on the important North Atlantic route. Extending immunity would allow integration of sales and marketing activities. It may yet lead to a full North Atlantic joint venture with Air France/KLM, Northwest, Delta and possibly the more loosely tied Continental Airlines.None of this will be enough to tackle the airlines' problems: high cost bases and inefficient working practices. Air France/KLM is only shedding a fraction of total costs. Still, a more effective Air France/KLM will put pressure on rivals without US deals, such as British Airways. With the European Union and the US stalling on full open skies, small steps are the only way to improve travel between the two continents.

The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.4 per cent to 1,904.08.While benign to favourable economic data offered the background to a possible rally, market participants have warned that the observance of the Jewish New Year on Thursday and Friday will take many Wall Street workers away from their desks and lead to lower volumes.This coincides with quadruple witching, or the simultaneous expiry of futures and options on equities and indices, a quarterly event that tends to accentuate volatility in the market.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We have a big expiration, high oil and a Jewish holiday that are all going to put a dent in activity, we're going to have to plod through the day.""Like many other market watchers, he noted a slower than expected resumption in market activity following the summer months, blaming it on uncertainty about the US presidential election and an unclear picture of the economy.Nortel Networks shares fell 7.9 per cent to $3.50 after the largest telecommunications equipment group in North America warned that third-quarter revenue would shrink from the previous quarter and its full-year results would underperform the industry.The news came amid concern about the strength of spending on technology and telecommunications equipment in particular and broader worries over business investment in the US.Mr Hogan suggested that pessimism about IT spending was overblown and noted that corporate America ""has boatloads of cash on balance sheets …they're going to simply have to upgrade obsolete IT equipment"".3Com shares closed flat at $4.32 ahead of the networking company's quarterly results, due out after the close.Delta Air Lines fell 2.2 per cent to $4.01 on news that the carrier's auditors had expressed doubt about its ability to continue operations for a variety of reasons, including the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing. The news prompted a credit rating downgrade for Delta's debt by Fitch.The airline sector index, which has declined recently after US Airways filed for its second bankruptcy in two years, was 1 per cent higher.The ripples of US Airways' filing were seen outside the sector as Electronic Data Systems said the carrier's bankruptcy could undermine its earnings. Recent reports also said that EDS could suffer from General Motors opening bidding for IT work currently done by EDS. Shares in the IT services provider were up, however, by 1.1 per cent at $20.10.Qualcomm was 0.4 per cent lower at $40.40 on news that Credit Suisse First Boston had downgraded the stock in a broader analysis of the wireless sector.Economic data offered some support to the bulls, as weekly jobless claims rose less than expected, according to the labour department, which said the report was unaffected by the hurricanes Charley and Frances hitting the south-east of the US. In addition, the consumer price index reflected the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy as it rose 0.1 per cent last month amid the tumble in fuel prices. The core index that strips out volatile food and energy prices was also 0.1 per cent higher, in line with expectations.High fuel costs prompted Swift Transportation to warn of lower than expected profits, sparking a downgrade by Bear Stearns. The trucking company's shares lost 10.9 per cent to $16.28.JB Hunt shares eased 1.7 per cent to $36.46 and Yellow Roadway edged up 0.9 per cent to $45.16."
730;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-09-15T23:41:36Z;Delta fuels fears of bankruptcy;;Delta on Wednesday fuelled concerns that it could soon join US Airways in bankruptcy when it said it was amending its annual report to include details of its deteriorating financial position and warned that its auditors had raised doubts about its ability to continue as a “going concern”.The doubts from Deloitte and Touche which cited Delta's losses and looming liquidity problems could cause practical problems if any of Delta's credit facilities contain covenants that cite the “going concern” clause.Delta which is the third largest US airline last week set out its proposed restructuring plan, which will include up to 7,000 job losses over the next 18 months.Delta has said that it needs to find a quick solution to its pilot retirement problem within the next few weeks, amid fears that if too many retire early it will face serious operational problems as well as a drain on cash.The carrier has set a deadline of the end of the month to secure a new contract with its pilots, which would reduce its annual costs by $1bn.Gerald Grinstein, chief executive, retreated on Wednesday from upbeat remarks that he made earlier in the week about a quick resolution to the retirement issue. Executives have also been meeting bankruptcy lawyers and its in-house legal team is understood to be working full-time on preparing for a bankruptcy filing.Delta also set out further details of its efforts to restructure its $20.2bn in debt.The airline said it had launched an exchange offer to holders of $2.6bn of unsecured debt and enhanced pass-through certificates. It was offering up to $680m of three series of newly issued senior secured notes to the holders, and said the offer would end on October 14th.“The new notes will be secured by a pool of collateral consisting of certain unencumbered aircraft, flight simulators and flight training equipment with an aggregate appraised current market value of $1.3bn,” it said.Phil Baggaley, analyst at Standard & Poor's said: “It is part of Delta's attempted restructuring plan. This won't make a huge difference but would help somewhat. If the offer were fully subscribed, it could reduce their total debt by $875m.”Rich Bittenbender, analyst at Moody's, said that Delta has asked for 90 per cent acceptance for the exchange offer.However, he also noted: “They recently asked for straightforward amendment to ETCs (aircraft backed debt) and that was rejected. This is a more complicated decision for investors.”

The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,125.91 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,910.38.Some market observers have said that a far from clear picture of the US economy, combined with the imminence of the November presidential elections and stubbornly high energy prices, are keeping investors on the sidelines.On Monday, only 1.3bn shares exchanged hands at the New York Stock Exchange.This week brings a bevy of economic data on retail sales and consumer confidence, as well as consumer-price inflation and industrial production. But their impact on trading could be limited by the impression many market participants have that the recent data could be distorted by the hurricanes affecting the south-eastern US. In addition, the end of the week brings quadruple-witching, or the simultaneous expiry of options and futures for indices and stocks. The accentuated volatility normally caused by quadruple witching could be compounded by the observance of the Jewish new year on Thursday and Friday, which could keep many Wall Street employees at home. In all, the stage appeared set for more inconclusive trading, with some analysts pointing out that a decrease in oil prices or another similar event could breathe new life into a short-term rally lacking in both volume and pace.Tobias Levkovich's team at the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup wrote on Monday: ""We continue to be tactically cautious as we think earnings concerns could interrupt the widely anticipated fourth-quarter rally.""A high-profile acquisition in advertising dominated the morning's action. The shares of Grey Global added 4 per cent to $977.90 after the advertising agency agreed to be taken over by the UK's WPP for about $1.5bn in cash and shares. The transaction is aimed at putting WPP on a par with Omnicom, the global leader. The latter's shares were 0.4 per cent higher at $69.19.In other M&A news the shares of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer rose 4 per cent to $11.55 after reports that Japan's Sony raised its offer to buy the entertainment group to $5bn and was close to taking control of the company, as Time-Warner pulled out of the contest to buy MGM. Sony's NYSE-listed shares were up 1.5 per cent at $35.82. Time-Warner eased 0.4 per cent to $16.45.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks rallied once again. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 2.5 per cent, paced by a 9.4 per cent rise in Broadcom shares to $30.30. The company, which makes broadband semiconductors, said rising inventories would weigh on its sales but the market focused on its stronger products.Amid the broader chip rally National Semiconductor added 4.4 per cent to $14.86 while Advanced Micro Devices was 5.7 per cent higher at $12.90.Away from technology investors reacted vehemently to US Airways' second bankruptcy filing in as many years, sending its shares in a 30.1 per cent tailspin to $1.02. The airline failed to secure backing for its restructuring plans from unions. The damage appeared contained as the Amex airline sector index was flat, with Delta Air Lines shares gaining 8.1 per cent to $4.13 as it met bankruptcy lawyers in case it might also have to file.Shares in CKE Restaurants gave up 9.6 per cent to $11.19 after the operator of Carl's Jr and Hardee's fast-food restaurants reported a loss for the quarter due to one-time charges.Energy-related stocks saw a moderate reaction to reports that Hurricane Ivan could hit the Gulf of Mexico this week, prompting a shutdown of offshore drilling facilities there. Shell, which is evacuating non-essential staff from platforms, saw its NYSE-listed shares inch up 0.1 per cent to $51.75."
732;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-09-07T20:44:03Z;Alitalia faces fight or flight;;The bitter medicine of restructuring and deep job cuts has been swallowed at many airlines in Europe and North America in the past couple of years. The alternative has been bankruptcy or liquidation.After years of losses and aborted rescue efforts Alitalia faces the same choice, but it is still far from clear whether its workforce is willing to take the medicine before the money runs out.The airline's senior executives told the unions on Monday night that they intended to split Alitalia into two companies, one for flight operations and one for maintenance and services, and to shed 5,000 personnel, or more than one-quarter of all permanently employed staff.One of the group's small, most radical unions even called yesterday for a hunger strike as part of “very tough industrial action” in protest at the latest plan for rationalisation.“Sensible compromise before bankruptcy does not have a long successful record in Europe,” said Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan. In the US, United Airlines and US Airways concessions have come in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and yet more cuts must be made to ensure any chance of survival. Air Canada has also been restructured in a Canadian version of Chapter 11 with protection from its creditors, and is due to re-emerge leaner and fitter this month.American Airlines gained its concessions virtually at the door of the bankruptcy courts and Delta Air Lines faces the fight of its life to wring deep concessions out of its pilots, if it is to avoid Chapter 11.In Europe, the aviation industry's four long years of financial crisis gained early victims in the shape of Swissair and Belgium's Sabena in 2001. It remains to be seen whether Alitalia will go the same way.“I detect an intransigence on the union side that makes significant labour restructuring unlikely, which therefore might even threaten the first €400m ($483m) of aid,” Mr Avery said. The Italian government has offered to guarantee a €400m loan, with strict conditions applied by Brussels.Many of Alitalia's rivals in Europe have already bitten the bullet, but even these airlines are aware thatthe struggle is far from over.British Airways cut 13,000 jobs, or 23 per cent of its mainline workforce between August 2001 and March this year, but it still believes that it must take another £300m ($532m) out of employee costs by March 2006, if it is to achieve sustainable profitability and a robust business.The effort to achieve the further cuts has already run into problems with threatened strike action only narrowly averted last month. SAS Scandinavian Airlines has also shown that the unthinkable is possible in Europe as well as in the US with its pilots agreeing to wage cuts and much tougher conditions earlier this year.Globally, airlines have racked up $31bn of losses in the past three years and a fourth year of losses is on the cards. The Italian carrier and its workforce must now decide whether they want to be casualties or survivors.

The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,858.56.The continuing fall in oil prices lifted the market's mood but led the S&P 500 energy sector to one of the session's weakest performances, flat on the day. It was one of just three sectors not firmly in the black.Market participants said a cocktail of other factors helped the day's performance, including relief that the Republican National Convention finished without a terrorist attack, as well as the return of many money managers who had been on holiday in late August.James Dlugosch, editor of the Rational Investor Newsletter, noted that cash positions had been growing through the sleepy summer season.Additionally, after a week of disappointing corporate news, investors were primed to welcome any profits surprises or climbing earnings forecasts.Hovnanian Enterprises rose 9.3 per cent to $38.50 after the luxury homebuilder topped Wall Street's third quarter profits expectations and boosted its forecast for the full fiscal year.Seagate Technology, which makes computer hard drives, rose 3.8 per cent to $12.32 after forecasting quarterly sales and earnings above Wall Street estimates amid stronger demand.Fleetwood Enterprises, maker of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, added 12.4 per cent at $15 after strong sales drove it to a fiscal first quarter profit of $6.7m, double Wall Street's expectations.However, the day also brought disappointment.Shares in US Airways sank 12.8 per cent to $2.05 after leaders of the airline's pilots union snubbed the company's latest contract proposal, denting the company's efforts to avoid a second bankruptcy filing.But the rest of the airline sector received a slight boost from the sliding oil price. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3 per cent to $4.48, AMR, parent of American Airlines added 0.2 per cent at $8.92, Continental Airlines gained 1 per cent to $9.67 and Southwest Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $14.45.Insurers saw a mild relief rally as damage caused by Hurricane Frances appeared to be less than was feared. The S&P 500 group added 1.2 per cent. Allstate, the insurer and largest property casualty in Florida, rose 1.9 per cent to $47.91. Other insurers with personal lines in Florida include Chubb, up 1.6 per cent to $69.65; Hartford Financial Services Group, up 1.8 per cent to $62.34; and Safeco, up 1.3 per cent to $48.41.Netflix, the mail order video rental service, leapt 7.3 per cent to $15.41 after Newsweek reported the company had struck an agreement with TiVo, the maker of television recorders, to allow Netflix subscribers to download movies over the Internet to their TiVos. TiVo shares rose 14.9 per cent to $5.08.Tech stocks enjoyed a rebound from last week's sharp losses, triggered in part by a disappointing mid-quarter update from bellwether Intel.Cisco rose 1.6 per cent to $19.05, after it was upgraded by CIBC World Markets. The analysts cited a strong growth outlook, predicting “at least” six quarters of outperformance.But not all of Wall Street was so upbeat about techs. Texas Instruments slid 2.4 per cent to $18.71 after several Wall Street analysts made negative comments ahead of its mid-quarter update today. Rival National Semiconductor dipped 5.7 per cent to $12.42.International Game Technology added 6.1 per cent to $31.89 after a positive story in Barron's over the weekend. The financial weekly said the slot machine maker was poised to hit the jackpot thanks to new casino construction.Halliburton slid 2.2 per cent to $29.47 on reports that the US Army would move to break up its support services contract in Iraq."
734;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-09-01T19:23:03Z;Lex: United Airlines;;United is grasping the nettle. The fact that the airline appears to be planning 6,000 more jobs cuts without significant capacity reductions suggests there is fat left in the system. It has taken an extended bankruptcy, and the refusal of a federal loan guarantee application, to focus minds. United knows its restructuring has to be convincing enough to attract the new private sector funds required to get out of bankruptcy.But the plight of United employees should serve as a warning to their counterparts at US Airways and Delta which, many fear, could join United. They could end up with a worse deal in bankruptcy than might be possible if they agreed to cuts in advance. In bankruptcy, a management can resort to the courts to try to push through changes to areas such as pensions, reducing the power of unions. Bankruptcy is also expensive in fees and management time. Finally, airline revenues can be hit as fares are cut to persuade passengers to keep flying meaning that the final labour concessions have to be deeper.The attractiveness of keeping an airline out of bankruptcy, however, by no means guarantees a negotiated solution for those near the edge. For one thing, volatility in the price of fuel, which accounts for about 15 per cent of operating costs, adds to uncertainty over the adequacy of any wage deal. In bankruptcy, moreover, airlines have a better chance of spreading the pain more widely to other interested parties, such as leasing companies and bondholders.
735;DAL;Delta Air Lines Inc;2004-08-30T08:15:43Z;Bombardier faces uncertainty;;Bombardier, a Canadian transport equipment group, said it might further scale back production of its regional jets, depending on the financial health of US Airways and Delta AirLines, its two biggest customers.The two airlines, which make up 40 per cent of Bombardier's order backlog, are struggling to avoid filing for protection from their creditors under US bankruptcy law.?Only a fool would deny that there are some major challenges? in the aircraft industry, Paul Tellier, Bombardier's chief executive, said on Wednesday, as the company announced a two-thirds drop in second-quarter earnings.But Mr Tellier said difficulties in the regional jet market were balanced by growing demand for Bombardier's Learjet, Challenger and Global Express business jets, and by gradual progress in putting the company's rail equipment division on a more stable footing.Bombardier's net earnings dropped to $23m, or 1 cent a share, in the quarter ended July 31, from $68m, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose fractionally to $3.88bn, with a 5 per cent fall from the aerospace division offset by a 9 per cent gain from rolling stock.Bombardier's shares, at a 10-year low, lost 10 Canadian cents to C$3 in early trading in Toronto. Nigel Heath, an analyst at Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, said that the US Airways and Delta orders were a ?huge uncertainty?.Bombardier's unfunded pension liability, one of the biggest among Canadian companies, also remains a substantial drain on cash resources.Nevertheless, in Mr Heath's view, the potential loss of the US Airways and Delta business ?is not life-threatening? to Bombardier, because other airlines would probably take up at least some of the orders, and the company could speed up deliveries to customers in other parts of the world.?A number of actions could be taken to reduce the pain threshold,? Mr Heath said.Last month, US Airways deferred deliveries of 19 Bombardier aircraft, which were scheduled to start in the current quarter.The airline also converted orders for 23 of the 50-seat CRJ200 to the 70-seat CRJ700.Bombardier announced this year that it would cut production of the CRJ200 this summer.Pierre Beaudoin, head of Bombardier's aerospace division, said he was confident that US Airways' orders for 12 jets still scheduled for delivery this year would go ahead. The production schedule would then be reviewed.US Airways' aggressive expansion in its use of regional jets is a critical part of its new business transformation plan.Delta, the world's largest operator of regional jets, has warned that it will be forced to file for bankruptcy in the absence of a new pilots' contract and concessions from its debt holders.Mr Beaudoin said Delta had confirmed its regional jet orders, but that bankruptcy protection would raise questions about financing. Discussions are taking place with the airline, Mr Beaudoin said.In contrast to the turbulence in the regional jet market, Bombardier delivered 26 business jets in the quarter to July 31, up from 14 a year earlier.Mr Tellier said prices had started to improve and the inventory of used aircraft had dropped substantially.A group of 150 Bombardier employees is pressing ahead with a feasibility study for a 100-135 seat aircraft, which would bring the Canadian company into direct competition for the first time with Boeing and Airbus.Mr Tellier said that no decisions had yet been taken.
