The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency tweeted earlier on Friday it had “no information on the cause of yesterday’s gas over-pressurization.”The company said in a statement that 8,600 customers were affected. “We expect this will be an extended restoration effort, and we are working tirelessly to restore service to the affected customers,” it said on Friday, adding that it was working with investigators to determine the cause.Shares in Indiana-based NiSource were down 11.2 per cent on Friday afternoon at a two-month low of $24.96.
1;NI;NiSource Inc;2012-03-07T15:37:45Z;Capital markets used to top up pension funds;;Low borrowing costs have brought companies to the capital markets for a variety of reasons, including paying their pension bills.CSX, the transportation company, supermarket group Kroger, NiSource, an energy company, and Raytheon, the defence contractor, have sold corporate bonds over the last year, with at least a portion of the proceeds being used to shore up pension funds.Low interest rates are making company pension funds increasingly expensive to maintain because they erode investment returns and increase the estimated size of future benefits. However, low rates also make the cost of issuing debt cheap.“The same interest rate environment that increased liabilities provided an opportunity to issue debt to fund an accelerated pension plan contribution,” said Dave Vajda, NiSource’s vice president, chief risk officer and treasurer. The company sold $250m of bonds last year at 4.45 per cent, the lowest coupon in its portfolio, to help fund a pension contribution of $400m, more than double what it planned to contribute at the start of the year.But not all companies see it that way. Borrowing to pay into a pension “crystallises” the pension obligation as debt. Unlike an annual contribution, which many companies have deferred over the years, corporate bonds must be paid on schedule to avoid default.Some companies are hoping a rise in interest rates to more typical levels and a few years of robust equity markets will alleviate the current level of pension under-funding. A potential risk is that the pension fund suffers a large loss, as many did during the financial crisis in 2008. The company then is on the hook for the bonds, but it has lost the money it put in the pension fund.Consultants argue in favour of companies funding their pension schemes. “It actually limits your risk,” says Martin Ragde, head of the global finance structuring and advisory group at Barclays. “What happens if at the absolute worst time, perhaps during another financial crisis, a company has a large mandatory funding obligation? It is prudent to try to cut off those tail risks.”Companies, whether they borrow to contribute to their pensions or not, are also taking steps to lower their exposure to equities after the volatility in stock markets of recent years.“A lot of contributions have been invested in bonds,” said Caitlin Long, a strategy consultant to capital markets clients at Morgan Stanley. “The dollar amount of the shift [in pension fund allocations to bonds] is roughly equal to contributions in recent years. That is not a coincidence.”The funding level at US corporate pension plans stands at about 77 per cent, estimates JPMorgan, the same level as during the financial crisis. However, the dollar gap at S&P 500 companies has grown to about $380bn, from $300bn in 2008, as liabilities have continued to rise.
2;NI;NiSource Inc;2012-02-23T20:16:51Z;Low borrowing costs help pay for pensions;;US companies are taking advantage of low borrowing costs to sell debt to help pay their pension contributions.CSX, the Florida-based transportation company, on Thursday became the latest such borrower. It unveiled plans to sell corporate bonds whose proceeds will be used primarily to fund a planned $275m contribution to its pension fund, according to a regulatory filing. CSX declined to comment further.In January, Kroger, a grocery retailer based in Ohio, tapped the capital markets for $450m related to pension contributions, while Raytheon, the defence company, and NiSource, an energy company, are among those that sold similar bond deals in 2011.Very low interest rates in recent years have made it increasingly difficult for pension funds to make the returns they need to fund their obligations to retirees, but they also make it cheap to borrow in the capital markets.“Consistent with the overall market, our pension assets saw relatively weak returns in 2011, while at the same time liabilities increased as interest and discount rates declined,” said Dave Vajda, vice-president, chief risk officer and treasurer at NiSource.“As part of our overall financial strategy, we continuously monitor debt capital markets for opportunities to reduce financing costs, extend our maturity profile and manage our liabilities, including our pension,” he said.The company is paying interest at 4.45 per cent on the $250m of 10-year notes it sold last year, the lowest coupon in its long-term debt portfolio.The funding level at US corporate pension plans stands at about 77 per cent, estimates JPMorgan, the same level as during the financial crisis. However, the dollar gap at S&P 500 companies has grown to about $380bn, from $300bn in 2008, as liabilities have continued to rise.Several companies have been forced to raise cash payments to pension funds this year.“Pension deficits are bigger. Interest rates are very low and there is still great caution around equity returns,” said Martin Ragde, head of global finance structuring and advisory at Barclays. “Earning your way out of the problem in the short to intermediate term is a forecast few people are subscribing to.”Yields on US investment grade bonds fell to a record low of 3.33 per cent last week, according to a Barclays index that dates back to 1973. Yields on benchmark US Treasury bonds hover near historic lows and risk premiums, or spreads on corporate debt, have narrowed this year.

A lot more lending in future will be done on this sort of club basis whether by banks or institutional investors.”Although used by multinationals, private placements are typically favoured by mid-market groups as a means of branching away from a reliance on bank loans and allowing them to develop investor relationships, but without incurring the full costs of using the public markets.Companies including Heineken, the Dutch brewer, Whitbread, the UK hotel and restaurant group, and Millennium Pipeline, the US gas pipeline operator, have all tapped the market this year.“We’re seeing one of the biggest supply-demand imbalances we’ve seen in a long time,” said Angus Whelchel, a director in the private capital markets team at Barclays Capital. “Investors are underweight in relation to where they want to be and there’s an active push into this space from some large institutions.”Judy Gulotta managing director at MetLife, the US insurer and one of the biggest investors in the market, said: “Companies are realising they do need to diversify their funding and this is one way of achieving that.”The market has its roots in the US, but European companies, which traditionally have a stronger reliance on bank lending, are increasingly turning to private placements.

Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal. Shares in eSpeed rose 0.4 per cent to $9.23.In earnings news, Coldwater Creek reported a stronger than forecast first quarter profit and the retailer rose 16.6 per cent to $24.37.Pulte Homes said it would cut 16 per cent of its workforce, and shares fell 0.1 per cent to $27.41.Shares in Coca-Cola were up 1.6 per cent at $53.05. Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
5;NI;NiSource Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
