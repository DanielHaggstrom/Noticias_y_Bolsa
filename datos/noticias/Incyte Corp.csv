0;INCY;Incyte Corp;2018-05-30T04:00:28Z;Drugmakers struggle to find immunotherapy combinations for cancer;Discordant notes expected at this year’s Asco, a kind of rock festival for pharma;"After decades of frustratingly slow progress in discovering new drugs to battle cancer, the breakthroughs have started to come thick and fast. Futuristic cell therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences can re-engineer the body to attack tumours, while a drug from Loxo Oncology produces spectacular results by zoning in on cancer genetics. The annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco), the world’s largest cancer conference, has become the main forum for drugmakers to chart their success. As the pace of discoveries has quickened in recent years, it has turned into a kind of rock festival for the pharmaceutical industry.This week, 30,000 doctors and pharma executives will again assemble in a huge conference centre on the banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago for the meeting to pore over results from hundreds of clinical trials. The biggest advance has been the arrival of immunotherapy drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, which remove brakes in the immune system so it can fight cancer as it does other foreign invaders such as viruses.The medicines, which wowed the audience at Asco in 2014, raked in $10bn in sales last year for Merck of the US, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca. This year’s meeting was supposed to be another one for the ages, when pharma companies would finally start to prove a popular theory which holds that combining two immunotherapy drugs into one treatment can dramatically boost survival rates. While a minority of between 20 and 30 per cent of cancer patients do extremely well on immunotherapies, most do not. Drugmakers have been trying to push response rates higher by testing cocktails containing two medicines targeting the immune system. Thousands of trials are under way.However, the company that was supposed to be this year’s headline act will be conspicuously absent from the main stage. Incyte, a US biotech group, had hoped to prove that combining its experimental immunotherapy with Keytruda — a leading checkpoint inhibitor made by its Big Pharma partner Merck — would boost survival rates in patients suffering from melanoma and other common cancers. But after announcing the failure of its closely watched Phase III trial earlier this year, Incyte’s investigators will instead take to the podium with a presentation that tries to unpick why the approach was so unsuccessful. “Every year Asco has an ‘advance of the year’,” said Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Exchange Traded Fund. “This year was supposed to be the year of combos, but it hasn’t materialised as quickly or as robustly as anyone would have hoped.” Outside of melanoma, the only combination approach that has been conclusively proven to work involves twinning a checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with chemotherapy, a treatment that has been used to fight cancer for more than 70 years. Last month, Merck unveiled a large trial showing this cocktail can dramatically improve survival prospects for people suffering from the most common form of lung cancer, putting it on track to become the standard first-in-line treatment for these patients. However, the inclusion of chemotherapy in the mix means patients must still contend with its brutal toxic side effects, such as hair loss, vomiting and anaemia. The holy grail is still finding two immunotherapies that can manipulate the immune system so that it does all the work, meaning chemotherapy can be discarded altogether. But a crop of studies due to be presented at this year’s Asco meeting suggests there is still much more work to do. The most promising experimental drug is from Nektar Therapeutics, a San Francisco biotech company that recently signed a record-breaking $1.85bn partnership deal with Bristol-Myers. I’d prefer to combine mechanisms where both parts of the combination have activity by themselves. “[Incyte’s drug] did not have single-agent efficacy, which was always worrisomeAn abstract preview of the company’s trial shows that around half of patients with skin, kidney and lung cancers responded to a combination of Nektar’s drug and Opdivo, a checkpoint inhibitor made by Bristol-Myers. Still, the results from the small trial are less impressive than a readout of the same study published in November, leading some investors to fret over whether the combo really works. Jounce Therapeutics, which had been touted as another star act, also looks set to disappoint. The company founded by Jim Allison — a scientist often described as the “godfather of immunotherapy” — published an abstract of its combination trial that Mr Loncar described as “terrible”.The patchy progress in finding the right combination supports the view of those oncologists who think drugmakers have started taking foolhardy scientific shortcuts in the hope that they will strike lucky and find a blockbuster treatment. Merck made a big bet on Incyte’s failed combination effort, in a rare stumble for a company that has developed its own immunotherapies with scientific rigour, even if it has meant sacrificing some early commercial success. Mr Loncar identified two problems with the Incyte and Merck collaboration. First, there was scant proof that Incyte’s drug was effective in fighting cancer. Second, the companies charged into a series of large and expensive trials based on data from a handful of small, early-stage studies, without doing the necessary mid-stage groundwork. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s top scientist, said the company would focus its future efforts on combinations where each of the drugs has been proven to work separately as a “monotherapy” before testing them together.“I’d prefer to combine mechanisms where both parts of the combination have activity by themselves,” he said. “[Incyte’s drug] did not have single-agent efficacy, which was always worrisome.” Asked whether that meant Merck could scale back any of the roughly 400 combination trials it has under way, Dr Perlmutter replied: “We review them all the time based on new data that comes in; we are always looking at them and thinking about them.”However, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, which is trialling its own immunotherapy combo, predicts companies will still move quickly because the lucrative field is so hotly contested. “It’s still a very competitive race and people are ready to take risks,” said Mr Soriot. “Of course, we are going to be looking for monotherapy activity, but if we have a good biological rationale, we may still take the risk with a combination.” For Mr Loncar, “the clear takeaway from the Incyte failure is that we need a lot more mid-stage, randomised trials”. “But,” he added, “that costs money and takes time, and sometimes market forces motivate people to do things the wrong way. “I believe things will change when I see it.”The most keenly awaited study at this year’s meeting is a large trial of Merck’s immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, in patients with a common type of lung cancer. The company stunned medics and investors last month with the success of its trial combining Keytruda and chemotherapy in untreated patients.But the study due to be unveiled at Asco is examining whether patients can be spared the older, toxic treatment altogether. Merck’s drug is already used instead of chemo in a subset of patients with tumours that have very high levels of a protein known as programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1), which is thought to make them particularly good candidates for immunotherapy. The forthcoming study is looking at whether chemo can also be dispensed with in patients whose tumours have lower levels of the protein.Merck has already announced that the study was successful without giving much detail, but doctors will want to see the full results to determine whether to use Keytruda on its own or in combination with chemotherapy. Merck’s success in using Keytruda as a “monotherapy” in this group of patients is surprising, given that Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted a similar trial in 2016 that ended up failing.Depending on the strength of the full results, the study could raise questions over whether Merck’s drug is inherently better than Bristol’s. Most doctors believe that the drugs are effectively copies of each other — the equivalent of Coca-Cola and Pepsi — but that could start to change if trials suggest that Merck has an edge. "
1;INCY;Incyte Corp;2018-04-06T16:26:07Z;Melanoma trial failure deals heavy blow to immunotherapy hopes;Merck slides and Incyte loses $4bn market value as ‘combination’ cancer study flops;The quest to expand the benefits of cancer immunotherapy to more patients suffered a big setback on Friday following the failure of a closely followed clinical trial.Immunotherapies work by removing brakes in the immune system so the body can attack cancer — and they have dramatically increased the odds of survival for some of the sickest patients since they were approved by regulators in 2014.But existing immuno-oncology drugs only work in a minority of about 20-30 per cent of cancer sufferers, prompting pharmaceutical companies to investigate whether twinning them with newer medicines can push response rates significantly higher. The combination theory was dealt a big blow on Friday when Merck of the US, one of the leading names in immunotherapy, announced the failure of a large trial of melanoma patients, which had paired its drug Keytruda with another experimental medicine that tries to manipulate the immune system. The trial of more than 700 patients showed that people who received both medicines did no better that those taking Keytruda alone. Shares in Incyte, the US biotech company developing the second medicine, epacadostat, fell 22 per cent, wiping more than $4bn from its market value, which stood at $13.8bn during early trading in New York. New Link Genetics, which makes a drug in the same class — known as IDO inhibitors — lost 34 per cent of its stock market value. The results of the trial, seen as one of the first conclusive tests of the combination hypothesis, will stoke fears that the benefit of immunotherapies will be limited to a minority of patients. “The failure . . . adds to the list of disappointment with ‘second generation’ immuno-oncology drugs,” said Tim Anderson, analyst at Bernstein. “Promises by companies and key opinion leaders that the industry was just scratching the surface with [immunotherapies] have not come true, at least yet.” Merck and other leading immuno-oncology companies, including Roche and Bristol-Myers, have had considerable success when pairing their drugs with older medicines, such as chemotherapy and earlier versions of immunotherapy. But they have struggled to show that the medicines can be augmented by a newer generation of ‘Immunotherapy 2.0’ drugs that are being developed by smaller biotech companies. Last year, researchers and industry figures told the Financial Times they feared the immunotherapy field was engaged in a medical gold rush, spending millions of dollars on hundreds of clinical trials without first doing the appropriate scientific groundwork. At the time, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, which is developing an immunotherapy, said fierce competition was prompting some drugmakers to push ahead with large, expensive trials in the absence of convincing results from early-stage studies. “The field is very competitive. Right now you have a lot of companies that take bets . . . without a lot of data,” he said. Merck and Incyte announced the failure of the melanoma trial just a year after they unveiled an expansion of their partnership, under which they started six late-stage trials in various tumour types including lung, kidney and bladder cancer. On a conference call with analysts on Friday, Hervé Hoppenot, chief executive of Incyte, admitted the disappointing study would have a “negative impact on the probability of success” of the other trials, suggesting they could be scaled back or halted. 
2;INCY;Incyte Corp;2018-03-05T05:00:47Z;Immunotherapy: beyond melanoma and lung cancer treatment;Scientists are seeking combination drugs that would make for more effective treatments;In the late 1800s, William Coley, a surgeon in New York, developed what scientists now think was the first cancer immunotherapy.Coley noticed one of his patients, Fred Stein, had started recovering from cancer after catching a serious infection. The observation made him wonder whether the bacteria had somehow stimulated the patient’s immune system and recruited the body’s natural “resisting powers” in the fight against Mr Stein’s tumours. The surgeon began treating inoperable cancer patients with bacterial injections — known as “Coley’s toxins” — and recorded some success, but his poorly documented findings were dismissed by contemporaries who favoured radiation and chemotherapy. Mr Coley died in 1936 and his theories were all but forgotten: it would take almost 80 years for oncologists to take cancer immunotherapy seriously. Today, immunotherapies are among the world’s best selling drugs and they have dramatically improved the survival prospects for some of the sickest patients, especially those with melanoma and lung cancer. “Immunotherapy is here to stay,” says Jill O’Donnell-Tormey, chief executive of the Cancer Research Institute. “It's not just a blip, it’s not overhyped — I think it is going to become the standard of care for many cancer types.” The most common immunotherapy drugs are known as checkpoint inhibitors, which work by removing brakes in the immune system so the body can attack cancer. Their discovery was made possible by the research of James Allison, now a professor at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, who spent the 1990s and early 2000s working on immunotherapy even as many other scientists dismissed it as an intriguing but futile sideshow. 60percentage of advanced melanoma patients who survive three years when they take a combination of two checkpoint inhibitorsCheckpoint inhibitors have proven remarkably effective in people with advanced melanoma, a disease once known as the “cancer that gave cancer a bad name” because it had such a terrible prognosis, with most patients dying within three to 18 months. Today, almost 60 per cent of advanced melanoma patients survive three years if they take a combination of two checkpoint inhibitors, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US pharmaceutical group that bought Yervoy, the drug based on Dr Allison’s findings, in 2009.A rival drug made by Merck, known as Keytruda, can significantly boost survival in lung cancer patients when added to a type of chemotherapy, according to early findings from a trial that is due to be published shortly. Other companies, including Roche and AstraZeneca, make competing versions. It was not until 2013 that checkpoint inhibitors gained widespread acclaim among oncologists, but the drugs were soon being hailed as the biggest breakthrough in cancer treatment since the advent of chemotherapy. The hype served to cloud some uneasy truths. When checkpoint inhibitors work, they are remarkably effective, helping patients live for months or years longer than expected with less severe side-effects than other drugs. However, with the exception of the remarkable impact in melanoma and, to a lesser extent, lung cancer, most patients do not respond. We asked readers, researchers and FT journalists to submit ideas with the potential to change the world. A panel of judges selected the 50 ideas worth looking at in more detail. This fourth tranche of 30 ideas (listed below) is about the latest advances in healthcare. The fifth and final chapter, looking at Earth and the universe, will be published on March 29, 2018.Although immunotherapies have now been approved in a long list of cancers from bladder and gastric to liver, the response rates in these illnesses is lower, with as many as 4 out of 5 patients deriving no benefit at all. When the second generation of checkpoints, known as PDL1 inhibitors, were approved in 2014, researchers and pharma executives confidently predicted they would quickly push response rates higher by combining them with newer experimental immunotherapies. So far no one has come up with the magic combination, despite running hundreds of trials. Giovanni Caforio, chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb, hails “unprecedented progress” with immunotherapies, but concedes the next step, which he describes as finding “intelligent combinations”, has not moved as quickly. “I think that it is not growing at the same speed, but I wouldn’t call it stalling,” he says. “I think it’s moving at a speed that is probably more typical of the speed of [traditional] cancer research.” Sean Bohen, chief medical officer of AstraZeneca, says the quick advent of checkpoint inhibitors was all the more remarkable because immunotherapy “had been a disappointment for decades”. Yet he cautions progress might become slower because the “science is going to harder places”. That is not necessarily a bad thing, says Dr Bohen, because it encourages companies and researchers to work in a more methodical way rather than making speculative guesses: “I believe it’s a healthier way to do drug development”. The challenge now is finding new drugs that can be added to checkpoints and boost the immune response to cancer without putting patients at risk or causing intolerable side effects. One hope is a so-called IDO inhibitor, which suppresses an enzyme that tumours use to hide from the immune system. Both Merck and Bristol-Myers are testing their checkpoints in combination with this type of medicine in a partnership with Incyte, a US biotech group that is developing the most advanced IDO inhibitor. The first trials are due to complete in May. Regardless of whether drugmakers and scientists find the right combination any time soon, the remarkable progress in recent years means the field is unlikely to languish as it did after Mr Coley’s early discoveries.
3;INCY;Incyte Corp;2017-05-30T09:00:38Z;Big pharma turns to immunotherapy combos to beat cancer;World’s biggest oncology summit focuses on drugs that boost body’s ability to fight;"Each year, 30,000 doctors descend on Chicago for the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, where they pore over thousands of pieces of clinical research. The event will be held this weekend in a cavernous conference centre on the banks of Lake Michigan, where oncologists will dash from one hall to another to hear about the newest ways to battle cancer.The meeting has also become one of the most important forums for drugmakers, from large pharmaceutical groups such as Merck and AstraZeneca, to smaller biotech groups such as Incyte. Many of these companies have held back results from trials of their most promising drugs to make a splash at the conference.With shareholder expectations running high ahead of the event, the data have the potential to prompt sharp movements in share prices — in either direction. Here are four questions that pharmaceutical investors will be askingCan Roche’s blockbuster Herceptin franchise endure?
Herceptin, a breast cancer medicine, is one of the world’s best-selling oncology drugs, generating about $7bn of sales last year for Roche, the Swiss drugmaker.But with Mylan, the generic drugmaker, gearing up to launch a cheaper “biosimilar” version of the medicine, analysts have started to ask how long the blockbuster franchise will survive.To protect its franchise, Roche has been pushing the use of Herceptin in combination with Perjeta, a newer medicine that has a longer patent life. A large study of the drug cocktail in patients with a type of breast cancer known as HER 2-positive is due to be presented at the conference.Roche has already announced that the combination increased a person’s chances of surviving breast cancer after surgery compared with Herceptin alone.But oncologists say the benefit would have to be substantial for them to switch to the expensive cocktail once a cheaper copycat version of Herceptin is available — not just for cost reasons, but also because the combination causes severe diarrhoea in many patients.“The big question is whether data are enough to convince clinicians that the standard of care in HER 2-positive breast cancer is now the Herceptin and Perjeta combination,” said Steve McGarry, an HSBC analyst.Mr McGarry said he was concerned “the data would be positive, but perhaps not positive enough to meet high expectations”.Will the location of a person’s tumour become less important?
For decades, oncologists have organised themselves based on where a person’s primary tumour is based — there are specialists for cancer of the lung, brain, breast and so on. But scientists have started to ask whether they should instead treat patients based on the genetic features of their cancer — and pharmaceutical companies are following suit.Merck last week became the first company to win approval to use its immunotherapy Keytruda in all patients whose tumours have a particular biological trait or “biomarker”, regardless of where the cancer is located. At Asco, it is due to present full results from the trial that convinced regulators to give it the green light.Investors are also watching out for a study of a drug made by Loxo Oncology, a small biotech group, which has been singled out by the organisers of Asco as being of particular interest. Loxo’s medicine is being developed for patients whose tumours have a specific genetic defect, and is being trialled in a broad range of cancers including lung, colon and melanoma.Can combination therapy extend the benefits of immunotherapy?Immunotherapies that turn the body into a weapon against cancer have produced some remarkable results, extending the lives of patients by months or years longer than doctors would have expected. But they still only work in a minority of between 20 and 30 per cent of patients.Drugmakers have argued that they can boost the number of people who respond by combining immunotherapies with other drugs, and have initiated a flurry of clinical trials. Among the studies that have generated the most interest is a trial of Keytruda in combination with an experimental drug being developed by Incyte, a biotech group.Asco’s organisers have already published some results from the trials, which suggested the cocktail could increase response rates significantly. Shares in Incyte have jumped 20 per cent since the data were made public earlier this month.Andrew Baum, analyst at Citi, said the performance of the cocktail in lung cancer patients — 35 per cent of whom responded to the combo — was his “biggest takeaway” from the information released so far.But investors will be waiting for the full study to be presented at Asco to see if there are any holes in the data. One investor in Incyte said even a small wrinkle could hit the company’s shares, which are now “priced for perfection”.Can AstraZeneca build an oncology powerhouse?
When Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, rebuffed a £69.4bn bid from Pfizer in 2014, he said the US group had vastly undervalued the company’s oncology drugs. Investors will soon find out whether he was right, when the drugmaker publishes the results from its much-anticipated trial of a new combination medicine for lung cancer.Some investors see the Mystic trial as a make-or-break moment for AstraZeneca, but the company has been keen to point to other promising cancer products in its portfolio.Among these medicines is Lynparza, which blocks the ability of cancer cells to repair themselves. The drug has already been approved for the treatment of some ovarian cancer patients, but full data from a successful trial in some breast cancer patients will be unveiled at the conference.Timothy Anderson, analyst at Bernstein, predicts a “practice-changing result” that could lead to a big shift in treatment of breast cancer patients with a mutation in their BRCA genes."
4;INCY;Incyte Corp;2017-05-17T21:39:02Z;Incyte shares lifted by positive early-stage trial results for cancer drug;;A cancer drug made by Incyte boosted the number of patients who responded to immunotherapy during an early-stage trial, sending shares in the group up 6 per cent in after-hours trading.The studies tested the drug, Epacadostat, in combination with Keytruda, an immunotherapy made by Merck, in a range of cancers including lung, bladder and kidney.Patients on the cocktail seemed to do better than they would have done if they had only taken Keytruda, an immunotherapy that turns the patient’s immune system into a weapon against tumours.For instance, 35 per cent of patients with a type of lung cancer saw their tumours shrink substantially after taking the combination, versus the 14-20 per cent that typically respond to Keytruda alone.The study is one of 5,000 scheduled to be presented in full at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago next month.Incyte, which has been tipped by analysts as one of the hottest biotech stocks, added 2.32 per cent during trading hours as traders anticipated the results and a further 6 per cent after markets closed.
5;INCY;Incyte Corp;2017-04-19T11:00:08Z;Investors bet on Incyte cancer drug success;Immunotherapy hopes push up shares 60% despite arthritis treatment knock-back;"The huge escalator running through the headquarters of Incyte, the US biotech company, harks backs to the building’s former life as a department store. Where smartly dressed shop assistants once sold ladieswear to the residents of Wilmington, Delaware, now there are hundreds of lab-coated scientists trying to discover the next blockbuster drug.Investors are betting the drugmaker has struck lucky with one of its experimental medicines, Epacadostat, a second-generation cancer immunotherapy that has produced promising results in mid-stage clinical trials.However, the unexpected rejection of Incyte’s arthritis drug by the US medicines regulator last week was a timely reminder that drug development is anything but smooth. The knock-back wiped more than 10 per cent off Incyte’s shares on Monday.The biotech group had sold the rights to the medicine to Eli Lilly, but was banking on royalties and other performance-based payments worth billions of dollars to fund trials of its experimental drugs, including Epacadostat.Now the success of its unproven medicines is even more important than before.Even accounting for the slide in the company’s shares on Monday, Incyte’s market value has swelled more than 60 per cent over the past 12 months to $26bn, helped in part by persistent rumours that it will be taken over by a larger drugmaker.“It’s not bad to be sexy — you want to be wanted,” says Hervé Hoppenot, the French-born chief executive of Incyte and previously president of oncology at Novartis. “But we have an obsessive vision of making Incyte a company that will be one of the fastest-growing, most successful, and most profitable — by ourself.”Asked whether he would consider doing a deal with Gilead, the large-cap biotech group that is often touted as a buyer by analysts, he quips: “We looked at them, but we are not going to buy them — because their growth prospect is very low compared to ours.”Not all investors agree that Incyte will stay independent. More than 8 per cent of its shares are held by hedge funds, some of which have bought the stock in anticipation of a deal. A manager at one such fund said he thought an approach was more likely following the recent decline in its shares.While Mr Hoppenot shows little interest in selling the company, he has not been averse to signing research deals with larger pharmaceutical groups. Incyte recently expanded a partnership to test Epacadostat in combination with Merck’s immunotherapy, Keytruda, in a string of late-stage clinical trials. The studies will be done on a broad range of cancers, including lung, kidney, head and neck, and melanoma.This month, the group agreed a similar tie-up with Bristol-Myers, Merck’s rival in immunotherapy, which raised eyebrows in the industry because the biotech group appeared to be playing the field. Tim Anderson, an analyst at Bernstein, says the deal shows Incyte is a “promiscuous company”.“People were saying, ‘how do you go to work with one in the morning and the other in the afternoon?’ Well, we offer an open company from a partnership standpoint,” says Mr Hoppenot.The interest from the likes of Merck and Bristol-Myers comes as the pair try to solve one of the most stubborn riddles of current immunotherapies, which are known as checkpoint inhibitors. Why do roughly a third of patients respond remarkably well to the drugs — living for months or years longer than they would have done previously — while the majority seem to derive no benefit at all?Drugmakers had hoped to push response rates much higher by combining the medicines with older immunotherapies and more conventional treatments such as chemotherapy. The approach seems to kill more tumour cells in some patients, but for many the toxic side-effects have proven intolerable and forced them to stop the treatment.Epacadostat, a second-generation immunotherapy, is part of a class of medicines that work by suppressing an enzyme called IDO, which tumours use to hide from the immune system. The drug seems to boost the percentage of patients who respond to existing immunotherapies without causing any major safety problems.In a mid-stage study of advanced melanoma sufferers, almost 60 per cent of patients on a combination of Incyte’s drug and Merck’s Keytruda went for a year without their cancer getting worse.The science behind so-called IDO inhibitors can be traced back to research done on pregnancy in the 1990s. Scientists wondered why a mother’s body did not reject a foetus — which derived 50 per cent of its genetic material from the father — in the same way it would spurn another foreign object such as a transplanted organ.They discovered that production of the IDO enzyme allowed the foetus to shield itself from the immune system. It turns out that tumours use a similar ruse to hide from cells that might otherwise kill them.Several other drugmakers are developing IDO inhibitors that could rival Epacadostat, such as Bristol-Myers, which recently spent up to $1.25bn to acquire a challenger from San-Francisco biotech Flexus. Roche, the Swiss pharma group, and Merck, have also done licensing deals to gain access to contenders, while Pfizer has an early candidate in development.Still, Incyte is about 18 months ahead of the nearest competitor, a meaningful head start in drug development.Incyte generated net income of $104m on revenues of $1.1bn last year, although shareholders ascribe most of the company’s value to future sales and the strength of its pipeline of experimental medicines.But some investors warn that the rapid appreciation in Incyte’s stock price — and the recent rejection of its arthritis medicine — mean that it must hit a home run with its IDO inhibitor.In June the company is due to present results from its Epacadostat trials at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology — the world’s biggest cancer conference. Anything less than a clean sweep could spook shareholders, according to some.————————-Source: Companies, Bernstein analysis; * technically, Indoximod is not an IDO inhibitor but a tryptophan analogue————————-“The data we are going to see next month have to be good,” says one large life-sciences investor with a stake in Incyte. “In fact, at this stage, they have to be perfect.”Mr Hoppenot admits to being a little apprehensive. He argues that while it was scientifically shrewd to start a large number of late-stage clinical trials of Epacadostat, it might be hard for the investment community to work out what the move will mean for the company’s long-term earnings.“Disappointment is possible because the job of many of the analysts is to do forecasting,” he says. “The problem is that there is a dictatorship of the spreadsheet.”One of the perennial debates in the pharmaceuticals industry is whether companies should try to discover their own drugs, or instead look outside their laboratories to buy and license promising medicines from their rivals.It is hard to find a company more squarely in the first camp than Incyte. It has seven drugs in mid- or late-stage clinical trials — all of which were discovered in-house by its own scientists.“Discovery is what matters in our business and the fact is some in our industry have been losing sight of that,” says chief executive Hervé Hoppenot, pointing to groups such as Valeant and Martin Shkreli’s Turing Pharmaceuticals, which profited by acquiring old drugs and implementing large price hikes.However, he also criticises companies “in the middle of the pack”, that spend lots of money on development and marketing but eschew early-stage research, instead buying innovative medicines from smaller biotech groups.“We can’t just drive trucks around and expect to make money out of it,” says Mr Hoppenot of the pharmaceuticals industry.The commitment to drug discovery predates Mr Hoppenot’s appointment as chief executive in 2014, and can be traced to the sharp change of direction taken by Incyte in 2001.Incyte, founded in the early-1990s, had traditionally been focused on genomic sequencing, but the company’s board decided to withdraw from that business before it became too commoditised.In 2001, Paul Friedman, then an executive at DuPont’s pharmaceuticals division, was recruited as chief executive of Incyte with a brief to pivot to drug discovery. About 60 chemists followed him to Incyte rather than work for Bristol-Myers, which had acquired DuPont Pharmaceuticals.Most of those 60 chemists, who wear navy lab coats rather than traditional white, still work at Incyte, although Dr Friedman has since retired as chief executive and joined the board.The company’s commitment to chemistry also sets it apart at a time when many of its rivals are focusing more on biological drugs made from living cells rather than chemical compounds.“Many companies have decided to export or to outsource their chemistry to India and China, and we have done exactly the opposite,” says Mr Hoppenot.However, not everyone in the industry ascribes to Incyte’s approach to early-stage scientific research.Brent Saunders, chief executive of Allergan, has implemented what he describes an “open science” strategy, whereby the company invests less in its own discovery efforts and instead engages in near-perpetual deal making to bring in promising drugs."
6;INCY;Incyte Corp;2017-04-17T15:20:52Z;FDA arthritis drug rejection hits Eli Lilly shares;New Baricitinib medicine unexpectedly fails to win US approval;Investors wiped a combined $6bn from the market value of Eli Lilly and its biotech partner Incyte on Monday after the US medicines regulator rejected their new arthritis medicine.In a letter to the companies, the US Food and Drug Administration said it was unable to approve the drug, Baricitinib, and asked for more clinical data to clarify safety concerns and to determine what dose of the medicine should be given to patients.Analysts had predicted Baricitinib would win US approval easily after European regulators recently gave it a green light. The once-a-day pill had been expected to generate more than $2bn in peak annual sales by taking share in the lucrative rheumatoid arthritis market, which is dominated by injectable drugs.Shares in Eli Lilly fell by as much 5.3 per cent in early trading in New York on Monday, before recovering slightly to trade 4.3 per cent lower. The price move wiped around $3.5bn from the company’s market capitalisation.It was the second big shock in recent months for Lilly investors, coming after the company in November revealed its experimental medicine for Alzheimer’s had flunked a late-stage clinical trial.The rejection was also a blow for Incyte, the biotech group that discovered Baricitinib before licensing the rights to Eli Lilly. The company had been hoping to use royalties and other payments tied to sales of the medicine to fund the development of experimental drugs in its pipeline.Shares in Incyte fell by 11 per cent on Monday, reducing its stock market value by almost $3bn.Eli Lilly and Incyte said they disagreed with the FDA’s decision and would resubmit their application after discussing a timeframe with the agency.However, analysts said that even in the best-case scenario, the launch of the drug would probably be delayed until 2019 at the earliest — more than a year later than planned.“The timing of a resubmission is still to be determined but for now we assume it will take at least 12 months, pushing back a US launch to potentially 2019 or later,” said Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayMr Divan said the delayed launch would limit Lilly’s ability to take share in the fiercely-competitive arthritis market, pointing out the drug would now have to go up against newer products that have yet to be approved and cheaper generic alternatives.The rejection was billed as a positive for AbbVie, which makes the world’s top-selling arthritis injection, Humira, and which is also developing a pill to rival Baricitinib.The FDA knocked the drug back in what is known as a “complete response letter”, although Eli Lilly did not give details on the regulator’s specific concerns when they announced the rejection during the stock market closure Good Friday.Some analysts suggested that the FDA had been perturbed by signs that the medicine could put patients at risk of developing cancers such as lymphoma, while others posited that the regulator might prefer to approve only a lower dose of the drug.
7;INCY;Incyte Corp;2016-06-01T13:08:24Z;Cancer doctors face next drug challenge;Delegates at world’s largest gathering of oncologists to address how to help more victims;More than 30,000 doctors and scientists will gather in Chicago this weekend for the biggest annual meeting of cancer experts, organised by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (Asco). They will be joined by healthcare investors and pharmaceuticals executives from the largest companies — such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer — to smaller biotech groups, to hear the results from more than 5,000 clinical trials.The sheer amount of research on display this year underscores a recent renaissance in developing drugs for cancer, after pharmaceuticals companies and their investors poured billions of dollars into finding new ways to tackle the disease.At last year’s event, a new generation of drugs that turn the body’s immune system into a weapon against tumours established themselves as the most important advance in cancer treatment in decades.These “immunotherapies” have radically altered the odds of surviving cancer for some patients. About 40 per cent of melanoma sufferers taking Keytruda, made by American group Merck, are still alive after three years, according to data from a large trial that will be presented in full at Asco this weekend.That is a remarkable turnround for an illness that has tended to result in a swift death for almost all of its victims.But for all the excitement, the immunotherapies on the market only work in a minority of patients and tumour types.This year, delegates will have to confront some difficult questions: can the benefits of these drugs be extended to help more sufferers, including those with the deadliest types of cancer?And, if so, will cash-strapped healthcare systems be able to afford the medicines, which command price tags well in excess of $100,000 per patient per year.COMBINATION THERAPIESScientists hope that adding existing immunotherapies to more established treatments such as chemotherapy could result in a higher success rate, and several companies have been testing this approach in clinical trials.Investors are awaiting the results of a study that combined Johnson & Johnson’s Daratumumab with chemotherapy in patients suffering from multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells. Ganymed Pharmaceuticals, a private German group, is also trialling a drug with chemo in patients with gastric cancer.Data from both studies have been held back by Asco’s organisers to be discussed in “late breaker” sessions this weekend, in a sign they deem the results to be promising.Other companies are trying to combine two novel immunotherapies, such as Pfizer, which will unveil data from a trial of Merck’s Keytruda with its own drug, known as 4-1BB. The former is designed to remove brakes in the immune system that stop it from attacking tumours, while the latter aims to speed up the body’s response.“Last year, immunotherapies established themselves as having real promise, but now we are asking how you can mix and match them,” says Dr Alan Worsley of Cancer Research UK.Some scientists warn that too much manipulation of the immune system could lead to intolerable and harmful side effects.“When you’re dealing with agents that are going to stimulate the body, you have to be careful,” says Dr Steven Stein, chief medical officer at Incyte, a biotech focused on cancer drugs. “You do not want to get to a point where there is an ‘autoimmune response’,” he adds, referring to a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells.HARD TO TREAT CANCERSSome cancers are worse than others, and doctors will be looking for data that show progress in tackling the deadliest forms of the disease.Investors are watching for data from a trial of a drug made by Immunomedics, a New Jersey-based biotech. The drug is designed to carry chemotherapy directly into the tumour cells of patients with triple negative breast cancer — one of the hardest cancers to treat — enabling them to take a type of chemo that would prove too toxic if delivered normally.Small cell lung cancer, which tends to affect smokers, is also notoriously difficult to tackle and can spread very quickly. Stemcentrx, recently acquired by AbbVie for $5.8bn, will present data from a study of its drug, Rova-T. In a smaller clinical trial, 44 per cent of patients with high levels of a certain protein saw their cancer disappear completely after taking Rova-T.PRICE AND VALUEDelegates at Asco have traditionally paid little attention to the price of drugs, preferring to focus on science. But that position has become untenable as concerns grow that the cost of the latest generation of medicines will cause patients and healthcare systems to buckle under the strain.“We have to think about fairness,” says Dr Julie Vose, president of Asco. “We’re trying wherever it’s suitable to talk about value and cost.”A study comparing the price of 23 major cancer drugs in different countries could spark a debate when it is published at the conference, she says.We have to think about fairness. We’re trying wherever it’s suitable to talk about value and costOne of the problems with the latest generation of cancer drugs is that they are biologic medicines made from living cells rather than chemical compounds, making it harder for generic manufacturers to make cheaper copycat versions.Instead, generic manufacturers must try to make biosimilar versions of the drug that are not direct copies, and some big pharma companies are warning these might not be as good as the “real thing”.Mylan, one of the largest generic drugmakers, is publishing data from a large study of its biosimilar version of Roche’s Herceptin, a breast cancer drug with annual sales of $6.6bn. If the medicine works as well as the branded version, it could offer a much cheaper alternative for patients.@bydavidcrow

dollar strengthened and concern grew over the prospect of tighter monetary policy.Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, also benefited from an upgrade by analysts at Barclays, who raised the stock from “equal weight” to “overweight”.Concerns over gross margins and an investigation into competition issues by the Federal Trade Commission has weighed on the shares, resulting in an attractive valuation, according to Barclays. Intel rose 2.3 per cent to $20.09.Deal news in the construction and pharmaceutical sectors also helped to revived overall confidence in the market.Bucyrus International, the construction company, announced that it had bought Terex’s mining business for $1.3bn.In October, Terex posted its fourth straight quarterly loss after demand for construction equipment continued to fall during the recession.Shares in Terex jumped 9 per cent to $20.94 while Bucyrus climbed 9.8 per cent to $55.84.Athersys, the pharmaceutical company, sold the rights of its stem cell treatment for inflammatory bowel disease to Pfizer for up to $111m.Athersys shares more than doubled to $2.40 while Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, was up 1.7 per cent to $18.61.Incyte also sold the rights to its experimental pill to treat inflammatory conditions to Eli Lilly & Co.Incyte, which could receive as much as $665m in additional payments, rose 2.8 per cent to $8.73. Eli Lilly edged 1.5 per cent higher to $36.24.“We’ve virtually gone sideways on the S&P 500 for almost six-and-a-half weeks now,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “Neither the bulls nor the bears want to take advantage of the end of the year and it seems like people are content to sit on the sidelines. But M&A activity today is playing into some early strength.”Elsewhere in the pharmaceutical sector, Human Genome Sciences rose 5.1 per cent to $29.60 after the drugmaker was rated “overweight” at Morgan Stanley. Analysts cited the growth potential of Benlysta, which could be the first drug approved for lupus in 50 years.Health insurers led the market higher from the opening bell after Senate Democrats pushed back the start date of a proposed insurer tax.The tax, which is expected to drive up premiums, was originally set to begin next year, eating into insurers’ 2010 earnings per share.Aetna advanced 4.7 per cent to $34.04, Cigna climbed 3.9 per cent to $37.19 and UnitedHealth added 2 per cent to $32.17.The technology sector was also up by more than1 per cent. Shares in Seagate Technology climbed 1.3 per cent to $17.68 after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Analysts at the brokerage said the company would
be likely to benefit from increased spending on hardware as the economy recovers.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, said its first-quarter profit had jumped almost 20 per cent.However, S&P cut the group’s price target from $41 to $38. Its shares closed down 0.1 per cent at $36.61.E-Trade Financial, which has been under intense regulatory pressure to shore up its balance sheet, fell 1.1 per cent to $1.76."
