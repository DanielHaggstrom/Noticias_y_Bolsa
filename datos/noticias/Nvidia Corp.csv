0;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-02-13T22:05:51Z;Nvidia surges back to growth as chip market recovers;Quarterly revenue jumped 41% on strength in the gaming and data centre segments;Nvidia surged back to growth in its latest quarter, after four quarters of contraction caused by a sharp drop-off in demand in the crypto-mining and data centre markets.The strength of the recovery, which pushed revenue up by 41 per cent from a year before to $3.1bn, surprised Wall Street and drove shares in the US chip company up by 7 per cent in after-market trading. Earnings also topped forecasts, as the company’s pro forma earnings per share bounced 136 per cent, to $1.89.The after-market rally extended a recovery that had already seen the shares more than double from a low point last May, lifting them back above the record high set 18 months ago for the first time. Nvidia also projected that revenue in the current quarter, at $3bn, would top Wall Street estimates, despite an expected $100m hit caused by the spread of the coronavirus.Jensen Huang, chief executive, pointed in particular to record data centre revenue for the recovery.Intel set the stage for strong earnings from Nvidia three weeks ago when it reported a powerful rebound in its own data centre business. Since then, shares in both Intel and Nvidia have risen 8 per cent.However, the strength of Nvidia’s recovery surprised analysts, with data centre revenues up 43 per cent, at $968m, and gaming revenue climbing 56 per cent to nearly $1.5bn. A year before, at the bottom of the trough, the company reported revenue of $2.2bn and pro forma earnings of 80 cents.The volatility in Nvidia’s markets has taken it from boom to bust and back again at breakneck speed. Quarterly revenue tumbled from growth of 66 per cent in early 2018 to a contraction of 31 per cent a year later, before the rebound this quarter.
1;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-02-04T19:48:06Z;Nvidia goes into battle for gamers with new streaming service;Official launch of GeForce comes after Google launched its own assault on the market;Nvidia, whose chips are used in many of the world’s most powerful gaming PCs, has formally launched a streaming service for gamers, joining a race among some of the most powerful technology, internet and gaming companies to dominate the emerging market for cloud-based play.The US chipmaker said it would offer a free service for gamers who were prepared to wait for access to its servers at busy times, along with a low-priced introductory offer of $4.99 a month for guaranteed service and a chance to play games with more advanced graphics.Executives likened the service to Spotify, whose “freemium” streaming music service set a new model for the music industry. Nvidia had already been operating a trial streaming service with 300,000 users, all of whom will be automatically switched over to become free users in the new GeForce Now.The company said it was doubling capacity in its network in anticipation of a wave of new users, who would have free access for sessions of up to an hour at a time, provided there was spare capacity on Nvidia’s servers. The move comes just three months after Google formally launched its own attack on the gaming market with a streaming service called Stadia. That service has received mixed reviews in its early days, given the scarcity of hit games and Google’s slow introduction of distinctive new technology features, such as integrating it with its YouTube video service. Unlike Google, Nvidia only provides the network and datacentres to support online play, enabling people to access games they already own or other gaming platforms that are linked to GeForce Now.This “bring your own licence” model contrasts with full content services like Stadia, as well as networks linked to the Xbox and Sony games consoles.Nvidia starts out with a strong position among serious gamers, thanks to the popularity of its high-end GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.Offering access to its most powerful GPUs online would expand the market by letting many more people play the most sophisticated games without having to pay $500 or more for a specialised graphics card for their own PCs, he added. The move represents both a hedge against the risk that Nvidia’s PC chips business would be disrupted by cloud-based gaming, as well as a potential way to open up a big new market for the company, according to Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at IHS Markit.Cloud-based gaming had given companies like Nvidia a chance to expand their place in the gaming value chain, Mr Harding-Rolls added. Nvidia said its cloud infrastructure, based on nine datacentres in North America and six in western Europe, meant it could stream high-definition games to households with broadband connections in those areas with lags of only 20 milliseconds. Through partnerships with other companies, it also said it could achieve a latency of only 10 milliseconds with services in Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow.
2;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-08-15T21:00:56Z;Nvidia shares rally as earnings fuel hopes for rebound;;Shares in US chipmaker Nvidia climbed 7 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday after quarterly numbers that showed a hoped-for rebound at the chipmaker was still on track, despite the latest economic and political uncertainties.Revenue of $2.58bn in the latest quarter was down 17 per cent from a year ago, reflecting an across-the-board fall-off from gaming, data centre and blockchain mining customers. However, that still represented a 16 per cent sequential increase from the first quarter of the year and was slightly ahead of most analysts’ estimates.Nvidia also forecast revenue of around $2.9bn in the current quarter, pointing to a continuation of its recovery despite the tremors that have hit the stock market this week.The chipmaker’s latest earnings also topped forecasts, despite being down heavily from a year ago. On a pro forma basis, it reported earnings per share of $1.24, down from $1.94 in the same period in 2018 but still 10 cents ahead of most forecasts.Nvidia’s shares had been on a rebound until the August doubts that have hit tech stocks more broadly, starting with President Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs against China. They currently stand 45 per cent below the peak hit last autumn.
3;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-07-27T09:00:27Z;Ray tracing expected to spark graphics revolution in video games;Pace at which technology will find its way to mass gamer audience depends a lot on cost;Shimmering reflections on water. Light glinting off objects as they move. Shadows of different depth cast by multiple light sources, all of them shifting in real time.Until now, the world of video games has lacked this kind of naturalistic lighting. Effects have to be programmed in, meaning that they usually remain static and do not constantly adjust with the movement in a scene. The result is an inevitable flatness that detracts from the feeling of realism.A computer graphics revolution that is just reaching video games could be about to change that. Known as ray tracing, the technique has been common for a decade in animated movies, where complex scenes are rendered in large server farms.The ability to pack more computing power into smaller, cheaper chips, along with new techniques to simulate sophisticated lighting effects, has now brought this capability to consumer devices. PC graphics cards with the technology first appeared a year ago, and it will be in the next generation of games consoles.Ray tracing certainly arrives with some big claims to back it. “This is the biggest advance in computer graphics in my lifetime,” said Rev Lebaredian, a veteran graphics expert and head of the simulation group at chipmaker Nvidia. It is the technology that will eventually take gamers across the “uncanny valley”, he said — the gulf that exists when a digital technology falls just short of simulating the real world, leaving a sense of creepiness.The technology involves a fundamental change to how scenes inside animations are “lit”. As the name suggests, it mimics the way photons move in the real world, using algorithms that calculate the angle that light would reflect off different objects in an animation. Rather than programme in each effect, game developers need only place their light sources and let the algorithms do the rest.The technology works from the gamer’s viewpoint, sending a notional ray to an object in the game, then following it from that back to a light source. That way, the computer only needs to calculate the light beams that actually reach the viewer’s eyeball, not ones that bounce off objects in other directions.Calculating the individual light beams puts considerable computing strain on the system. “It’s very resource-intensive,” said Pat Moorhead, a US chip analyst. “The good thing is you can mix it with other effects”, bringing elements of the technology to a scene to generate the most-eye catching effects — for instance, using it to handle just reflections.The pace at which ray tracing now finds its way to a mass gamer audience now depends on three things: cost, performance and content.The price of Nvidia’s graphics cards needed to support ray tracing start at $349. But prices could come down quickly: the cheapest cards are likely to fall quickly to $149 by next year, said Mr Moorhead.A second issue concerns performance. The high demands that ray tracing places on a computer means that the machine can render fewer frames per second, particularly for the highest resolution images. Adding ray tracing degrades performance by 30 per cent to 40 per cent, according to Mr Moorhead. But he added that many games look just fine at between 30 and 60 fps, opening a big part of the market to the technology.That leaves the chicken-and-egg problem that faces all new gaming technologies: when will there be enough high quality games to make it worth buying the more expensive hardware needed for ray tracing — and vice versa?Game developers normally take three to five years to adapt to capabilities such as this in a new generation of chips, said Mr Lebaredian, though he added that the pace is moving faster with ray tracing. Part of the reason is financial. A large slice of the $100m that can go into producing a high-end video game goes into the hand-produced art, he said. With an algorithm that produces lighting effects automatically as scenes change, much of the manual effort goes away.
4;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-05-17T04:10:00Z;Nvidia: graphic decline;Chipmaker’s insistence that a rebound is imminent looks overly optimistic;Nvidia follows one turbulent quarter with another. Revenue for the three months to April was down by around a third compared to last year. Limp demand suggests worse is coming. Nvidia’s insistence that a rebound is imminent looks overly optimistic.The global semiconductor market’s recovery remains theoretical. The sector had been pushing the idea of a strong second half for 2019, but that was before chipmakers such as Intel reported disappointing quarterly numbers. Nvidia, which creates graphic chips used for video games and cloud infrastructure, caps off a bad earnings season.The industry would like to push blame on to President Trump’s decision to ratchet up US trade tensions with China. But that is only one part of the problem. Chipmakers must also contend with falling demand from China, where gaming restrictions are in place, and lower global smartphone sales growth. Nvidia has the added problem of trying to make up for the drop off in demand for graphics chips used by cryptocurrency miners and the threat of rival Advanced Micro Devices.The real snag is data centres, where sales account for about a third of revenues. Boss Jensen Huang wants to use this as proof that Nvidia’s future is not hung up on gaming. Yet data centre sales are falling — down 10 per cent to $634m compared to the same period last year. Intel has also said that data centre chip sales are likely to fall for the full year. Nvidia’s near $7bn purchase of Mellanox — which will absorb almost all of its cash — is looking increasingly expensive.For now, gaming remains by far the biggest contributor to sales. It is a sign of how bleak the situation looks that gaming revenue can sink 39 per cent from last year and be greeted as a good thing. At least the mountain of old inventory is being worked through. None of this addresses the question of where growth will come from. The odds of a turnround in the next few quarters are fading fast.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

5;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-05-17T00:36:11Z;Nvidia backs away from confirming full-year guidance;US chipmaker says it lacks visibility into future orders as revenues firm slightly;Nvidia backed away from confirming its full-year financial guidance on Thursday, dampening rising hopes on Wall Street that it was recovering from a recent slump.On a call with investment analysts late in the day, executives said the US chipmaker would not confirm the earlier guidance because of a lack of visibility into future orders. However, they expressed confidence that the recovery they first predicted three months ago would still take place. Quarterly figures released before the call showed that revenue in the company’s first quarter, to the end of April, had risen above the preceding three months, suggesting that it had started to stage a recovery and reinforcing hopes of a stronger second-half rebound. The slight firming of revenues on a sequential basis, to $2.22bn — despite a year-on-year fall of 31 per cent — brought an immediate 6 per cent bounce in Nvidia’s shares in after-market trading. However, the stock fell back again to trade up only about 1 per cent as executives dropped their guidance and revealed on the call that the issues that had hurt the company during the first quarter were likely to continue in the second. Earlier this year, Nvidia had said it expected its revenue for the whole of 2020 to be “flat to down slightly” from the previous year’s $11.7bn. That implied a strong second-half bounce, given that its first-half estimates now call for revenue of only $4.77bn, down 25 per cent from the year before. 
6;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-03-25T12:35:13Z;AI: state of the smart;Being able to power supercomputers will help non-existent tech become a reality;Announcing a tech breakthrough then declaring yourself too responsible to release it is good publicity. OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company co-founded by Elon Musk, blocked a tool created for language modelling last month after deciding it might be misused to produce “fake news”. That attention fillip helped when the non-profit then declared plans to become a for-profit enterprise to raise more money, citing competition from major tech companies in the artificial intelligence wars.It is right to pay attention to the competition. Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and others are all throwing money at AI. The US and China regard it as a national priority. A PwC report estimates AI technologies will add $15.7tn to the global economy by 2030. Yet human-like computer intelligence remains a fantasy. For now, AI means machine learning and semi-intelligent systems that can predict the next word being typed or spot a stop sign on the road.The easiest way to harness this sort of AI is data centre hardware. Every step forward requires increased computational power. Specialised semiconductor company Nvidia has a head start as the main producer of the graphics processors currently used for AI in data centres. Revenue last year was $11.7bn, up a fifth on the previous year. But Nvidia thinks the total addressable market for graphics processing units will be $50bn by 2023.The company’s recent deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $7bn adds hardware that can move this data around more quickly. It will also ship in a group of new supercomputer customers not already on Nvidia’s books. The price is equal to nearly all the cash the $96bn company has but it will be well worth it. Non-existent tech needs faster computing to become reality. Between them, Nvidia and Mellanox will power more than half the world’s fastest supercomputers.

7;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-03-11T14:45:22Z;Nvidia to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox for $6.9bn ;All-cash deal aims to boost US group’s focus on data centres;Nvidia on Monday agreed to buy rival Mellanox Technologies for $6.9bn, including debt, in the biggest deal ever for the US semiconductor company as it seeks to bolster its business in data centres.The all-cash deal would help Nvidia shift its focus away from the gaming industry, which has been hit by slowing economic growth in China and the waning cryptocurrency fervour.Nvidia said it would pay $125 a share for Mellanox, a 14 per cent premium to the group’s closing share price on Friday. The chipmaker beat Intel in a competitive race to secure Mellanox, which is based in both the US and Israel, said one person involved in the bidding process.Intel is one of the biggest foreign investors in Israel. Just two months ago, the chipmaker announced plans for a $11bn production and research facility in the country. Intel purchased Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based maker of sensors and cameras for computer-assisted and autonomous driving, for $15.3bn in 2017. Mellanox, which reported sales of $1.1bn last year, makes cables and switches that transfer data between servers, storage systems and infrastructure equipment. The technology will complement Nvidia’s graphics processors, which despite their origins in visual effects and computer games, are increasingly used in machine learning systems. “The emergence of [artificial intelligence] and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fuelling skyrocketing demand on the world’s data centres,” said Jensen Huang, the founder and chief executive of Nvidia. “This type of workload is simply too big to fit on any one computer . . . Thousands of computers have to be networked together.”The two companies said the combined entity will serve every big provider of cloud computing services and power more than half the world’s fastest supercomputers, with customers such as Dell, Google owner Alphabet and IBM. Nvidia and Mellanox have partnered for several years, but acquisition talks began only recently, Mr Huang said on a conference call on Monday morning. “We would like to accelerate growth into data centres by being able to architect across both the compute as well as the network fabric,” he said, saying the deal was part of a broader strategy to change Nvidia “from a chip and system-level company to a data centre-scale company”. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2019, and will be funded by cash on Nvidia’s balance sheet. The deal will require regulatory approval in the US, China and other jurisdictions, Nvidia said.Nvidia generated roughly a quarter of its $11.7bn of revenues from its data centre business last year, which was dwarfed by its sales to gamers who want to supercharge their PCs. The company faced a turbulent end to 2018 as its gaming division’s sales slid, driven in large part by a slump in sales of graphics cards to cryptocurrency miners. Nvidia has said it expects return to growth in its core gaming business in the quarter ending in July, but has warned of limited visibility among cloud computing clients.Executives warned investors and analysts earlier this year that its total revenues in 2019 would be flat or decline. Shares of the California-based company have declined 48 per cent from a record high hit last October. Mellanox competes primarily with Intel in the market for a specialised form of networking technology designed for high-end servers and supercomputers, called InfiniBand. The InfiniBand standard was originally developed in the late 1990s during the dotcom boom, but adoption stagnated after the bubble burst. Mellanox also sells Ethernet networking technology, which is more widely used across PCs and data centres. The $12bn-a-year high-performance computing market caters primarily to clients in bio-sciences, aviation, defence, government and academic research. Hyperion Research, which tracks the HPC market, predicts the HPC market to grow to around $20bn by 2022.“Where compute starts and networking starts and ends is going to become harder to see,” Mr Huang said. “The entire data centre becomes one giant compute engine.”The transaction is a win for activist investor Starboard Value, which had bought more than a tenth of Mellanox and called for the company to explore a deal to bolster its share price. The activist sold some of its position after Mellanox last year agreed to add new directors to its board, but it remains the company’s largest stockholder, according to data provider Refinitiv.Mark Lipacis, an analyst with investment bank Jefferies, said he viewed the takeover “favourably” for Nvidia, writing that Mellanox technology was “uncorking the bandwidth bottleneck between large amounts of data and the processors that process them”.Nvidia shares rose 1 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday to $152. Mellanox gained 9 per cent to $118.93. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Nvidia while Jones Day served as legal counsel. Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase advised Mellanox and law firms Latham & Watkins and Herzog Fox & Neeman offered legal advice to the company.

9;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Nvidia offers promise of recovery later this year;Shares rise 7% as chipmaker outlines better outlook after near-term slump;Nvidia’s shares bounced more than 7 per cent in extended trading on Thursday after the US chipmaker gave its first guidance about the direction of its business since a slump that dented revenues and earnings late last year.Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive, gave investors an upbeat prediction of a rebound in the second half of this year for Nvidia, which sells to the gaming industry and datacentres, even though he was cautious on the company’s prospects in the short term.For the current quarter, which runs to the end of April, Nvidia said it expected revenues of $2.2bn. Analysts had been forecasting revenues of $2.41bn, implying that investors were expecting the chipmaker to see a return of consecutive quarter growth after a sharp downturn. In the event, Nvidia said the inventory overhang weighing on its business would continue until the end of the quarter, delaying any recovery.The computing needs of Earth were certainly not satisfied with what was shipped in the last quarterHowever, it also pointed to a rebound later in its fiscal year, for which it predicted revenues that would be “flat to slightly down” compared with the year just ended. Company analysts had been expecting a bigger drop of about 4 per cent.The chipmaker warned last month that problems in its business had spread beyond the hit it took from the slump in cryptocurrency markets, which choked off demand for servers embedded with its graphics processing units.It blamed “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions”, particularly in China, for weak demand for its gaming chips, and said that datacentre customers has grown “more cautious”, leading to a number of expected deals not closing.On Thursday, commenting on the sudden pause in demand from datacentres, where Nvidia’s chips are used in applications such as machine learning, data analytics and data-intensive rendering, Mr Huang said: “It has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth were certainly not satisfied with what was shipped in the last quarter.”He added that the full-year revenue prediction rested more on confidence in a number of secular growth drivers in Nvidia’s business, as well as its strategic position, rather than any hard evidence of a rebound in orders from customers.“In the near term, we have limited visibility. We don’t thing it’s going to remain this way,” he said. “With a little bit of a tail wind we could have a very good year.”The slump that hit Nvidia in the three months to the end of January — the final quarter of its fiscal year — followed nine months of surging growth. Even with a 24 per cent decline in fourth-quarter revenue, full-year revenue still grew by 21 per cent, to $11.7bn. For the latest quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $2.21bn. That was near the figure it predicted when it issued a revenue warning for the quarter two weeks ago. However, some analysts had hoped that the dip would be less severe, and the consensus forecast among analysts was for revenue of $2.32bn.It reported earnings per share of 92 cents, down from $1.78 the year before. Shares in the company were trading at about $163 after the release of the results, having hit a low of about $128 earlier this year.
10;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-02-14T04:12:24Z;Chipmaker Nvidia falls from ranks of tech darlings;Sale of stake by SoftBank’s Vision Fund comes as group hit by end of cryptocurrency boom;When SoftBank’s Vision Fund took a stake of about 5 per cent in chipmaker Nvidia in 2017, it looked like vindication for one of the boldest strategies in the US semiconductor industry.Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, had long argued that the company’s graphics processing units, developed to handle processes such as video gaming, would play a central role in the new era of data-intensive computing.Last month, however, the vision ran out. SoftBank revealed that its fund had dumped its entire Nvidia stake — a holding which was worth more than $7bn at its peak last October, but which had collapsed to only $3.4bn at the end of 2018.Among the questions left by the sale is how deep SoftBank’s vision runs. The giant fund has promoted itself to both investors and the companies it backs as a new type of tech investor, willing to place bigger, long-term bets on the major disruptions caused by technology. But it held the Nvidia stake for less than two years, while also hedging its stake amid last autumn’s tech stock tumble to protect itself from much of the decline.SoftBank did not respond to a question about the length of its investment, which was unusual for the Vision Fund in being in a public company. Last month, it claimed a $2.8bn profit from the holding.For Nvidia, the sale has thrown a spotlight on a difficult transition.$100bnAmount wiped off Nvidia’s stock market value in the final quarter of 2018Two weeks ago, the chipmaker warned that it was likely to report revenues of only $2.2bn in the three months to the end of January, the final quarter of its fiscal year. That is 30 per cent less than Wall Street had been expecting only two months before, and represents a shocking reversal: after growing by 40 per cent in the first nine months of its fiscal year, the change implies that revenues slumped by a quarter in the final three months.The recent hit to highly valued tech stocks — along with the company’s own revenue slump — wiped 57 per cent, or $100bn, off Nvidia’s stock market value in the final quarter of last year before a bounce that erased a fifth of the losses. The question now is whether the pain is over — and whether Nvidia’s long-term prospects are still intact after the massive “reset” in its business.Mr Huang is due to discuss Nvidia’s prospects on a call with analysts on Thursday.The immediate cause of Nvidia’s pain can be traced to the collapse in the cryptocurrency market, where equipment based on its GPUs is used by “miners” to handle the intensive calculations required to authenticate transactions.This dependence, which first led to a warning from Nvidia last November, has turned out to be greater than many investors expected. Some 25 per cent of the company’s sales were probably tied to demand from the cryptocurrency markets, said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in San Francisco.The end of the bitcoin boom has had other knock-on effects. While GPUs were in short supply, companies building machines for gamers submitted orders to Nvidia for far more chips than they needed, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy in Austin.That contributed to a spike in pricing across the GPU market last year: AMD, one of the major producers, reported that its average selling prices in its computing and graphics business had jumped by 55 per cent in the first half of last year, with much of that down to GPUs. With excess inventory likely to take another quarter or two to clear, according to Mr Moorhead, those forces have gone into reverse.Underlying conditions in the gaming market have made the sudden slump more intense. China’s limits on licensing new video games last year was seen as a major blow to demand. At the same time, Nvidia has reported slow take-up from gamers for its latest advance: chips that use so-called “ray tracing” technology, a way of simulating the effect of light hitting virtual objects that is credited with creating far more realistic images.The question is whether this is anything more than a temporary blip. History suggests that gamers will quickly take to chips with ray tracing once developers produce more games that take advantage of it, said Mr Moorhead. Even if demand from the cryptocurrency market does not return, that would still bring renewed growth in Nvidia’s main market.The company warned last month, however, that it is facing a new headwind: weaker demand from data centre customers, who represent one of its biggest hopes for long-term growth.Thanks to their ability to handle large amounts of data, GPUs have been added on as accelerators in machine learning systems. The AI boom has made GPUs a key component in the data centres of cloud computing companies, though a recent slowdown after a capital spending boom has brought a pause in spending. However, Mr Moorhead estimates that only around 5 per cent of data centre servers have AI accelerators, leaving a large market up for grabs.Nvidia once had this market to itself. But there has been a race to develop new chip architectures to handle “inference” — the task of applying machine learning algorithms to new data sets, the largest part of the new AI demand for silicon. Google has already developed its own specialised chips for machine learning, called TPUs, while Facebook and Amazon are both working on developing chips.At the same time, other AI chips will soon become available. Intel, for instance, plans to launch a specialised chip for AI inferencing later this year, based on its CPUs. Start-ups like British company Graphcore represent another new source of competition.The overall effect, said Mr Srivastava, is that Nvidia is facing far greater competition and will no longer have the AI market largely to itself. The stock price needs to fall further to reflect the new realities it is facing, he added.But Mr Huang’s assurances that his company’s long-term prospects are undimmed — whatever the short-term troubles — still resonate with many. “It’s a growing market, and Nvidia has room to grow,” said Mr Moorhead. “Yes, there will be more competition — but the market is going to be so much bigger.”
11;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-02-06T08:46:29Z;SoftBank Vision Fund offloads entire Nvidia stake;Latest blow for US graphics chipmaker which has faced heavy share-price decline;SoftBank’s Vision Fund has sold its entire stake in Nvidia in the latest blow for the California-based chipmaker, shares in which have nearly halved since the end of September.SoftBank said on Wednesday the fund had sold the Nvidia shares, which were valued at ¥398bn ($3.63bn) as of December 31. The fund held about 29m shares prior to the divestment in January, making it the fourth-largest investor in the company, according to Bloomberg data.SoftBank said it had seen a valuation loss of nearly ¥300bn from the investment during the third quarter, although the Japanese conglomerate noted that it had recorded a derivatives gain of almost ¥250bn from investments designed to limit the downside risk of the Nvidia stake. The announcement of the fund’s divestment came in SoftBank’s third-quarter earnings report out on Wednesday, which showed the company’s Vision and Delta investment funds together recorded operating income of ¥808.7bn for the period, up from just ¥236.4bn a year ago.Shares in Nvidia have fallen 48 per cent since late September and in January the Silicon Valley-based graphics chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by half a billion dollars, warning of a slowdown of sales to gamers in China.
12;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-01-29T22:49:38Z;AMD delivers upbeat outlook in wake of chipmaker fears;Shares jump more than 8% despite quarterly sales miss;Advanced Micro Devices swung to a profit in the fourth quarter even as sales missed, but the semiconductor maker’s upbeat full-year revenue outlook was cheered by investors who had come to fear weak performance for chipmakers following warnings from Intel and Nvidia.The California-based company said revenues rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $1.42bn in the three months ended December 29, just shy of analysts’ expectations for $1.45bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.Sales were boosted by its computing and graphics segment, where sales rose 9 per cent driven by sales of its Ryzen processors for desktop PCs. AMD said it “delivered record graphics processing units (GPU) datacentre revenue in the quarter”.The company swung to a profit of $38m, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $19m, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 8 cents a share were in line with forecasts.Last year, AMD benefited from security flaws at rival Intel and earlier this week, the chipmaker delivered a revenue warning, noting its data centre chips business had taken a hit due to a slowdown in China and a pause in capital spending by cloud computing companies. Meanwhile, Nvidia unexpectedly slashed its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by half a billion dollars, partly blaming a slowdown in sales to gamers in China.AMD’s results and outlook by contrast cheered investors. Shares climbed more than 8 per cent in after-hours trade. AMD shares are up 4 per cent year-to-date following a near 80 per cent increase last year. Shares in Nvidia rose 2 per cent, and Intel was fractionally higher following AMD’s earnings report.For the full year, AMD forecast high single-digit percentage growth, that compared with analysts’ expectations for $6.88bn which would represent a 6 per cent increase.“Despite near-term graphics headwinds, 2019 is shaping up to be another exciting year driven by the launch of our broadest and most competitive product portfolio ever,” Lisa Su, chief executive, said.In the current quarter, the company forecast revenue of about $1.25bn, plus or minus $50m — which represents a 24 per cent year-on-year drop. That compared with analyst estimates for $1.47bn. AMD expects the decline to be driven by “lower graphics sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of blockchain-related GPU revenue and lower memory sales”.
13;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-01-29T13:02:01Z;Nvidia: graphic content warning;A shift in Silicon Valley priorities indicates core businesses are under pressure;Nvidia’s fourth-quarter stumble bodes ill for the US tech sector. The chip creator laid the blame at China’s feet. But the surprise cut to revenue guidance marks a shift in Silicon Valley priorities that suggests core businesses are under pressure.Pick any modish technology and chances are Nvidia is involved. Its graphics chips are used in autonomous vehicles, virtual reality headsets, artificial intelligence and cryptocoin mines. Such secular trends helped to power shares from $20 in 2015 to more than $200 last year.The problem is that tech giants are turning their attention away from these side hustles. Other parts of their businesses demand more attention.Apple, for example, has to focus on handset sales, not driverless cars. Facebook, needs higher advertising revenue to combat flattening user growth in the US and Europe. This is not expected to come from VR. In the last earnings call Mark Zuckerberg mentioned Oculus VR just once.Nvidia sales folk are meanwhile working their way through graphics chips left over from the crypto crash.Remember that original guidance for fourth-quarter earnings was already lower than expected at $2.7bn, before Nvidia made the decision to take it down to $2.2bn. Revenue is expected to be about 25 per cent below the same period last year. Hopes that semiconductor stocks found a bottom at the end of 2018 are fading fast.All this would be less worrying if gaming companies, which generate the bulk of Nvidia’s revenue, had shown more interest in the company’s new, more expensive chips. Or if data centres, the highest margin sector, had put in more orders. Instead, gross margin guidance for 2019 has been cut from 62 per cent to 55 per cent.The shares have more than halved since early October. But an enterprise value of $79bn is more than 7 times expected sales. That is higher than Intel and double AMD. Without a Chinese economic rebound that leaves a lot of room left to fall.Lex is seeking a team member to comment daily on US tech, the biggest business story of recent years.

14;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-01-28T19:46:58Z;China warnings from Caterpillar, Nvidia rattle Wall Street;;US stocks faced hefty losses on Monday after warnings of a sluggish Chinese economy rippled across Wall Street.Caterpillar, the maker of construction and mining equipment, issued a weaker earnings outlook than expected for 2019 with sales poised to flatline in China. Nvidia added to investors’ concerns by making a surprise cut to its fourth-quarter revenue guidance, saying demand for gaming chips in the region had deteriorated.Monday’s fresh warnings of trouble in China — just days before US and Chinese officials meet in Washington — gave Wall Street reason to believe that a long-running trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies is taking its toll, both on the Chinese economy and US corporate earnings. Nvidia’s downbeat outlook echoed warnings from other tech giants including Apple, which shocked Wall Street early this month with a rare cut to its revenue forecast, citing slow iPhone sales in China.The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” was sitting more than 2 points higher at 19.53.Morgan Stanley’s chief US equity strategist Michael Wilson advised clients to “dismount” from the bull market amid continued volatility and mixed signals from the initial batch of fourth-quarter earnings.“We’ve gotten close enough on a bull that is becoming increasingly dangerous and we struggle to see the upside in hanging on just to see how long we can,” Mr Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “We think it is better to hop off now and rest up for the next rodeo.”Technology and industrial shares were among the worst performers in the S&P 500, which tumbled as much as 1.5 per cent. The benchmark index was down 1 per cent in midday trading amid a 1.8 per cent decline for the tech sector. Industrials fell 1.3 per cent, while healthcare dipped 1.4 per cent and communication services fell 1.4 per cent.Energy shares also retreated, down 1.4 per cent, as the worsening outlook for China renewed concerns that a slowdown could hit oil demand. West Texas Intermediate lost 3.3 per cent to trade at $51.91 a barrel. Brent crude slipped 2.9 per cent to $59.85 a barrel.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.1 per cent. Shares in Caterpillar, by far the worst performer in the Dow, sank 9 per cent to set a pace toward its worst single-day drop since August 2011.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.3 per cent, battered by falling shares of semiconductor groups. Nvidia was down 15.5 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices declined 7 per cent, while shares of Intel and Texas Instruments also saw red.Other companies with exposure to China also felt pressure on Monday. Shares of Boeing, MGM Resorts, smartphone glass maker Corning, auto parts supplier BorgWarner and engine builder Cummins were in negative territory.The US dollar softened, with the DXY index down 0.1 per cent at 95.711.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 1.2 basis points to 2.7386, while that on the two-year note declined 1 basis point to 2.5897.
15;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-01-28T16:24:33Z;Nvidia shares tumble on sharp cut to revenue forecasts;Graphics chipmaker suffers ‘extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter’;Nvidia sent fresh tremors through the semiconductor sector on Monday after the graphics chipmaker unexpectedly cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by half a billion dollars, news that sent its shares tumbling nearly 16 per cent in early trading.The Silicon Valley-based company’s warning of a slowdown in sales to gamers in China and among its data centre customers follows similar shocks from Apple and Intel. Nvidia’s powerful graphics chips for PCs are primarily used for playing video games, adding artificial intelligence capabilities to cloud computing systems and autonomous cars, and processing the complex transactions that create cryptocurrencies. Demand for its chips was hit by last year’s slump in the price of bitcoin, Ether, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies, but Monday’s update points to deeper problems at the chipmaker. Nvidia had disappointed the market in November with a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter outlook, which it blamed at the time on the “crypto hangover” that was causing a glut of unsold graphics chips. On Monday, it said business was also being hit by “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China” in its core gaming business, and weaker-than-expected sales of its higher-end data centre products.Data centres made up around 25 per cent of Nvidia’s overall revenues in the third quarter of last year but the company said several deals failed to close at the end of 2018 “as customers shifted to a more cautious approach”. Last week, rival Intel also blamed a pause in capital spending by cloud computing companies for a revenue shortfall that it said would continue for the first half of 2019. “Q4 was an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter,” said chief executive Jensen Huang. As a result, Nvidia now expects revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter ending on January 27 to come in at $2.2bn, plus or minus 2 per cent, down from the $2.7bn, plus or minus 2 per cent range it gave just two months ago. It also said quarterly gross margin would be hit by $120m in charges related to “current market conditions”. Nvidia’s warning came just hours after Japan Display warned of a “harsh” earnings impact from the US-China trade war and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The comments — coming after Apple’s revenue warning this month, which blamed China for weak iPhone sales— are also likely to cast a pall over tech earnings, which kick into high gear this week. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 5.8 per cent at the open on Monday while Intel and Texas Instruments both dropped 1.9 per cent. Micron Technology fell 2.9 per cent and Broadcom was 2.4 per cent lower. The wider Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 3.8 per cent. Nvidia is due to report its fourth-quarter results on February 14.Including Monday’s decline, shares in the company are down more than 53 per cent since early October, leaving it with a market value of about $82bn.
16;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2019-01-28T15:09:14Z;Wall Street knocked by company warnings on China in early trade;;Concerns about the impact of slowing economic growth in China on corporate earnings sent a shudder through Wall Street on Monday, sending stocks more than 1 per cent lower in early trade.Weaker than expected earnings and a “modest” 2019 outlook from earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar, regarded by investors as a proxy for global growth, was followed up by chipmaker Nvidia cutting its fourth-quarter sales guidance.Caterpillar said it expected no growth in sales in China this year and that it experienced “lower demand” there in the December quarter, while Nvidia said its business was being hit by “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly China”.Those warnings come in the wake of a warning from a major Apple supplier, Japan Display, which said on Monday it expected a “harsh” earnings impact from the US-China trade war and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. That only served to heighten concerns about the iPhone maker ahead of its quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon.The S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent within the first half-hour of trade on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which counts Caterpillar and Apple as major components, was down 1.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7 per cent as chipmakers and tech stocks dropped.Caterpillar shares were down 8.3 per cent and facing their biggest one-day drop since August 2011, while Nvidia dropped 16.1 per cent for its biggest drop since November. The pair were the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this morning.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, a broad measure of US-listed chipmakers, was down 2.9 per cent.Treasuries erased their losses from earlier in the day, as yields turned lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was now down 1.6 basis points at 2.735 per cent.
17;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-12-18T07:15:24Z;Microsoft and BMW invest in UK chipmaker Graphcore;New fundraising round values start-up at $1.5bn;The UK-based chipmaker Graphcore has raised $200m in a new funding round from investors including Microsoft and BMW, valuing the company at $1.5bn. The financing will accelerate Graphcore’s ambitions to challenge the likes of Nvidia, Intel and Google to become the silicon backbone of artificial intelligence applications. The latest round, which was led by European investment funds Atomico and Sofina, comes after Graphcore began shipping its processors to its first customers earlier this year. The company plans to use the funding to increase production. While its business remains at an early stage, Graphcore has received endorsements from AI experts Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google’s DeepMind, and Zoubin Ghahramani, chief scientist at Uber, who are both investors.The company was founded in Bristol in 2016 by semiconductor industry veterans Nigel Toon and Simon Knowles. Since its last financing a year ago, its staff has increased from about 75 to about 200, with offices opening in Silicon Valley, Beijing and soon Taiwan. “We have built the world’s most complex processor,” said Mr Toon, “designed from the ground up to do machine intelligence applications.” Its new valuation of $1.5bn, before including the new capital raised, makes Graphcore the latest UK-based “unicorn” to be minted this year, alongside cyber security group Darktrace and fintech start-ups Monzo and Revolut. Unicorns are private companies valued at more than $1bn.“The versatility of Graphcore’s intelligence processing unit — which supports multiple machine learning techniques with high efficiency — is well-suited for a wide variety of applications from intelligent voice assistants to self-driving vehicles,” said Tobias Jahn, principal at BMW i Ventures, the carmaker’s venture capital arm. London-based Merian Global Investors, which was formerly known as Old Mutual Global Investors, was also among the new investors in the latest Graphcore funding round. Existing investors including Dell, Samsung, Sequoia Capital, Amadeus Capital and Draper Esprit also participated. The field for chips designed specifically for machine learning and AI is becoming more competitive. Alongside established chipmakers such as Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel, tech groups including Google, Apple, Facebook and Huawei have been developing their own silicon dedicated to AI, while dozens of start-ups such as Cerebras and Wave Computing have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for similar ventures. “Most in the start-up space are trying to build a slightly better graphics processing unit,” said Mr Toon. “What you can do with a GPU does not a fully intelligent machine make. What we’ve done is build a completely new processor that is massively more parallel,” meaning it can work on more tasks simultaneously, in contrast to more traditional serial or sequential processing.Graphcore said its chips were suitable for a range of applications, from cloud computing and drug discovery to self-driving cars and speech recognition. Because its processing units can be used for both the training and deployment of machine learning systems, they were “much more efficient”, Mr Toon said, while still selling its hardware at a similar price to Nvidia’s GPUs. Goldman Sachs advised Graphcore on the financing.
18;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Nvidia share price reflects ups and downs of artificial intelligence;;Nvidia’s share price over the past five years is a good representation of the frenzy about artificial intelligence that has occurred over the same period. From the start of 2014 until September, Nvidia’s price rose by more than 1,500 per cent. Since then, its shares have roughly halved in value.The company has done nothing wrong. Nvidia produces capable graphics-based chips (GPUs) and makes good margins doing so. It has taken its technology and applied it creatively to AI, or machine-learning, problems. It was rather over-optimistic about reducing its inventory of older chip designs and the prospective sales of its new designs. Nothing scandalous or shocking, though.Along with being an actual company, however, Nvidia became the symbol of the AI age.The crash in the stock is the investment world’s way of accepting what data scientists and engineers have been saying for months or even years: machine learning is useful but it does not replace the human mind. Or even a lot of animal or insect minds, for that matter.This is normal. Machine vision, for example, became much better in the mid-1980s, not least because there was a new generation of microprocessors that made the techniques more accessible for industrial applications such as circuit-board inspection. Then progress slowed to a walk. AI progress is like that: rapid development followed by years of more sober and incremental work.The most recent boom in machine learning (and budgets for machine learning) was brought about by a confluence of theoretical, engineering and commercial advances.The key theoretical advances were in “deep learning” in neural networks, which arguably had started with a 1986 paper on “backpropagation” by Geoffrey Hinton of the University of Toronto. The algorithms based on backpropagation became more implementable after 2012.This is about organising layers of artificial neurons to perform a sort of self-diagnosis of errors in series of inferences, allowing them to correct the errors by testing conclusions against a training set of inputs (such as images) and labelled outputs (names for types of images). The machines could learn over time to recognise a Russian tank, a cat or a hot dog.Mind you, a lot of training data are necessary to make this process work. Pictures of hot dogs and “not hot dogs”, for example. Or the endless translations produced by the EU of documents in member countries’ native languages.The key engineering advance was the wide availability of fast semiconductor graphics accelerator chips, such as those made by Nvidia. The company had been a niche producer of graphics cards for gamers before it became the giant of AI devices and bitcoin miners.Nvidia’s millions of gamers had a visceral need for ever faster and more detailed renderings of things being blown up or sliced to pieces.Along with the elaborated backpropagation algorithms and fast, cheap GPUs, machine-learning practitioners also began to have the much larger and well annotated data sets generated by social media and search companies. Other corporations and government organisations with huge piles of data realised machine learning was another way to realise the commercial value of their information.So the AI machine-learning bubble started to inflate. From the beginning, though, the actual data scientists tried to point out the limits of the technology.One limit, for example, is in the interpretability of machine learning’s results. Machine learning is more of a black box than other sorts of computation. It is not easy to reverse the chains of inference to understand how the machine makes its decisions.The fuzziness of the inference process makes it difficult to justify using a machine learning program’s output as a determinate result. You may have noticed this with the machine learning programs that banks use to detect credit card fraud. There are a lot of false positives.Unlike natural intelligence, machine learning has a hard time working with thin data sets. This is not a problem with, say, analysing chess or go strategies, because the program can run millions of games to create its own training set. It is harder when you have changing traffic and weather, not to mention how shadows will change over a day or season — and your machine learning program is trying to drive your car.That is the sort of problem where humans can make decisions (not always right) based on thin data. So autonomous self-driving cars, one of the biggest sources of gas for the AI bubble, are further off than we might have hoped.And the financial world, always eager to buy a box that will own the world, does not bring enough data to the game. Price series may look data intense to the business graduate, but they are as nothing compared to video images. Also, more rapid-fire trading creates more data points, but most of the data added is noise rather than information.True artificial intelligence will require a lot more science. That probably means breakthroughs in understanding the processes of animal and human minds.
19;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-11-17T00:58:53Z;Nasdaq contains losses as Nvidia woes hit chipmakers;Group’s unexpectedly weak sales guidance adds to fears electronics demand could slow;Another spate of gloomy outlook statements by computer chipmakers has cast renewed doubts on the strength of the electronics market, as shares in Nintendo and its Switch graphics unit supplier Nvidia both plunged.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 1 per cent at the market’s open on Friday as unexpectedly weak sales guidance from Nvidia knocked the wider semiconductor sector and further fuelled concerns that chip demand could be set for a slowdown. By the end of the day the Nasdaq had recovered most of the losses but was 0.15 per cent lower at 7,247.87 points.Shares in Nvidia, the chip giant with a $123bn market capitalisation, suffered their worst day in years, slumping by more than 19 per cent, to eventually end the day 18.8 per cent lower at $164.43. The Silicon Valley-based company said on Thursday night that a “crypto hangover” was causing a glut of unsold graphics chips, which before the rise of bitcoin had been primarily used by video gamers. As a result, revenues in the next quarter will be about a fifth lower than what the market had forecast.The company’s powerful processors for PCs are ideally suited for handling the complex transactions that create cryptocurrencies. But demand for these chips has evaporated as a sell-off in digital currencies such as bitcoin, Ether and XRP prompted a drop-off in cryptocurrency mining activities.Investors’ panic on Friday reflected fears that crypto had been providing a far bigger boost to Nvidia’s business than investors — or perhaps even its executives — had realised, exacerbating the impact of its subsequent declines. “Simply put, the company failed to have an accurate pulse on their business,” said Gene Munster, a tech investor at Loup Ventures. Analysts say the glut could take several months to clear. “This is surely a setback. And I wish we had seen it earlier,” said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, on a conference call. The forecast points to a 30 per cent decline in gaming revenues, its largest business unit, in the current quarter. Nvidia’s results also sparked concerns about Nintendo’s prospects for holiday console sales. In heavy trading in Tokyo, Nintendo stock fell 9 per cent, its biggest drop in more than two years. Nvidia said it expected “minimal” fourth-quarter sales of its Tegra chips, which are primarily used in Nintendo’s Switch console, though it blamed this on “normal seasonal build cycle” as manufacturers ramp up production ahead of the holidays.Nonetheless, the warnings from Nvidia will do little to calm investors who were already nervous about the prospects for sales of smartphones and other electronics ahead of next week’s Black Friday shopping frenzy and in the run-up to Christmas. Tech stocks have been hammered by concerns over softening demand for iPhones, with several of Apple’s suppliers pointing to order cuts. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, already down 12 per cent since early September, fell another 2 per cent early on Friday but recovered some of its losses to end the day down 1.2 per cent. Within this, Advanced Micro Devices — which competes closely with Nvidia on graphics chips — fell 6 per cent at the start of trading yet bounced back slightly to end the day 3.9 per cent lower, while Micron Technology closed 1.2 per cent lower.Applied Materials, a chip equipment maker, did little to lift sentiment for the semiconductor sector after it too issued a disappointing forecast on Thursday night. Applied Materials blamed export restrictions in China, most likely a reference to the recent US ban on Fujian, for its guidance of a 12 per cent drop in sales.Its shares had been as much as 9 per cent lower ahead of the opening bell, though they pared their losses throughout Friday to be up 1.1 per cent at the close.
20;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-11-16T03:37:16Z;Nvidia: tales from the crypto;Fall in cryptocurrency prices leaves chipmaker with inventory overload;Nvidia backers like to argue that the chipmaker deserves to replace Netflix as the N in the big, fast-growing Faang group of tech stocks. Not only is it a leader in graphics chips used for gaming but its products power some of the most transformational developments in computing, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The trouble with signing up to the hottest trends is being left out of pocket when the hype dies down.Cryptocurrency miner demand for Nvidia chips raised revenue last year. But the decision to stock up on the cards was a bad one. As prices for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin fell, so did demand.Nvidia’s core gaming unit, which sold the cards used for crypto-mining, still makes up the bulk of revenue. The drop in demand means total revenue for the third quarter looks disappointing at $3.8bn. The 21 per cent increase on last year is puny against the usual 50 per cent plus quarterly growth that has powered the stock price.More worrying is a 7 per cent year-on-year fall in revenue forecast for the next quarter. If correct it will mark the company’s first revenue decline in more than five years.Nvidia thinks its “crypto hangover” will be temporary — and it will. New gaming chips released recently will find a bigger audience next year. It is still investing heavily in R&D too — which should mean new revenue streams to come. Operating expenses are up nearly 30 per cent on last year.A sell-off since October along with the rest of the tech sector, plus the after hours share price fall means Nvidia’s stock is trading at about 20 times expected earnings. That is still more than Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor company, which trades at 11 times forecast earnings. The long-term potential for growth is unchanged. Nvidia has more exciting opportunities than its peers.But it is going to take longer than one rough quarter for inventory to go back to normal. If crypto prices stay low then miners may well try to sell their own chips. Even at lower prices, Nvidia’s inventory backlog is going to prove hard to shift in just three months.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

21;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-11-15T22:13:39Z;Nvidia shares plunge as bitcoin boost fades;Chipmaker blames weak revenue forecast on lower demand from cryptocurrency miners;Nvidia shares fell sharply late on Thursday after the company’s revenue forecast missed expectations, with the chipmaker’s chief executive Jensen Huang blaming a “crypto hangover” for mounting stockpiles of unsold inventory. The company expects to record revenue of $2.7bn in the current quarter, plus or minus 2 per cent. Wall Street analysts polled by Refinitiv were projecting revenue of $3.4bn. Analysts said the outlook pointed to a revenue drop of as much as 30 per cent in Nvidia’s PC gaming business, it largest division, which also supplies chips for cryptocurrencies.In the third quarter ending October 28, Nvidia booked revenue of $3.18bn, up 21 per cent year-over-year, but missing a consensus estimate of $3.24bn.Mr Huang said in a statement that the company’s “near-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the cryptocurrency boom, which will be corrected”. In a regulatory filing, Nvidia noted that its bottom line took a $57m hit from charges related to prior architecture components and chips, caused by a sharp decline in cryptocurrency mining demand.This is surely a setback. And I wish we had seen it earlierAs it launched a new range of “Turing” processors aimed at high-end gamers, supplies of its previous-generation chips went unsold in retailers and at PC vendors, he told analysts on a conference call. “I think the pricing [reductions] just took longer than we expected and the [sales] volume increase took longer than we expected,” Mr Huang said, adding that some 12 weeks’ worth of inventory remained unsold. “I’m hopeful now that pricing has stabilised that customers will come back and buy.” Nvidia’s powerful graphics chips for PCs are primarily used for either video games or processing the complex transactions that create cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Nvidia’s warning comes amid a fresh slump in the price of bitcoin, Ether, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies this week. Mr Huang admitted that Nvidia was slow to respond to the changing market conditions but has now stopped supplying more chips into the retail channel until existing stock is sold down. “This is surely a setback. And I wish we had seen it earlier,” he said — but he ultimately blamed the market for the issues. “In the final analysis, I’m not sure what we would have done differently.”The sales slump puts more pressure on Nvidia to grow in other areas, such as cloud computing or the automotive sector, where customers use its chips in machine learning systems.Sales generated by Nvidia’s data centre chips unit grew to $792m from $501m, below a forecast of $820m, according to FactSet. Nvidia said it earned $1.23bn, or $1.97 per share, in the most recent quarter, compared with $838m, or $1.33 per share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings rose to $1.84 a share from $1.33 a share. Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings per share of $1.71.Nvidia shares tumbled more than 16 per cent in after-hours trading.
22;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Nvidia drops as Q3 guidance falls short of forecasts;;Nvidia reported strong year-on-year revenue and profit growth in its second quarter thanks to its gaming and data centre businesses, but shares sank in after-hours trade as the graphics chip maker’s guidance for the current quarter fell short of market expectations.The company’s processors are powering many of the hottest global trends in technology, ranging from autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence to PC gaming.Despite that, the company’s guidance for the third quarter, which will end in October, came in below what the market was expecting. Nvidia expects to report revenue of $3.25bn, plus or minus 2 per cent, compared with the median forecast of $3.34bn among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The company’s expects its gross margin to shrink again in the current three month period, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, to 62.6 per cent, down from 64.7 per cent at the start of this year.Revenue and profit growth in the second quarter also cooled from the start of the year.In the three months ended July 29, Nvidia reported revenue of $3.12bn, up 40 per cent from a year ago but down 3 per cent from the previous quarter. This roughly met market expectations.By division, Nvidia’s gaming division, which makes up nearly 60 per cent of total group sales, saw revenue rise 52 per cent from a year ago to $1.8bn, while the company’s fastest pace of growth came from its data centre unit, where revenue was up 83 per cent to $760m.Net income in the second quarter rose 89 per cent from a year earlier to $1.1bn, or $1.76 a diluted share, which was 10 cents a share better than analysts expected, but down 11 per cent from the first quarter.Nvidia shares were down 5 per cent in after-hours trade on Thursday. The stock has still been a strong performer in 2018, with shares up 33 per cent year to date as of the close of trading on Thursday.
23;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-07-29T15:49:34Z;The US chip industry starts to wake up to new competitive reality;Demise of Moore’s Law presages a shift in approach to key tech sector;The imminent death of Moore’s Law, which describes the main force behind long-running performance improvements in semiconductors, has frequently been predicted.But according to Bill Chappell, chief microelectronics expert at Darpa, the US defence department’s research arm, the idea “died a decade ago”.The US chip industry is now starting to face up to an uncomfortable reality. The dependable gains in chip performance that have long underpinned the industry’s growth — and supplied the computing power to open up new tech markets — have been weakening for some time.Erica Fuchs, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, said this had been apparent since 2004. Speaking at a Darpa conference in San Francisco last week, she pointed out that chip companies had also been struggling with lower returns from their R&D.“The revenue is not keeping pace with the increasing investment they’re having to put in,” she said.The 60-year-old US chip industry has sailed through this ominous period with barely a blink. A cyclical boom and the rise of new markets for silicon, from driverless cars to machine learning, have lifted the sector’s sales and led to a doubling of the Philadelphia semiconductor index since the start of 2016. That compares with a 38 per cent gain for the S&P 500.But the self-confidence of an industry that has been one of the key forces behind US tech leadership is showing signs of cracking.A report from a presidential advisory group issued early last year spelt out the dangers. Along with “fundamental technological limits” that were starting to slow innovation, the industry leaders behind the report warned of “a concerted push by China to remake the market in its favour”, using an industrial policy backed by massive government funding in a way that “threatens the competitiveness of US industry”.It is against that background that Darpa — best known for research that contributed to breakthroughs such the internet and self-driving cars — last week announced its backing for a set of research projects to help shape the long-term direction of the industry.The grants, to a wide range of academic and corporate researchers, are part of a $1.5bn push by the agency, its first large-scale involvement in chips in nearly four decades. The intervention is needed because the industry is at an “inflection point” where it needs to shift its sights to longer term forces, said Mr Chappell.The attention looks long overdue. The industry’s main trade body proposed a $600m budget for long-range research more than a decade ago, said Prof Fuchs. The amount eventually committed: $20m.The research projects Darpa is backing cover chip architecture, new materials and design, and offer a glimpse of the technologies that could drive growth a decade from now. They also point to potentially significant shifts in the shape of the chip industry as the old certainties of operating under Moore’s Law fall away.In the realm of chip architecture, for instance, the industry is facing diminishing returns from general-purpose chips that have been the main workhorses of the digital age, for example Intel’s CPUs. While they can deliver unmatched computing power for the price, they cannot be optimised for particular tasks. The future is more heterogeneous, said Mike Mayberry, head of research at Intel.One focus of Darpa’s research is new chip architectures that combine both power and flexibility. This includes “software-defined hardware”, or chips that can be reprogrammed on the fly — an extension of today’s field-programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits that can be adjusted after they are manufactured and provide a limited amount of flexibility.The rise of machine learning already offers an early glimpse of what this new world would look like, said Mr Chappell. Demand for specialised chips capable of handling the huge volumes of data needed to train deep learning systems that are used in artificial intelligence has brought a new lease of life for Nvidia, whose graphic processing units were originally designed to handle video. It has also opened a door for Google, which has come up with a big-data chip design of its own known as the TPU. Intel, meanwhile, is using FPGAs to enhance the performance of its CPUs for machine learning — an approach Microsoft has adopted for Project Brainwave, its bid to bring deeper AI capability to its data centres.The rise of “domain-specific architectures” like these represents the most important force shaping the chip industry, according to John Hennessy, chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, and a hardware designer for much of his life.This could set a pattern in other emerging computing markets. For instance, it is possible to imagine a new form of processor optimised specifically for personal robots that need to operate in the physical world alongside people, said Mr Mayberry.This trend could bode well for companies such as Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm. It points to a potential future where large “horizontal” chip companies, whose products can be applied across many fields, would continue to hold sway in more specialised computing domains, said Mr Chappell.Other long-term technology trends, however, could open the way for newer competitors and bring more disruptive change.In materials, Darpa is backing research into ways of integrating specialised components that are already added to today’s chips to enhance their performance in different ways. This is largely intended to overcome a fundamental bottleneck: the need to shuttle information from the memory component of a chip to the logic processor and back, something that slows performance particularly in applications that involve very large amounts of data. One result, according to Darpa, could be a new hardware design that turns the old approach on its head and moves processing power to where the data are stored — a clear sign of the increasingly data-centric nature of modern computing.In the field of chip design, meanwhile, Darpa is backing new techniques to bring down costs through greater automation, while breaking design tasks into smaller units.Together, trends like this point to a future where new entrants could shape specialised chip designs. This could give companies like Facebook and Amazon more control over the delivery of services, from owning the data all the way through to designing the specialised silicon, said Mr Chappell.Breaking down design and manufacturing into smaller components could also make it economic for much smaller companies to become involved, reversing a trend that has seen the industry consolidate into a small handful of global powers. Mr Chappell likens this to the craft brewing industry, where start-ups and companies with an interest in “vertical” markets (like medical imaging) design and produce smaller batches of chips.It is not surprising that such a future would appeal to defence department researchers. The US military has come to rely on its ability to commission relatively small numbers of highly optimised chips, said Mr Mayberry. The Pentagon’s global technological lead, as well as that of the US chip industry, could be on the line.The chip industry rule of thumb, spelt out in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, predicted roughly a doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every two years. The term has since been stretched to include other forces that affect chip performance, such as the steady improvement in power efficiency known as Dennard scaling, and now encapsulates the overall price-performance gains in chips.A slowdown in this benign force has already caused a notable deficit in the tech world, according to John Hennessy, chairman of Alphabet.Falling below the exponential growth curve of Moore’s Law over the past decade has left the density of transistors on today’s chips a factor of ten behind where it would otherwise be, he says. That represents a significant loss of performance, even if transistor densities have improved 1m-fold over the past 40 years.Mr Chappell, meanwhile, argues that the main force behind the fall-off has been economic rather than technical. The huge upfront design costs for new chips and the expense of fitting out the “fabs” needed to make them have eaten into the industry’s customary price-performance gains for all but the highest-volume products, he says.
24;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-06-22T02:30:23Z;Intel faces big challenges as Krzanich exits after affair;Ouster over relationship with staffer comes as manufacturing lead is under threat;When Brian Krzanich took over the top job at Intel, he had a simple message. The US chipmaker was the clear leader in the world’s most demanding manufacturing industry. After a career of more than 30 years spent in operations, the new chief executive vowed to double down on a lead that he saw as Intel’s main competitive advantage.Five years on, however, that manufacturing leadership has come into question for the first time since Intel rose to dominate the semiconductor industry in the 1980s — and Mr Krzanich is out.The two are completely unrelated, if the company is to be believed. Mr Krzanich had a consensual relationship with an unnamed Intel employee, contravening a policy in place since 2011 that forbids managers from “fraternising” — the company’s word — with anyone who either directly or indirectly reports to them.Corporate governance experts backed the company’s zero-tolerance policy on Thursday, supporting the board’s decision to apply its ethical rules at all levels of the company, regardless of rank.But the slip in manufacturing that has occurred on Mr Krzanich’s watch has left his successor with a headache. Intel has led the chip industry for years by being the first company to reach each new generation of microprocessor technology, shrinking the feature size on its chips faster than the competition. That enabled it to pack more processing power into less space and surf the wave of Moore’s Law — the prediction, by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, that chips would get progressively smaller and more powerful.The extent of the slip was evident earlier this year, when Intel warned that its first 10 nanometre chips — originally due by the end of 2016 — would not hit volume production until late in 2019. Mr Krzanich once predicted that Intel’s old two-year cadence for shrinking chip feature sizes would probably stretch out another six months as it hit new challenges manufacturing at such minute scale. But by the time its 10nm chips reach the market, the gap will have widened to more than five years.“Intel was on a roll for years — in hindsight, they took too much risk” by setting over-ambitious manufacturing goals, said Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.The company’s slip has contributed to the new lease of life being enjoyed by AMD, the perennial also-ran in a PC and server chip market dominated Intel. By outsourcing its manufacturing to TSMC, a Taiwanese group that makes chips on order for outside groups, AMD may stand to take a slice out of its bigger rival’s market share in the data centre market. Intel’s latest manufacturing headaches have contributed to a 60 per cent bounce in AMD’s shares since April.That helps to account for the lack of consternation on Wall Street at the news of Mr Krzanich’s abrupt departure. He had been credited with pushing the company faster beyond the mature PC market, partly through acquisitions. These included the $16.7bn purchase of Altera, whose products are used in artificial intelligence, and the $15.3bn acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli driverless technology company.Intel was on a roll for years — in hindsight, they took too much riskBut while this has given it a stake in more of the industry’s most promising growth markets — including 5G mobile communications, driverless cars, machine learning and the internet of things — Intel still has a long way to go to challenge companies such as Nvidia in AI and Qualcomm in mobile.Analysts at Barclays summed up the mood. In a note to investors on Thursday, they said that the departure, though unplanned, could still be a “a good transition point” for Intel as it looks to hone its position in the next giant chip markets, working out where to push harder and where to retreat.“I don’t think all of these have to hit — but some of them do,” said Mr Moorhead.Despite the manufacturing delays, however, Mr Krzanich has left Intel in robust financial health. The company is enjoying strong growth from the data centre market — where its chip architecture, originally created for PCs, is also the foundation for most servers. Intel combined news of its CEO’s ouster with a bullish forecast for second-quarter earnings, lessening some of the shock.Stronger cost discipline under Bob Swan, brought in as chief financial officer from eBay in 2016, has also helped. That has contributed a strong rally in Intel’s shares since last autumn, after a period in which the company’s investors had missed out on a powerful stock price boom for other chip companies. Mr Swan was named interim CEO on Thursday.Intel said it would look beyond the company for its next CEO, as well as consider internal candidates, potentially pointing to the first outside leader in its 50-year history. The large number of bets on new markets placed by Mr Krzanich makes it unlikely the company will turn outside for a visionary leader to set a new direction, said Mr Moorhead. The challenge now is to refine its current strategy, not pick an entirely new one. That is a job better suited an insider, he said.Coming soon after extensive executive changes set in motion by Mr Krzanich, however, the search for a successor has come at an inconvenient time.The list of internal candidates is headed by executives such as Navin Shenoy, who was appointed head of the company’s important data centre group only last year, and Venkata Renduchintala, who joined three years ago from Qualcomm and is now head of the PC group and chief engineering officer.If Intel’s board follows through on its usual practice of promoting from within, one of these two could soon become the inheritor of one of the chip industry’s most famous crowns.
25;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-06-01T22:28:02Z;Tech stocks hit record highs as trade war fears bite;Gains in 2018 for NYSE Fang+ index at 26% as investors view sector as less susceptible;The shares of Amazon, Netflix and other companies known as Faangs have rallied to fresh highs as the focus of investors has shifted from concerns about internet privacy and heightened regulation in the tech sector to worries about trade tariffs.Transatlantic trade tensions escalated on Friday as the EU vowed to respond to US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium with measures of its own, while leaders from Canada and Mexico also prepared retaliatory duties.“The trade war discussion is resulting in folks hiding in Faang stocks,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.The NYSE Fang+ index rose 2.5 per cent to a new high on Friday, taking the year-to-date gain to 26 per cent. The group originally given the moniker included Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, formerly known as Google, but has since expanded to include Apple. The index also includes other high-profile tech companies such as Twitter, Nvidia and Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Apple closed at record highs on Friday.The outsized performance stands in contrast to the S&P 500, which is up little more than 2 per cent in 2018 and failed to test its January high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has added 9.4 per cent this year and sits about 1 per cent below its March high.“The feeling is let’s go with what is working and what has been working is Faangs,” Mr Arone added. “We are uncertain as to what the future holds as it relates to tariffs and investors cannot determine the impact on industrials and other sectors like steel and aluminium because of all the back and forth.”JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, agreed. “Certain sectors are more susceptible than others [to trade tension] and you go to the ones that are less susceptible,” he said. “Tech seems to be less susceptible — right now.”Investors are again embracing tech stocks after a sharp sell-off in March when privacy concerns translated into fears that regulators would step up oversight of these groups or even that they had become powerful enough to be broken up.Facebook and other shares came under pressure after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company employed by Mr Trump’s presidential campaign, mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users.Tech stocks on Friday got an added boost from news that Fiat Chrysler planned to invest €9bn into new electric models.Also on Friday, UBS analysts raised their price target on Apple to $210 from $190.

Shares in the world’s second-largest memory chipmaker rose more than 5 per cent to Won94,000, their highest since 2001. Although the stock remained well off the Won810,000, which it touched in 1999. Reuters reported that South Korean chipmaker had started a new supply deal with NVIDIA, which would boost sales of higher-value chips.The broader semiconductor segment was mostly positive across Asia. Samsung Electronics, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was up 3 per cent while the biggest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co rose 0.7 per cent and UMC was up 0.6 per cent.
27;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Nvidia revenues boosted by data centres, gamers;;Revenues at graphics chipmaker Nvidia surged by 66 per cent in its first quarter to $3.2bn, surpassing analysts’ forecasts thanks to strong growth from customers in both data centres and video gamers.Nvidia’s processors are powering many of Silicon Valley’s hottest trends, from artificial intelligence and autonomous cars to PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining.Gaming, its largest market, grew by 68 per cent to $1.7bn, thanks to players’ enthusiasm for titles in the popular “battle royale” genre, such as Player Unknown: Battlegrounds and Fortnite, as well as esports.Datacentre revenues — where it counts cloud computing providers such as Amazon and Microsoft as customers — reached $701m, up 71 per cent.Profits for its fiscal first quarter leapt by 145 per cent year-on-year, with net income at $1.2bn. Earnings per share also beat Wall Street estimates at $2.05.Nvidia’s shares had traded lower earlier this year over fears that it would be caught up in the wildly fluctuating demand for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.However, the stock had rallied strongly in the last two weeks, following good results from rival chipmaker AMD. Nvidia closed on Thursday at a new all-time high of $260.13, valuing the Silicon Valley company at $157.9bn.When Nvidia reported its results on Thursday, the stock fell by 2 per cent after-hours as investors opted to “sell the news”. It quickly recovered some of those losses, however.Nvidia predicted second-quarter revenues would be around $3.1bn, plus or minus two per cent, ahead of Wall Street’s previous estimate of $2.9bn.“We had a strong quarter with growth across every platform,” said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and chief executive officer. “Our datacentre business achieved another record and gaming remained strong. At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI, just as traditional computing has slowed.”
28;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2018-05-03T04:15:26Z;Driverless car secrecy sparks fears for US road users;After Uber crash, FT investigation reveals wide variations in training and disclosure;"Human test drivers, charged with seizing control of autonomous cars during dangerous incidents, have been allowed behind the wheel after only a few days’ training, according to regulatory filings by Silicon Valley companies.An investigation by the Financial Times reveals that some of the biggest companies in this nascent market have spent less time training their back-up operators than Uber, whose safety record is in the spotlight following a fatal crash, and that training practices vary widely between companies. The documents, filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles in California, which grants permits for autonomous testing in the state, also reveal patchy disclosure about training programmes — prompting calls for a more standardised approach to an increasingly urgent matter of public safety. An autonomous Uber vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, in what is believed to the industry’s first such fatality. Video from the crash, released by Tempe police, appeared to show the Uber driver was distracted and not looking at the road in the moments leading up to the collision. The company suspended its testing operations across the US following the accident.Through a public-records request, the FT obtained documents detailing driver training programmes for Uber and the seven other Silicon Valley companies that had the largest number of safety drivers on the road in California. The companies have together received permits for more than 1,000 safety operators. Much of the time spent behind the wheel of an autonomous vehicle is tedious and uneventful. Few of the documents describe how companies train drivers to deal with fatigue or boredom.But experts say thorough training is important given operators may have to take control of an unpredictable vehicle in a wide range of situations, from high-speed freeways to dense urban streets full of pedestrians and cyclists. The longest education programmes detailed in the filings give back-up drivers more experience, from how to cope with a cyber attack to encountering other vehicles that deliberately try to confuse the robot car.“The more training and experience they have, the safer you are,” said Mark Rosekind, a former US road safety regulator who now serves as chief safety innovation officer at Zoox, a four-year old autonomous car start-up.Uber’s most recent filing with the DMV, submitted in March last year, shows that it spent about three weeks training new safety drivers.Documents provided by the DMV show that two companies — Cruise, which is part of General Motors and has permits for almost 400 drivers in California, and Aurora, a start-up founded by autonomous industry veterans — both spent less time than Uber training their operators as recently as last year.“Overall, the descriptions don’t inspire confidence that these drivers are well-trained,” said Pravin Varaiya, professor at the University of California Berkeley’s department of electrical engineering and computer sciences, who is researching driverless car safety.$80bnEstimated sum invested in self-driving vehicle technologySilicon Valley has seen a gold rush surrounding autonomous driving in recent years, with the Brookings Institution estimating last year that more than $80bn has been invested across the industry. Companies are testing hundreds of self-driving vehicles across the US and some are piloting fully driverless cars. Developers point out it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between the outlines provided in the different filings. Different levels of technological development and complexity can require different amounts of training. A well-established autonomous system should need less supervision than a new approach, developers say, and some companies have been working on their systems for far longer than others.Waymo, which has the longest-running autonomous car testing programme after starting out in 2009 as the Google self-driving car project, now spends two to three weeks training its “basic” operators. Much of its testing is done in simulation, which allows its systems to run through a greater number of scenarios without having to put a physical car on the road.These documents suggest that regulators don’t have the level of detail and/or technical expertise neededZoox, which has quietly raised more than $250m in venture funding, details nearly a month of driver instruction, including a 10-day module covering its proprietary driving system and another 10 days behind the wheel. A Zoox spokesman said that its latest curriculum amounts to more than 300 hours of training, although this figure was not specified in its filings to the DMV.Aurora, in a filing made last July, said it spent two weeks training its operators, while Cruise told the DMV it put safety drivers through a “multi day” course.Both Aurora and Cruise say they have subsequently increased their training time. Last week, after receiving inquiries from the FT, Aurora sent the DMV an updated overview that said it spends 12 weeks instructing its dozens of operators. Cruise said that it has run a “one month” training programme since June 2017, which “draws on GM’s decades of experience in safely developing and testing vehicles”. “We developed this programme by analysing the tasks of monitoring and training our vehicles, performing safety analyses of these tasks, and creating roles and procedures for the people involved to maximise the safety of the programme,” a spokesperson for Cruise said.The previous filing describes its practices in 2016, before it was acquired by GM.Tesla, Nvidia and Apple did not provide the DMV with a timescale for their training. Academics and safety experts who reviewed their filings criticised those companies for their lack of transparency.Bryan Reimer, a research scientist investigating driver safety technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed to the “incredible level of variability in documented details that one would have expected authorities in California to question”.He added: “Overall, these documents suggest that regulators don’t have the level of detail and/or technical expertise needed to ensure that the autonomous vehicle industry as a whole is prepared for the complexities present in developing, testing and deploying this technology on public roads.”The paperwork left other experts worried that the companies’ secrecy, driven by intense competition to be first to launch an autonomous car or taxi service, is coming at a potential cost to the safety of other road users.The California DMV requires only that any company testing autonomous cars must provide an “outline” of its driver training programme, inviting a range of interpretations and implementations.Six of the eight companies for whom data were obtained, who together have the largest testing fleets in California, describe their training in three pages or fewer; Cruise provides just half a page of information. A DMV spokesperson said that it provides guidelines about what must be included in an outline but no rules on how often the information must be updated.Missy Cummings, an engineering and computer science professor at Duke University, said the patchy disclosure reflects the “hyper-competitive drive” of the companies involved, as well as Silicon Valley’s tendency to “beg for forgiveness [for failures] rather than ask permission”.There are all these areas where there is no guidance, no structure, very vague requests and needsCalifornia runs a stricter reporting regime for autonomous vehicles than Arizona, where Uber’s crash occurred, requiring companies to obtain a permit before they start testing. They must also file annual “disengagement reports” that explain how often human drivers have to take the wheel.But the state does not mandate a particular kind of driver training, beyond certain requirements around background and licence checks. “The training programme depends on the technology a manufacturer is testing,” the DMV said. “It is up to each manufacturer on what training is adequate.”Mr Rosekind of Zoox warned of a regulatory “vacuum” because federal agencies have largely left individual states to govern how autonomous vehicles use their roads. “There are all these areas where there is no guidance, no structure, very vague requests and needs,” he said. California has not specified how many operators are required in a car. Both Uber and Waymo allow their safety drivers to operate alone, unless they are testing new systems or locations. Apple, Cruise and Zoox require two employees to be in an autonomous vehicle at all times, according to their filings.Earlier this year the California DMV began fielding applications for fully driverless testing permits, which will allow operators to send vehicles out with no one in them at all, but it has not yet issued any. The Uber crash has triggered investigations from several government agencies, including California’s DMV, and prompted criticism of the company’s approach. Doug Ducey, Arizona governor, said it marked an “unquestionable failure” by Uber to make safety its “top priority”. Nonetheless, the vast majority of the more than 50 companies operating in California have continued to test on public roads. Ms Cummings of Duke University said that the upsurge in public concern should prompt companies to work together to establish common standards. “They don’t have to do this in a vacuum by themselves. If they were to come together on testing and certification, this might help them all to get to a better place.”"

The declines marked a reversal from Monday’s rebound after major US benchmarks had their worst week in more than two years.The decline spread to Asia and then into Europe on Wednesday. Japan’s Topix index was down 1.7 per cent by midday as the technology sector slid 2 per cent.South Korea’s Kospi index fell 1.4 per cent while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 1.5 per cent, dragged lower by a 3.7 per cent decline for tech shares. Chinese technology company Tencent shed 3.2 per cent.In Europe, the Stoxx tech index is down 1.7 per cent, led lower by Austria Microsystem, down 4 per cent, and ST Micro which is 3.3 per cent weaker. The region’s wider indices are calmer, with the sector making up a less significant part of the stock market. The international Stoxx 600 is down 0.7 per cent.UBS’s wealth management group said it was concerned about the US taking a “hard line” on technology stocks. “We calculate a 20 to 30 per cent tariff on IT products would see Asian earnings decline by low to mid-single digits,” it said.Investors are repricing tech shares because they are uncertain about whether that growth will be there in the futureInvestors in New York were spooked by a report that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, is willing to testify before Congress about the social network’s data scandal.Nvidia’s suspension of self-driving car tests after the recent fatality involving an Uber autonomous vehicle also weighed on sentiment, as did renewed concerns about Tesla’s production plans.“The fundamental concern is that these issues — whether it be something in the business line that was expected to drive growth or an increase in regulation — will negatively impact growth expectations,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“Investors are repricing tech shares because they are uncertain about whether that growth will be there in the future.”Facebook and other shares have been under pressure since reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company employed by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users.“Investors are clearly worried that we may be about to see a regime change in regulation,” said Luca Paolini of Pictet. “History tells us that when a company or sector becomes dominant, it tends to attract the attention of either the regulator (US) or the taxman (Europe).“And today the value of many tech names is based almost entirely on intangibles like reputation and brand, so regulation can have a huge impact.”On Tuesday Twitter dropped 12 per cent while Facebook lost 4.9 per cent, Alphabet was down 4.6 per cent and Apple declined 2.6 per cent. Nvidia fell 7.8 per cent while Tesla was off more than 8 per cent.With the more defensive mood on Wall Street, investors shifted to utilities and telecoms shares, which rose 1.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, and also favoured government debt.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield broke out of a long-held trading range to touch its lowest level since early February. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell over 8 basis points to 2.77 per cent.The move also marked the first time the 10-year yield has closed below its 50-day moving average this year, with investors pointing to a growing dislocation between the current positive economic environment and tension over growth and inflation.The spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell to 50.9 basis points, closing in on its year-to-date low of 49.7bp, another sign of flagging confidence in the economy.“The flattening will take hold. It will accelerate,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets. “That’s an important theme for us to have on the radar for the year.”Additional reporting by Emma Dunkley in Hong Kong

Other chipmakers also fell on the news, with Advanced Micro Devices down 2.9 per cent and Micron Technology off 2.5 per cent. The wider Philadelphia semiconductor index skidded 1.7 per cent.A run on Tesla also weighed on the Nasdaq. Shares in the electric car maker fell 6 per cent amid renewed concerns over the company’s ability to deliver on its production goals.The so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) - were back in the firing line as investors turned risk averse.

31;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Nvidia shares slide after it suspends self-driving car tests;;Nvidia shares went into reverse on Tuesday after the US chipmaker confirmed that it had temporarily suspended testing self-driving cars on public roads around the world following the recent fatality involving an Uber vehicle.Nvidia shares fell 3.9 per cent in midday trading to $234.8357 following the suspension, which was first reported by Reuters.An Nvidia spokesperson said:“Ultimately AVs will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.”Nvidia is among numerous chip companies and carmakers that have been racing to perfect self-driving vehicle technology. But those efforts suffered a serious setback recently after an Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona, prompting Uber and others to temporarily halt testing on public roads while trying to figure out what went wrong.Nvidia chips were already being used by Uber in its fleet of modified Volvo XC90 SUVs and the companies announced in January plans to extend that partnership to Uber’s fleets of self-driving cars and freight trucks.
32;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;China’s accession to WTO has been a boon, not an error;The US economy has enjoyed significant benefits from its inclusion;"It was a mistake for the US to support China’s membership into the World Trade Organisation and negotiating new trade deals with Beijing is a waste of time. That, at least, is the flawed view of the Trump administration’s Office of the US Trade Representative.In a January 2018 report, USTR declared that “the US erred in supporting China’s entry into the WTO” and that high-level bilateral talks designed to advance market access “have largely failed”.This is a remarkable change in perspective.A little more than a year ago, under the Obama administration, the very same agency wrote that “data confirms a dramatic expansion in trade and investment among China and its many trading partners, including the US, since China joined the WTO”, noting that exports of American goods to China have increased by 500 per cent since 2001, “positioning China as the US’s largest goods market outside of North America”.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.In January 2017, USTR stated that after joining the WTO, “the Chinese government took many steps to implement China’s numerous commitments”, which “unquestionably deepened China’s integration into the WTO’s rules-based international trading system”. USTR also said that bilateral talks in the prior year [2016] had resulted in “significant progress” on a wide rate of “key trade and investment issues”.China’s WTO accession has delivered
In my view, China’s 2001 entry into the WTO has delivered benefits to a wide range of Americans and Chinese.China’s inclusion in the WTO has been a boon to many American companies. During the 15-year period when US exports to China rose by 500 per cent, our exports to the rest of the world were up by only 90 per cent.Exports to China are especially important to American farmers. China is their largest overseas market and since China’s WTO accession, the value of US agricultural exports to China has risen by 1,000 per cent. Shipments of American soybeans, for example, rose 13-fold.While it is true that US firms continue to battle against non-tariff barriers and non-transparent government regulatory policy in China, many American companies have done well in that market. Boeing, for example, has over the last five years delivered more aircraft in China than in the US. The American Chamber of Commerce in China recently reported that nearly three-quarters of their member companies are profitable, the highest proportion in three years.Exports to China create American jobs
You’ve probably read reports that imports from China led to 2.4m US job losses. But those jobs were lost over a more than 10-year period, while another study found that US exports to China directly and indirectly supported 1.8m new jobs in just one year, 2015.Another overlooked point is that imports from China are good for American household budgets. A study by economists at the New York Fed and other institutions concludes that “US consumers gained from China’s WTO entry through lower prices on varieties of manufactured goods”.Structural change in China
The Trump administration’s USTR report makes one other significant gaffe, claiming that “the state’s role in the [Chinese] economy has increased”. In fact, China’s WTO accession has driven structural changes in that country’s own economy, which have given Chinese people a better standard of living and more personal (although not yet political) freedom.The absence of political rights and the rule of law are serious long-term problems, but Chinese people have the freedom to run their own lives to a degree that was unimaginable just 25 years ago. And, in my view, continued expansion of personal freedom and wealth creation will inevitably lead to more political rights.For many years, China’s economy was dependent on investment. Today, domestic consumption accounts for the majority of economic growth and more than half of GDP.When I first worked in China during the early-1980s, there were no private companies. But small, entrepreneurial private firms now account for 85 per cent of urban employment and all new job creation.Since 2001, per capita urban household income rose by 431 per cent in China. As a result, spending by Chinese consumers — which was equal to only 27 per cent of US retail sales a decade ago — was equal to 90 per cent of American consumer spending in 2017, and is likely to surpass US retail spending by the end of the decade.This has opened up opportunities for many publicly listed American companies. General Motors sells more vehicles in China than it does in the US, and China accounts for about 20 per cent of GM’s global earnings. China contributes 19 per cent of Apple’s revenue. Nike shoe sales in China rose 19 per cent over the past quarter and accounted for about 15 per cent of total revenue. China contributes roughly 15 per cent of global earnings for firms such as Nvidia, Dolby and Tesla.Challenges remain, but engagement will deliver more than protectionism
Despite all of this progress, many challenges remain. China, for example, continues to restrict market access for foreign firms in sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals, financial services and accounting. The Trump administration should focus on this, rather than on reducing the US trade deficit with China. The trade deficit has little impact on US employment and is determined by balances between savings and investments, rather than by trade policy.Protectionist policies by the Trump administration would not further open Chinese markets for US firms. Rather, such steps would lead to retaliation, which would reduce US exports and harm the many American jobs they support. Protectionism would hurt American families, because imports have resulted in more affordable prices for many consumer goods.Andy Rothman is Investment Strategist at Matthews Asia, an asset management firm."
33;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
34;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-12-06T10:53:36Z;Nintendo lets Mario loose on rival device in China;Japanese group to distribute limited catalogue of classic games through deal with Nvidia;Nintendo has shattered decades of tradition by allowing gamers in China to play some of its most treasured titles on another company’s console as the Japanese company prepares to launch its Switch machine in the world’s most valuable games market. The move, which took industry experts by surprise, will see Nintendo distribute a limited catalogue of its classic games through Nvidia’s Shield. The tablet-style gaming console has largely flopped in the US and Europe but its producers hope it may now be injected with life as a localised version launches in China. Chinese gamers who own the Shield will initially be able to download licensed versions of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Punch-Out!! — a trio of blockbuster games that were launched about 10 years ago on now discontinued Nintendo consoles. Nvidia said other older Nintendo titles would follow. Nvidia’s licensing deal with Nintendo marks what one Tokyo-based analyst described as a “sharp and indicative” break with the past. Several other experts linked it to a much broader strategic shift for the Japanese company as it eyes a Chinese games market that surpassed $24bn last year. $73.2bnGlobal value of console market — including video games — in 2025, as projected by Goldman SachsNintendo has spent many years nurturing intellectual property in the form of game characters such as Mario and Zelda. A central strut of that strategy has been an absolute insistence that those games only be accessible through its own consoles. That strategy was softened last year when Nintendo produced a Mario title for smartphones, and it has since released or announced a string of other games for the mobile market.The Kyoto-based company has long been wary of the mainland Chinese market, and has long resisted selling its consoles there because of tough regulation, counterfeiting and a concern that it would not be able to retain its normal grip on distribution. Nintendo has not formally confirmed plans for a China launch of its Switch — a machine that plays games as both a handheld device and through a television — but people close to the company have said it is preparing to do so in 2018. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, who forecast that the value of the global console market, including hardware and software, will rise from $42.3bn in 2016 to $73.2bn in 2025, said that if the Switch were able to gain traction in China, it would represent “significant upside” to Nintendo’s earnings.Analysts said Nintendo’s deal with Nvidia would help it enter the Chinese market, while costing the Japanese company little in practical terms because the games it is licensing are so old.By getting Nvidia to distribute its games, Nintendo will be hoping to familiarise Chinese consumers with some of its titles and characters that may not be so well known given that the Japanese company has not been in the market for so long.“Nvidia is doing the heavy lifting here, and Nintendo can provide them with a number of older games and see how they go in China without endangering the newer titles that would come with a future Switch launch,” said Serkan Toto, a games industry consultant. 
35;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-11-19T08:00:26Z;Chipmakers bet on the ‘big bang’ of artificial intelligence;Broadcom’s $130bn bid for Qualcomm reflects semiconductor companies’ desire to depend less on smartphones and vie for a foothold in AI;No one in Silicon Valley wants to be called a “chip company” these days. Qualcomm, which makes the processors found in many Android phones and iPhone modems, describes itself as a “platform company”. Intel, once proudly “inside” most of the world’s PCs, now positions itself as a “data company”. Nvidia, whose soaring share price has made it one of the best-performing stocks of any sector in the past two years, describes its graphical processors as “amplifying human intelligence”, thanks to their growing role in deep learning research.Yet just as quickly as semiconductor companies are trying to rebrand themselves as something else, dealmakers are rushing into the sector. Since 2015, the chip sector has seen more than $150bn-worth of mergers and acquisitions — and that was before Broadcom chief Hock Tan made his bold $130bn move on Qualcomm this month.Broadcom is the product of several of those deals, not least its $37bn buyout by the smaller Avago in 2015, which retained its target’s name.Its bid for Qualcomm, whose board has rebuffed its $70-a-share offer as too meagre, is likely to prove a high water mark in the current consolidation frenzy. “In a way, all the M&A has happened,” says James Wang of Ark Invest, an investment adviser. “This is the last one you could even imagine.” A deal could create the world’s third-biggest chipmaker behind Samsung and Intel.Qualcomm and Broadcom sit at the top of a complex but rapidly shrinking food chain. Before Broadcom swept in, Qualcomm itself was trying to complete the chip sector’s biggest deal to date, buying NXP, the Dutch chipmaker that only two years ago paid $12bn for Freescale. Broadcom and Avago are still integrating with each other after a merger in 2015. It is enough to give even a veteran dealmaker like Mr Tan indigestion.The last few years’ activity reflect a unique set of circumstances in the tech industry. A decade after the introduction of the iPhone, the smartphone market is vast but mature, offering slower, less profitable growth to companies such as Arm Holdings and Qualcomm.Executives are convinced that artificial intelligence and augmented reality will soon sweep the globe like the personal computer and the smartphone before them. Softbank’s $32bn buyout last year of Arm, the UK-based chip designer, was a gutsy bet on the internet of things, or IoT, by the Japanese conglomerate’s founder, Masayoshi Son.However, it is not quite clear when or even which of these revolutions will happen. The result is something unusual in the land of disruption: the status quo is holding. Apple, which is sitting on $269bn in cash and whose latest iPhone X is already proving successful, seems unlikely to fall on harder times like Nokia or BlackBerry anytime soon. The awkward alliance between Samsung and Google based on the latter’s Android operating system is holding up, while the South Korean electronics group’s dominance in chip manufacturing continues to grow. The prospect of a new entrant loosening Lenovo, Dell and HP’s collective hold on more than half of the PC market seems remote too.The global dominance of a few big tech companies may be causing concern in Washington and Brussels, but it presents an opportunity for the likes of Mr Tan. If consolidation in maturing markets has been one force driving the prolific deal making, the other has been a rush by established powers and newcomers alike to position themselves for the next wave of growth.“When you have a small number of very powerful customers, you have to have a very small number of powerful suppliers,” says Michael Marks, former chief executive of electronics supplier Flextronics and a former Broadcom director. “Thirty years ago you had 200 computer customers, now you have three. Fifteen years ago you had 20 cellphone customers, now you have two. The hardware sector has consolidated massively over the last 30 years . . . I’m surprised it has taken this long for there to be more consolidation in the semiconductor market.”At a time when the likes of Intel and Qualcomm have been investing in search of that elusive next big thing, from forays into smartwatches and virtual reality to multibillion-dollar bets on autonomous cars, Broadcom has shown a more narrow focus in the less glamorous parts of the supply chain.Intel is best known for the central processing units that power Windows PCs and Macs, but its other chips can be found in iPhone modems, data centres, drones and self-driving cars. Unlike many of its rivals, it manufactures chips as well as designs them. Its $17bn acquisition of Altera in 2015 added new capabilities.Founded in 1993, Nvidia’s strength has always been in graphical processing units, which run alongside a CPU. Nvidia is still popular with gamers, including players of Nintendo’s latest Switch console, but the GPU has taken on a new life in cryptocurrency mining, training artificial intelligence systems and autonomous cars.San Diego-based Qualcomm’s heritage is in wireless technology, particularly in 3G and 4G cellular networking, where it owns foundational intellectual property. It capitalised on the growth of Android smartphones with its Snapdragon “system on a chip”, while also selling modems to Apple since the first iPhone. It is now investing in the hope of dominating the next generation of 5G wireless networks.Broadcom supplies components to telecoms, enterprise and industrial companies, which are used in TV set top boxes, smartphones, broadband infrastructure and energy systems. Its origins date back to the 1960s at Hewlett Packard and in AT&T’s Bell Labs. A driver of its $130bn bid for Qualcomm was to expand into cellular wireless chips for mobile devices.“Broadcom has always been an ingredients supplier, that’s very much their heritage,” says Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insights.Mr Tan puts it a little differently. “We have bought five companies over the past five years,” he explains. “The way our business model works is, when we buy a business we look at the strong, the core sustainable product lines . . . We very often invest even more than the original owners have invested in those businesses.”He is dismissive of diversions into “peripheral” or “adjacent” businesses that the management teams of his targets “can’t help dabbling in”, adding: “In those businesses, we tend to go through an asset rationalisation.”Contrast that approach with Intel, which went far beyond mere dabbling with this year’s $15bn acquisition of Israel’s Mobileye, a maker of sensors and cameras for computer-assisted and autonomous driving. Self-driving cars are moving from science fiction to reality faster than many expected: Alphabet’s Waymo is already putting truly driverless cars into public service, many of them powered by Intel’s processors.Even after winning its first slot in the iPhone last year, Intel is searching for new sources of growth beyond the central processing unit, the workhorse chip driving most PCs and servers, after largely missing out on the smartphone revolution. Its attempt to reposition itself as a data company also reflects its strength in data centres, where Intel says it is targeting a $50bn market opportunity for silicon ranging from server processors to networking and AI.Here, the rise of cloud computing has helped drive faster growth than the PCs that make up its “client” business, which still makes up more than half of Intel’s total revenues. Despite the hype, the “internet of things” accounted for only 5 per cent of Intel’s $45.7bn in revenues for the first nine months of this year. Pressure to diversify also motivated Intel’s $400m acquisition of Nervana, whose technology is more suited to AI systems than the CPU.In autonomous cars specifically and AI generally, Intel is seen as playing catch-up with Nvidia, whose graphics processing units have been eagerly adopted by researchers working on deep learning. Last year, Nvidia was the best performing stock on the S&P 500, rising by 224 per cent. Its shares have doubled in value again this year.“Nvidia is at the centre of AI, machine learning and deep learning and where the value really resides, which is in neural networks and training,” says Mr Blaber. “That doesn’t mean it’s not going to face competition from Intel, and Google and Facebook are investing in their own silicon [for AI]. But Nvidia is in a remarkably strong position.”It has achieved this stronghold without buying its way into the market. Like Intel, Nvidia missed mobile, prompting its 2011 acquisition of Icera, a maker of smartphone modems that competes with Qualcomm. But the modem business was closed last year, just as the value of its original focus on graphics chips was becoming clear in AI.“We enabled the AI big bang to happen because of this new computing architecture that we invented,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, told the FT in an interview this year. “Just as software ate the world, AI is going to eat software.”For now, more than half of Nvidia’s sales still come from gamers wanting the latest graphics cards for their PCs. Though less than a quarter of its most recent quarterly revenues come from AI-centric applications in data centres, it is growing fast, doubling year on year.“When people think about IoT, that’s an AI problem. When people think about self-driving cars, that’s an AI problem,” Mr Huang said. “I believe there’s going to be a trillion, multiple trillions of devices in the world that are going to have inference capability . . . basically, localised AI capability.”Once seen as a takeover target, Nvidia’s surging share price has given it a market capitalisation of $126bn — seen by most analysts as too large for potential buyers such as Intel.Until recently, the same was said for Qualcomm, whose valuation was eclipsed by Nvidia this year. The two companies’ share prices give a clear picture of investors’ enthusiasm for their respective stories: while Qualcomm’s stock would have been broadly flat without the recent rally driven by Broadcom’s bid, Nvidia has increased by more than 600 per cent in the same period. “It comes back to the fact that it’s a very opportunistic move on Broadcom’s part,” says Mr Blaber.Qualcomm’s stock has been hit hard since January by its antitrust battles with Apple over pricing and patents. Apple has stopped paying Qualcomm, which is trying to block iPhone sales from San Francisco to Beijing. Investors are worried because Qualcomm’s licensing business, QTL, is “just such a disproportionate amount of profit that the Apple weight on its earnings quarter to quarter is substantial”, says Mr Blaber. “Plus [there are] long-term fears about all the other regulatory cases and how that might impact the business model.”To its proponents, Qualcomm’s biggest strength is its unique combination of chipmaking, with hundreds of millions of modems and “Snapdragon” processors sold to smartphone makers round the world every year, and intellectual property licensing, which feeds off an accumulated $47bn investment in research and development since its foundation in 1985. Critics, including Apple and regulators in several continents, argue that the combination is fleecing customers by allowing Qualcomm to collect more royalties than it deserves for its patents for cellular wireless networking.If regulators do not intervene first, Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm would create even greater supplier concentration for smartphone makers. “With Qualcomm, Broadcom would be able to offer basically every chip in the iPhone besides [Apple’s] A-Series processor,” says Mr Wang.Yet the presence of the iPhone’s A-Series processor points to what Mr Wang sees as the semiconductor industry’s most successful deal: Apple’s 2008 acquisition of PA Semi, for what now seems like a modest price, $278m. The deal has allowed Apple to take control of the chips at the heart of its devices and with it much of the iPhone’s competitive differentiation.As the UK-based graphics chipmaker Imagination Technologies found out this year, Apple can quickly go from your largest customer to a brutal competitor. After the iPhone maker said it would bring design of graphics chips in-house, Imagination’s shares fell and it was forced to put itself up for sale.Hardly anyone wants to be a chip company these days, it seems, except for the world’s most valuable company.Additional reporting by Richard WatersRegulators have taken a close interest in consolidation among chipmakers, holding up Qualcomm’s $47bn NXP deal and Broadcom’s $6bn bid for Brocade in recent months. Given its size and complexity, analysts expect Broadcom’s $130bn attempt to seize Qualcomm will also face a lengthy review. Qualcomm itself, which is resisting the bid, is using that threat as part of its defence.Yet chopping up Qualcomm or selling off business units would fit the dealmaking modus operandi of Hock Tan, Broadcom’s consolidator in chief. One idea already pushed by activist investors in Qualcomm is to split its highly profitable intellectual property licensing business from its chipmaking unit. Under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners two years ago, Qualcomm’s board launched a review of the idea but chief executive Steve Mollenkopf ultimately decided there were too many “strategic benefits and synergies” from the combination.Nonetheless, that unique combination lies at the heart of many of Qualcomm’s current legal and regulatory troubles.Concerns about these and the NXP deal preoccupied analysts on Qualcomm’s most recent quarterly earnings calls. Instead of discussing its moves into healthcare, robotics or smart cities, investors are worried that its licensing issues with Apple threaten contagion to other customers. Qualcomm has said it is already in dispute with one large Asian smartphone maker, which many analysts believe to be Huawei, although the situation has not yet deteriorated into litigation.Even before launching his bid for Qualcomm, Mr Tan had been cosying up to the US government. At a press conference alongside President Donald Trump, he promised to relocate Broadcom’s headquarters from Singapore to the US.Given Broadcom’s considerable overlap with Qualcomm, he may need more than a presidential photo-op to accomplish tech’s biggest ever deal.
36;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Nvidia results buoyed by revenue jump in core gaming market;;Nvidia’s third quarter results blew past most Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the third quarter, as revenues from its core gaming market surged and it recovered from a disappointing second quarter performance in data centres.Nvidia’s stock has already been buoyed by high investor expectations this year, and the strong results lifted the shares only slightly in after market trading ahead of a call with analysts to discuss the earnings.Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used in high end gaming PCs as well as to handle newer tasks like processing large amounts of data for machine learning systems, had been expected to register a sharp deceleration in growth. But figures released after the bell on Thursday include a 32 per cent jump in revenue, to $2.64bn, ahead of the $2.23bn Wall Street was expecting.Earning of per share of $1.33 were up 41 per cent and well above consensus analyst expectations of 94 cents.Underpinning the latest results was a 25 per cent jump in revenue from gaming, to $1.56bn, which belied expectations of a slight decline.Meanwhile, sales of chips for data centres to handle AI tasks rose by 109 per cent, to $501m. That was comfortably ahead of what the market had been expecting and came in the wake of an unexpected slowing in the preceding quarter.
37;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-11-09T19:45:49Z;Semiconductors poised for worst day since June;;Semiconductors were in investors’ line of fire on Thursday, with the sector poised for its worst day in nearly five months and the sell-off dragging the broader technology sector lower.The S&P semiconductor and semiconductor equipment index fell 2.8 per cent — leaving it on track for its biggest one-day decline since June 9. The decline weighed on the wider technology sector, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.8 per cent for the day.Advanced Micro Devices led the decline among chipmakers, falling 5 per cent to $11.15. The slide came after Intel confirmed late on Wednesday that it had poached Raja Koduri, head of AMD’s fast growing graphic chips unit Radeon Technologies — to head up its newly formed core and visual computing group. Interestingly, Mr Koduri’s jump also comes after Intel recently teamed up with AMD to build chips in a move that was perceived as taking on rival Nvidia.Mr Koduri announced his departure from AMD on Tuesday, raising questions about the growth prospects at Radeon and sparking chatter that the move could boost Intel’s competitiveness in the graphic chips business at the expense of Nvidia and AMD.However, Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities disagrees. He notes that while Mr Koduri is a “rock star” in the world of graphics processing chips and his departure from AMD is a “strategic loss” for the company, it may not provide enough of a boost for Intel, which is in its”third or fourth serious effort in graphics”.“The Intel move in our view is a no-win situation for him as it is way too late in the game for him to change things and innovate,” said Mr Mosesmann.Still that did not prevent shares in semiconductors from lurching lower. Nvidia, which is slated to report results after the bell, saw its shares down 3.4 per cent to $202.02, Xilinx slid 3.5 per cent to $71.04, KLA-Tencor declined 4.3 per cent to $102.47 while Analog Devices shed 3.9 per cent to $88.45.Despite Thursday’s decline, the S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment index is up 38 per cent so far this year helping technology lead the broader benchmark index with a 36 per cent year-to-date gain.
38;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-10-10T16:27:16Z;First chips for full control of driverless cars to hit the streets;Trial in Germany will feature test vehicle that follows human delivery driver around;The first computer chips designed to control a completely driverless car are set to hit the streets for a trial in Germany next year, with a test vehicle that follows a human delivery driver around.The system, developed by US chipmaker Nvidia, is set to extend the company’s lead over Intel and other rivals in one of the industry’s most important development areas.However, Nvidia executives said the technology was likely to be used only in very restricted circumstances at first, and that it would take time for road safety regulations and software to catch up with the advances in hardware.Nvidia announced the new system on Tuesday at an event in Germany, along with a trial in the second half of next year by Deutsche Post DHL. The logistics company will equip a fleet of electric delivery vans with sensors and the new chips.The US company said the chips were the first designed for the top “Level 5” category of autonomous vehicles, which will be built without steering wheels, brake and accelerator pedals and other human controls. The most advanced technology in use today is Level 2, which can do things such as changing lanes and auto-parking but still requires a human to be ready to take back control at any time.Nvidia’s latest chip, called Pegasus, represents “the end-game for self-driving cars,” said Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. It “gives Nvidia a leg up in the race to full autonomy”.A practical version of Level 5 would require a solution for the huge, power-hungry computers that are packed into today’s test vehicles. The new Nvidia system will come “in a form factor the size of a licence plate,” said Danny Shapiro, the executive in charge of automotive at Nvidia.The new system is designed to eventually handle up to 320 trillion operations per second (TOPS), compared to the 24tn of today’s technology. That would give it the power needed to process the masses of data produced by a vehicle’s cameras and other sensors and allow it to drive completely autonomously, Nvidia said. The first systems to be tested next year will have less processing power, but will be designed to scale up with the addition of extra chips.Nvidia’s expertise in graphical processing units, or GPUs, has given it an early lead in developing artificial intelligence and has helped to drive its stock market value up to more than $110bn, a six-fold increase since the start of last year.
39;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-09-21T17:36:26Z;Anadarko jumps after $2.5bn share buyback pledge;Leading US stock indices retreat despite energy group’s 7% climb;Anadarko Petroleum was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the energy group announced a $2.5bn share buyback programme through the end of 2018.With the Texas-based company’s current market cap of approximately $25bn, the buybacks would represent approximately 10 per cent of Anadarko’s current outstanding common shares, according to the announcement made after the market closed on Wednesday.The company set an initial target of making $1bn in share repurchases before the end of 2017.“We believe this is a very attractive use of our cash given the value of our assets and the highly accretive nature of this programme,” said Al Walker, Anadarko’s chairman and chief executive.The news sent Anadarko’s shares up more than 7 per cent by midday on Thursday to $48.02, putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain since November.The boost came after an otherwise dim year for Anadarko, which — like other major US oil companies — has seen its share price pressured by lower crude prices. Year-to-date, its shares are down about 30 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.The buyback programme won praise from Drexel Hamilton analyst Robert Christensen, who also pointed to its “strong balance sheet”, relatively high margins and $6bn in cash.He said in a note that the buybacks were a “positive signal that (Anadarko) remains focused on creating value not just through the drill bit and reserve and production growth or M&A at any price”.Mr Christensen — who reiterated his “buy” recommendation and target share price of $100 — said the move also underscored that other top-tier exploration and production companies have alternatives for their capital rather than pursuing a “one-sided strategy” of “merely drilling for growth’s sake”, particularly if commodity prices fall.“[A] two-sided strategy to use cash and return it to shareholders when possible is better,” he added.Despite Anadarko’s advance, major US stock indices were trading lower by lunchtime in New York. The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 2,504.77 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1 per cent to 22,393.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent to 6,433.97.Blue Apron shares rallied as much as 9 per cent to $5.68 before trimming those gains to trade about 1.5 per cent higher to $5.30.Shares in the meal kit delivery service were boosted after Albertsons said on Wednesday afternoon that it would buy Plated, which launched in 2012, raising speculation that Blue Apron could be the next meal kit targeted for a takeover.Albertsons operates stores under numerous brand names including Safeway, Vons and its eponymous brand.Nvidia shares stumbled 4 per cent to $178.27 following reports that electric automaker Tesla was working with rival Advanced Micro Devices to develop an autonomous driving technology chip.AMD shares, which had jumped earlier in the session, were trading roughly flat at $13.76.Shares in Eldorado Gold rose nearly 3 per cent to $2.27 after the miner said it had entered into “constructive dialogue” with the Greek government and postponed its decision to freeze its investment in Greece.The company had previously threatened to suspend operations after quarrelling over delayed approvals for mine developments.

Tim Cook, chief executive, unveiled the device in the Steve Jobs theatre, a sleek auditorium at Apple Park, its new head office in Cupertino.Apple Park, a $5bn campus for 12,000 staff with a vast circular building surrounding a park planted with oaks and fruit trees, is an emblem of the US technology industry’s latest craze. An industry of start-ups founded in garages wants to redesign employee activity, prodding engineers to get up from their desks and exchange ideas.Apple Park is “a building which is pushing social behaviour in the way people work to new limits”, says Stefan Behling of Foster + Partners, its architects, in an official video. Apple is not alone: Amazon plans a $5bn second head office and Nvidia, a chipmaker, has built a two-storey office with spaces at its heart to “spark collisions”.The vision is as ambitious as that of Louis Sullivan, the architect of early US skyscrapers, whose 1896 essay “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered” declared loftiness to be “on a high road to a natural and satisfying art”. The contrast is that, instead of skyscrapers that split staff across floors, they are building utopias in wide, flat campuses.But utopias are tricky: people do not always enjoy collisions, nor having their social behaviour pushed. As John O’Brien, senior director of real estate at Nvidia, says: “Human beings do not like change, and engineers like it the least.” There is reason to be reluctant about being made to mingle: people often get most done when left in peace.The guilty secret of many corporate transitions to open plan offices and “hot desking” is the desire to save money. As work patterns become more flexible and technology makes remote working easier, one study found that the average desk is only occupied about half the time. Allocating everyone a locker and telling them to find a free desk when they arrive costs less.The tech industry is innocent of that. Its main motivation for reconfiguring these campuses is not cost but revenue, the belief that innovation springs out of collaboration and that is inhibited by walls and floors. Everyone has his or her own workstation at both Apple and Nvidia and these buildings also allow them to gather and huddle when working together on projects.The apotheosis is “activity based working”, an approach to office design pioneered in the mid-1990s in the Netherlands by the consulting firm Veldhoen at companies including the insurer Interpolis. Rather than staying in one place, staff should move among zones during the working day, depending on whether they are working normally, focusing quietly, or collaborating.This can create uncertainty for employees, who have a human tendency to gravitate to one spot. (When told that the Financial Times is considering activity based working on its return to its former London head office, I was among them.) Some Apple engineers were reported to be dismayed at having to work in newly designed open plan “pods” at Apple Park.As a result, activity based working often does not operate as planned. A study by Leesman, a workplace research group, found that while it often boosts productivity, many employees stuck to familiar habits. About 70 per cent of those in activity based workplaces still anchored themselves to a single desk, which the study concluded “seems a catastrophic failure”.It is also a waste, given the amount of ambition and money that goes into configuring these offices. There must be something in it for employees or they will not change their ways, no matter how much companies abolish walls to create space or alter furniture.Companies should start by recognising what their employees fear losing. Gensler, the architecture firm that designed Nvidia’s new building, pointed out in one study that workers face “less space, less privacy . . . more distractions” in offices, as well as spending more hours working. Collaboration had to be balanced with “extended periods of uninterrupted focus”.They also need to accept that not every kind of professional works in a similar way. Some jobs require the kind of constant moving from communal discussions to individual focus that activity based working is designed to facilitate. In other cases, employees work most efficiently in one place every day and prodding them to migrate around the office is a pointless distraction.Sullivan wrote influentially that “form ever follows function” and concluded that in skyscrapers, “tiers of typical offices, having the same unchanging function, shall continue in the same unchanging form”. This was the early 20th century template: floor upon floor of small offices, “similar to a cell in honeycomb, merely a compartment”.A century later, the need for uniformity has been eroded by changes in technology and working patterns. The 21st-century office performs a variety of functions and has to take on various forms. Silicon Valley’s campuses will work if they are flexible enough to allow diversity, not if they are technology utopias that try to re-engineer the behaviour of the people inside.john.gapper@ft.comIf you are a subscriber, add John to myFT in order to receive alerts when his articles are published.

41;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-08-11T20:45:15Z;Nvidia slides as chipmaker fails to meet high expectations;Share price tumbles as investors fret that heady pace of growth may slow;Nvidia was the biggest loser on the S&P 500 after the highflying chipmaker failed to satisfy investors’ lofty expectations.The company saw its shares drop 5.3 per cent to $155.96 on Friday in its worst day of trading in two months.This comes after being the best-performing stock over the past 12 months and Nvidia approaching a $100bn valuation. Its chips are used for artificial intelligence, virtual reality and autonomous cars, and it shipped chips to Tesla and Facebook during the quarter.Blistering demand for its product was underscored by its second-quarter sales, which soared 56 per cent year on year to $2.3bn, ahead of the consensus forecast for revenue of $1.96bn. Net income was $583m.Earnings per share, at 92 cents, was 124 per cent compared with the prior-year period and topped the average analyst estimate of 70 cents.“This is the era of AI, and the Nvidia GPU (graphics processing unit) has become its brain. We have incredible opportunities ahead of us,” said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive of Nvidia.Still, investors appeared to be disappointed that the company’s heady pace of growth is showing sign of slowing.The company makes more than half of its revenue from gaming, powering GEForce and Nintendo Switch. That unit saw sales jump 52 per cent year on year during the quarter, compared with the 66 per cent year-on-year increase it clocked during the fourth quarter.Its data centre business, which makes chips used in high-performance computing and machine learning, recorded a 175 per cent sales gain, down from a 186 per cent pace recorded in the fourth quarter.Nvidia forecast revenue for the third quarter of $2.35bn, plus or minus 2 per cent, and GAAP gross margins of 58.6 per cent.The wider market rose for the first time in three days as investors played down tension between the US and North Korea.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 2,441.32, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely changed at 21,858.32, while the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.6 per cent to 6,256.56.The gains were driven in part by a strong showing for tech stocks, including Apple, which rose 1.4 per cent to $157.48.Elsewhere, Nordstrom was flat despite beating the broader department-store slump and post stronger profits and sales growth than analysts had expected.The upmarket department store operator ended 0.1 per cent up at $44.90.Nordstrom said that second-quarter net sales rose 3.5 per cent year-on-year to $3.71bn, just a hair shy of the $3.75bn that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 1.7 per cent during the quarter, beating forecasts for an 0.4 per cent decline.Of that, comparable sales at Nordstrom-brand stores and online grew 1.4 per cent, led by women’s clothing and beauty divisions, while comparable sales at its discount-driven Nordstrom Rack increased 3.1 per cent.Net earnings were $110m, beating predictions for $108.2m, and earnings per diluted share were 65 cents, better than the 63.5 cents that Wall Street was looking for.The solid second-quarter performance prompted Nordstrom to boost the bottom end of its full-year forecasts.It is now looking for net sales to grow about 4 per cent, compared with a previous range of 3-4 per cent and earnings per diluted share of $2.85-$3.00, versus previous forecasts for $2.75-$3.00.
42;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Chipmaker Nvidia’s shares fall despite earnings beat;;Shares in Nvidia fell 5 per cent to $157 in after hours trading despite the chipmaker at the centre of three major tech trends reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue.Nvidia was nearing $100bn valuation after being the best-performing stock in the last year, up 193 per cent. Its chips are used for artificial intelligence, virtual reality and autonomous cars, and it shipped chips to Tesla and Facebook during the quarter.The Silicon Valley-based company reported diluted earnings per share of 92 cents, up 124 per cent year-on-year, compared with the average analyst estimate of 70 cents per share. Net income was $583m.Nvidia’s sales soared 56 per cent to $2.3bn in the last year, higher than the consensus forecast for revenue of $1.96bn.“This is the era of AI, and the NVIDIA GPU (graphics processing unit) has become its brain. We have incredible opportunities ahead of us,” said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive of Nvidia.The company makes the majority of its revenue from gaming, powering GEForce and Nintendo Switch, but is also riding waves of new investment from autonomous car makers such as Toyota, Volvo and Autoliv, and artificial intelligence — it announced partnerships with VW and Baidu during the quarter.Nvidia forecast revenue for the third quarter of $2.35bn, plus or minus 2 per cent, and GAAP gross margins of 58.6 per cent.

Even e-commerce giant Amazon, which is set to report quarterly results later in the day, had gave up its earlier gains to trade down 0.17 per cent at pixel time.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, stayed in positive territory, clinging to an 0.17 per cent gain to put it at 21,745.
44;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;SoftBank begins Vision Fund investments with West Coast tech;Three start-ups in autonomous vehicles and farming garner $473m from Japanese group;SoftBank has announced almost half a billion dollars’ worth of tech investments in a diverse group of companies ranging from robotics to farming, as its begins to deploy its $93bn Vision Fund. The first deals exclusively carried out by the Vision Fund are investments in Brain Corp, a robotics company based in San Diego, and Plenty, which is pioneering a new kind of agricultural technology in the San Francisco Bay Area.At the same time, SoftBank itself is leading a $159m funding round into Nauto, a Silicon Valley-based autonomous vehicle technology company. The investment is expected to be offered to the Vision Fund at a later date.The deals were unveiled ahead of chairman Masayoshi Son’s keynote speech on Thursday at SoftBank World, the Japanese group’s annual conference, where some of its latest investments, including robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics and chip designer Arm are expected to be shown off to customers and partners. The Vision Fund was established late last year as a combination of equity and debt from backers including the state investment funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, as well as tech groups including Apple, Qualcomm, Foxconn and Sharp. Mr Son has promised to “think big” with its bets on many facets of what he calls the “information revolution”, ranging from artificial intelligence to the internet of things. The fund’s first deployments will set the tone, with a company using sensors and big data to create a “hyper-yield” farm and another that is hoping to become the standard operating system for autonomous robots, in the same way that Android did in smartphones. Plenty is raising $200m to help with what Mr Son said was a plan to “remake the current food system”. Matt Barnard, chief executive and co-founder of Plenty, said its indoor farms would produce “hyper-organic food with no pesticides nor GMOs while cutting water consumption by 99 per cent”. The facilities, which grow food vertically inside towers lit by bright LEDS, will be created close to large cities to avoid having to transport and store their produce. “We’re now ready to build out our farm network and serve communities around the globe,” he said. The Vision Fund’s other investment announced on Wednesday is a $114m bet that manually operated vehicles in warehouses and other industrial applications can be turned into autonomous robots. San Diego-based Brain, which was first backed by chipmaker Qualcomm, offers “AI as a service”. Brain’s first application was a floor-cleaning robot, but its founders say its technology will eventually be as “commonplace as computers and mobile phones are today”. “We believe tomorrow’s robots will be intelligent autonomous machines that take care of us,” said Eugene Izhikevich, Brain’s chief executive. “This funding will allow us to accelerate our mission, and we look forward to collaborating with the SoftBank Vision Fund as a long-term strategic partner.”Nauto, which is part of Android founder Andy Rubin’s Playground Global hardware incubator, is the latest Silicon Valley autonomous driving start-up to see a multimillion-dollar cash injection. Its device can be installed into existing vehicles and looks inside and outside the car, to help prevent distracted driving. Its initial target customers are fleet managers of commercial vehicles who want to track their drivers remotely and improve safety, with a longer term goal of applying the same technology to develop fully self-driving cars. Stefan Heck, Nauto’s chief executive, said its system was “learning how to drive from the best drivers — professional drivers”. “We will be integrating our algorithms into future production vehicles,” he said. “So it will go from a driver coaching system to guiding the car to actually driving.” As well as Nauto, SoftBank is expected to offer the Vision Fund a stake in Arm, as well as graphics chipmaker Nvidia, satellite start-up OneWeb and simulation technology provider Improbable. 
45;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-06-19T21:24:14Z;US tech stocks bounce back for best day of the year;Investors dive back into companies hit by recent sell-off;US technology stocks enjoyed their best day of 2017, as investors took advantage of the recent sell-off to dive back into some of the companies that have powered most of the stock market’s gains this year.Tech shares — especially big blue-chips such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft — have been the biggest driver of the US market’s climb to record highs this year, but suffered last week as some investors worried that they had become overvalued.After falling almost 4 per cent since June 8 in what some analysts dubbed a “tech wreck”, the S&P 500 technology index bounced back with a 1.7 per cent gain on Monday, its best daily rise since December 7 and extending this year’s rally to 19.1 per cent.Apple, the biggest listed US company, gained 2.9 per cent, chipmaker Nvidia rallied 3.8 per cent and Facebook rose 1.5 per cent, making tech the day’s best-performing sector and helping the broader S&P 500 index to a new record close.“We think the latest pullback in tech is more likely to represent a pause that refreshes some excess optimistic sentiment than it is the start of something nastier,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.“Today’s tech companies look nothing like many of their 2000 counterparts, some of which were valued on silly things like ‘eyeballs’ given they had no earnings, and little prospect of ever having an earnings stream.”Investors have in recent years mostly fastened on to the “Faang” stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — as powerful growth stories, making their shares soar. But some analysts have advocated replacing Netflix with the much bigger Microsoft, a more important driver for the US stock market as a whole.The overall market capitalisation of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google now stands at just under $2.9tn, compared to the FTSE 100’s dollar value of $2.57tn, and the combined value of France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s Dax of almost $3tn.Some analysts and fund managers remain cautious, arguing that the optimism of equity investors stands in sharp contrast to the pessimism of bond markets. Peter Tchir, at Brean Capital, said that while the resumed tech rally was “key for the broad market resuming its upward trend”, he was still sceptical that it could last.“Today is positive, but such a big move on no news says more about broader liquidity than the fundamentals being solid,” he added.
46;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-06-09T20:07:50Z;Volatile Nvidia could shunt Netflix out of the Faangs ;Chipmaker valued at just shy of $100bn on a wild day for tech stocks;US chipmaker Nvidia suffered a pounding on Friday after flirting with a $100bn market capitalisation, giving up early gains to suffer the biggest drop of any company on the S&P 500 on the last trading day of the week. Big, rapidly growing technology groups have powered this year’s US stock market rally, as investors become increasingly enamoured of the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. These so-called Faang stocks have between them gained around a third this year and helped lift the S&P 500 to numerous records.But the Faangs suffered steep losses on Friday, dragging the S&P 500 into the red, and Nvidia, a California-based chipmaker that is moving from supplying the computer gaming sector to self-driving cars and the broader, emerging “internet of things” industry, was the biggest loser. Nvidia’s shares more than tripled in value last year, and were up as much as 5.4 per cent earlier on Friday, before tumbling as much as 10.8 per cent in the broad rout for technology shares. Towards the end of the trading day Nvidia’s shares were at $150.6, down 5.9 per cent and paring their advance this year to 41 per cent. Some market analysts said a Goldman Sachs research note published on Friday may have contributed to the sudden reversal for the sector.The US investment bank’s analysts highlighted some growing risks to the buoyant tech sector’s valuations, such as how free cash flow generation has plateaued after doubling between 2006 and 2016, even as the industry’s shares have continued to rocket. Moreover, fund managers are now very exposed to the “Faamg” stocks, Goldman warned.“This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult to decipher risk narratives,” the bank warned.The Nvidia rout came after a string of analysts upgraded their outlook. Citi analysts said on Thursday that its shares could double over the next year under its optimistic scenario, while UBS upgraded its view on Nvidia’s sales to the car industry and Bank of America Merrill Lynch lifted its price target to $185 this week.Nvidia is now trading at a punchy 47 times its forecast earnings over the next four quarters, but the valuation is justified despite the “parabolic rise” of its shares, given under ownership by US mutual funds, the company’s early lead in artificial intelligence and growing opportunities in autonomous driving, BofA analysts said.The chipmaker is valued at just shy of $100bn, making the case for ejecting Netflix from the Faang club in its favour much stronger. Netflix is valued at a more modest $68bn, making it comfortably the smallest company of the five widely followed stocks that make up the acronym.But Andrew Left of Citron Research, a short-seller, on Friday published a report arguing that Nvidia should fall back to $130 a share despite being “long time [Nvidia] lovers”. Goldman Sachs analysts have made the case for replacing Netflix and ignoring Nvidia in favour of Microsoft and renaming the tech club driving the US stock market higher “Faamg” instead, given that Microsoft’s stock is a far bigger contributor to the S&P 500 this year.The “Faamg” stocks have together added more than $600bn of market capitalisation this year, the equivalent of Hong Kong and South Africa’s combined gross domestic product, Goldman Sachs noted before Friday’s tech rout.
47;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T06:21:58+0000;US tech shares on track for biggest drop in almost a year;;US technology shares tumbled abruptly at mid-day on Friday, leaving the sector on track for its heaviest drop since the day following last year’s Brexit vote.The S&P 500 technology sector dropped as much as 4.2 per cent, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index down 2.2 per cent.Many of the industry’s biggest names sustained heavy selling. Apple was off 4.2 per cent, Microsoft was down 3.9 per cent, Facebook declined 4.1 per cent, Alphabet dropped 3.7 per cent, Netflix tumbled 5.8 per cent lower, and Nvidia — which saw a 7 per cent rise a day earlier — flipped into the red to trade lower by 10 per cent.Market strategists were not immediately clear on what caused the sharp move, with some investors pointing to profit-taking as a potential rationale.“One theory might simply be that tech is overbought (after the recent rally) and market participants are rotating into financials and other underperforming sectors,” Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald told the Financial Times.Trading activity on one of the largest and oldest exchange-traded funds that tracks many of the biggest US tech groups surged to more than three times the average over the past month amid the abrupt sell-off in the sector.The PowerShares QQQ Trust, which is often just referred to by traders as the triple-Qs, saw its trading volume hit 45.3m shares by 1:56pm in New York. That compares with the 30-day average for that time of day of 13.6m, and total average volume of 23.8m, Bloomberg data show.The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, which includes the 100 largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq Composite. Among its biggest weightings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. Those shares, and tech more broadly, have posted big gains so far this year and have helped to drive the broader market higher.“…rates stabilising … combined with the general concern over tech’s ability to continue outperforming goes a long way in explaining the reversal,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.
48;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-05-09T20:58:14Z;Nvidia shares jump as it rides AI and gaming booms;;Shares in US graphics chipmaker Nvidia leaped up 13 per cent in after-hours trading, after it reported results ahead of expectations across a portfolio of products that power gaming PCs and consoles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The Silicon Valley-based company saw revenues rise 48 per cent year-over-year to $1.94bn, just ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, with guidance for its second quarter also beating estimates at around $1.95bn. Net income more than doubled to $507m, with earnings per share also more than twice last year’s figure at 86 cents.Nvidia, which was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, has seen its shares pause for breath this year as investors grew concerned about increased competition from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm, as well as slower growth among its videogamer customers.“The AI revolution is moving fast and continuing to accelerate,” said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive. “Nvidia’s GPU deep learning platform is the instrument of choice for researchers, internet giants and startups as they invent the future.”As well as striking partnerships with auto supplier Bosch on self-driving cars and data-centre AI tie-ups with Microsoft, Google, Tencent and Baidu, Nvidia has also benefitted from the success of Nintendo’s Switch, which uses its Tegra processors. Tegra revenues more than doubled overall to $332m, while its core GPU business was up 45 per cent to $1.56bn. Data centre sales rose 186 per cent to $409m.Nvidia shares, which closed at $102.94, were 13 per cent higher in after-hours trading at $116.75, their highest point since early February.
49;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-04-07T18:09:46Z;The blessing and curse of being an Apple supplier;Competition for iPhone contracts is fierce, but a break-up can be devastating;Business is booming at Cirrus Logic, the Texas-based audio chipmaker. Sales are growing by more than 25 per cent for the third year in a row and its shares are up by 70 per cent in the past 12 months.However, despite running a public company with a market capitalisation of $4bn, chief executive Jason Rhode struggles when explaining to investors the finer details of its impressive results. Even though a single customer accounts for two-thirds of its annual revenues — and as much as 85 per cent in the quarter ending in December — Mr Rhode never dares mention it by name.On every quarterly earnings call, Mr Rhode trots out the same carefully worded phrase: “While we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.”Of course, every Cirrus investor knows that the unnamed customer is Apple, the world’s leading maker of smartphones by sales. When Apple revealed strong demand for its new iPhone 7 in mid-September, Cirrus’s shares leapt by 8 per cent in a single day.Yet Apple’s obsessive secrecy, coupled with the extreme demands it makes of its manufacturers and the competition to join their ranks, means its suppliers dare not put a foot wrong. Apple’s patronage is a blessing when everything is going well but it can quickly become a curse. The consequences of a break-up can be devastating, as London-listed chip designer Imagination Technologies discovered this week.Imagination’s graphics processors have been a core part of the iPhone since it first launched a decade ago. Its shares lost almost two-thirds of their value on Monday when the chipmaker revealed that Apple “has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology”. It was one of the most dramatic share-price reactions for a large UK company — previously worth £754m — in a decade.Imagination’s relationship with Apple has been rocky for a while. Early last year, amid deepening losses as it struggled to adapt to the smartphone market slowdown, its long-serving chief executive Sir Hossein Yassaie left the company. Soon after, it emerged that Apple — which owns an 8.1 per cent stake in the chipmaker — had discussed acquiring Imagination outright but ultimately decided against making an offer.Today, Apple still accounts for more than half of Imagination’s revenues but within two years it intends to “no longer use the group’s intellectual property”, Imagination said in a statement.Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst now a venture investor at Loup Ventures, compares investing in the group’s suppliers to playing “Russian roulette”. “It’s the classic deal with the devil,” he says. “You know you are going to pay a price for it, whether it is getting left behind completely or squeezed on your profits.”Apple’s abrupt severance may seem ruthless but it shows how the group is moving to own more of the core technologies at the heart of its products. By making such a drastic shift into graphics processors, Apple is seizing control of a component that is becoming essential to not just video and gaming, but two coming tech megatrends: artificial intelligence and augmented reality.That will come as little consolation to Imagination, which is facing what one analyst called its “black swan” moment. For many such vendors, though, the pattern is all too familiar.“This is not the first time this has happened in the Apple supply chain and reminds us that a discount should be applied to Apple suppliers’ valuations,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note to clients this week. Apple declined to comment for this piece.An early victim was PortalPlayer, a provider of audio technology to the iPod, which relied on Apple for around 90 per cent of its sales. In December 2005, PortalPlayer was riding high on the success of Apple’s MP3 player, with its chief executive saying it was “well positioned for the year ahead” thanks to its “strong” relationship with its unnamed “leading customers”. Just four months later, Apple switched to another supplier and the company lost half of its value almost overnight. Before the year was out, PortalPlayer had been sold to Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker.As a result, publicly listed manufacturers who count Apple as a customer, tend to trade at a lower multiple than their peers, analysts say. On Wall Street, this phenomenon is known as the “Apple risk discount”. Last September, analysts at RBC Capital Markets noticed that 10 of 11 suppliers with significant revenues from Apple were seeing their gross margins contract. “We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers,” RBC said in a note at the time, as a way to mitigate increases in its own costs due to currency fluctuations.Yet even for suppliers who know the risks, a contract with Apple is seen as a badge of prestige that will bring in other customers. It also brings huge volumes — Apple will sell more than 240m iPhones this year, according to analysts.“The best thing is to do the deal with Apple anyway,” says Mr Munster. “Even though you are probably going to get throttled in the end, you will have three years of great times you probably would never have had if you hadn’t done it.”Nonetheless, news of Imagination’s predicament will have triggered concern across Apple’s supply chain. “Companies working with them in certain areas are really struggling to get financing, because of the risk,” said an executive at one company that has worked with the iPhone maker for many years. “Every bank has every Apple vendor on a watchlist now. The negative impact on [Apple’s] supply chain is huge.”Imagination is an extreme case because Apple is not just swapping to another supplier — it is taking development of the same technology in-house. Chipmaking is not a new endeavour for Apple, though. Since it acquired PA Semi in 2008, it has developed formidable expertise in crafting the tiny electronic brains inside its devices.As well as the A-series processors that power its iPhones and iPads, Apple has custom-designed special chips that run in its Watch and AirPods wireless headphones. Analysts see this as a key strategic advantage for the company, given that the huge resources required to make custom processors put them out of reach of many rivals.Yet creating a new graphics processor (or GPU) is far more complex and ambitious than anything Apple has attempted so far. Only a handful of companies other than Imagination, including Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and SoftBank’s Arm, are able to produce the technology at real scale. Apple has been steadily poaching employees from Imagination as it learns to fine-tune its off-the-shelf processors.“Apple has demonstrated extraordinarily well that its chips can be well optimised for the specific functions of the iPhone,” says Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. Ditching Imagination for its own GPU is “just Apple being Apple — they want to customise as much as they can”, he adds. “Given the clear directions Apple is moving in, a GPU is only going to become more important.”In today’s iPhones, graphics processors are used to make richer video games and more visually sophisticated apps. But the next model will feature a new front-facing camera that can sense the depth in a scene, such as capturing all the features of a face in 3D, according to people familiar with Apple’s plans.That will enable not only new security techniques, such as a user’s face unlocking the phone instead of today’s fingerprint reader, but also new kinds of features and inputs that are loosely gathered under the buzz term of “augmented reality”. That could mean elaborate special effects in photos and videos, like a supercharged version of Pokémon Go or Snapchat’s selfie masks, which give people dog ears or turn them into a character from a TV show.Beyond the iPhone, Apple is also researching AR glasses — a new frontier in wearable technology that companies across Silicon Valley are spending billions on to develop. “This [Imagination move] is as clear a nod that Apple has given that it sees a dramatic shift in how people are going to interact with their devices,” says Mr Munster. “This is like the tremor before the earthquake.”For such a secretive company, Apple chief Tim Cook has been unusually vocal about his enthusiasm for augmented reality, saying it could be “huge”, as big as the iPhone is today. “I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining,” Mr Cook told the Independent in February. “It’s not a product per se — it’s a core technology.”A graphics processor is also important beyond images because its architecture is uniquely suited for processing the huge amounts of information that lie behind AI systems, which already appear in today’s iPhones in its Siri virtual assistant’s suggestions and automatic face recognition in photos.While Apple dreams up new applications for AR and AI, Imagination faces a nightmare scenario from which few suppliers have ever fully recovered. Knowing that it has worked with Apple for so long, it might attract renewed interest from rival smartphone makers, analysts say, while it may yet be able to force Apple to license its intellectual property. Royalties would bring in less revenues than chip sales but command a higher profit margin.“Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights,” the company said on Monday, flexing its legal muscles.Perhaps Imagination might learn from the experience of another British supplier to Apple, audio chipmaker Wolfson. After it lost Apple as a customer in 2008, Wolfson posted five years of operating losses before being bought by a larger rival: Cirrus Logic.
50;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-04-05T04:02:08Z;Nintendo and Sony lead charge as games consoles return to battle;Gaming apps fail to kill off a format that is being reinvented for a new generation;"Some pundits say sales of games consoles peaked with the dotcom boom. However, others believe rumours of their deaths have been greatly exaggerated as new concepts have helped to reinvigorate the format.Sony’s PlayStation 2, released in 2000 at the height of the market, holds the title of best-selling games console, with more than 150m units sold in just over a decade. Vying for the top spot is Nintendo’s handheld DS, which debuted in 2004. Despite two later versions of the PlayStation, and the release of competitors from Nintendo and Microsoft, no other console of the past 20 years has yet come close to either the PS2 or DS. In the meantime, the iPhone has sold 1bn units since its 2007 launch, with consumers now spending tens of billions of dollars a year on games.Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS Markit, the research group, forecasts PlayStation 4 sales — at more than 53m since its 2013 release, according to Sony — could top those of the PS2 over its lifetime. He estimates sales will total 119m by 2021.Franchises from Pokémon to Final Fantasy are hopping from console to smartphone and back, with the games industry now able to address a larger audience of paying players thanks as much to puzzle-adventure game Candy Crush Saga as shoot-’em-up Call of Duty. Spending on console, mobile and PC games reached $100bn globally last year, up about $8bn on 2015 according to games intelligence provider Newzoo.No device epitomises that joined-up vision more than Nintendo’s new Switch, a “hybrid” console that combines a portable screen with big-display gaming when plugged into a TV. “The Switch is a complete redefinition of what it means to be a console,” says Mike Gallagher, chief executive of the Entertainment Software Association, the US games industry’s trade group. “The concept is very novel, very exciting and very different . . . It’s a great credit to [Nintendo] that they make this investment and take this risk.”Nintendo has tried to bridge the gap between consoles and tablets before, with the Wii U, launched in 2012, which was a disaster for the Japanese company. This featured a huge controller with an iPad-like touchscreen that has to be within range of a TV-tethered base station to work. It sold 13m units over its lifetime until January, far below the 100m units of its predecessor, the Wii.Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, the chipmaker that produces the Switch’s graphics processor, has said consumers will be “blown away” by the new device. “Nintendo . . . [is] singularly focused on making sure the gaming experience is amazing, surprising and safe for young people,” Mr Huang said at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.His implicit contrast was with smartphones and tablets, whose primary function is communication; games are just one of a phone’s many uses, which limits the opportunities for players. Mr Harding-Rolls says: “Consoles are still unique in providing a curated selection of games, [sophisticated] experiences, plug-and-play technology and are relatively cheap compared to a PC.”The Switch became Nintendo’s fastest-selling console in the US, Europe and Australia during its launch weekend in March. IHS Markit says it will help contribute to a predicted 4.1 per cent growth in the overall console market this year, which will take it to $36.2bn.Last year, however, the console market declined. With price cuts by Sony and Microsoft — and slowing demand for their PS4 and Xbox One consoles — the market fell by 2.5 per cent to $34.7bn in 2016 from the year before, IHS says. That came despite the launch of three much-anticipated virtual-reality headsets: the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.VR has promised to reinvigorate the games industry by offering immersive experiences that place the player inside the game. So far, however, the market is taking off slowly. While the PS VR has shown early signs of success, thanks to its association with the PS4, the high costs of VR hardware and the powerful PCs required to run the Rift and Vive have deterred consumers.Jason Rubin, head of content at Facebook-owned Oculus, said in an interview at the Game Developers Conference in March that VR needed more content and lower prices to “shift into second gear”. So in March, less than a year after the headset first went on sale, Oculus cut the Rift’s price — and that of its accompanying Touch Controllers, which let players use their hands in virtual worlds — by 25 per cent to $598.To ensure more games are created to attract consumers, Mr Rubin said hardware companies such as Oculus will have to fund software developers upfront. Facebook has said it will invest $500m in VR content. But, for now, smaller independent developers dominate the Oculus game store rather than traditional console publishers such as Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts, which are waiting to see if the medium takes off.Many in the industry remain optimistic about VR. IDC, the analyst group, predicts total headsets for VR and AR will reach 99.4m units by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 58 per cent between now and then.“Will VR get to tens or hundreds of millions of users? I think it will,” says Lisa Su, chief executive of chipmaker AMD, who hopes VR will spur demand for its new range of cheaper, yet powerful, processors. “As the price point becomes more affordable, that’s when the technology takes off.” Mobile app stores remain the biggest draw for games developers looking for a large market and low upfront costs. While the likes of Apple’s App Store has become overcrowded, with a few hits such as Clash of Clans or Pokémon Go scooping up a disproportionate amount of downloads and revenues, new mobile gaming businesses continue to emerge.The revenues of Scopely, a six-year-old mobile games publisher based in Los Angeles, grow eightfold between 2014 and 2016. Walter Driver, its chief executive, says the app market is a “totally different business model to traditional gaming, which was about one-time payments and relies on brand recognition. Now there are 2.5bn apps to try.”He adds: “Many companies started with a hit game but only a handful have done it again and again.” The company’s popular games include WWE Champions, based on the wrestling franchise, and The Walking Dead: Road to Survival, featuring characters from the zombie TV show and comics.“We are living in this arena of a massive ‘mainstreamification’ of gaming,” Mr Driver says. “It used to be a binary category — either you bought a console or you didn’t. Now mobile games appeal to a far broader audience.”That is proving profitable even though smartphone sales have also begun to slow. “A higher percentage of people are spending money on games, and the people who are spending money are spending more,” Mr Driver adds.Mr Harding-Rolls says that Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft will have to move beyond selling discs and into Netflix-style streaming services if console makers are to win over mobile gamers. Sony, for example, is offering the PlayStation Now games subscription service while using its console as a platform to leap into the video streaming market with PlayStation Vue — a package of live TV and movies that competes with US cable offerings. Set-top boxes for watching TV and films, such as Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire TV, are also becoming a means to play games.“The existential question is, what is a console?” asks ESA chief Mr Gallagher. “There are more platforms than ever with high amounts of computing power. We could see even more kinds of consoles than we have now.”"
51;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-03-13T18:16:05Z;Intel/Mobileye: driven to overpay;PC chips are profitable but US group is making expensive bets elsewhere;The total addressable market slide is a staple of every venture capital pitch in Silicon Valley. But it is awkward for a company worth $175bn to rely on it. Semiconductor monster Intel has been stung by a steady decline in its core personal computing business. Still, that unit generates $30bn in annual revenue and an operating margin of 35 per cent. And with that kind of cash flow it has been quickly trying to expand its capability in smaller but fast-growing areas such as data centres and the internet of things.At its recent investor day, Intel said that while its traditional PC and server chip market was worth $45bn, the broader market opportunity was really $220bn. On Monday, it added another $70bn of TAM by acquiring autonomous vehicle sensor pioneer Mobileye for $15bn. Shareholders showed their displeasure by knocking off $4bn, or 2 per cent, off Intel’s value.Intel has just bought Mobileye, a leader in the fast-growing market for assisted-driving systems, for $15bn. Why was this small Israeli company so attractive to the semiconductor giant and will the deal pay off? Madhumita Murgia puts the question to the FT’s Sujeet Indap in New York a John Reed in JerusalemMobileye works with most automobile manufacturers (though notably had a falling out with Tesla last year). Its 2016 revenue was less than $400m, implying a deal price to revenue multiple of nearly 40 times. The $63.54 per share that Intel is paying is a 34 per cent immediate premium. Mobileye traded for as little as $28 per share 13 months ago. Intel says it can knock off $175m of Mobileye’s operating costs by 2019. That alone does not justify the premium paid. Mobileye is profitable and as Intel is using its stash of foreign cash to fund the deal the profit boost Intel touts is no great achievement.Intel, which infamously missed the rise of smartphones, looks desperate to be part of the next big thing. Buying rival chipmaker Nvidia with expertise in self-driving cars and artificial intelligence would have better future-proofed Intel, but its shares have risen 200 per cent in the last year.If this move heralds more big acquisitions, Intel investors should be scared. Despite generating $22bn in cash from operations in 2016, only $7.6bn went to shareholders, the rest to acquisitions. Intel bought software security company McAfee for $8bn in 2010 only to spin it off six months ago for less than $5bn.Competing against the likes of Alphabet and Uber in autonomous driving will be costly. Plenty of investors willingly take venture capital risk. That does not mean they want their cash-rich tech stalwarts to place those same bets.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
52;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-02-22T13:08:09Z;Semiconductors: the joy of Sox;The surge in chip stocks can be justified only by technological revolution;"This is bigger than a normal boom in the notoriously cyclical chip industry. In the past 12 months, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (Sox), which tracks the fortunes of the sector’s 30 biggest companies, is up 64 per cent compared with a 23 per cent rise in the S&P 500.Investors, unlike Public Enemy, do believe the hype. They imagine the internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and driverless cars will be as transformative as promoters say, driving demand for semiconductors. Support also comes from the prospect of transformative acquisitions in the wake of Avago’s $37bn acquisition of Broadcom or Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of NXP.The impact of emerging technologies is hard to gauge. That is hardly reflected in earnings multiples — profits have not kept pace with the rally and the sector is now trading at about 18 times forward earnings compared with a historical average of less than 17. Margins have actually deteriorated over the past three years.The bulls are certain a revolution is under way. Credit Suisse predicts the index will pass its dotcom bubble peak within the next two years. That may not sound racy. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed its 2000 peak in 2015; Microsoft reached it last year. But the bubble back then was more pronounced in semis than elsewhere. Getting back to that level would be unjustified unless new data merits it.Within the index, there is undoubted quality. Nvidia, which is responsible for an outsized share of the Sox’s gain, produces cutting edge graphics processing units. But the shares are already up 265 per cent in 12 months, valuing it at 25 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Perhaps better to stick with a renowned capital disciplinarian. Texas Instruments fits the bill and also has an unusually high 27 per cent effective tax rate. The revolution may be just around the corner, benefiting all the semis. Republicans cutting taxes, though, is a safer bet."
53;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-02-10T03:15:46Z;Activision shows fight despite latest Call of Duty difficulties;Shares of video games publisher boosted on strong holiday sales and dividend increase;Shares in Activision Blizzard surged by as much as 11 per cent in after-hours trading, as the video games publisher beat Wall Street’s expectations for holiday sales and announced a new capital return programme.The December quarter saw the launch of the latest instalment of Call of Duty, the 13-year-old shooting-game franchise. While Activision does not reveal sales for the title, this year dubbed Infinite Warfare, the company acknowledged that the game performed poorly due to its outer-space setting, which “did not appeal to all of our fans”.“With any longstanding franchise like Call of Duty, there’s a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things that people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital,” said Eric Hirshberg, Activision’s chief executive. “Last year, I don’t think we got that balance right.”Activision may have lost this battle to Electronic Arts’ rival first-person shooter Battlefield, but the war continues. Mr Hirshberg promised that 2017’s episode of the series would go “back to its roots” with more “traditional combat”. “We have never been more excited, either creatively or commercially, about our three-year Call of Duty slate,” he said.While Infinite Warfare performed poorly, many players of its predecessor, Black Ops III, are still buying special items and power-ups as they fight online against their friends. In-game purchases more than doubled last year to $3.8bn across the company as a whole.“Call of Duty is still the key pillar to the Activision part of the business,” said Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird. “What we are seeing develop fairly quickly is that recurring digital revenues and in-game transactions are becoming a much larger part of the mix.”While Call of Duty is still Activision’s best-known brand, Blizzard’s new hit Overwatch more than compensated for the shortfall, with Bobby Kotick, group chief executive, hailing it as a “major new franchise”.Overwatch’s monthly active users during the year were up 37 per cent year-on-year to 36m. That helped drive Blizzard’s revenues up by 50 per cent last year.Total revenues at Activision Blizzard grew 49 per cent in the December quarter to $2.01bn, boosted by its acquisition of Candy Crush Saga maker King Digital. Including deferred revenues, fourth-quarter sales of $2.45bn exceeded analysts’ estimates of $2.38bn. Earnings were up 57 per cent to 33 cents, with net income up 60 per cent to $254m.At the same time, the video games group also unveiled a $1bn share buyback plan and a 15 per cent dividend increase to 30 cents, as well as its slate of releases for 2017. Its shares hit $44.00 in after-hours trading, their highest level since October.Overwatch is a team-based shooting game that taps into the fast-growing trend for esports, which was also credited as driving sales at Nvidia, the maker of graphical processing units for gaming PCs, as well as data centres and autonomous cars.Nvidia, which was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 last year, has turned sales to gamers into a $5bn-a-year business, based on the last quarter’s revenues. On Thursday, Nvidia reported overall 2016 revenues of $6.9bn, up 38 per cent on the previous year.“PC gaming is growing because of a dynamic nobody expected 20 years ago — how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport,” said Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, on a call with analysts. “It will soon be the largest sport in the world.”
54;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Nvidia reports record revenue but shares soften on flat outlook;;Fresh off a year in which it was the best performing stock on the S&P 500, chipmaker Nvidia on Thursday said it notched a new record for full-year revenue in 2016. Nevertheless, the company’s shares traded lower after hours as it projected a small drop in sales for the upcoming quarter.The company said that revenue from the most recent quarter came in at $2.17bn, a 55 per cent year-on-year increase and slightly over the $2.1bn predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-year revenues for 2016 were $6.9bn, a 38 per cent improvement from the year earlier. Both figures represented record highs, it said.Net income came in at $655m, translating to earnings per share of 99 cents, versus expectations of a $536.6m profit and earnings per share of 83.6 cents.Despite the solid beat, Nvidia’s shares reflected investors’ disappointment in its guidance for slightly lower revenue of $1.9bn in the coming quarter, plus or minus about 2 per cent.Nvidia called the results a “great finish to a record year”. Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia’s founder and chief executive, said that the company’s graphics processing unit (GPU) has seen “rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.”Nvidia is riding high after it surfed a late-year rally to become the top-performing stock on the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Over the past 12 months, its shares have soared a remarkable 363 per cent.Nevertheless, the slightly bearish projection for sales next quarter — which will be the first of its fiscal year 2018 — suggests that it may have reached a plateau, for now, even as it eyes opportunities in next-generation technologies like self-driving cars, early cancer detection and weather prediction.
55;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2017-01-06T19:00:23Z;Artificial intelligence: the dash to connect the consumer;Exhibitors at CES insist the ‘internet of things’ is moving closer to reality. But will these smart gadgets prove useful?;The gadget that probably best encapsulates this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas does not look like a gadget at all. The new hairbrush from Kérastase has the same bristles and lacquered sheen as any of the L’Oréal brand’s salon products. There are no flashing lights or even a button to turn it on and off.Yet hidden inside are microphones, motion and conductivity sensors, and wireless connectors that turn this $10 everyday object into what its makers bill as the “world’s first smart hairbrush”, costing close to $200. Artificial intelligence has made it to the boudoir.The data gathered by the brush are sent to an app, where software algorithms produce a score for hair quality and recommend techniques — and L’Oréal products — that might improve it. The brush even vibrates a little if you brush too fast and damage your hair.“I was stunned by what you can infer and interpret by the noise of the friction of the hair brush,” says Cedric Hutchings, chief executive of Withings, the Nokia-owned company that developed the Kérastase Hair Coach with L’Oréal, the French cosmetics company.Yet Mr Hutchings admits that the product, unveiled at the Las Vegas tech show before it goes on sale this year, has been met with scepticism. “Eyebrows were raised,” he says. “People said: ‘Seriously, a smart brush?’”If that was attendees’ reaction early in the week, by the end of CES this weekend they should be all too familiar with the concept. The “internet of things” has been surpassed by AI as the most ubiquitous buzzword at CES, as start-ups and tech giants alike attach it to everything from cars and fridges to toothbrushes and shoes.“In 2015, we were focused primarily on connecting devices,” says BK Yoon, chief executive of Samsung Electronics’ home appliances unit. “Now we have moved beyond simple connection.”The AI wave that is poised to sweep across consumer technology comes in two forms. The first involves using voice as a new — and simpler — way to interact with everyday gadgets. Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant, which is activated by simply calling out its name and making a request, has been particularly popular among device makers wanting to add smart functionality to their products.Alexa, which Amazon lets other manufacturers use free of charge, will soon be accessible from millions of Ford cars’ dashboards, Whirlpool washing machines, LG fridges, Westinghouse TVs and Lenovo soundboxes.As well as controlling the devices in which it is encased, Alexa can switch on lights and open doors, not to mention read the news, book a cab on Uber or order a pizza. Eventually, Amazon hopes to make it a true intelligent agent, able to understand and anticipate users’ wants and needs at a much deeper level.Device makers are hopeful that embedding this kind of intelligence in their hardware can make consumers understand the value of the internet of things — the tech world’s dream of connecting billions of inanimate objects to the internet and making them smart. Long hyped, the connected home thermostats and “wearable” devices it has produced have not resonated much with those outside the tech bubble.But just as the Windows operating system dominates PCs and Google’s Android has a significant share of the smartphone market, new digital assistants like Alexa could give their creators inordinate power.Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of US chipmaker Nvidia, expects consumers to coalesce around a handful of virtual assistants from the likes of Google, Amazon or Microsoft as they become more accustomed to the technology.“When you are using Google Assistant, you get used to the capability of that assistant,” he says. “Over time it’s easy for people to use that capability rather than working across four or five different assistants.”Electronic hardware makers are trying to hedge their bets. Samsung recently bought an AI start-up whose founders also created Apple’s Siri, potentially giving it a rival platform and saving it from the kind of dependence it has had on Google’s Android operating system for its smartphones.Don Butler, head of Ford’s connected car initiative, is also wary of becoming dependent on Apple and Google, which have their own designs on the auto industry. That has made Amazon a natural ally, he says, though Ford also expects eventually to open up to other digital assistants.The second aspect of the coming AI revolution involves analysing data collected by smart devices to make them more useful. Until now, many products have gathered knowledge without using it. The big development in AI research has been “deep learning”, which can make sense of this real-world data.“AI is a dream that everybody has had about the potential of computers for a very long time,” says Mr Huang, whose graphical processing unit chips are used in many internet companies’ data centres. “Because of deep learning and [graphical processing chips] making deep learning practical, we are really seeing a new tool that has reignited the AI revolution.”Tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon hold troves of data, using them to train their systems to do things like understand language or recognise human faces in a crowd.But Mr Huang predicts that start-ups focusing on much narrower problems will be able to make gains with far smaller data sets, gleaning meaningful insights from low-cost sensors such as those found in the smart hairbrush.“This is a great time for start-ups,” he says. “It’s not true all these cloud services have all the data in the world . . . We all have our own data. Because of AI these micro businesses are going to surge.”Some of the items from which data are being gathered can sound unlikely. French company Kolibree, for instance, has been collecting information for three years using its smart toothbrush — a gadget that measures things like how long people brush their teeth.Its latest model, unveiled at CES, goes a step further and tries to assess which of 16 locations in the mouth the brush is in at any particular time. To do that, says chief executive officer Thomas Serval, it analyses data from “tens of thousands of brushes” to train the technology.Giving people feedback about how well they are brushing should improve dental hygiene, he says.The incipient intelligence on display this week in smart fridges, toothbrushes and hairbrushes prompts inevitable suspicion: does the world need such digital wizardry? As so often when the tech world races to invent the future, there is a sense that technology is being applied for its own sake.“The real difficulty in this process of fully realising [the internet of things] has been identifying . . . what is really useful to consumers,” says Mr Yoon, “and how to make consumers notice and really feel the difference.”As Brian Blau, an analyst at tech research group Gartner, put it after viewing the goods at CES: “You can control your blinds, you can control your appliances, you will be able to talk to the digital assistant in your refrigerator. But are any of those things interesting?”Part of the problem is that some capabilities of this technology have raced ahead of others, challenging gadget-makers’ ability to employ AI systems effectively. UBTech, a maker of small humanoid robots designed as domestic companions, has put facial recognition software in its machines so they can assess how their human owners are feeling.But the capability does not yet exist to use that knowledge to adjust a robot’s voice tone or subtly change other behaviour, says John Rhee, general manager for North America at UBTech. Instead, the company’s Lynx robot does its best to express itself: it flashes LED lights and rotates and nods its head.The race to plant intelligence widely has pushed into some unlikely places. Shadecraft, a start-up in Los Angeles, this week showed off its prototype of a smart garden umbrella. The device, expected to be priced at $2,500-3,000, will rotate with the sun — and like all the best smart gadgets, it will come with a built-in intelligent agent.Armen Gharabegian, Shadecraft’s chief executive, brushes off questions about why robotic intelligence is needed for a device like this. Over time, he says, as prices fall and consumers’ expectations of everyday digital objects change, it will be second nature to expect an umbrella to move itself.“Ten years from now, it’s going to be kind of awkward sitting on a beach not having an umbrella move to the sun, and for you to ask the robotic shade to order you a drink,” he says. “Right now, we’re living in the dark ages.”
56;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Chipmaker Nvidia tops S&P 500 as best performer of the year;High expectations for artificial intelligence drive stock up 238%;Soaring expectations for artificial intelligence may have threatened to tip over into tech industry hype this year, but they have thrown up at least one clear winner: chipmaker Nvidia, which has ridden a late-year rally to make it the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.Like Levi Strauss, who made his fortune selling goods to miners during the California gold rush rather than doing the mining himself, Nvidia has become a key supplier to all the leading tech companies involved in deep learning, the current state of the art in AI.It is widely credited with having developed the best chips for training the artificial neural networks built by companies including Google, Amazon and Baidu to do things like recognise images or understand language.“I’ve never seen such agreement about a technology,” said Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “I think they’re two to three years ahead of Intel.” He added that the world’s biggest chipmaker now had its sights set on the same market and “can’t be counted out”.Nvidia rewarded its growing legion of Wall Street fans with blowout earnings early last month. Since then its shares have risen another 64 per cent, adding $23bn to the company’s market value. At 238 per cent, its stock market gain this year has far outpaced every other company in the S&P 500, with second-placed natural gas company Oneok rising 135 per cent.The recognition for Nvidia follows years of investment to try to turn its graphical processing units, originally designed to enhance computer graphics, into the foundation for a broader general-purpose computing platform. The same parallel processing developed to handle graphical images has turned out to be the best technique for dealing with the massive amounts of data used in machine learning.The soaring interest in GPUs, which are also now a component in most advanced supercomputers and a growing portion of the servers used for cloud computing, has vindicated years of evangelising by Jen-hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive.“He was probably the earliest guy to see this coming,” said Mark Anderson, an independent technology analyst. He added that Nvidia’s head start over other companies has been helped by its investment in the software tools and other technologies to support its GPUs, though the nascent state of AI technology made it too early to tell if Nvidia would be able to hold on to its lead.“It’s not sustainable yet — the market’s too small,” Mr Anderson said. “There are a lot of guys with a lot of money working on this problem.”Nvidia still makes most of its money from selling graphics cards to computer gamers — itself a booming market, with growth of 35 per cent in the first nine months. Revenue from its datacentre business, by contrast, still only accounts for 12 per cent of sales, but a near-threefold jump in the third quarter of the year was taken by Wall Street bulls as confirmation that the technology was about to go mainstream.Chips for self-driving cars, another market where Nvidia’s has made a dent, also remain a tiny market. Despite recent technical breakthroughs, it is likely to be “a few years before you get to an explosion [of intelligence] inside cars”, said Michael Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner. He said, though, that Nvidia had got a foot in the door with carmakers looking to enhance their information and entertainment systems, and was well-positioned to become a big chip supplier to the industry in the run-up to autonomous vehicles.
57;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2016-11-13T15:43:28Z;Nvidia: not just gaming it;Powering the cloud justifies the surge in the chipmaker’s valuation ;Stocks gyrated wildly last week on guesses about the policy choices of the future Trump administration. It is consoling that the S&P 500’s best performer, and the best this year, is not moving on speculation about regulation or handouts from Washington.Nvidia’s shares rose 30 per cent after quarterly earnings smashed forecasts by more than a third, and are up 167 per cent this year. This after a longer-term run that has catapulted it into the big leagues of semiconductor companies. It raises the question of whether every larger chipmaker missed the moment to acquire the industry’s most exciting property during a recent wave of consolidation. Nvidia’s enterprise value — which discounts more than $3bn of cash — was under $10bn for most of 2015. Now it is more than $40bn. That may leave it still within the reach of a couple of the largest chipmakers — but at almost 30 times forecast earnings — it is now priced far more richly than its peers. Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor company, trades at 13 times forecast earnings.You could dismiss this premium as froth. Nvidia supplies some hyped industries. There are bound to be spectacular blow-ups in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars and other frontiers where the company’s graphics processing units provide the computing power. Part of the earnings call on Thursday was devoted to discussing a partnership with Tesla, whose controversial autonomous technology Nvidia now powers, and whose own prospects remain dubious. And yet there are plenty of grounds for optimism that the company can continue its stellar trajectory, during which margins expanded while revenues rose. There is also the breadth of these nascent sectors — Nvidia says it is following 1,500 companies working in artificial intelligence. The surge of activity in computer gaming continues — sending revenues in the category 60 per cent higher year-on-year to $1.2bn — even before virtual reality has taken off.And there is the fact that GPUs have become increasingly important in the data centres operated by the big public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Revenues from data centres tripled to $240m in the quarter. The cloud shift is the current big thing, not the next one. Its more humdrum but ubiquitous technology supports the dramatic upgrade in valuations.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
58;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2016-11-11T21:35:48Z;Nvidia jumps 30% as chip sales soar;;Nvidia, the US graphics processor maker, saw its shares soar 30 per cent after delivering better-than-expected earnings on the back of robust demand for its new chips.The stock closed at a record high of $87.92, which has brought year-to-date gains to 167 per cent. Friday’s jump helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which opened slightly lower, to a 0.5 per cent rise at the closing bell.The company, which sells chips used in games, cars and data centres, on Thursday said adjusted earnings in the third quarter more than doubled from a year earlier to 94 cents per share, and revenue grew 54 per cent from a year earlier to $2.0bn, driven by robust demand for its new Pascal chips. The results handily beat Wall Street expectations of earnings of 69 cents per share and $1.7bn in revenue.Analysts expect recent developments, such as a deal to supply processors for the upcoming gaming console Nintendo Switch, to continue ramping up demand. “We believe NVDA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and Tegra processors makes it positioned to take advantage of key secular trends within data centers, gaming, and automotive,” said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research.

Oculus is partnering with Walt Disney to bring some of its best-known characters to VR later this year.“The breadth and depth of content Oculus has secured reflects the unrivalled scale Facebook brings to the table,” said Ben Wood, tech analyst at CCS Insight.Mr Zuckerberg also showed off new kinds of communication between people both inside and outside VR. In one demonstration, virtual avatars chatted with a video caller using Facebook Messenger. Oculus is also enabling users to create avatars that they can use across a variety of games on its headset.“Virtual reality is the perfect platform to put people first because of [its sense of] presence: you feel like you are really there in another place with people,” Mr Zuckerberg said.He also revealed that Oculus is working on a standalone VR headset that promises to combine the best of PC and mobile VR and follows similar demonstrations of standalone VR prototypes by chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm in recent months.Oculus also unveiled new graphics processing technology designed to lower the cost of the PC required to support its existing Rift headset. The cheapest “VR-ready” PC will now cost as little as $500, down from $1,000 just a few months ago, after Oculus worked with graphics chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.The biggest new hardware products of the event were its handheld Touch controllers, costing $199, and a “room scale” sensor system that will allow users to walk around in a VR world, rather than using the Rift only while seated.Those announcements showed how Oculus was having to play catch-up with HTC Vive, its main rival in PC-based VR, Mr Wood said.“On hardware, this [event] felt more like catch-up than breakthrough innovation,” he said. “HTC seems to have the jump on them in hardware terms.”

Just ask the fund managers who specialise in emerging markets or precious metals.In the 14 weeks between the Memorial day and Labor Day holidays — that period where market lore tells investors to “sell in May and go away” — the top-performing mutual funds managers returned more than 20 per cent this year.And even larger profits were available for the buyers of some exchange traded funds and individual stocks.The gains have gone disproportionately to asset classes that benefit from low interest rates, as markets settled into a view that the US Federal Reserve will keep rates low in the short term and may not ever raise them back to historical norms.“There is a lot of money in play on that single factor,” said Shanquan Li, manager of the Oppenheimer Gold & Special Minerals Fund, whose 27.4 per cent gain since Memorial day on May 30 is the best performance of all US mutual funds with over $1bn in assets.Mr Li’s $1.3bn fund invests in mainly small- and mid-cap gold mining stocks, to magnify the impact of changes in the gold price, which has risen 9.3 per cent over the summer. With rates staying low, the lack of yield on precious metals is less of a deterrent to investors, some of whom also see gold as a hedge against any inflation generated by loose monetary policy.Gold-focused mutual funds from Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and Tocqueville Asset Management are also among the best performers, according to data from Morningstar.Meanwhile, emerging markets have seen growing interest throughout the summer, as US fixed-income investors sought higher yields overseas and equity investors expected capital to continue flowing into emerging economies and forecast China would continue to stimulate demand.Two “smart beta” mutual funds from Pimco, which buy emerging markets stocks, are in Morningstar’s top 10, but the biggest gains have fallen to buyers of exchange traded funds designed to give exposure to individual countries.Investors’ enthusiasm for the change of political leadership in Brazil— plus early signs of an earnings recovery at the country’s recession-hit companies — has generated a 31 per cent gain for an iShares fund that tracks the country’s stock market. China funds also surged in value.After a sharp rise in the wake of the UK Brexit vote, volatility in the US stock market remained subdued as the summer came to an end, but individual stockpickers were still able to enjoy gains of more than 50 per cent on large-cap stocks.Chesapeake Energy, whose large debt burden has frightened many long-term investors out of the stock, jumped 59 per cent, the most by any S&P 500 constituent. It has been pulling itself back from the brink of bankruptcy, thanks to a debt restructuring and the sale of assets. And Seagate Technology, whose business manufacturing computer disks is under pressure, soared on news of a restructuring that involves laying off 6,500 employees, about 14 per cent of the workforce.Investors have also warmed to microchip stocks such as Micron Technology and Nvidia, and to retailers, including Gap and Nordstrom.The question is how markets will fare as traders and investors return to work following the extended break, and some strategists are warning that summer trends may cool, particularly the enthusiasm for emerging markets.“I believe there is a ‘one-offness’ to what has happened,” said Bhanu Baweja, strategist at UBS. “Emerging markets have had a tremendous and exceptional fair wind this year. We have seen the biggest decline in US real interest rates in years, but even if rates stay low, that is now priced in.”
61;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Nvidia: vroom;Believers in self-driving cars can still invest in the year’s best performing tech stock;At the dawn of the automobile, you might have been right that cars were going to be big, but would most likely still have been wrong about which manufacturer to back. The answer with hindsight, as Warren Buffett points out, was to short horses. It is his reason for being reticent in investing in new technology.At the dawn of self-driving vehicles, believers are faced with a similar challenge: do you bet on Tesla Motors, Google, Apple or a traditional carmaker? Predicted safety gains mean you could perhaps short Mr Buffett’s car insurers. There is, however, a lower-risk long alternative: Nvidia, the chipmaker, which sells its graphics processing units to more than 80 companies developing autonomous cars. As an added bonus, it solves the problem of which company to back if you are excited about virtual reality: do not worry about picking between Sony, HTC and Oculus. Nvidia’s graphics processing units power VR too.The shares have been on a tear — up more than 80 per cent this year and a further 3 per cent after-market following strong earnings on Thursday evening. There could easily be big bumps ahead. For now, the relatively old-fashioned business of PC gaming accounts for the bulk of revenues. The adoption of autonomous driving is still frustratingly hard to predict. Virtual reality in its first mass-market offerings could be a flop.But even though it is the best-performing US tech stock this year, Nvidia’s shares do not look to be inhabiting an alternate reality of their own. Its enterprise value is about 20 times estimated 2016 sales — punchy, yes, but about half the multiple at Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer being acquired by SoftBank. And revenues of $1.4bn in the quarter are growing at 24 per cent a year. Forecasts looks unduly modest, pricing in a softening of gross margins. Automotive revenues are less than 10 per cent of the total and most of these are for “infotainment” rather than autonomous driving. There is plenty of road ahead.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
62;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Nvidia climbs amid auto division optimism;Utilities the only US sector to stay in black over the week;Nvidia shares rallied on Friday after the maker of graphics processors posted strong quarterly results and impressed Wall Street with growth in its forward-looking divisions.The company said its sales jumped 13.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to May 1 to $1.31bn, beating estimates of $1.27bn.Revenues in the gaming unit, its largest group, climbed 17 per cent to $687m.However, analysts paid closer attention to rising sales in Nvidia’s data centre and automobiles groups, which are considered to be important areas of opportunity that may help the company lessen its link to the struggling PC market.The data centre division, which produces chips that can be used for artificial intelligence such as applications that allow for computer-driven image recognition, logged a 62.5 per cent year-on-year rise in sales.“We see data centre growth continuing into the [current quarter] largely driven by deep learning/[artificial intelligence] applications, which are still early innings,” said Rick Schafer, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Meanwhile, the autos division that makes products that are used in cars’ information displays, as well as processing chips for self-driving cars, saw a 46.8 per cent jump in sales.Nvidia’s shares rose 15.2 per cent on Friday to $40.98, extending their 12-month rise to 92.5 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, Nordstrom became the latest department store chain to face the wrath of investors after disclosing disappointing quarterly results and a gloomy outlook.The upscale retailer said it expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 a share, down from its previous outlook for $3.10 to $3.35. That compared with analysts’ estimates for $3.20.The news came alongside lacklustre first-quarter results. Like-for-like sales decreased 1.7 per cent, worse than expectations for sales to remain unchanged.Nordstrom shares tumbled 13.4 per cent on Friday to $39.16 and have plummeted by 49.3 per cent over the past year.The weak results from Nordstrom came amid a grim week for US department stores with its peers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s sustaining steep declines as investors fret over rising competition from online and fast-fashion merchants, as well as discount chains.The S&P 500 department store index, which counts just Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s as members, fell 16.4 per cent on the week, compared with an essentially flat broader market.Elsewhere, Acacia Communications, which makes components for fibre-optic networks, rallied by 34.6 per cent to $30.95 in its Nasdaq debut after pricing on Thursday evening at the top of its indicated range.The strong performance by the first venture capital tech deal of the year may come as good news for the initial public offering market, which has seen many groups opt to remain private after a volatile start to 2016 for the financial markets.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had fallen 0.9 per cent to 2,046.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 1.1 per cent to 17,535.3 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4 per cent to 4,717.7.The broad S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent over the week. Utilities was the only sector to make gains, with consumer staples avoiding the brunt of the sell-off. Consumer discretionary, industrial stocks and financials struggled.
63;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2015-11-06T17:46:17Z;Chipmakers and banks lead Wall Street;Broad market slips after solid employment figures point to tighter central bank policy in December;Chip manufacturers Qorvo and Nvidia rallied with US banks on Friday as Wall Street digested a blowout employment report for October.A $1bn share buyback plan and adjusted earnings beat announced after market close on Thursday helped make Apple supplier Qorvo the biggest S&P 500 riser in morning trading.Qorvo shares were up 19.4 per cent to $53.88, with Nvidia’s stock also boosted by higher than expected third-quarter profits.Nvidia reported earnings per share of 44 cents, well above market estimates for 24 cents per share, leading analysts at Jefferies to move their price target up to $38 from $34. The launch of virtual reality headsets will give further momentum to the stock, they argued.“We think as the ecosystem rallies ahead of the official launches of Oculus Rift, HTC’s Vive, and PlayStation VR, this raises awareness of the secular forces favouring Nvidia and improves sentiment for the stock,” they said in a note.Nvidia was up 14.1 per cent to $31.62. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions jumped too on better than expected adjusted earnings, with shares up 7.4 per cent to $86.22.The gains were in contrast to broad weakness in equities following the release of job figures that heightened expectations of a December rate rise by the Federal Reserve.Financials and information technology were the only sectors to gain as the benchmark S&P 500 index slid 0.4 per cent to 2,091.38.Rising rates indicate higher bank profits as the gap between the amount they charge borrowers and the bank’s own cost of borrowing tends to increase. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan all rose more than 2.7 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,830.70, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was flat at 5,127.98. Implied equity volatility, as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index, rose from 15.05 to 15.29.TripAdvisor weighed on the S&P after missing on adjusted third-quarter profits and revenues late on Thursday. The travel booking site reported adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents, shy of the 54 cents expected by the market, and also lowered expectations for the fourth quarter, citing an accelerated investment in new products.Shares fell 9.6 per cent to $75.16 as analysts at Credit Suisse nudged their price target down one dollar to $82.“While this is a sharper-than-expected downward reset to our near-term estimates, we are willing to underwrite what is effectively an investment to improve the conversion rate and ultimately increase the value of TripAdvisor’s ad inventory,” said the analysts.Weight Watchers continued to bulk up after beating on earnings and raising its full-year guidance. Shares in the dieting brand jumped 36.3 per cent to $28.08 and are now up 240 per cent since mid-October, when Oprah Winfrey endorsed the business and bought a 10 per cent stake.Investors less keen on dieting pushed Monster Beverage Corp shares up 14.4 per cent to $151.34. The owner of energy drink brands such as Monster Energy and Relentless beat on sales and earnings on Thursday.
64;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2015-07-07T21:18:28Z;US stocks gyrate sharply on fresh turmoil;Utilities and consumer staples benefit from risk aversion;US equity markets gyrated sharply on Tuesday, ending a volatile day higher after briefly falling below a key technical level as turmoil in China and the eurozone knocked investor confidence.The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,081.34, nearly 2 per cent above lows touched early in the trading day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,776.91.The benchmark US index also pared losses that saw it keel through its 200-day moving average — currently 2,055.27 — as investors sold-off positions in mining, technology and banking stocks heading into the close of trading in European stock markets.While investors remain sceptical that a deal will be reached between Athens and its international creditors, the tone of negotiations softened somewhat as new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos spoke with his counterparts at an emergency summit in Brussels.Strategists said the move in equity markets, which also saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rise 0.1 per cent to 4,997.46, was driven by the Greek talks.“This is headline trading,” Gennadiy Goldberg, a US strategist for TD Securities said. “That’s why you’re seeing the whip from the strong negative to the strong positive. I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.
65;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2015-06-18T11:23:31Z;Internet TV boxes: Nvidia pips Google for Android;Graphics chipmaker’s Shield can stream videos and games and beats Google’s product for ease of use;"One of the more bizarre gadgets to cross the desk of the FT’s Personal Tech column was Sony’s remote control for the original Google TV. Google’s first attempt at a internet-based “cable killer” box was launched in 2010 and Sony’s accessory featured dozens of buttons, including a tiny Qwerty keyboard. It looked totally unapproachable and confusing. Google’s software was little better and was eventually discontinued last year.Now Google is making another bid for control of the living room with Android TV, a big-screen version of its smartphone operating system. Instead of all those buttons, Android TV remotes have a microphone. The idea is you can just tell it what you want to watch and it will find the best results from its own library and hundreds of apps.Unlike its predecessor, Android TV is no embarrassment when stacked up to rival internet-streaming boxes such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, but it still falls short on usability.Searching for more
Google sells its own Android TV set-top box, the Nexus Player, and the software is also being built directly into a growing number of television sets from Sharp and, yes, Sony. I have been testing the more powerful Shield Android TV box, made by Nvidia, a company better known for making high-performance graphics chips for PCs. The Nvidia Shield boasts ultra-high-definition 4K video, dedicated games and a nippy Tegra X1 processor.The Android TV interface is straightforward, organised into rows for apps, games and personalised recommendations. While the range of Android apps that work on TV could be broader, many of the familiar internet video services are available, including Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV and soon HBO. However, Google tends to feature its own Play store and YouTube app more prominently than third-party apps. That is especially true in search results when using that microphone.Google’s voice-to-text technology is first class and it rarely misunderstood the words I was saying. Asking “what will the weather be like tomorrow” produced the right answer. Even more sophisticated queries, such as “games that work with the Nvidia shield controller” or “movies in 4K”, brought back useful results.But while it mostly got the dictation right, it often failed to produce the results I was looking for. Asking for Breaking Bad brought up detailed information about the show and its actors, but no way to watch it. This query also produced a link to Pomodoro Wear, a countdown timer app shaped like a tomato and designed for Google’s Android Wear smartwatch platform.Even Google itself does not seem to know quite how to use Android TV. Its marketing materials suggest asking for “romantic comedies set in New York”. But when I tried that on the Android TV itself, it produced only a list of YouTube videos, the first of which was about Lego sets from a New York toy fair. With no When Harry Met Sally or Manhattan to be found, I can only wonder whether anyone else — including Google’s own staff — has ever searched for something to watch this way.Pressing play
Fortunately, the Nvidia Shield does more than just play videos. With its PC video gaming pedigree, the set-top box has a growing selection of console-quality Android titles such as Portal, Soul Calibur and Doom 3 available to download for $5-15 each, which work with the included Xbox-style joypad. More recent and sophisticated PC games, such as Ultra Street Fighter IV, Borderlands and a range of Lego titles, can be streamed from Nvidia’s cloud-based Grid service, with a separate subscription. With a fast internet connection, the cloud-streaming service worked remarkably well, with only very occasional stuttering.Verdict
Having hundreds of low-priced games available is impressive for a new device, and for people who are committed to the Android platform for their smartphone, tablet and even smartwatch, the Nvidia Shield is the best way to get it on their TV too. But, while Google’s TV technology has come a long way in the last five years, it still feels like a work in progress."
66;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;US judges review central element of insider trading law;;A US prosecutor barely started her argument to defend an insider trading conviction when judges on a US appeals court stopped her in her tracks.They wanted to know if the government had shopped a case until it landed before a judge who saw the insider trading law the way prosecutors had interpreted it: a trader could be found guilty by trading on confidential information if he knew it had been obtained in breach of a duty to keep it confidential.Five other jurists in the courthouse overseeing other insider trading cases had previously ruled – without government objection – that the trader also needed to know that the company insider had received a personal benefit for sharing the secret information.“It looks like the government is taking completely inconsistent views on a critical point of law,” said Judge Barrington Parker, adding: “I’m concerned that the government’s position on key [points] of the law seems to be varied depending on what judge you’re talking to.”The opening salvo set the tone for a series of targeted and at times rapid-fire questioning of Antonia Apps, a prosecutor with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan over the convictions of Anthony Chiasson, a former portfolio manager with Level Global, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager with Diamondback Capital.The men were convicted of securities fraud for trading after learning from their research analysts confidential earnings data about Dell and Nvidia before it was publicly announced.Both men are seeking acquittals or new trials on the grounds that Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, erred when instructing the jury on the legal requirements to find guilt.The inconsistency the judges homed in on also relates to the recent conviction of Michael Steinberg, a former portfolio manager with SAC Capital whose analyst was part of the ring that received confidential earnings information about Dell and Nvidia. Mr Steinberg will be sentenced next month and has not yet formally appealed.His lawyer Barry Berke, who was present at the argument, previously asked that the case be moved before a different judge in part because he argued prosecutors had used a legal procedure to keep it in front of Mr Sullivan.Ms Apps disagreed with the assessment and said the law was clear. She also noted that the defendants could infer that the company insiders received a benefit because they were sophisticated enough to know that specific earnings information was not supposed to be relayed to traders.The panel of three judges pressed the prosecutor on the point saying there was no bright line for the industry.We sit in the financial capital of the world and the atmosphere that you have . . . gives precious little guidance to all the institutions, all the hedge funds that are trying to come up with some bright line rule of what they can and can’t do“If I’m in the business 15 minutes versus 15 years there seems to be a different standard of criminal exposure. At the end of the day if you follow your position to its logical conclusion – the person likely to be guilty is the person the government decided to indict,” Judge Parker said.Defence lawyers argued a leading 1983 Supreme Court decision called Dirks v. SEC was the guiding principle.In that case the court that if an insider breached a fiduciary duty, courts are required to “focus on objective criteria, ie, whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.”Ms Apps said Dirks applied only to the company insider. The trader did not have to know of the benefit, she said, only that there was a breach of a duty.Ms Apps apologised for interrupting Judge Ralph Winter, who said: “Don’t apologise, you’re doing fine.”Judge Parker added: “We sit in the financial capital of the world and the atmosphere that you have . . . gives precious little guidance to all the institutions, all the hedge funds that are trying to come up with some bright line rule of what they can and can’t do.”He previously asked Stephen Fishbein, a lawyer for Mr Newman, what he understood the government’s theory on insider trading to be.“My interpretation is I know it when I see it,” Mr Fishbein said.
67;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2014-04-20T16:03:01Z;Fund managers seek reversal on insider trading conviction;;"Two former hedge fund managers found guilty of insider trading hope to persuade a US appeals court to throw out their convictions by arguing that the government failed to prove a central element of the law.A three-judge panel sitting on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will hear arguments on Tuesday in the case of Anthony Chiasson, a former money manager with Level Global, and Todd Newman, a former money manager at Diamondback Capital.The men were convicted of securities fraud for trading after learning from their research analysts confidential earnings data about Dell and Nvidia before it was publicly announced.At issue in the case is whether Mr Chiasson and Mr Newman knew the that insiders at the tech companies received a benefit in exchange for passing information to analysts that was later passed on to the defendants.The defence is arguing the judge erred by failing to instruct the jury that it needed to make that finding and is asking for an acquittal of all charges or a new trial.“This has a very good chance of having legs and [winning] a reversal of convictions,” said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University.The question arises from the way insider trading laws have evolved in the US. There is no explicit insider trading statute; rather the law has been defined through court interpretations.Defence lawyers hinge their argument on a leading 1983 Supreme Court decision called Dirks v. SEC. In that case the court ruled that to be liable for insider trading the government must prove the receiver of the tip knew that the material non-public information was given in breach of a duty.To decide if an insider breached a fiduciary duty, it said courts are required to “focus on objective criteria, ie, whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings,” the court wrote.Prosecutors have argued that the Supreme Court has never required the government to prove the receiver of the tip knew that the insider received a personal benefit, just that the duty had been breached.The government said that to satisfy the breach requirement they needed to “prove knowledge of enough facts to distinguish conduct that is likely culpable from conduct that is entirely innocent”.The court’s decision won’t be known for months. It is unlikely to impact most of the other five dozen insider trading convictions won by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan. In many of those the judge did instruct the jury that it needed to find that the defendant knew that insider received a benefit.Michael Steinberg, a former SAC Capital portfolio manager, could benefit from a reversal. His trial was also held before the same judge who issued the same instruction to the jury. Mr Steinberg, who was convicted in December, is awaiting sentencing.If the court agrees with the defendants it could acquit him of the charges, order a new trial, or find the error was harmless and affirm the convictions. If the court does reverse the convictions it would mar the perfect record held by the US attorney’s office in its crackdown on insider trading among Wall Street professionals.Mr Cox of Duke University said a reversal could also have ramifications in the future. “The government has a lot at stake on this appeal because any sort of appearance or tightening of a restriction limits their [prosecution] discussions going forward,” he said."
68;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2014-04-01T16:35:41Z;US casinos gain from Chinese gambling appetite;;Shares in US casinos climbed on Tuesday after figures showed gambling revenues in Macau rose by a double-digit rate for the second consecutive month, as demand from Chinese visitors remained robust.Gaming revenues increased 13 per cent from a year earlier to 35.5bn patacas, or $4.4bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The rise was at the top end of analyst expectations for a 10 to 13 per cent advance.Sterne Agee analyst David Bain said he expected upward revisions to earnings estimates in the next several weeks based on better than expected figures for the first three months of the year.“Results were on the high-end of recent expectations and we believe, provide solace for those with macro-China concerns – something that caused disruption in the otherwise upward momentum for Macau names,” Mr Bain said.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed 2.26 per cent to close at $227.18, MGM resorts rose 2.59 per cent to $26.53 and Melco Crown Entertainment increased 5.67 per cent to $40.84. All three companies have properties in Macau.Ford Motor led US automakers higher following better than expected monthly sales figures.The second-largest US car manufacturer reported a 3.4 per cent rise in sales in March as buyers returned to dealership showrooms as the weather eased.The Detroit-based company sold 244,167 vehicles last month, compared with 236,160 in the same month a year earlier.Ford was joined by Chrysler and Toyota in besting Wall Street estimates, as sales rose 11 per cent and 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, respectively. General Motors initially delayed its monthly report due to a computer issue, but later announced that sales in March were 4.1 per cent higher on last year.Shares in Ford rose almost 5 per cent to $16.31 while General Motors slipped 0.23 per cent to $34.34.Intuitive Surgical shares climbed after the company announced it had won regulatory approval to bring a new surgical system to the US market.The company said the Food and Drug Administration cleared its da Vinci Xi Surgical System, a new system that uses minimally invasive approaches to abdominal surgeries.“We view this as a significant positive for Intuitive Surgical, as it has the potential to both drive a replacement cycle and further increase penetration/utilisation within hospitals,” JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson said.Intuitive Surgical ended 12.7 per cent higher at $493.60, leading the benchmark S&P 500.Nvidia, the chipmaker, advanced following a broker upgrade to ‘market outperform’ on Tuesday as analysts at JMP Securities warmed to the company’s focus on the cloud market.“The company is successfully realigning its business model to more stable growth and gross margin opportunities, and, in our opinion, is in a position to deliver earnings upside in coming quarters,” analyst Alex Gauna said.Mr Gauna established a $26 price target on the company and said Nvidia should benefit from an increase in sales of its Tegra mobile processor for auto applications. He noted PC headwinds should also be lower than in past years.Shares in Nvidia increased just over 4 per cent to $18.65.Overall, US equities strengthened for the third consecutive day following a rise in the monthly ISM manufacturing survey. The report showed improving new orders and production activity at the country’s manufacturers.Millan Mulraine, a strategist with TD Securities, said gains in key forward looking indicators in the monthly ISM report pointed to “sustained upside momentum” in the future.“This report offers an upbeat assessment on US manufacturing sector momentum in March, and more importantly with the key forward-looking heading higher, it provides a constructive outlook on the performance of this crucial sector,” he said.The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,885.52 after touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.46 per cent to close at 16,532.61. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 1.64 per cent to end the day at 4,268.04.
69;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2013-12-15T15:22:03Z;Steinberg in hands of jury in SAC insider trading case;;When the jury begins this week to deliberate the fate of Michael Steinberg, a former SAC Capital portfolio manager accused of trading on inside information, their decision will turn on whether they believe his former analyst had connections at Dell and Nvidia which he used to supply confidential information to Mr Steinberg.Mr Steinberg would not testify in his own defence, his lawyer Barry Berke said on Friday, signalling that he believed he had sufficiently discredited Jon Horvath, his former analyst and the key government witness, over five days of cross-examination.Prosecutors wrapped up their case on Friday after three weeks of testimony in the criminal trial.During nine days on the witness stand, Mr Horvath testified that Mr Steinberg had told him after he lost money on trades that he needed to get “proprietary information”, which he understood to mean confidential information.Mr Horvath explained to the jury that he had subsequently tapped into a “circle of friends” including analysts at other hedge funds who had sources at public companies.One of those analysts was Jesse Tortora, a friend of Mr Horvath’s. Mr Tortora has pleaded guilty and testified earlier in the trial for the government.Mr Horvath said he began funnelling confidential earnings information about Dell and Nvidia to Mr Steinberg from at least 2008-09.“I had told Mike that Jesse had a contact at Dell inside the company,” Mr Horvath testified.Mr Horvath worked for Mr Steinberg at Sigma Capital, a unit of SAC, the hedge fund founded by Steven Cohen.Mr Horvath and SAC have pleaded guilty to insider trading.Mr Berke, Mr Steinberg’s lead lawyer, spent five days cross-examining Mr Horvath, trying to show him as someone who was lying about Mr Steinberg to win leniency and avoid prison. He also elicited testimony that suggested Mr Steinberg did not explicitly know who Mr Horvath’s company sources were.For Mr Steinberg to be found guilty of insider trading, prosecutors have to prove that he traded on important, non-public information in breach of a duty to keep it confidential.Mr Berke said on Friday he intended to call only three witnesses, including an expert to testify on trading patterns, and two lawyers who will be used to introduce emails and other records.Mr Steinberg faces more than 20 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud.He is the eighth former SAC employee to be charged with insider trading while at the hedge fund. Six have pleaded guilty.
70;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2013-07-09T18:59:07Z;Supercomputers: Battle of the speed machines;The US is falling behind China in the race to produce the world’s fastest computers;"With its flying buttresses and domed roof, the Terascale Simulation Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was built as a cathedral to the supercomputer.The design may suggest some religious reverence for the all-powerful machines. More practically, though, it means they are unencumbered by supporting columns, saving space and creating a more direct route for the arteries of cables to feed and cool the world’s fastest supercomputers. But less than 10 years after being built, the building is already in danger of becoming outdated.“When we designed this building, we thought it would be good for 50 years but already it’s only adequate and not robust,” says Mike McCoy, who leads the supercomputing effort at Lawrence Livermore as director of the Advanced Simulation and Computing programme.Even its name risks becoming an anachronism. Terascale computing has been superseded by petascale computing – 1,000 times faster. By 2020, we will be in the exascale age– a thousand times faster again.Located less than an hour’s drive from San Francisco, the laboratory – a mile-square high-security campus with 6,000 workers – was built to simulate nuclear tests, thus safeguarding the US nuclear stockpile.The first supercomputer housed here was the fastest in the world for nearly four years. But the latest to replace it – called Sequoia – was the world’s fastest for only six months before being overtaken last November by Titan – another Department of Energy machine at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.Last month, Milky Way 2, based at the National Supercomputing Centre in Guangzhou, gave China a decisive lead over Titan on the Top 500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers, offering more than double the performance, at 55 petaflops, or 55 quadrillion operations per second.China is now expected to be first to exascale – the target of an international race also involving the EU, India, Japan and Russia. The winner would be first to reap the significant scientific and economic advantages from supercomputers that can be used for everything from detecting weather patterns to making a more efficient combustion engine.China’s lead comes as budget gridlock in Washington means there is no approved plan – or funding in place – for the US to reach exascale computing by 2020. It is a source of intense frustration among US scientists, engineers and technology companies that have been accustomed to dominating the field and maintaining their technical superiority.Touring the 48,000 sq ft computing floor at the Terascale facility, the big names of American high technology are represented: Sequoia consists of rows and rows of IBM’s Blue Gene Q servers, with 96 racks packed with 1.6m processing cores. Older machines feature Sun Microsystems servers powered by Intel processors. But these tech titans will be joined – and possibly replaced – by Chinese brands as the country increases its investment and expertise.Mr McCoy says the building could soon begin creaking under the strain of the latest machines: “The density of the racks is getting so huge they may exceed the capacity of this floor to support them. A single rack of Blue Gene Q weighs 4,400lbs but they could get up to 10,000lbs and we would barely be able to bring them up in the elevators.”But weight is the least of the problems that need to be overcome to reach exascale computing. Engineers must also reduce the computers’ power requirements, create potent software and remove memory bottlenecks. Resiliency – the ability of the machines to run for more than a day to complete their tasks – is also an important issue. With more than 100m operating parts, supercomputers need the ability to self-heal.China has approved a five-year plan for them to get to exascale. They’re as serious as a heart attackAn exascale computer, capable of a quintillion – or 10 to the power of 18 – floating point operations per second, could probably be built today. But it would draw about 100MW of power, equivalent to that used by 80,000 US homes. The US plan to achieve exascale will require lower-power chips, denser circuitry and more efficient cooling to be developed.Inside an armadillo-shaped auditorium at Livermore, scientists give presentations on the simulations they are achieving in the petaflop era: a tomography of the planet, showing seismic activity under the surface; the inner workings of the human heart; and how best to optimise the firing of the 192 giant lasers in the adjoining National Ignition Facility. In a simulation of the effect of a nuclear bomb, the world’s largest laser system is focused on an object the size of a pencil eraser, triggering an explosion lasting 20 nanoseconds.While these simulations are impressive, they lack the resolution and scale that exaflop computing will make possible.Simulation has become the third leg of science alongside theory and experimentation, says Steve Scott, chief technology officer at Nvidia, whose 18,600 Kepler processors help power the Titan machine in Tennessee.“There are fundamental problems in science that do need an exaflop and new sciences will be enabled as well, so it can be transformative,” he says. “For example, scientists believe you need to do a global climate model at a 1km resolution to understand cloud convections and ocean eddies that are really important to the process. That needs exaflops.”It is this kind of work that President Barack Obama referred to in his 2011 State of the Union speech when he acknowledged China had just grabbed the lead in supercomputing.“This is our generation’s Sputnik moment,” he said, comparing supercomputing to the space race between Russia and the US in the 1960s.More than two years later, an exascale strategic plan is only now being submitted to Congress. No direct funding has been approved. Concerned members of Congress have drafted the American High-End Computing Leadership Act to try to co-ordinate and fund the exascale effort in the US.Experts testifying at a House energy subcommittee hearing on it in May warned that the US had fallen behind China and Japan, despite retaining leadership in intellectual property. “I think it would be truly shameful for us to give up the elements of leadership that we have,” said Roscoe Giles, chairman of the Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee.Rick Stevens, co-leader of exascale planning in the Department of Energy’s laboratories, said Washington needed to provide an extra $400m a year for an exascale computer in the US to be feasibly deployed by 2020. Current funding levels would put this back to 2025 – seven years after China is expected to reach exascale.But US tech companies are pressing ahead with their own exascale investments. Intel began assembling an exascale team more than two years ago, hiring Mark Seager, who deployed Livermore’s earlier Blue Gene supercomputers, and Alan Gara, chief architect of three generations of Blue Gene machines. They have launched Xeon Phi, an accelerator processor that China is using in Milky Way 2. Intel plans to keep developing the chip and hopes eventually to seal a partnership with the US Department of Energy – if the bigger funding demands for exascale are met.“In China, the politburo has approved a five-year plan for them to get to exascale,” Mr Seager says. “They have unlimited funding to get there with three parallel developments. They are as serious as a heart attack.”While Milky Way 2 depends on Xeon processors, significant parts of the machine are made in China, including the software “stack” and interconnect – a complex piece of networking equipment that needs to be ultra-efficient in connecting the different banks of processors to one another for parallel computing. A second effort is based entirely on western technology, while a third is completely indigenous but further behind. China has also developed its own processor, nicknamed Godson. Its latest version has eight “cores”, which act as the brains of the chip, and features 1.14bn transistors.“It’s currently believed to be well behind best-of-breed chips like Intel’s,” says Addison Snell, computing analyst with the Intersect360 research firm. “Nevertheless, it’s certainly feasible that by the end of the decade they will be able to field a very large supercomputer made entirely out of Chinese technology.”…China’s move towards a home­grown supercomputer is seen as inevitable, with the US likely in future to limit the export and sale of its best technology for national security and economic reasons. It also wants to have a big say in the establishment of computing standards.“Where we don’t want to go in the near term is in deep hardware partnerships internationally. I think that’s a place where we want to maintain our competitive edge,” Mr Stevens told the congressional subcommittee.Intellectual property is the US’s strongest card, with other exascale efforts already well funded. The EU has three projects under way and $2bn in funding for them over the next three years. The Indian government has committed $2bn and Japan has a $1.1bn investment programme.The lack of US funding means a 1960s-style space race remains a dream, as are the spin-offs that could be expected from new advances in technology.“There would absolutely be a trickle-down from exascale, just as the laptops of today were supercomputers 10 years ago,” says Mr Gara. “We’re not sitting on our hands right now but the lack of investment at the high end means that we don’t push as hard in some interesting dimensions that have historically paid dividends for mainstream technology.”The space race analogy is a false one, says Mr Snell. The moon, he adds, was a final destination, while beyond the exaflop there are zettaflop and yottaflop targets.“The goal is always receding into the distance – and this is the nice thing about supercomputing – it’s really a tool for science and engineering where there are always harder problems to solve. Until we’ve reached the end of science, we will always need more powerful tools.”While the fastest computer does not always produce the best science, for a country used to being at the leading edge of science and technology, not being competitive in its ultimate expression could be damaging to national pride and competitiveness.“We are in a perilous place right now. Leadership is ours to lose,” Mr McCoy says. “We have to make a decision. Do we want to control the instruction sets, the programming models? Do we want American technology in these machines or do we want someone else’s in 15 years?”…From nappy absorption to the apocalypseWhether measuring the decay and safety of the US nuclear stockpile or improving the absorbency of nappies for American babies, the power of supercomputers to simulate conditions from the cradle to the apocalypse is proving vital in materials science.At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, years of simulations of atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions have evolved into larger projects of modelling the planet’s weather patterns and creating a subsurface seismic topography – although earthquakes remain as unpredictable as ever.Just outside the high-security perimeter of the complex, a High-Performance Computing Center was established two years ago to establish partnerships with industry – allowing companies to buy time on supercomputers to create their own simulations and improve their products.“Leadership is about being able to model physical systems that can be a strategic and economic advantage for this country,” says Mike McCoy, director of the Advanced Simulation and Computing programme. “Think of how a Boeing or Ford or IBM could make use of this.”The partnerships are still in their early stages. Apart from nappy discussions with Johnson & Johnson, the most impressive feat is the Cardioid project – a simulation of the electrophysiology of the human heart that can model its reaction to drugs intended to treat conditions such as arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat.At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Titan supercomputer is being used to simulate fuel chemistries to try to create engines that are 25-50 per cent more efficient in the combustion process.Exascale computing will allow modelling that goes beyond a single part of the body or unit of a machine.“Manufacturers designing complicated machinery won’t have to focus on single-point designs in future,” says Jack Wells, director of science at Oak Ridge.“We can do whole ensembles of design and collapse months-long workflows into one day.”——————————————-Quest for the world’s fastest computer1958 Seymour Cray, the “father of supercomputing”, leaves Sperry Corporation to join Control Data Corporation. Two years later, Cray finishes the CDC 604, the first solid-state computer. It is followed by the CDC 6600 in 1964. In 1968 he introduces the 7600, then the fastest computer in the world at 36MHz.1976 Cray builds the Cray 1, which was installed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for $8.8m. It has a speed of 160m floating-point operations per second, or 160 megaflops. The Cray-1 has a “C” shape that allows the integrated circuits to be closer together. It is cooled with a refrigeration system using Freon. The Cray Y-MP, released in 1988, sustains over 1 gigaflop on many applications.1990 NEC’s SX-3/44R becomes the world’s fastest supercomputer with a four-processor model. Fujitsu’s Numerical Wind Tunnel, installed in 1993 at Tokyo’s National Aerospace Laboratory, reaches 124.5 gigaflops. By the end of the 20th century, Intel’s ASCI Red supercomputer is the fastest, using Pentium Pro processors. It has 12 terabytes of disk storage.2005 IBM’s Blue Genie is installed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. By 2007, it reaches 478.2 teraflops.2013 Milky Way 2, based at the National Supercomputing Centre in Guangzhou, gives China the lead in supercomputing with 55 petaflops, or 55 quadrillion (10 to the power of 18) operations per second.——————————————-Letter in response to this article:China’s influence on the world can only increase / From Dr Paul Jowett"
71;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2013-06-20T17:26:56Z;Nvidia: ups and downs;Microchip group has to win as a supplier to mobile devices;"Nvidia just can’t win. On Wednesday morning, the American microchip company’s shares rallied 7 per cent on news that it would license its intellectual property to other chipmakers. The news put a dent in the shares of Arm Holdings, which also licenses graphics designs. The jump makes sense: licensing is a high-return business, and gives Nvidia a way to participate in mobile computing by potentially hawking its designs to Apple or Samsung.But by Thursday morning Nvidia’s shares were right back where they started. At $14, the shares carry an above-market price/earnings multiple of 16 times. But this looks low. The company has $6 a share in net cash. Back that out and the p/e falls to under 9 times, well below, say, Intel. Netting out cash can make stocks look cheaper than they are. Cash can be taxed, or fumbled away by management, before shareholders see it. But Nvidia has made a fuss of its plan to return cash to shareholders. What is more, graphics processing units – the meat of Nvidia’s business – while they are primarily used in personal computers, have a better growth outlook than PC processors generally. MKM Partners, for example, sees Nvidia’s GPU business growing 12 per cent over the next two years; it expects Intel’s PC chip business to be nearly flat.One tricky issue is Nvidia’s decision to enter the market for integrated chips for mobile devices, which combine a core computing, graphics and wireless modem. These made up about a sixth of Nvidia’s revenue last year. Mobile market leaders Apple and Samsung design their own, and low-end smartphones and tablets use cheaper chips from the likes of China’s MediaTek. This leaves Nvidia fighting it out with Qualcomm for the mid-tier device makers such as HTC, Nokia, LG or Motorola. Until Nvidia can show that this is a winnable fight, its shares are likely to stay cheap.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
72;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-12-11T20:49:37Z;Insider trading case turns on Dell sources;Circle of friends at centre of trial;Prosecutors and defence lawyers behind the latest US government case in the crackdown on insider trading agreed on one thing: the case turns on whether the jury believes the two hedge fund traders knew that alleged tips about Dell’s earnings came from company insiders.Prosecutor Antonia Apps told the jury “it wasn’t a coincidence” that Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, the two portfolio managers charged with insider trading, had made big bets that Dell stock would drop in August 2008 the day before the company announced poor earnings that sent its shares tumbling 14 per cent.It was not because their forecasting models were better than the rest of Wall Street, she said. “It was because they had a secret pipeline to insiders at the company.”The US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged Mr Chiasson, co-founder of hedge fund Level Global, and Mr Newman, a portfolio manager with Diamondback Capital, along with a half a dozen others, in an alleged $62m insider trading scheme.The case alleged the biggest profit from insider trading until last month when authorities charged Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager with a unit of SAC Capital, in an alleged $276m insider trading scheme. Mr Martoma’s lawyer has said he expected to be fully exonerated.Authorities allege Mr Chiasson and Mr Newman were tipped off by their analysts, members of a “circle of friends” that linked back to an investor relations official at Dell and a friend in accounting at Nvidia, a technology company. Prosecutors allege the pair traded on secret information about Nvidia.By passing secret financial information, such as gross margin, on to the traders in advance of earnings in 2008 and 2009, the hedge funds allegedly made huge bets that resulted in big profits.John Nathanson, a lawyer for Mr Newman, told the jury that the case rose and fell on the testimony of Jesse Tortora, a former Diamondback Capital analyst who pleaded guilty and co-operated with the government. “Mr Tortora lied to you and he cannot and should not be trusted,” he said.Mr Tortora testified early in the four-week trial that he repeatedly passed specific secret earnings information to Mr Newman and his friend, Spyridon Adondakis, an analyst at Level Global. Mr Adondakis, who also pleaded guilty, testified at trial against his boss, Mr Chiasson.Both men said their bosses knew the information came from contacts at Dell but were less clear about Nvidia. Prosecutors showed an email forwarded to Mr Newman in which one of the friends said he “checked with an accounting manager at Nvidia”. Mr Adondakis testified he did not recall telling his boss that his contact worked at Nvidia but he believed it was implied.“Mr Newman believed he was receiving legitimate work from his analyst,” his lawyer told the jury. He pulled up a series of stock charts to argue that Mr Newman had traded at a loss at times, and also traded at other times inconsistently with the alleged confidential tips he received.“This is the pattern of somebody who’s not sure” of the veracity of the information he gleaned from his analyst, the lawyer said, suggesting it showed his client did not know what the earnings would be.Mr Chiasson’s lawyers are expected to argue their case to the jury on Wednesday, the judge said.
73;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-12-10T22:03:09Z;Fiscal cliff talks weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks saw muted traded gains on Monday as fiscal cliff negotiations in Washington to prevent a possible economic recession continued to hang over US equities.The S&P 500 traded within a limited range before finishing roughly flat for the day at 1,418.55.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.3 per cent to 2,986.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,169.88.Investor focus remained squarely on talks between Republicans and Democrats to resolve the pending expiration of tax cuts and mandatory spending cuts at the end of the year.News that President Barack Obama and Republican John Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday to discuss the fiscal cliff provided a little relief.But investors said the incremental signs of progress did little to alleviate downward pressure on US equities. On Monday, many tried to assess the likelihood of a successful resolution as well as its possible effect on stocks.David Bianco, US equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, said: “Averting the cliff before Christmas will probably rally the S&P 500 to 1500 by year-end or early January, provided the 2013 fiscal drag does not exceed 1.5 per cent and is not mostly tax hikes.”However, some investors were less optimistic that politicians would resolve the host of budgetary issues.Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays, said: “In the near-term, we believe risks for both earnings and stocks are on the downside given the low probability of a grand bargain in the budget negotiations, [which would put] public sector debt on a sustainable path.”Shares in McDonald’s rose 1.1 per cent to $89.41 as the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain by sales reported a stronger-than-expected increase in same-store sales for November.However, Andy Barish, analyst at Jefferies, said the results did little to ease the challenges McDonald’s faces next year, which included pressure on its gross margins.Financial sector stocks fell 0.3 per cent on the day ahead of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting set to kick off on Tuesday.JPMorgan Chase shares fell 0.6 per cent to $42.31 while Goldman Sachs added 0.4 per cent to $117.01.American International Group shares were down 2.3 per cent to $33.36 as the US insurance group said it would sell a majority stake in its plane-leasing unit, ILFC, for $4.23bn.Shares in Marathon Oil lost 1.8 per cent to $30.36 as its chief operating officer, who some analysts had expected was in line for the top job at the upstream oil company, resigned unexpectedly.Apple continued its recent struggles as the iPhone and iPad maker saw its market capitalisation fall back below $500bn.Shares in the world’s largest company by market value declined 0.6 per cent to $529.82.The losses weighed initially on the information tech sector, which slipped as much as 0.8 per cent. But stocks in the sector rebounded and were trading in positive territory on strong gains by chipmakers Micron Technology and Nvidia Corp.Shares in Micron were 3.7 per cent higher to $6.67 while Nvidia rose 3.4 per cent to $12.36.Groupon, the daily deals company, lost 9.3 per cent to $4.25, as it gave back some of its gains from Friday when its shares rose by nearly $1 on takeover rumours.CME Group, the futures exchange operator, declined 1.6 per cent to $54.05 after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded their rating on its shares from “buy” to “sell”.“Although we view CME as the leading global futures exchange, with resilient margins and a powerful capital deployment strategy, we believe the [market consensus] is too optimistic on CME’s near-term earnings per share outlook given the most recent volume and open interest trends,” the Goldman report said.
74;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-11-14T00:01:44Z;Managers traded on Dell tips, court told;;The key witness in the federal insider trading case against two former hedge fund managers testified that he passed secret information about Dell’s earnings to his boss at Diamondback Capital Management who then traded on it.Jesse Tortora, the former research analyst, testified that he told his boss, Todd Newman, that his former colleague, Sandeep Goyal, had a contact inside Dell.“I told Todd verbatim what Sandy told me,” Mr Tortora testified. When asked by prosecutor Antonia Apps what he told Mr Newman, Mr Tortora said: “The same thing Sandy is telling me …I passed on to Todd and obviously [the] person worked for Dell.”The testimony came on the first day in the insider trading trial against Mr Newman and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global. Both men have pleaded not guilty.Prosecutors allege the two former hedge fund managers “crossed a criminal line” when they traded after receiving secret information about Dell and Nvidia from their research analysts. The research analysts have all pleaded guilty.Lawyers for Mr Chiasson and Mr Newman said their clients were unaware of the analysts network of insiders.“Any line crossing was unknown to Todd Newman. He thought he was getting legitimate research,” said Stephen Fishbein, Mr Newman’s attorney. “He didn’t cheat. He didn’t steal,” he added.Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr Chiasson, said the analysts acted like they were in Fight Club, referencing the Brad Pitt movie about an underground fighting group. “The first rule of fight club is there is no fight club,” he said, suggesting his client did not know about the arrangement.Mr Tortora is at the centre of the alleged conspiracy. He testified that after receiving the information from Mr Goyal and another Dell insider he met through an expert network firm, which matches money managers with company officials, he passed it to Mr Newman and his group of friends. The defence is likely to argue that Mr Newman didn’t know that Mr Goyal’s source was a corporate insider prohibited from sharing the information.One friend Mr Tortora allegedly told was Sam Adondakis, Mr Chiasson’s analyst. Mr Tortora testified he told Mr Adondakis, a friend, “about Sandy’s information.” Mr Adondakis “told me he passed it on to his superiors Chiasson and [David] Ganek for the purpose of trading,” Mr Tortora testified. Mr Ganek, who co-founded Level Global after leaving SAC Capital, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have identified him as an unindicted co-conspirator.Mr Tortora said he learnt from Mr Goyal on August 5, 2008, that Dell’s gross margin would fall short of analyst estimates. He emailed Mr Newman that “gm looking a 17.5 per cent vs street at 18.3 per cent.” Mr Tortora then forwarded that email onto his friends.Prosecutors showed an instant message sent by Mr Newman to Mr Tortora asking “the Dell from Sandy?”Mr Tortora replied, “y[es] on the phone with him now”.Prosecutors allege when Dell announced its earnings in August 2008 the stock fell 14 per cent in one day. Mr Newman’s firm, which placed a bet the stock would drop, made $2.8m while Mr Chiasson’s firm, which also bet the stock would fall, made $50m.
75;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-09-25T22:31:50Z;Texas Instruments retreats from smartphones;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by revenues, is beating a retreat from the smartphone and tablet markets as competition intensifies.Once the leading manufacturer of chips for wireless devices globally, TI has been overtaken in recent years by its US rival Qualcomm, while new entrants such as Nvidia and Intel have appeared and device makers Apple and Samsung have been designing their own mobile chips.The chipmaker, based in Dallas, Texas, told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that TI’s chips for smartphones and tablets were “less attractive” with the emergence of a few large players and changing market trends.It would be “reprofiling” its investment in those markets and concentrating on addressing the broader market of embedded processing, the company said. TI makes a wide range of chips for many different industries.“In effect, the company will stop investing in R&D for new products in those markets, and instead focus on a more horizontal approach,” said Sumit Dhanda, semiconductor analyst with the International Strategy and Investment group, in a note.ISI estimates TI has 10 customers and $900m in annual revenues for its smartphone and tablet chips. Its shares closed 3 per cent lower at $27.83 on the news.A TI processor features in the new Kindle Fire HD tablet, but its only input in the iPhone 5 is a touchscreen controller chip, according to the IHS iSuppli research firm.That showed Qualcomm provided the baseband wireless processor for the handset and Samsung manufactured Apple’s A6 microprocessor.
76;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-09-07T16:49:02Z;Intel cuts forecast amid softer PC demand;;"Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, has issued a sales warning as consumers spend more on tablets and smartphones and the PC industry slows ahead of the release of Windows 8.The Silicon Valley company, whose microprocessors feature in four out of every five PCs sold, said chip sales would probably be more than $1bn less than forecast for the third quarter.Its shares fell more than 2 per cent, while those of rival chipmakers Nvidia and AMD dropped more than 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.PC makers have been running down inventories in a slow period for sales and with uncertainty over demand ahead of the release of Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system on October 26.Intel said: “Relative to the prior forecast, the company is seeing customers reducing inventory in the supply chain versus the normal growth in third-quarter inventory; softness in the enterprise PC market segment; and slowing emerging market demand.”Strength in the enterprise and emerging markets had helped Intel in recent quarters as consumers spent less on PCs and more on mobile devices such as the iPad and iPhone.However, PC shipments to China fell 4.5 per cent in the second quarter – their first ever year-on-year decline, according to a report last week from Gartner, the research group.The company said another area of strong demand, for server microprocessors used in data centres, was meeting expectations.But “weaker-than-expected demand in a challenging macroeconomic environment” meant revenues were anticipated to be $13.2bn, plus or minus $300m, compared to a previous forecast of $13.8bn to $14.8bn.Sumit Dhanda, analyst with the ISI research firm, said: “While Intel's pre-announcement itself was not wholly unexpected, the magnitude of the reduction in revenue guidance seems large.”Intel is expected to show off thin Ultrabook laptops with touchscreens and hybrid tablet/laptop convertibles at its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week. But these will only be introduced in the fourth quarter and PC makers are still struggling to bring costs down and make such devices affordable for mainstream consumers.The IHS iSuppli research firm predicted this week that an era of “Wintel” dominance was coming to an end due to the much faster-growing tablet and smartphone markets, where chips based on designs of the UK’s Arm and operating systems from Apple and Google held commanding leads.It forecast that Windows’ share of the PC, tablet and smartphone market would slip from 44 per cent in 2011 to 33 per cent in 2016, while Intel’s share would drop from 41 per cent to 29 per cent. However, it said the total size of the market would double over the five years.Intel has failed to make any serious inroads into the smartphone and tablet markets thus far and will face a challenge in laptops, with a version of Windows for PCs being released next month that will run on Arm-based chips for the first time.Intel reduced its third-quarter gross margin forecasts by one percentage point on Friday, from 63 per cent to 62 per cent.It said capital spending for the year was now expected to be below the low end of its previous forecast of $12.1bn to $12.9bn, with the company accelerating the reuse of existing equipment for its next “shrink” of microprocessors to circuits that will be 14 billionths of a metre wide."
77;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-08-09T21:17:03Z;Wall Street stocks edge higher;;News Corp shares touched their highest level in five years as investors took a $2.8bn writedown of the company’s newspaper business in their stride.After-market traders had sent the stock down more than three percentage points on Wednesday evening following the announcement.But the widely traded class A shares climbed as much as 1.4 per cent to $24.05 in early trading on Thursday. The stock retreated by market close but was down just 0.3 per cent to $23.82.Attention overnight had focused on the scale of the writedown in the publishing business, which is to be demerged from News Corp’s entertainment business.But some analysts remained upbeat. “[It is] worth noting the company still hit their 2012 full-year guidance and also delivered a robust guidance outlook for 2013,” Jason Bazinet at Citigroup told clients.Despite strong data showing an unexpected fall in unemployment insurance claimants and a narrowing trade deficit, broader markets were generally flat.The S&P 500 closed fractionally up at 1,402.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1 per cent to 13,165.19 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index went up 0.3 per cent to 3,018.64.E Trade Financial rose 6.9 per cent to $8.57 after the online share trading company announced the exit of its chief executive.E Trade has faced pressure from shareholders, including Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, to explore a sale as shares have fallen 30 per cent in the past year amid subdued US equity trading volumes. Michael Tarkan, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said the departure of Steven Freiberg, who will be temporarily replaced by chairman Frank Petrilli, would rekindle takeover talk.But Mr Tarkan warned: “A potential acquirer would also likely have to provide a sizeable capital infusion to mark the company’s loan portfolio to current market value”, potentially putting off suitors.Monster Beverage fell 9.7 per cent to $61.20 as second-quarter revenue and earnings missed analyst expectations and the energy drink company said its gross margin, a measure of profitability, was down on the same period last year.However, Mark Astrachan, at Stifel Nicolaus, maintained his “buy” recommendation, telling clients: “We believe [the slowdown in sales] is more a function of timing than materially slowing end-demand.”Windstream Corporation declined 7.5 per cent to $9.30 as the internet provider’s expenses rose sharply, more than offsetting higher revenues and pushing quarterly earnings down 2 per cent compared with the same period in 2011.Nomura analysts highlighted losses in the consumer business, which Mike McCormack said “could signal increasing competition, which may lead to aggressive pricing or higher capital spending”.Kohl’s shares dropped 1.2 per cent to $51.42 after the department store chain reported weaker than expected sales and a 20 per cent slide in net income. It also lowered guidance for the third quarter.Paul Lejuez, a retail sector analyst at Nomura, said: “Kohl’s strategy for the second half of 2012 is to bring in more inventory units as management is willing to sacrifice gross margins to take back market share.“But we think having more units in the store is a risky strategy that could result in more markdowns than planned.”Seagate Technology and Western Digital, makers of hard disc drives, made gains after Lazard Capital analysts initiated coverage on the sector with “buy” recommendations on both.The sector was hit hard last year when widespread flooding in Thailand disrupted supply chains, while the increasing popularity of solid state drives threaten to eat into sales.But Edward Parker at Lazard told clients that the sector’s two largest companies by market share could prosper as smaller rivals struggle. “Despite ongoing signs of weakening demand and the receding of peak margins, we believe consolidation and the aftermath of the floods in Thailand have changed the pricing dynamics of the industry.”Western Digital rose 2.8 per cent to $43.03 and Seagate 1.4 per cent to $33.09.Semiconductor stocks Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology fell 0.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent to $4.37 and $6.81 respectively. Rival Nvidia, which closed up 3.4 per cent to $14.71 on Thursday, jumped even higher in the after-hours market. Shares rose 5.4 per cent to $15.51 after the company beat second-quarter earnings expectations and reported record revenue growth from its smartphone and tablet technology.
78;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-07-10T20:53:17Z;Global slowdown fears weigh on Wall St;;Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled after the company warned that its revenue for the second quarter was expected to drop 11 per cent.The second-largest PC microprocessor maker in the world sank 11.2 per cent to $4.99. AMD, which issued the warning late on Monday, blamed the lacklustre sales in China and Europe for weaker-than-expected quarterly results.It is due to report its second-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.James Covello, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: “The fact that AMD missed its guidance is not surprising to us given several weak PC sales data points.”Goldman Sachs maintained its “sell” rating for AMD with a 12-month target price of $5.50, cut from $6.25. Nomura also reduced its target price from $8 to $6.In another note to its clients, JPMorgan said the stock will remain under pressure given weak PC demand, AMD’s low market share and Intel’s “superior products”. The investment bank lowered its earnings per share estimates for the company to 50 cents from 76 cents for this year.Intel, the close rival of AMD, traded 2.3 per cent lower at $25.56.The world’s biggest chipmaker announced on Monday a $4.1bn investment in Dutch semiconductor equipment-maker ASML as a move to strengthen its research and development capability of smaller chips.Romit Shah, analyst at Nomura, said: “While these investments in ASML do not grant Intel an exclusive access to the tools, we believe Intel will be the biggest beneficiary of these technologies due to its high volume of shipments.”Other technology stocks dropped. IBM decreased 1.8 per cent to $186.26 and Nvidia lost 3.1 per cent to $12.81.Facebook fell 2.2 per cent higher to $31.47. The social networking website was ranked as one of the top 10 US technology companies by market capitalisation over the past month, according to McGraw-Hill Financial.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq, dropped 0.9 per cent to $608.21.Cummins fell 9 per cent to $86.91, as the diesel engine maker also lowered its full year revenue forecast to approximately $4.45 billion, in line with 2011 versus its previous guidance for a growth of 10 per cent year-on-year. The company did not provide specific earnings guidance.“However, we expect pent-up demand for trucks in the US to drive improving revenue trends once economic uncertainty eases,” said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “We still believe CMI is well positioned in truck engines and power generation equipment.” Mr Corridore maintained the “buy” rating for the stock.US equities extended losses on Tuesday after trading in negative territory for the previous three consecutive sessions, as the market swung between being pressured by the soft trade data of China and an easing of the eurozone debt crisis after finance ministers reached agreement to support Spain’s banks.The S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent to 1,341.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,653.12, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index lost 1 per cent to 2,902.33.The consumer staples and utilities indices were the only subgroups that traded in positive territory, rising 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. The materials sectors dropped 1.5 per cent.Shares in aluminium manufacturer Alcoa fell 4.1 per cent to $8.40. The company’s second-quarter results announced after the market closed on Monday were modestly better than expected.S&P Capital IQ upgraded its rating to Alcoa from “hold” to “buy” and raised the company’s 12-month target price from $10 to $11.DuPont, the US chemical company, added 0.4 per cent to $47.65, and Dow Chemical dropped 2 per cent to $30.56.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said third-quarter losses are expected to appear in lower-weighted sectors – materials, utilities and telecoms that account for a total of 10 per cent in the S&P 500.The defensive telecoms index decreased 0.2 per cent on Tuesday. AT&T edged down 0.3 per cent to $35.44, and Verizon also dropped 0.1 per cent to $44.70.Energy stocks remained weak after trading in negative territory for the previous two consecutive sessions.ExxonMobil lost 0.7 per cent to $83.11, and Chevron, the second-largest US oil group by market value, moved down 0.6 per cent to $103.88. ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company by market value, dropped 1.6 per cent to $53.48.Bank stocks were mixed. Morgan Stanley decreased 1.6 per cent to $13.71 and Goldman Sachs shed 0.2 per cent to $94.25. Bank of America lost 1.1 per cent to $7.48, but JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $34.25.
79;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-05-16T04:00:20Z;AMD bridges Ivy gap with Trinity;;Intel told its investor day last week it would be producing 2m units a week of its latest “Ivy Bridge” processors by the end of June, but the chipmaker faces fresh competition from Tuesday’s consumer and business announcements by rivals AMD and Nvidia.AMD launched its second-generation “Trinity” processors, touting longer battery life and lower prices than Intel’s offerings for notebooks and PCs, while Nvidia threatened to challenge Intel in the data centre and enterprise with the unveiling of its VGX graphics processing unit (GPU) platform.AMD finally achieved “Fusion” last year – the codename for marrying a traditional central processing unit (CPU) with a GPU on the same die. Delays following the inception of the concept in 2006, when it bought graphics chipmaker ATI, meant it lost a two-year lead over Intel, which reached the same goal in 2011 with its Core processors, codenamed Sandy Bridge.Despite mis-steps, heavy losses, major management changes and the spinning off of its manufacturing arm into Globalfoundries, AMD has hung in as a competitor, retaining a market share of around 20 per cent to Intel’s 80 per cent in the “x86″ microprocessor market that dominates the PC world.AMD refers to its combined processors as APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) and first-generation ones for PCs and laptops were codenamed Llano. Their Trinity successors just announced are said to offer double the performance per watt and up to 12 hours’ battery life for notebooks.While Intel has a huge marketing campaign underway for the Ultrabook category of thin, fast-starting laptops, AMD sees itself playing in ultrathin notebooks that don’t quite meet Intel’s Ultrabook specification.HP announced “Sleekbooks” last week, featuring both Intel and AMD processors. An AMD one with a 15.6in display will come out a month later than a 14in Intel version, but cost $100 less and feature an hour’s extra battery life – at an estimated nine hours.AMD is also offering an alternative to Intel’s Rapid Start – its Start Now technology can boot a PC in as little as 10 seconds and resume from sleep mode in two seconds.AMD expects Trinity – the official branding will be for A10, A8, A6 and A4 Vision APUs with varying numbers of cores – to feature in all-in-one PCs and traditional designs as well. It boasts that a record number of PC models for the company will use the processor. It did not provide a number (while Intel cited 670 “design wins” at Ivy Bridge’s launch), but named brands such as Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.Lenovo announced a new lineup of Thinkpad laptops on Tuesday, all featuring Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors, with the standout model being the X1 Carbon – “the lightest 14in Ultrabook in the industry” with its carbon-fibre casing helping it weigh only 3lbs.Meanwhile, Nvidia announced technology that would reduce the need for office PCs with powerful Intel processors. At its GPU technology conference in Silicon Valley, it showed off its VGX processor board for servers in data centres. It will deliver a virtualised PC experience to up to 100 users. Applications will be streamed from the cloud, allowing businesses to provide cheaper, more basic terminals for their workers.
80;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-03-05T23:16:59Z;Collaboration: Electric challenges spark cross-industry connections;Rapidly changing technology requires new alliances, finds Chris Bryant;"One of the most idiosyncratic vehicles at the Frankfurt motor show last September was also one of the smallest.Daimler, the German carmaker, and BASF, the world’s largest chemical company, unveiled a two-seat concept car to showcase new lightweight and energy-efficient technologies.The Smart Forvision’s transparent rooftop solar cells and all-plastic wheels embodied the collaborative potential of partnerships outside the traditional bounds of the car industry.The rise of electric vehicles, the incorporation of more electronics and software into the “connected car” and the greater use of lightweight materials are forcing carmakers to seek out new partnerships and expertise.Electronics companies, software programmers, chemical producers and utilities are pushing for a slice of car industry revenues, forcing carmakers to decide which technologies can be outsourced and where their core competencies lie.A more advanced partnership in the material sector is the joint venture between BMW and Germany’s SGL Carbon, which manufactures carbon-fibre material for the i3 and i8, the carmaker’s forthcoming electric vehicles.BMW has long had considerable expertise in using small amounts of carbon fibre in its high-performance M-range but lacked the capability to manufacture efficiently the costly material in large volumes.“We have a manufacturer that can supply us with huge volumes of carbon fibre in the joint venture … [and] was able to design a fibre that perfectly meets the needs of BMW,” says Ulrich Kranz, head of BMW’s Project i.New alliances are evolving most rapidly in the development of batteries, where the technological challenges are greatest; battery performance will be critical to consumer acceptance of electric vehicles.An understanding of battery technology is particularly important for carmakers as it plays an integral role in vehicle power – traditionally the bread-and-butter of car making.Analysts at Lux Research told clients in a recent note that strong partnerships were “critical for success” in advancing electric vehicles.But carmakers may be forced to collaborate with battery suppliers, rather than wielding control over them.General Motors is among several big carmakers working with LG Chem, the South Korean conglomerate. LG supplies lithium-ion battery cells for the Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric car and last year the two companies took their partnership a step further by announcing a joint venture to develop electric vehicles.Similarly, Daimler has partnered with BYD, a Chinese maker of lithium-ion batteries and cars, to develop an electric vehicle; it plans to unveil a design concept at this year’s Beijing motor show.The Stuttgart-based carmaker has also linked up with RWE, the German utility, to roll out electric vehicles in Berlin.The two companies have formed a joint venture with Siemens, BMW, Bosch and utility EnBW to develop an open platform to simplify data exchange in electric vehicle-charging infrastructure.Electronics, telecommunications and software companies are also redefining the traditional relationship of carmaker and supplier as they push into the connected vehicle field.Meanwhile, carmakers are ramping up their presence at consumer electronics and mobile technology trade shows to underscore their capabilities in this area.Accenture, the consultancy, estimates the connected vehicle market will exceed $70bn by 2015.“Of course, there is a lot of interest in different parts of the value chain to get a slice of this business,” says Marcello Tamietti, a car and industrial equipment expert at Accenture.“The technology is evolving so rapidly that carmakers can’t keep up. They are very good at producing cars, power trains, engines and security, but digital technology is not one of their core competencies, and they are looking to alliances to fill the gap.”Volkswagen’s upmarket Audi brand has formed a partnership with Nvidia, the chipmaker, to power its vehicle infotainment systems and digital instrument clusters, while rival Ford has a long-standing partnership with Microsoft.General Motors and BMW are among carmaking members of the Genevi Alliance, which is developing a common open-source platform to improve access to the web and infotainment products in cars. Intel, the chipmaker, is also a member.“The tech component in the car is increasing year on year,” says Mr Tamietti. “Today, about 20 per cent of the value of a car is based on electronics, software and silicon. If you look at the high-end segment it’s even more.”"
81;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-02-28T22:11:06Z;Semiconductor stocks drive Nasdaq rally;;The Nasdaq Composite index hit fresh 11-year highs as Apple shares reached record levels and semiconductor stocks continued to rally on hopes that the bankruptcy filing of Japanese chipmakerElpida would drive up prices of computer memory.The Philadelphia index of semiconductor stocks climbed 1.6 per cent with three-quarters of its constituents posting record gains.Micron Technology, which stands to benefit from an Elpida retreat from the dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) market, rose 3.7 per cent to $8.88. Its shares are up 14 per cent this week and at their highest level since last June. Novellus Systems also climbed 3.7 per cent to $47.02.However, Nomura analysts – who on Monday had said D-Ram prices would not recover until late in 2012 because of continued disruption to the supply chain for personal computers – posted another downbeat note.They forecast weak demand for semiconductor chips from android smartphone makers, which they said would lose market share to Apple’s iPhones.“The Android tablet market is likely dead …Most of the tier 1 phones lack differentiation …Apple has done it again,” Romit Shah told Nomura clients from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Apple shares increased 1.8 per cent to close at a fresh high of $535.41 on reports it would launch a much-discussed television product alongside the expected introduction of new iPad models in March. That took Apple’s market capitalisation over $500bn, taking it about $90bn clear of ExxonMobil as the world’s largest publicly traded company.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.7 per cent to 2,986.76, having earlier hit 2,988.59. The tech-heavy index is now up by almost 15 per cent for the year compared with a 9 per cent gain for the benchmark S&P 500 as tech stocks – and Apple in particular – drive market gains.The S&P 500 also hit a post-financial crisis high of 1,373.09 before retreating slightly to 1,372.18 for a gain of 0.3 per cent. Investors brushed off an unexpectedly large fall in durable goods orders as other economic data surprised on the upside.“1,377 is a big level of resistance for the S&P 500, where investors may take profit or put on hedges to protect against falls,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “If we push through that, the expectation is the market will rally to 1,400, which would be psychologically important for confidence.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 13,005.12, finally closing above 13,000 for the first time since 2008 having repeatedly fallen back after breaching the psychological barrier several times in intraday trading on Monday and last week.Shares in Priceline.com climbed 7 per cent to $632.76 as the largest US online travel agent by market capitalisation beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales forecasts.Citigroup analysts tipped the shares to reach $850 within 12 months, praising the company’s European sales growth and saying the website’s appeal to value-hunting consumers meant the company “enjoys something of a counter­cyclical hedge in the US”.That triggered a wider rally in online travel companies, with fellow travel agent Expedia up 2 per cent to $33.79.However, analysts said there was limited read across from Priceline’s results to peers.“This is company-specific: Priceline is reaping the rewards of strong investment in advertising and on hotel space in Europe,” said Scott Kessler at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray added that Priceline’s international booking growth was four times greater than Expedia’s.Herman Leung at Susquehanna said Google stood to benefit most with Priceline set to deploy its increasing cash flow to increased spending on online advertising.Google shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $618.39.TripAdvisor, the travel review website spun off from Expedia in December, which relies on advertising by travel companies, was up 1.3 per cent to $32.31.Yahoo shares climbed 0.6 per cent to $14.94 as the company claimed Facebook had infringed on some of its patents.A similar claim by the company against Google shortly before the search giant’s IPO resulted in Yahoo receiving shares in Google as part of a settlement.Shares in the for-profit educator Apollo Group fell 16.3 per cent to $43.04 after the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast and said new degree enrolment in the current quarter would fall short of previous expectations.Shares in Cablevision fell 6 per cent to $14.70 as fourth-quarter profit almost halved compared with the same period in 2011. The cable company lost 14,000 video subscribers during the quarter, far more than analysts had expected.Bank stocks were firm with Bank of America up 1 per cent to $8.12. JPMorgan analysts were upbeat on the bank’s “progress towards resolving its large mortgage issues”.JPMorgan climbed 0.9 per cent to $39.42 as the bank unexpectedly revealed trading revenue by asset class, and announced it would scale back a branch expansion plan at its analyst day.
82;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-02-10T00:26:07Z;Intel pays $6.5m to end New York lawsuit;;Intel is close to winding up a series of antitrust actions against it around the world with an agreement with the New York attorney-general to terminate a lawsuit.Intel said it would pay $6.5m to meet part of New York’s costs for the suit, which was filed in November 2009.The world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues said in a statement that the agreement followed a December ruling that greatly reduced the scope of New York’s case.The agreement “expressly states that Intel does not admit either any violation of law or that the allegations in the complaint are true, and it calls for no changes to the way Intel does business”, it said.“We have always said that Intel’s business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers, and we are pleased this matter has been resolved,” said Doug Melamed, Intel’s general counsel.New York’s original suit had alleged that Dell and other computer makers received billions of dollars in rebates from Intel in exchange for not using processors made by its rival, Advanced Micro Devices.Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn in 2009 in exchange for dropping all complaints against it and it later paid another rival chipmaker Nvidia $1.5bn on similar terms.The Silicon Valley company has been investigated and fined by the European Commission as well as being the subject of inquiries by regulatory bodies in Japan and Korea.It has also reached an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission to use an open industry standard to make it easier for other chipmakers to connect their own products to its chips.
83;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-25T22:14:34Z;Fed boost puts S&P 500 in bull market;FOMC meetings leads to afternoon rally;The S&P 500 closed Wednesday in bull market territory after climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,326.06, a gain of 20.6 per cent since the close on October 3.The market had opened lower as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, added to pressure on the European Central Bank to take a hit on its Greek bond holdings. But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.
84;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Diamondback settles insider trading case;;Diamondback became the first hedge fund to reach a settlement with federal prosecutors in connection with their probe of insider trading on Wall Street as it agreed to pay $9m to resolve allegations it illegally profited from trading in shares of Dell and Nvidia.The US attorney in Manhattan said on Monday that Diamondback would not be prosecuted in exchange for the forfeiture of $6m, its agreement to a statement of facts detailing the “wrongful conduct” of two employees and its continuing co-operation. Diamondback also agreed to pay a fine of $3m to resolve civil insider trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Lawyers said they believed the so-called non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors was the first involving a hedge fund adviser. Non-prosecution agreements and deferred prosecutions are often used by the federal government against companies, especially when enforcing anti-bribery laws.So far, 56 traders, lawyers and consultants have been convicted in the insider trading investigation, dubbed “Operation Perfect Hedge” by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Diamondback’s settlement involved trades made in 2008 and 2009.George Canellos, director of the SEC’s New York office, said that if the settlement is approved by a federal court, “we believe that the proposed settlement appropriately sanctions the misconduct while giving due credit to Diamondback for its substantial assistance in the government’s investigation and the pending actions against former employees and their co-defendants”.Diamondback declined to comment.Todd Newman, a former employee of Diamondback, was one of seven men charged last week in what the authorities called a $62m insider trading scheme. The arrests followed guilty pleas by three others who agreed to co-operate, including Jesse Tortora, a former analyst with Diamondback. Mr Newman’s lawyer could not be reached for comment.Diamondback was one of three hedge funds raided by the FBI in November 2010, prompting many investors to pull their capital from the hedge fund run by Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, who have co-operated with the investigation.From $5.9bn in assets under management in December 2010, the hedge fund now invests about $2.5bn, according to a person familiar with the fund.The fund had reopened to new capital in the second half of last year and had begun to see some inflows. The next deadline for investors to request the return of their capital is March 31, the person said.In a letter to investors, seen by the Financial Times, Diamondback said that it would pay all costs related to the government case and also return to investors $175,000 in commission payments allegedly used by Mr Newman and Mr Tortora to reward a co-conspirator.
85;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-20T16:12:28Z;Charges highlight pursuit of illegal trading;;US authorities escalated their pursuit of illegal trading on Wall Street by announcing new criminal securities fraud charges against seven hedge fund traders and analysts in an alleged scheme exceeding $61m in profits.The arrests of four individuals and guilty pleas entered by three others shows the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US attorney’s office in Manhattan are not letting up, having netted 56 insider trading convictions in recent years.Janice Fedarcyk, the FBI assistant director in charge of the New York office, said “each wave of cases and arrests seems to produce leads to the next phase. This investigation is far from over.”The charges touch the senior ranks of the New York hedge fund world, with allegations levied against Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of Level Global, Tod Newman, formerly a portfolio manager at Diamondback, and Jon Horvath, an analyst with the New York unit of SAC Capital, the $14bn hedge fund run by Steve A Cohen. Lawyers for the men denied any wrongdoing or declined to comment. Mr Cohen has not been accused of any wrongdoing.According to court filings, the scheme was run by a “circle of friends “ that learnt secret earnings data from insiders at Dell and Nvidia and then traded on it.After allegedly receiving a tip in 2008 Level Global placed a big bet that Dell’s stock would drop following a disappointing earnings announcement. The firm made $57m in profits on the illegal information, authorities allege. Level Global declined to comment.
86;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-18T23:55:38Z;Emails trace trading of stock tips;;In August 2008, Jesse Tortura, a research analyst at the Diamondback hedge fund, got a tip from a former colleague that Dell was going to announce disappointing earnings later that month. He emailed his boss, saying it “doesn’t sound good”, and then forwarded the email to three friends, according to US authorities.One friend, Spyridon Adondakis, worked at Level Global, another hedge fund, and after receiving the email the hedge fund allegedly placed several bets that Dell’s stock would drop.Ten days later, Dell announced disappointing earnings, its stock fell 13 per cent and Level Global netted a $53m profit, one of the single biggest profits ever from inside information, according to authorities.Mr Tortura’s other friends allegedly also told their bosses, who executed trades resulting in a total $61.8m in profits as part of what Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan, called a “circle of corruption and cycle of greed”.Mr Bharara said the case, which resulted in criminal insider trading charges against four hedge fund employees and guilty pleas by three analysts, shows that insider trading is “rampant and routine and that this criminal behaviour was known, encouraged and exploited by authority figures in several investment funds”. The investigation is continuing, he said.The charges are an escalation of what the Federal Bureau of Investigation has dubbed “Operation Perfect Hedge”, a 5-year-old probe into insider trading on Wall Street. To date, the investigation, which has relied on wire taps, co-operating witnesses and emails and instant messages, has resulted in convictions against 56 traders, lawyers and consultants.Mr Tortura and Mr Adondakis have pleaded guilty and are co-operating with the government. Diamondback said it is also co-operating with the investigation. Mr Adondakis’ boss, Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global and an alumnus of SAC Capital, surrendered Wednesday to authorities. His lawyer couldn’t be reached.The times between some of the men reach back to early in their careers. Mr Adondakis, Mr Tortura and Sandeep Goyal, who previously worked at Dell and allegedly tipped Mr Tortura about the company’s 2008 earnings, worked at Prudential Equity. Mr Goyal also pleaded guilty.Another friend Mr Tortura allegedly emailed about Dell was Jon Horvath, an analyst at SAC’s New York unit, known as Sigma Capital Management, according to court filings. Mr Horvath was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday. His attorney said Mr Horvath has “conducted himself with honesty and integrity. He has done nothing wrong, and the charges brought against him today will be shown to be meritless.”The allegations illustrate the close ties within the hedge fund community and heighten the focus on SAC Capital, the $14bn hedge fund run by Steven A Cohen. Mr Cohen has not been accused of any wrongdoing but rumours about insider trading have dogged the firm for years. Mr Cohen has taken the uncharacteristic step of giving media interviews and attending public events to demystify the firm.According to court documents, after receiving the email about Dell’s earnings, Mr Horvath allegedly called his boss, who is not identified in the complaint. People familiar with the matter say he is Michael Steinberg, a portfolio manager specialising in technology stocks, who has worked at SAC since 1997. Mr Steinberg has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Soon after receiving the Dell email, the SAC fund began betting Dell’s stock would drop, according to the complaint. Calls to Mr Steinberg were referred to SAC’s general counsel, who had no immediate comment. A spokesman declined to comment, beyond saying that Sigma is continuing to co-operate with the investigation.After a subsequent update from Mr Tortura, Mr Horvath allegedly emailed his boss on August 25 2008, saying “JT also spoke with them again and his check was unchanged.”Two days later, on the eve of Dell’s scheduled earnings announcement, Mr Horvath recommended to his boss that they increase their short position.His boss replied in an email: “Very reminiscent of last qtr, up everyday into the print. Were near $10mln. Have u double checked JT this week?” Mr Horvath responded that he did, “same read no change.”After Dell announced disappointing earnings, SAC covered its short position and made a $1m profit.Mr Tortura also allegedly tipped Danny Kuo, a portfolio manager at Whittier Trust, a California investment adviser. Mr Kuo, who was arrested on Wednesday, allegedly completed the circle of friendship by providing information he learnt from a Nvidia insider to his friends, including Mr Tortura, Mr Adondakis and Mr Horvath. Mr Kuo couldn't be reached for comment.Level Global, Diamondback, and Whitter allegedly made $15.8m in profits and avoided losses from the Nvidia tips, according to court filings.
87;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-11T19:44:04Z;Intel: smartphone chips are down;Even if the products roll out as promised, there is still a long way to go;"About time. Intel’s chips will finally to be found in smartphones this year. The company announced on Tuesday that Lenovo would release a phone with an Intel processor in China in the second quarter, and that Motorola would ship Intel phones in the second half. But the real hurdles are gaining significant market share and making money.Even if the products roll out as promised, Intel will have a long way to go in a market where chips based on Arm Holdings’ designs have 100 per cent market share. Why would handset makers rush to Intel when Arm licensees from Qualcomm to Nvidia to Texas Instruments are already competing for their business, and their software is already a proved fit with Arm designs?Intel has a history of paying up for a foothold in a new business. The company invested $1.6bn in Clearwire in the hope of cultivating WiMax wireless technology, aimed at breaking up the iron grip of Qualcomm’s CDMA. Intel may be protecting Motorola and Lenovo from any downside on the new products. But as the failure of WiMax highlights, even Intel is not rich enough to buy its way in to an established market.Smartphone sales grew by more than 40 per cent in the third quarter, when 115m units were sold, according to Gartner. But smartphone processors are much cheaper than PC processors, at
$10-$15 a pop. So even if Intel can take an impressive 25 per cent share in a year or two – and sell a lot of chips into tablets, too – it might sell $2bn in mobile chips. That is a respectable number, but it is hardly huge in the context of Intel’s $55bn in sales this year. It is no wonder that Intel wants to reignite PC sales with high-end “ultrabooks”.An aggressive entry by Intel could hurt the margins of Arm or its licensees. Near term, they may have more to fear than Intel has to gain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
88;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-09T20:22:16Z;‘Wintel’ aims for grip on portable PCs;;If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Intel and Microsoft, the twin powers that long dominated the personal computing world, are bidding to outdo each other in paying Apple the ultimate compliment.Nearly four years to the day after Steve Jobs first held aloft the MacBook Air, Intel on Monday sought to give a lift to a similar wave of extremely thin, lightweight PCs that it hopes will build a new moat around its core business.Though the machines were first unveiled six months ago, Intel has chosen to use this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as a “coming-out party” for the new machines, which it has dubbed Ultrabooks and has predicted will quickly come to account for 40 per cent of laptop PC sales. Along with their portability, Intel also claims that it has moved closer to the long battery life and “instant-on” capability that has made Apple’s iPad the current role model for convenient computing.Yet with tablets continuing to evolve and rival chip technologies making headway, this looks like a “desperate bid to stay relevant,” says Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Associates.Matching the technological edge that lies behind Apple’s recent product hits – let alone securing a sustainable advantage – will be hard, he and other analysts say.By next year, chipmakers like Qualcomm and Nvidia are likely to be boasting chips that can match most of the performance characteristics of Intel-based Ultrabooks, says Ian Thornton, head of investor relations at ARM, the UK-based chip design company. ARM’s designs are already used by these and other chipmakers to power most of the world’s smartphones and tablets, and performance advances are Intel’s worst nightmare.Apple could itself launch an ARM-powered notebook by the end of this year that sets new standards in thinness and portability, adds Mr Kay. Also, with hardware makers pitching most of the machines at close to the $999 base price that Apple sells the Air, it will be hard to win over the personal buyers who are coming to influence even how corporate IT departments make their buying decisions, he says.The Ultrabook push is just part of the bid by Intel and Microsoft to break into high-mobility devices that has become a persistent theme of the annual CES event, but which this year has assumed added urgency. At risk is the gravitational pull that Wintel – the name given to the combination of Microsoft’s operating system and Intel-designed chips – has long held over personal computing, thanks to their ability to attract the attention of other software developers. But with smartphones and tablets running on other company’s technology, time is starting to run out.“Microsoft always owned the ecosystem of developers, but on this new platform, Apple is in the catbird seat,” says Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Nomura.Also expected to feature prominently in Las Vegas this week are the latest attempts by Intel and Microsoft to break into smartphones, with Intel showing off a design running Google’s Android software and Microsoft aligning itself closely with Nokia.When it comes to tablets, it will not be until the expected launch of Windows 8 operating system later this year that the old Wintel powers will be able to boast a true rival.At stake will be whether machines using this software can trigger the enthusiasm of consumers, says Al Gillen, an analyst IDC.There is a high chance of this happening, say optimists like Mr Sherlund. With screens that swivel back or detach to make tablets, the coming Windows 8 machines will finally push the software company and the PC ecosystem it leads into the tablet era, he adds.Microsoft and Intel will certainly be hoping he is right.
89;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-05T19:11:07Z;Tablet contenders vie for iPad’s crown;iPad is leader of the tablet pack as challengers muster;A year after they charged into the annual Consumer Electronics Show with more than 100 devices, tablet makers are returning to Las Vegas next week as a ragged and battle-scarred army that has failed to dent the success of Apple’s iPad.Despite the deep war wounds – most notably HP’s abandonment of its TouchPad and Research in Motion’s $485m writedown as it was forced to discount deeply its PlayBook device– the iPad rivals are banking on a new Android operating system, the arrival of Windows 8 and improved content offerings to help them cut into Apple’s two-thirds share of the market.They should be helped by consumers’ enduring appetite for tablets as overall market growth continues, according to NPD DisplaySearch forecasts. The research firm this week estimated 250 per cent growth year on year in 2011 to 73m units, as notebook PC shipments grew 12 per cent to 187.5m units.While companies such as Samsung, Sony and Toshiba have adopted Google’s Android operating system, it has not repeated its success in smartphones, where it had more than a 50 per cent share in the third quarter, according to Gartner research.Unlike smartphones, tablets do not generally attract subsidies from carriers and consumers seem unwilling to pay more than $250 for a non-iPad tablet, according to a survey by the consumer electronics site Retrevo last month. This has made life hard for Android hardware manufacturers wanting to pitch their devices at the $500 level of the iPad, says Andrew Eisner, Retrevo content director.“While Apple can command a premium price for the iPad with its apps and content, the likes of Samsung and Toshiba are only able to sell the hardware – they don’t make any money from sales in the Android Market – so they are stuck with trying to make money by charging a higher price for the hardware,” he says.Makers of ereaders, specifically the retailers Amazon and Barnes & Noble, have squeezed the established manufacturers with tablet versions under $250, made possible by their own ability to sell content and services such as books and film-streaming. These have been relatively successful, with Amazon’s Fire tablet leading Kindle sales of more than 1m a week in December.Rhoda Alexander, senior manager of tablet research at the IHS iSuppli research firm, says that while the Kindle Fire’s hardware may be basic, Amazon’s ability to sell content and an “experience” has been key.“You can make the most beautiful device that you want but, if when you turn it on, it’s not something that opens your eyes to a whole other world of content and different way of doing things, the beauty of the device is somewhat lost at that point,” she says.FT tech writers will upload their views from this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las VegasJen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, whose Tegra chips have powered leading Android tablet models, says their progress has also been dogged by the immaturity of the operating system and a lack of apps – the release in 2011 of an Android 3.0 version, codenamed Honeycomb, specifically designed for tablets, did not get the developer support it needed.“It was such a different operating system, it split the Android platform into phones and tablets. There was a small installed base of Honeycomb tablets and, as a result, there weren’t that many applications developed for it,” he says.That should change this year with 4.0 or “Ice Cream Sandwich” – a unified operating system that first appeared on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone in November. Android developers will now be encouraged to develop for both smartphones and tablets at the same time, Mr Huang forecasts.Microsoft’s Windows 8, expected to launch in the second half, should also aid tablet developers with its touch-optimised “Metro” interface offered as an alternative to the traditional Windows desktop.“[Android tablets] have been an incremental business for us, they’ve been very solid and steady,” says Philip Osako, a Toshiba product marketing director. “But we’re very excited about Windows 8 and we think it will grow the market for tablets in 2012.”Although tablet makers can look forward to better touch interfaces and more compelling apps – as well as more comprehensive content offerings in the case of new entrants such as Sony – they still face stiffening competition from Apple and will have to fight to be the focus at next week’s key event for the industry.An iPad 3 is expected by the spring and Ultrabooks – thin instant-on laptops – are slated to be the story of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show.
90;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2012-01-05T16:27:46Z;US companies snap up Euro chip bargains;;Marvell, the US semiconductor company, has bought Xelerated, the Swedish maker of networking infrastructure chips, in a deal understood to be worth around $100m.Meanwhile, UK-based Picochip was bought by Mindspeed Technologies, a US chip vendor, in a deal valued at up to $76.8m, including a $51.8m in cash and shares and up to $25m earn-out.Given that Xelerated sucked in more than $77m in investment money since it was founded in 2000, the returns are not staggering, but it will be a relief for investors Amadeus Capital Partners to get another tricky, investment-hungry semiconductor company off its books.Picochip actually took in $110m in funding since 2000, meaning that investors are taking a loss on this unless the value of the Mindspeed shares they have been issued rise spectacularly some time soon.The deals come only eight months after Amadeus sold Icera, the Bristol-based mobile semiconductor company, to Nvidia for $367m, another less-than-stellar return.“It is a tough market because it is difficult to build a semiconductor company for less than $60m to $100m. But it has delivered returns for us,” says Simon Cornwell, partner at Amadeus.However, it is worth noting that Amadeus has not made any new semiconductor investments in the past two to three years, preferring to invest in social media and viral internet companies like Unruly, which require much less start-up capital.The main beneficiaries of the Xelerated sale will be the Swedish National Pension Fund, which stepped in to finance the company in 2008 when other sources of funding were running dry. The Swedish Fund owned around two thirds of the business, with Amadeus holding around 10 per cent.Both the Xelerated and Picochip acquisitions are about chip technology for mobile phone network infrastructure. Xelerated makes chips that sit in network switches and routers, making them work faster, while Picochip makes chips for small base stations. Both technologies should be in demand as smartphone networks expand and become more complicated.It is easy to see why US companies should be snapping up these technology companies now. And with Eurozone concerns weighing on already weak investor appetite for chips, investors on this side of the Atlantic seem happy to let these companies go at post-Christmas bargain prices.
91;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-12-12T22:55:53Z;Semiconductors in sharp sell-off;;Semiconductor manufacturers sold off sharply after Intellowered fourth-quarter revenue guidance by $1bn to $13.7bn, plus or minus $300m.Intel fell 4 per cent to $24.00 while smaller rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia fell 4.3 per cent to $5.30 and 2.5 per cent to $14.53 respectively.Intel said disruption to the hard drive supply chain, a result of Thai flooding, had led PC makers to run down inventories, hitting demand for its microprocessors. It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500. Shares rose 15.4 per cent to $39.48, after its smaller rival, Martin Marietta, launched a hostile takeover, offering half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share. Martin Marietta climbed 1.7 per cent to $74.61.M&A hopes helped Netflix to a 6.2 per cent gain. Shares climbed to $75.26 on chatter than Amazon or Verizon could make a play for the video-streaming website, which has seen its share price fall from more than $300 this year.Apple provided ballast for tech shares, falling just 0.5 per cent to $391.84, as Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga, said the iPhone maker had its best November on record with sales up 17 per cent month on month.Lockheed Martin bucked the market, falling just 0.7 per cent to $74.61 after the Pentagon said it had placed a $4bn order for 30F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.Edwards Lifesciences climbed 5.1 per cent to $67.85, on the back of upgrades from several analysts. A Morgan Keegan noted pointed to the group’s strong product pipeline and prospects in China.General Motors fell 1.7 per cent to $20.80, relatively unaffected by a decision to halt production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown plant, which GM blamed on a supplier issue.

The benchmark US index was up 7.6 per cent for the week, erasing nearly all of its losses for the month.The three-day rally pushed the CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, down to its lowest level of the month, before it closed at 27.79, allowing fund managers to breathe more easily.“The Fed’s intervention is a cushion for investors,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service. “It suggests central banks will continue to intervene to prop things up if the markets get too ugly.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose almost 500 points for its best close since March 2009, closing into positive territory for the year at 12,045.68. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 4.2 per cent to 2,620.34.The rally was broadly cyclical with investors piling into the energy, metal and mining stocks most dependent on global growth to sustain commodity prices.Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, rose 15.2 per cent to $24.00. AK Steel Holding rose 13.4 per cent to $8.46 and US Steel rose 15.3 per cent to $27.30.Analysts said steel stocks were boosted by news that China had cut the amount of deposits banks must hold in reserve, which could support lending to the country’s construction industry.“China accounts for 50 per cent of global steel consumption, and construction is the biggest part of that,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie. “The fear is that if Chinese consumption fell, but Chinese producers did not cut back on output, we’d have a massive oversupply, which would depress steel prices, hurting US companies.”But other analysts said the steel rally was down to short sellers being squeezed.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and that explains the big moves,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.investors were less keen on indebted energy groups.Transocean rose just 2.9 per cent to $42.85, as analysts evaluated the impact of a planned capital raise.The oil services company will add as many as 29.9m shares while also raising up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt from the acquisition of Aker Drilling.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.Banks climbed into the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 up 6.7 per cent, bettered only by energy, material and industrial stocks. Morgan Stanley was up 11.1 per cent to $14.79, Citigroup gained 8.9 per cent to $27.48.Bank of America lagged behind its peers for most of the day, having touched a new year low of $5.03 on Tuesday, but closed up 7.3 per cent to $5.44,The strength of the relief rally drowned out most other news, but company fundamentals were at work beneath the bubbly surface.Nvidia rose 4.8 per cent to $15.63 after Canaccord analysts said the company’s Tegra processors have been designed into the latest Amazon Kindle Fire. Nvidia shares are now up 12 per cent since the start of last week, when reports surfaced that Apple will also use its processors in the next batch of MacBooks.Apple itself underperformed the market for a second day running, up just 2.4 per cent to $382.20, after a court ruled that Samsung can sell a tablet product in Australia, despite Apple's complaints of patent infringement.Yahoo was up just 0.1 per cent to $15.71, after reports that a group of investors led by private equity firm Silver Lake may offer as little as $16.60 a share for the internet portal.Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 4 per cent to $64.62, despite launching the first generic version of Pfizer’s anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor. Citigroup analysts said Pfizer would retain 50 per cent market share this year.Netflix shares continued their decline, falling another 4.5 per cent to $64.53 after Wedbush became the latest research firm to lose faith.The stock had traded as high as $300 before a price rise led customers to desert the streaming and DVD delivery service.“The company’s business model was broken when it raised prices,” Wedbush analyst told clients. “And continued customer defections will require it to invest ever increasing amounts on marketing.”Wedbush also forecast Netflix’s content costs will rise to $1.7bn in 2012, from $800m in 2011.

The all cash acquisition is intended to capitalise on growing demand for oral hepatitis C medicine.The deal values Pharmasset at $137 a share, an 89 per cent premium to its Friday closing price and a 59 per cent premium to its all-time high closing price. Pharmasset shares surged 84.6 per cent to $134.14.“This deal could see a step change in the treatment of Hep C, but the valuation is the rub,” said Maged Shenouda, healthcare analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “You can make the numbers work, but it’s going to take a long time.”Every member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the red, as the index fell 2.1 per cent to 11,479.5.Hewlett-Packard fell 4 per cent to $26.86 ahead of quarterly results due after the bell. Jason Nyoland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, said the largest computer maker would probably cut its fiscal 2012 forecast.Chevron lost 2.3 per cent to $95.66 in anticipation of a hefty fine for an oil spill from a rig off Brazil’s coast, which has been leaking for more than a week. Transocean, the company hired by Chevron to drill the leaking well, was down 4.1 per cent to $45.53.Both companies may face possible restrictions on future activity in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro state, according to comments attributed to government and state officials.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.6 per cent to 2,505.96.Not all investors were in panic mode, however.“Inaction by politicians is priced into the market,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Tulsa-based Capitol Advisors, in response to the supercommittee’s travails. “And I think the budget deficit here poses less of an urgent threat than Europe’s debt crisis.”The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2.7 per cent with big US banks once again in the spotlight. Bank of America fell 5 per cent to $5.49, and Citigroup was off 4.9 per cent to $25.00.Jefferies shares closed up 0.4 per cent to $10.20, after the investment bank released a statement attacking “half-truths, false rumours and lies”, as investors zeroed in on its dependence on short-term funding.Jefferies finances part of its inventory by pledging securities in return for cash via repurchase agreements with other banks.Separately, Glen Schorr, Nomura analyst, warned that ratings downgrades could be in the pipeline for US banks as Standard & Poor’s implements a new ratings methodology, which focuses on the role of governments and central banks in system-wide funding.Highly-cyclical material stocks led the broader market sell-off, as a senior Chinese official said the world economy would slump into long-term recession.Steel stocks were especially hard hit after Matthew Cross, Nomura analyst, said a slowdown in investment in new housing in China would sap global demand for steel.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for the manufacture of steel, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.26. AK Steel Holding Corp fell 4.8 per cent to $8.01 and United States Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $24.50.Shares in Alleghany were down 6.7 per cent to $293.01 after the US insurer said it would buy Transatlantic Holdings for $3.4bn in cash and stock, ending a lengthy battle over the reinsurer.Alleghany will pay $59.79 per share, a premium of about 10 per cent to Transatlantic’s Friday closing price of $54.53. Transatlantic shares were up 0.8 per cent to $54.84.Several tech stocks new to the market were also caught in the crosshairs, notable property search group Zillow, which fell 13.1 per cent to $23.52.Russian search engine Yandex fell 8.9 per cent to $19.72 and Groupon fell 10 per cent to $23.56 – nearing its $20 debut price.Semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia Corp was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 5 per cent to $14.63 on reports that it would supply components for the next generation of Apple MacBooks.
95;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-11-07T21:40:41Z;Semi-stocks weigh on Nasdaq;Investors cautious on Greece and Italy news;Semiconductor stocks slipped on Monday, as supply chain disruption stemming from flooding in Thailand continued to weigh on the sector.Hard drive manufacturers have had to close factories in Thailand, raising fears that products such as personal computers, set top boxes and servers will all face production shortfalls next year.Texas Instruments was off 0.8 per cent to $31.53, and Nvidia was off 0.5 per cent to $14.74.Analysts said falling semi stocks could also indicate renewed concern about global growth, because chips are used in a wide variety of industrial processes and computer products.“We’re definitely seeing the impact of macro headwinds in this space,” said Kevin Cassidy, semiconductor analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“Looking at third-quarter results, industry wide guidance for the fourth quarter was down 10 per cent, and the numbers for 2012 have been set very low,” he added.
96;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Innovation: Autocratic directives fail to spark creativity;Jamil Anderlini looks at obstacles to invention;Late last year, a Chinese military institute unveiled the world’s fastest supercomputer, accompanied by great fanfare from state media, which hailed it as a triumph of homegrown innovation.But some top Chinese scientists were quick to dismiss the invention as little more than a propaganda stunt and it soon emerged that almost all the chips used to build the machine, the Tianhe-1, were made by Intel and Nvidia, a US computer animation company.“I am not saying it is utterly useless,” said one outspoken professor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in a scathing interview with a Hong Kong newspaper. “It can play video games.”China is widely recognised as the origin of some of humankind’s greatest inventions, including papermaking, the compass and gunpowder. But today it is better known as a global source of cheap knock-offs and the main haven for intellectual property pirates.Modern China’s comparative lack of inventiveness is a source of consternation for the ruling Communist party, which has made moving up the technology ladder a goal for its military and civilian sectors.The country has “insufficient scientific and technological innovation capabilities” and “defects in systems and mechanisms that hinder scientific development”, Premier Wen Jiabao said in his latest state of the union speech this year.In order to address these deficiencies, Beijing has formulated ambitious targets and multi-decade development plans that aim to make China an “innovative nation” by 2020 and a “scientific superpower” by 2050.For many years, it has raised the annual amount it spends on research and development by about 10 per cent and is expected to spend nearly $154bn in 2011, putting it in second place after the US (on $400bn).But analysts say one of the main obstacles is the government’s insistence on sparking creativity through autocratic directives, by ordering people to be inventive, and by throwing money at projects that often end up as white elephants.Endemic corruption and rampant academic cheating are also seen as problems, as are restrictions on freedom of thought and expression.For example, technology entrepreneurs from other countries are often shocked when they first come to China and experience how restricted and slow the internet is, thanks to the world’s most sophisticated online censorship regime.Beijing’s push to increase the number of patents filed by Chinese state-owned and private enterprises is a telling example of how the government’s policies do not necessarily produce the desired results.In terms of the number of patents filed, China witnessed an average annual growth rate of more than 26 per cent in total patent volume from 2003 to 2009, compared with the US which saw 5.5 per cent.But about half the patents filed in recent years are so-called “utility models” which are less rigorous, more affordable and provide less protection than so-called “invention patents”.In other words, China is leading the world in the quantity but not the quality of its innovation.“To catch up, let alone overtake the west, China must address some serious problems in its innovation system,” according to a report prepared earlier this year for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.The report said: “Chinese scientists and scientific managers admit serious problems of research creativity, fraud and dishonesty, weak accountability for research expenditures, troubled institutional arrangements for managing the nation’s scientific efforts, and a serious undersupply of highly qualified scientists and engineers.”Analysts note some success in incremental innovations in areas such as clean energy, space technology, gene sequencing and supercomputing.But none of these technologies was invented in China and the fact remains that the intellectual property behind about 90 per cent of the country’s high-tech exports is developed and owned by foreign companies.One of the main elements of Beijing’s technological development strategy is a continued focus on extracting advanced technology from foreign companies attracted by China’s huge domestic market.“Technology transfer” is often a condition for any multinational company hoping to gain access to Chinese customers and, although they often complain bitterly in private, these companies mostly end up agreeing to hand over precious technologies.China’s much-hyped high-speed train network, already the largest in the world, has been a big beneficiary of this policy, which has allowed companies to “digest” foreign technology and then “re-innovate” to produce indigenous products they hope eventually to sell abroad.Those plans have probably been derailed for now by a devastating crash on a high-speed line in late July that killed at least 40 people and injured nearly 200.This came after the detention in February of China’s former rail minister amid allegations of serious corruption. Together, these incidents have thrown into question the entire project, which until recently was advertised, like the Tianhe-1 supercomputer, as a shining symbol of technological prowess.
97;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-10-15T05:22:28Z;Supercomputing’s exascale arms race;;A supercomputing race is taking place among leading nations to reap the economic benefits of reaching exaflop speeds, according to Steve Scott, formerly of Cray Inc and now Nvidia’s new chief technology officer.“It’s really critical for industrial competitiveness, military superiority is not the most important thing anymore,” he told us, in the week Nvidia announced it would supply 18,000 of its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to upgrade a supercomputer at the US’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.The current Jaguar supercomputer there will become known as Titan as it is boosted from 2- to 20-petaflop performance – that’s 20 million billion mathematical operations per second. An exaflop is 1,000 petaflops and the US wants to achieve this 50x improvement on Titan by around 2019.China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia are also targetting Exascale computing.“This has become a real priority for national governments,” he said, “There’s a growing realisation around the world that high-end computing is at the root of economic competitiveness.”The super-processing power can help with everything from designing better engines to new materials and drugs – due to the ability to create ever more accurate simulations. It can also model scientific pursuits such as climate change, cell growth and nuclear fusion“Simulation has taken its place as the third pillar of scientific advancement. Simulation is used to understand physical phenomena in the world around us and, along with theory and experiment, it’s now how we move ahead in science.”Fortunately for Nvidia, as a graphics chip company, this means GPUs, which have the power to run many operations in parallel, are increasingly finding favour – compared to CPU (Central Processing Unit) microprocessors, which carry out serial processing.Mr Scott points out that three years ago, there were no supercomputers using GPUs on the Top 500 supercomputing list, but now they were used by three out of the top five, with Titan expected to join that elite few as well.However, he expects CPUs and GPUs to work together in a “heterogeneous computing” model to achieve exaflop speeds.Oak Ridge’s use of GPUs is the biggest boost yet for Nvidia and this class of processor. “It’s an incredible validation and endorsement for us,” said Mr Scott.
98;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-10-13T20:56:32Z;JPMorgan pulls banks on Wall Street lower;;Bank stocks fell Thursday after JPMorgan kicked off the sector’s quarterly results season.Earnings per share of $1.02 were flat for the year but a full 10 cents higher than the average forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg. But the figures were flattered by a $1.9bn debt valuation adjustment, which saw the company benchmark its own debt to a lower market valuation.“Excluding the various ‘one offs’, we think the numbers are about in line,” Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote to clients. Mr Staite had forecast earnings per share to be as low as 77 cents.JPMorgan fell 4.8 per cent to $31.60, Bank of America was down 5.5 per cent to $6.22, and Citigroup was off 5.3 per cent to $27.64.JPMorgan’s investment banking division reported net income of $1.6bn, down from $2bn in the second quarter of 2011.But investment bank stocks did not suffer as much as the universal banks. Morgan Stanley was down 4.4 per cent to $15.14, while Goldman Sachs, fell 3 per cent to $96.15.JPMorgan set aside 15 cents a share for litigation costs in a sign that various mortgage-related cases pending against the big US banks may impact on the sector’s earnings.The bank only released $96m of loan loss reserves, down from $1.3bn in the second quarter, suggesting it is cautious about the outlook for credit quality.Safeway, the supermarket chain, was down 0.2 per cent to $17.93, reversing strong early gains, after quarterly earnings rose to 38 cents a share, from 33 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Sales rose from $9.4bn to $10.06bn.The S&P 500 reversed early losses to close down just 0.3 per cent at 1,203.85. The financial sector of the benchmark index was down 2.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which briefly moved into positive territory for the year on Wednesday afternoon, fell 0.4 per cent to 11,478.13.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,620.24, helped by a strong performance by semiconductor stocks.Fairchild Semiconductor, the first company in the sector to report results, was up 10.2 per cent to $13.49. That was a dramatic reversal after the stock fell 7 per cent in the first minutes of trading after reporting third quarter sales of $403.2m, a fall of 7 per cent from the previous quarter, while margins were also squeezed.“Investors always want to buy the last estimate cut,” said Bobby Burleson, semiconductor analyst at Canaccord Genuity, “and Fairchild is calling a bottom in demand.”The group reduced fourth-quarter revenue guidance by 11 per cent to between $350m and $370m, but forecast a turnround in 2012.That helped push Nvidia Corp up 5.8 per cent to $15.46, while SanDisk rose 3.3 per cent to $45.93 and Micron Technology was up 6.2 per cent to $5.52.But JPMorgan analysts suggested demand for D-Ram memory, a big product for many semiconductor firms, would continue to fall.“Given the PC industry’s shift from high-performance-oriented devices to adequate specification and low-cost products, we believe D-Ram content growth will decelerate further,” JJ Park told clients.A closely watched industry survey by Gartner found worldwide PC shipments rose only 3 per cent in the third quarter, 2 per cent less than Gartner had previously forecast.Akamai Technology, an internet service provider, was up 4.8 per cent to $24.49 on reports that Google might launch a bid for the company.Google, which was set to report results after the market closed, was up 1.9 per cent to $558.99.Yahoo was up 1 per cent to $15.93 on reported acquisition interest from the private equity arms of Blackstone and KKR.Insurers suffered as Citibank analyst Colin Devine said life assurers may be designated systemically important financial institutions, requiring them to hold more capital.Lincoln National Corporation fell 3.8 per cent to $16.70 and Genworth Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $5.56.Asset managers had another tough session, after Legg Mason revealed assets under management fell 5 per cent during September to $611.8bn as a result of investor redemptions and falling asset prices.Legg Mason was down 4.7 per cent to $25.62, and Blackstone Group fell 5.4 per cent to $13.55.Sprint Nextel was up 8.2 per cent to $2.78. Citigroup analysts said the third-largest US mobile network could “raise additional funds, even at the current implied yields for bonds”, which rose above 11 per cent on Friday. The company needs to fund $10bn of capital expenditure.Apple was up 1.6 per cent to $408.43, after Sprint and Verizon stopped taking pre-orders for the new iPhone because of strong demand.
99;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-10-04T22:37:44Z;S&P 500 surges 4% after dipping into bear market;;A Financial Times report that European finance ministers are discussing co-ordinated bank recapitalisations triggered a 4 per cent surge in the S&P 500 in the last 45 minutes of trading.The S&P 500 had traded as low as 1,074.77 at the start of the day’s session, well into the bear market territory that is defined by a 20 per cent drop from its year high on April 29, but the benchmark index closed up 2.3 per cent at 1,123.94, after the FT report.Bank stocks led the rebound, with financials in the S&P 500 up 4.1 per cent, reversing an earlier fall of 2.9 per cent.Morgan Stanley closed up 12.3 per cent at $14.01, having traded beneath $12 for the first time since December 2008, earlier in the session. JPMorgan rose 6.6 per cent to $30.26 and Citigroup rose 5.5 per cent to $24.39.Regional bank stocks also surged, with Fifth Third Bancorp up 8.6 per cent to $10.64 and Zions Bancorp up 7.8 per cent to $10.64.“It’s good to see a bounce in stocks. It’s been a one-way street for several days now,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “But volatility is so high, it’s unclear which way the market will eventually go.”Utility stocks in the S&P 500 were down 0.5 per cent, the only sector of the S&P 500 to fall.NRG Energy, the power generator and electricity supplier, fell 1.8 per cent to $19.57 after decreasing its revenue guidance for the quarter on Monday evening, citing bad weather in Texas, which interrupted supply to retail customers.Northeast Utilities System fell 2.5 per cent to $31.27 and Edison International fell 2.2 per cent to $36.30.Utility stocks also fell 2.3 per cent on Monday but before that had not had a single day’s fall of more than 2 per cent since early August as investors flocked to defensive names.The reason appeared to be the heavy selling of an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500’s utility sector.The Utilities Select SPDR was down 0.5 per cent to $32.66 after three blocks of more than 300,000 shares each were traded in the morning session.By midday, 10m shares had been traded in the ETF, just short of the full-day average of 11.8m.“It looks like someone is selling off the utilities ETF,” said Angie Storozynski, energy analyst at Macquarie. “Nothing could convince me to sell utilities at the moment, it’s exactly the protection I would want right now.”Some traders speculated that the sell-off was due to an institution raising funds to cover short positions as the broader index tumbled in the morning session.Semiconductor stocks performed strongly with MEMC Electronic Materials up 9.3 per cent to $5.19, Nvidia up 9.2 per cent to $12.90 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index up almost 4.2 per cent.The moves followed the release of semiconductor sales data for August, which was not as bad as expected.Romit Shah, a Nomura analyst, warned unit growth was “sub-seasonal” and predicted “another (and likely deeper) round of estimate revisions” but stocks benefited from a relief rally.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Nasdaq was up 3 per cent to 2,404.82 while the Dow was up 1.4 per cent to 10,808.18.Apple fell 0.6 per cent to $372.50 on a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, the 4s, unveiled Tuesday afternoon. Jefferies analyst Peter Misek tipped the stock to turn round on Wednesday.“The surface is underwhelming because the 4s looks just like the iPhone 4, but underneath the hood there is a lot to be excited about,” he said. Mr Misek also tipped the lower priced 3gs to become a “global blockbuster,” if it is rolled out worldwide at a low price.The New York Stock Exchange was up 3.5 per cent to $22.75 on reports that the European Commission may block its merger with German exchange Deutsche Börse.Yahoo rose 6.9 per cent to $14.46 on reports that private equity house Silver Lake and Russian group Digital Sky Technologies have joined Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba in its bid for the internet gateway service.Material and energy stocks which had been sold off heavily on Monday and last week, also benefited from the late buying. Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, closed up 8.8 per cent to $17.44. Its rival Cliff Natural Resources also jumped 10.6 per cent to $53.41.
100;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-09-14T20:53:34Z;Residential REIT declines blight Wall Street gains;;Residential real estate investment trusts took a tumble on Wednesday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik told clients to expect “much more pedestrian” performance, following a strong run so far this year.Residential Reit stocks have strongly outperformed commercial Reits this year. The short duration of residential leases relative to commercial leases, means residential Reits can immediately take advantage of a strengthening rental market, as contracts come up for renewal more often.But, according to Stifel’s research, residential Reit stocks are now over priced, with share prices valuing residential Reit 34 per cent higher than other Reits with similar earnings.AvalonBay Communities fell 2.5 per cent to $130.40. Apartment Investment and Residential fell 0.9 per cent to $26.48 and Equity Residential fell 2.2 per cent to $58.79.Reits have significantly outperformed most other equities this year, as low interest rates have eased financing costs, and made dividends, which Reits are legally obliged to pay, attractive to yield-seeking investors.Bloomberg’s Reits index, which is dominated by commercial property funds rather than residential funds, was up 0.8 per cent Wednesday and is only down 1.7 per cent for the year.The broader S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent, leaving it up 5 per cent for the week.That was despite disappointing retail sales data, which showed consumption stagnated in August.Timothy Speiss, vice-president of EisnerAmper Wealth Planning, said the retail figures were not unexpected and that “markets are pricing in hopes of getting to a master agreement on the European crisis,” where talks between the German, French and Greek governments continued Wednesday.Financials were up 1.2 per cent led by life insurer Hartford Financial Services, up 4.8 per cent at $18.18, and Ameriprise Financial, up 2.1 per cent at $43.80, as Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher upgraded both companies to to “buy”.Low interest rates and a weak equity market have raised questions about whether life insurers can generate returns on the premiums they take in from customers. But Mr Gallagher told clients, “low interest rates will have only a minor impact” on 2012 earnings.Bank of America rose 0.7 per cent to $7.05, but RBC Capital Markets became one of the first research shops to suggest BofA may offer fair value under $10.Analyst Paul Miller cut his BofA target price from $12 to $8, telling clients, “There seems to be no end in sight for [BofA’s] litigation expenses, and there is little clarity into what the company will look like two to three years down the road.”Most buy-side analysts have “buy” ratings on the stock, which has almost halved in value this year.Reaction to Cisco’s analyst day on Tuesday was mixed. Analysts greeted the company’s restructuring, which involves significant cost-cuts, but were divided on whether it can now deliver sales growth given the weak macroeconomic environment. “Three-year revenue growth rate guidance of 5-7 per cent appears conservative to us especially as year on year comparisons get easier. This new target is well below the recent 12-17 per cent target,” Jason Noland of Baird wrote to clients.But Rod Hall at JPMorgan told clients: “The good news is that [Cisco] has finally reduced its targets to levels that are achievable. The bad news is that those targets boil down to earnings per share growth of just 7-9 per cent.”Cisco’s shares fell 0.1 per cent to $16.33. The stock traded as low as $13.30 in August, and is still down almost 20 per cent for the year.Micron Technology was again among the top performers in the S&P 500, up 5 per cent at $7.20. It has now gained more than 13 per cent this week.Statistical research by JPMorgan suggested Micron, Nvidia, and other semiconductor stocks are in an “accumulation” cycle, with investors piling into the sector as it recovers from an oversell.Nvidia rose 5.2 per cent to $15.28 and the Philadelphia semiconductors index was up 2.6 per cent on Wednesday, and 5 per cent for the week.Cablevision rose 7 per cent to $17.83 on reports of a deal with Time Warner that will allow Cablevision subscribers to watch Turner Networks programming on tablets.Shares in Sears, the department store, rose 6.2 per cent to $58.48 on reports its Kenmore brand may be made available for sale through other outlets.Some investors were cheered by analysis of Tuesday’s sectoral movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Transport stocks outperformed the broader index by almost 3 per cent.“This kind of outperformance by the Transports has happened 177 times over the last 50 years, and the average performance for both the Transports and the Dow in the near term has been very positive,” according to a note from the Bespoke Investment Group.On Wednesday transport stocks in the Dow were up 2 per cent, while the wider index was up 1.3 per cent at 11,246.73. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent at 2,572.55.
101;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-09-12T15:14:26Z;Broadcom buys NetLogic for $3.7bn;;Broadcom, the US wireless chip company, announced a $3.7bn cash deal to buy rival NetLogic Microsystems, the latest in a wave of consolidation linked to the growing number and importance of mobile devices.The deal will extend Broadcom’s ability to make chips used in wireless base stations as operators build next-generation networks. It is the fourth-largest US technology deal this year, according to Capital IQ data.The $50 per share offer represents a 57 per cent premium to Nasdaq-listed NetLogic’s close on Friday. NetLogic shares rose 50 per cent to $48 in midday trading on Monday in New York, while Broadcom’s fell 2.5 per cent to $32.60.Development costs of mobile device chips are driving more consolidation in the industry. Earlier this year, Nvidia, the US chip company, acquired UK rival Icera for $367m in order to bolster its ability to make chips for mobiles and tablets.Meanwhile, AT&T, the mobile operator, has proposed a $39bn deal to buy T-Mobile USA, as the companies struggle to meet the costs of developing next-generation networks.Last month, Google announced the acquisition of the mobile operations of Motorola for $12.5bn, as the internet company becomes increasingly involved in the smartphone industry.Broadcom’s main rival Qualcomm announced a deal in January to buy wireless chipmaker Atheros for $3.2bn, strengthening its positioning in Wi-Fi, where Broadcom had been focusing its efforts. The NetLogic deal boosts Broadcom on Qualcomm’s home turf.“We like the deal and believe NetLogic will bolster Broadcom’s position in infrastructure, not to mention add to its strength at key customers, such as Cisco,” said analysts at BMO Capital Markets in a note.Broadcom said it expects the deal to add 10 cents a share to its adjusted earnings in 2012 and it expects to maintain a strong balance sheet, with $4.2bn in cash at the end of this quarter. Both boards have approved the transaction, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012.California-based NetLogic is involved in the manufacture of 4G chips but made losses of $66m on revenues of $382m last year. So far this year, it is thought to have racked up losses of $29m.Scott McGregor, Broadcom chief executive, said the deal would double the company’s market, particularly as it moved into the market for wireless infrastructure and base stations.“Customers are looking for complete solutions. This allows us to pull all the technologies together in a space where small companies are having a hard time competing,” he told the Financial Times.But Alex Gauna, analyst at JMP Securities, said the acquisition of NetLogic was expensive. “Broadcom is paying a very full price at 26 times consensus earnings estimates. It highlights Broadcom’s inability to grow internally. If I were an investor I would be thinking that there goes $3.7bn of my money on something that Broadcom should have been able to build itself.”
102;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-09-09T14:37:33Z;Wall Street down after Obama speech;;A sharp drop on Friday, gave the S&P 500 its worst start to September in a decade, as President Obama’s jobs plan failed to stimulate markets and euro zone debt fears intensified.The broad S&P 500 index lost 2.7 per cent on Friday to close at 1,154.23, and sent the benchmark into negative territory for the week, for a loss of 1.9 per cent since Monday.On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7 per cent to 10,992.13 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.4 per cent to 2,467.99.A $450bn package was unveiled on Thursday night in a well-trailed speech but the measures had already been priced in to the market.“Obviously there’s disappointment – the market doesn’t think the Obama speech is going to change things materially,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.She added: “The big questions is still whether US markets can divorce from Europe.”Despite many investors focusing on macro factors, which led to more big swings up and down, the performance of many stocks was determined by earnings reports and sectoral trends rather than fear.Semiconductor stocks rose strongly in a week when several companies produced earnings forecasts that were not as bad as expected considering deteriorating macroeconomic data.Demand for semiconductors depends on global growth, making the stocks highly cyclical.In August the semiconductor holders trust ETF fell 9.1 per cent, almost 50 per cent more than the S&P 500.This week it rose almost 2 per cent, closing most of the gap in performance with the S&P 500 since the start of August.Shares in companies that make DRam memory chips for personal computers, which had suffered most in August, did particularly well. Micron Technology was up 15.8 per cent to $6.35 and SanDisk rose 10.3 per cent to 38.73.Smartphone supplier Nvidia was also up 7.2 per cent to $13.88 after surprising analysts with its earnings forecasts.Regional bank stocks decoupled from bigger national banks after Credit Suisse recommended clients buy their shares.Analyst Craig Siegenthale argued that low interest rates are already priced into regional bank business models because most of their lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins fall over time as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $9.81 and US Bancorp rose 1.5 per cent to $22.00.National banks continued to fall on fears of exposure to Europe and a stalling economy.Bank of America was down 3.4 per cent to $6.98, Citigroup fell 5.8 per cent to $26.74 and JPMorgan fell 7.5 per cent to $32.08.Overall, financial companies in the S&P 500 were down 2.7 per cent for the week.Coal mining stocks were given a boost by unconfirmed reports of a potential bid from Anglo American, the global metals and mining group, for Walter Energy, the largest pure play coke and coal producer in the US. Those rumours followed hot on the heels of a confirmed bid last week from US coalminer Peabody forMacArthur, the Australian coal producer.Walter rose 13.3 per cent to $88.22 and Alpha Natural Resources, which has significant US coal mining interests only fell 0.5 per cent to 30.81, handily outperforming the S&P 500.Yahoo rose 12 per cent to $14.48 after the sacking of chief executive Carol Bartz and news that activist investor Daniel Loeb had taken a 5 per cent stake in the company.Mr Loeb immediately called for the resignation of the board of directors.Investors greeted the decision of oil company Sunoco to desert refining, closing its last two remaining facilities. Shares rose 2.2 per cent to $37.12.RBC Capital upgraded Sunoco from hold to buy, arguing its streamlined supply and logistics focus leaves it well set to benefit from the combination of, “growing crude oil production and insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity”.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, rose 2 per cent to $26.17 after the company successfully concluded its three-month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple Inland.The $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple stock rose 25.8 per cent to $31.04.VeriSign, the internet domain name seller, fell 3.4 per cent to $29.03. The company has announced the departure of Chief Financial Officer Brian Robins, damping speculation that it was about to be acquired.

Third Point will push for the resignation of the board of directors and a clearer strategy, the fund said in filings.But the broad S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1185.88, despite breaking through the 1,200 barrier earlier in the day, a level it has only touched on three other days since early August.Traders appeared to take advantage of Wednesday’s strong bounce – when the S&P 500 rose almost 3 per cent – to book profits ahead of President Obama’s speech to Congress on jobs on Thursday evening.“Our metrics still suggest risk is elevated and with no end in sight to European problems, our position is to sell into the strength of the market,” said Channing Smith, fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Semiconductor stocks surged, with Micron Technology, maker of Dram memory chips for personal computers, up 3.1 per cent at $6.25, extending its
gains for the week to almost 15 per cent.SanDisk rose 2.4 per cent to $38.52, and even embattled sector heavyweight Cisco was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, up 2.6 per cent at $16.29.Semiconductor stocks tend to be highly cyclical since demand for the components, which feature in everything from smartphones to solar panels and industrial machinery, is closely linked to global growth.But on Thursday the surge seemed to be driven by a positive earnings forecast by Nvidia on Wednesday.Analysts continued to warn of a potential fall in demand. JPMorgan lowered earnings estimates across the industry, citing “the tougher macro-environment” and “signs of weakness appear across the board”.Elsewhere, gold miner Newmont Mining rose 2.9 per cent to $65.66. Trading in the stock has soared in the past month as equity investors seek exposure to rising gold prices as a hedge against global growth.Newmont is now up 18 per cent since the start of August, while the S&P 500 index is off 8 per cent over the same period.But gold analysts point out this breaks with recent trading patterns in the stock. Until August, gold stocks had closely tracked stock market indices this year.“If you look at the betas of gold mining stocks against the S&P, they had become much more correlated with the index over the past five or six years,” says Alex Hacking at Citigroup.Mr Hacking said safe haven-seeking investors had triggered the more recent divergence between the stock and the broad index, but noted that gold mining stocks have underperformed gold itself.“Central banks and risk averse investors want physical gold, not a paper entitlement to the dividends of a gold mining company. Also whenever you get a spike in a metal price, the price-earnings ratios of associated mining stocks naturally come down. The market is distrustful of spikes in commodity prices, and is not willing to pay a high share price for earnings that might be temporary.”Filtration company Pall Corp, which fell 9.8 per cent to $44.03, was by far the biggest mover in the index.At 76 cents a share, Pall’s preliminary fourth-quarter results missed expectations, and Eric Krasnoff, chief executive, conceded they pointed to a “disappointing finish to an otherwise good year”.Urban Outfitters fell 1.2 per cent to $24.96 as RBC Capital and Citigroup lowered earnings per share estimates for the current quarter.Urban shares are now off 3.9 per cent for the week after the company used a scheduled update late on Tuesday to report that same-store sales were down as much as 3 per cent in the third quarter to date.Macroeconomic news was mixed with jobless claims rising unexpectedly by 2,000 to 414,000 in the week ended September 3 but the US trade deficit eased slightly in July as imports fell.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 2.3 per cent, more than any other sector. Bank of America fell 3.7 per cent at $7.20 and Citigroup was off 3.5 per cent at $27.98.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent at 11,295.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.8 per cent to 2,529.14."

The reports of an Anglo American bid for Walter follow a confirmed bid last week from US coal miner Peabody for MacArthur, the Australian coal producer.“Reports of M&A in the coke and coal space are driving up shares across the sector,” said Jeremy Sussman, at Brean Murray Carret. “Anglo American is one of the biggest mining companies in the world so the possibility of activity by them will move stocks.”Alpha Natural Resources and Cliff Natural Resources, both companies which have coal and coke in their mining mix, were among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500. Alpha rose 10.6 per cent to $33.44 and Cliff was up 8.3 per cent to $81.46. Peabody also rose 6.9 per cent to $48.72.The S&P 500 energy sector advanced 3.7 per cent. Financials rallied 4.8 per cent, up 3 per cent for the week. Regional banks propelled gains.Regions Financial rose 12.3 per cent to $4.37, its largest single-day rally since March 2010.The stock had fallen heavily on Tuesday despite a note from Credit Suisse advising clients to buy regional banks.Credit Suisse argued regional bank business models already price in low interest rates because most loans are made to businesses at floating rates.That note seemed to be having an impact on Wednesday. Midwest lender Fifth Third Bancorp recorded a second straight day of strong gains, up 7.2 per cent to $10.45. Synovus, which has branches across the southern states, rose 10.7 per cent to $1.45. Bank of America rose 7 per cent to $7.48 after a reshuffle of senior management at the much scrutinised bank.The S&P 500 rose 2.9 per cent to 1,198.62, within touching distance of the 1,200 level, which it butted up against for much of August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5 per cent to 11,414.86 and the Nasdaq Composite index put on 3 per cent to 2,548.94.Yahoo gained 5.4 per cent as investors greeted the dismissal ofCarol Bartz, chief executive. At $13.61, shares are trading near the level they were at when Ms Bartz was appointed in late 2008.“Yahoo’s board has generally been viewed as slow-moving and more passive; any kind of shake-up here will suggest greater interest in value creation,” said Doug Anmuth, internet analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to explain the share price move.Apart from M&A hopes, the rally appeared to be driven by positive sentiment about global growth with highly cyclical semiconductor stocks performing strongly.Nvidia rose 8.1 per cent to $14.25 after the company forecast positive quarterly earnings .Micron Technology was also up 6.9 per cent to $6.06.Sentiment also drove steel shares. Materials rose 2.7 per cent with US Steel leading the way, up 9.2 per cent to $29.92, and AK Steel, up 10.2 per cent at $8.90, despite a fall in weekly steel production.“It’s a mixture of bargain-hunters coming in to the market, because steel stocks have been beat up so much, and also the talk that President Obama’s stimulus plan might divert idle construction workers to infrastructure projects, which are a source of demand for steel,” Charles Bradford at Bradford Research, said. “But I would not be moving back into steel stocks until there is a clear sign of a turnround,” he added.JPMorgan lowered its earnings per share forecast for FedEx Corporation. JPMorgan said the business-driven package delivery service would suffer from weak demand. FedEx shares rose 3.6 per cent to $76.27.Citigroup upgraded DR Horton to buy, citing the low share price and an expected seasonal upturn in construction for the homebuilder. DR Horton shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.17, while homebuilder Pulte Group rose 8.8 per cent to $4.58.C&J Energy Services rose 2.3 per cent to $25.53 after JPMorgan initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy recommendation and a $41 target price. Citigroup also initiated coverage with a buy-high risk rating and a $33 price target.Exchange shares were higher after Deutsche Bank upgraded Nasdaq OMX to buy.

105;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-09-01T20:54:21Z;SAIC falls over government contract concerns;Financials lead losses on Wall Street, helping to push the S&P 500 index down more than 1 per cent, and ending its four-day rally;Companies dependent on government contracts for revenue led Wall Street down, after a key government supplier missed earnings reports and forecast more gloom.SAIC, an IT and technology government contractor, reported quarterly earnings of 32 cents a share, 3 cents lower than expected, as revenue fell 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter.SAIC shares were down 13.5 per cent at $12.97.Stifel Nicolaus analyst William Loomis downgraded SAIC from buy to hold, and said he was worried that the government appeared to be cutting back on funding for contracts it had already awarded to SAIC.He also stripped his buy recommendation from Booz Allen Hamilton Holding, the public sector offshoot of the management consultancy Booz Allen, which has heavy exposure to federal government IT contracts. Booz shares fell 6.4 per cent to $15.02.“The whole sector faces a tricky dilemma. The amount of bid opportunities has actually gone up, because after budget negotiations the government now has a backlog of contracts to put out to tender. So companies have increased spending around business development,” Mr Loomis said.“But if those contracts are not awarded so projects can be ramped up, and revenue starts flowing, it could be difficult.”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.2 per cent at 1,204.42, ending a four-day rally.Financial stocks fell 2.4 per cent, more than any other sector.Goldman Sachs was down 3.5 per cent to $112.16 after writing down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.The Federal Reserve Board had alleged a “pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton.Bank of New York Mellon outperformed the sector, despite the departure of chief executive Robert Kelly late on Wednesday.BNY Mellon shares were only down 0.2 per cent at $20.63 after Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove said the bank was sitting on a “staggering” cash pile.Semiconductor companies had a volatile day after analysts disputed whether burgeoning demand from smartphone manufacturers will be enough to compensate for falling sales to computer makers.Shares in Nvidia outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 per cent, after Kaufman Brothers analyst Mike Burton initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The Nasdaq was down 1.3 per cent at 2,546.04, but Nvidia shares were only off 0.2 per cent at $13.28.“We view Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the convergence of mobility and computing,” Mr Burton said.Glen Yeung, Citigroup’s technology analyst, also said smartphone demand could offset falling industrial demand ahead of an industry conference.“We expect the tone from chip companies to reflect uncertainty … we do not, however, expect chip companies to lower guidance en masse, reflecting the dearth of actual order cuts quarter-to-date.”That pushed Micron Technology and SanDisk, which manufacture Dram memory chips used in computers and phones, into positive territory in early trading. But Micron closed at $5.74, down 2.9 per cent for the day and SanDisk dropped 1 per cent to $36.27.Manufacturers with exposure to industries other than computing had outperformed in August but on Thursday their shares were pushed back as investors traded on enthusiasm for smartphones.Applied Materials, a company whose chips end up in solar panels, was off 2.3 per cent at $11.06.Novellus, whose semiconductors are used in various industrial processes, fell 3.3 per cent to $27.05 after the company used a mid-quarter update late on Wednesday to lower revenue targets.Not every analyst shared the enthusiasm for smartphones. Mr Yeung’s Citigroup colleague Henry Kim predicted a “double-dip in DRAM”.“We are revising down our global memory industry revenue forecast by 19 per cent on weaker pricing from low demand and expect industry revenue to decline by 13 per cent year on year in 2011 earnings,” Mr Kim said.Robert Lea, South Korea-based semiconductor analyst for Jefferies, who initiated coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor with a hold rating, was also downbeat on the sector.“Semiconductor industry inventories [excluding memory] have risen for seven consecutive quarters to an estimated 81.5 days”, while at the same time, “revenue growth has stalled”, Mr Lea said.TSM shares were down 0.7 per cent at $11.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent for the day at 11,493.57, pushing it back into negative territory for the year to date.
106;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-08-23T21:20:55Z;Wall Street rallies despite BofA gloom;;US stocks recorded their biggest gains in nearly two weeks as investors shook off growing concern about Bank of America’s capital adequacy.BofA shares traded as lows as $6.01 on Tuesday, as a wave of speculation about possible capital raising, which had knocked 8 per cent of the bank’s share price Monday, continued to drive trading.Financial shares in the S&P 500 were up 3.2 per cent and the broader KBW Bank index was up 4.0 per cent at 36.51, although it had touched a new year low of 34.57 in early trading.Goldman Sachsunderperformed, its shares rising only 0.3 per cent to close at $106.86 following a sharp fall late on Monday after news that its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, had hired a defence attorney.But by the close of trading the share price had rallied to $6.30, a decline of 1.9 per cent on the day. Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities released a note arguing the bank’s balance sheet remains strong, helped by new deposit inflows of $18.2bn in the quarter just ended, and as much as $20bn in the past two weeks.Trading in bank credit markets had sparked some of the worry as well. Five-year credit default swaps on BofA rose 9 basis points to 380bp, or $380,000 annually to insure $10m in debt, according to Markit. Earlier it had spiked to 435bp, surpassed its previous high in March 2009 of 390bp, before narrowing later in the day.Goldman Sachs CDS prices also initially rose before narrowing sharply, adding just 7bp to 245bp on the day, well below their peak levels in 2008.Charles Schwab rose 6.1 per cent to close at $11.97 after SEC filings revealed board-member Roger O. Walther had exercised an option to purchase 17,034 shares.There was some good news for banks. The number of banks on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s “Problem List” fell from 888 to 865 in the second quarter, the first decline since 2006. The total assets of “problem” institutions fell from $397bn to $372bn.The broad S&P 500 index rallied strongly, up 3.4 per cent to1,162.35, on continued hopes that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke will signal further quantitative easing at his Jackson Hole speech on Friday.Sprint Nextel recorded its largest single day gains this year. Shares climbed 10.1 per cent to close at $3.59 on reports it will begin selling Apple’s iPhone 5 in mid-October. At the moment Sprint’s larger rivals, Verizon and AT&T, are the only US networks licensed to sell Apple’s popular handset.Sprint managers had been hinting to analysts for some time that the iPhone 5 would be part of their line up by the end of the year, according to Michael Nelson at Mizuho Securities. “The iPhone’s popularity combined with Sprint’s marketing focus on unlimited customers could allow it to reverse the decline in lucrative postpaid customers,” he said.Energy stocks performed strongest up 4.6 per cent. Solar panel firms outperformed, as the price of polysilicon, the main material used in the manufacture of photovoltaic panels, rose to $51.96 from $51.17, in a sign of rising demand.MEMC Electronic Materials was up 12.7 per cent to 46.83. First Solar gained 7.6 per cent to close at $94.33.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.0 per cent at 11,176.76, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 4.29 per cent at 2,446.06.Nvidia Corp, a maker of graphics chips, climbed 11.0 per cent to $13.23, after Wells Fargo raised its recommendation on the company, in anticipation of, “a seasonal lift in PC-related chip demand and beyond that a recovery in the consumer PC end market”.Harley-Davidson Inc shares were up 6.5 per cent at $34.20 after a survey of US motorcycle dealers by Robert W. Baird found the company is on pace for sales growth of 11 per cent in Q3, almost double Baird’s previous growth forecast.Heinz was a rare faller. Its share lost 1.2 per cent to close at $51.44, after the condiment maker reported earnings per share of 70 cents, taking a hit of 8 cents per share from one-off expenditure on productivity improvements.Walgreen was down 0.6 per cent at $34.68 after Barclays Capital lowered its 2012 earnings per share estimate to $2.74 from $3.10. Walgreen is at risk of losing $5 billion in annual revenue over a dispute with Express Scripts over how much the pharmacy benefits manager pays Walgreen to fill prescriptions.Markets did not seem ruffled by worrying economic data. The Richmond Federal Reserve’s index of factory output on the mid-Atlantic eastern seaboard fell to -10 in August from -1 in July. opened.In the US, sales of new single family homes fell by a month on month 0.7 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted 298,000, which was the worst performance since February. Most analysts had expected a slight uptick in sales. Shares in homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4.0 per cent to $3.61.
107;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-08-10T22:56:42Z;Ex-Marvell manager on insider trading charge;;Stanley Ng, a former finance manager at Marvell Technology, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit insider trading for allegedly providing secret corporate earnings information to an expert network consultant before the results were publicly announced.Mr Ng, 42, was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents at his home in Cupertino, California, at about 6.30am on Wednesday local time without incident, the FBI said.The arrest is the latest in the government’s expansive investigation into insider trading, which has resulted in charges against 52 traders, consultants and public company employees since August 2009.Mr Ng couldn’t be reached for comment. He is allegedly part of the ring that involved Winifred Jiau, a consultant with Primary Global Research, who allegedly tipped hedge fund traders Samir Barai of Barai Capital and Noah Freeman of SAC Capital. Both men have pleaded guilty to insider trading and Ms Jiau was convicted following a trial. Primary Global, an expert network company that matches money managers with industry specialists, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Sonny Nguyen, a former employee in Nvidia’s finance department, met Ms Jiau when they worked for Nvidia. Ms Jiau recruited Mr Nguyen to join her investment club. Mr Nguygen in turn recruited Mr Ng, who served as the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting manager at Nvidia, according to the criminal complaint.Mr Nguyen named Mr Ng as a source of secret company information during Ms Jiau’s trial. Mr Nguyen pleaded guilty and is co-operating with the government.In exchange for the information, it is claimed that Ms Jiau took the men to lunch at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant and passed secret information she learnt from other sources, according to the criminal complaint.According to court filings, one insider tip is alleged to have occurred at 10pm on August 7 2008, when Ms Jiau had a 12-minute phone conversation with Mr Ng using their mobile phones.The following morning, Ms Jiau joined a conference call with Mr Barai and Mr Freeman and relayed that her source told her Marvell’s “revenue is in line” and she would get an additional update before the company announced its earnings.Separately, a former employee of Primary Global, James Fleishman, is expected to go to trial later this month on insider trading charges. He has denied any wrongdoing.
108;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
109;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-06-23T20:50:49Z;Energy and financials lead losses on Wall St;;"Energy and financial stocks led the losses in a volatile session on Wall Street as traders continued to digest the downbeat assessment of the US economy given by the Federal Reserve late in the previous session and also worried about a disappointing rise in unemployment claims.The markets tumbled in early trading on these worries, but then managed to rally somewhat towards the end of the session on news reports that European leaders had reached a breakthrough on a Greek austerity plan.Still, the financial sector still saw the sharpest losses in the session, falling 1 per cent as Fifth Third Bancorp fell 2.5 per cent to $12.09 and Bank of New York Mellondeclined 2.3 per cent to $25.44. The KBW banking index was down 1 per cent.Industrial stocks also suffered from a “risk off” trade. Boeing was down 1.2 per cent to $71.25 as the S&P industrial index fell 0.3 per cent.But the worst losses came from the energy sector as oil prices fell hard after an unexpected intervention in the oil markets by the International Energy Agency.The S&P energy index was down 1.1 per cent as Schlumberger fell 0.6 per cent to $83.10 and Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $99.36.The sell-off in risk assets began late on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the US economy and lifted its inflation expectations.The downbeat mood persisted into Thursday’s session, and the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent by mid-session.But the markets reversed some of their losses in late trading following a Reuters report that Greece had forged a deal with the EU and IMF on a five-year austerity plan.The S&P 500 then closed only 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.50.Helping keep the index in negative territory, however, was data from the labour department showing that the number of unemployed Americans filing for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, which was more than had been expected by economists.Separate data from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 2.1 per cent in May, though the news was not all bad as the median home sale price rose 2.6 per cent from April.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.5 per cent to 12,053.93. The Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 0.7 per cent to 2,686.82.The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 7.5 per cent to 29.77.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, argued that the losses in the session were due to a downturn in sentiment rather than any change in the fundamentals, as the economic data were mixed and the Federal Reserve did not say anything that had not been anticipated.The financial sector actually saw some strong gains in the session, led by Western Digitalwhich jumped 7.1 per cent to $37.01 after a favourable analyst report. Elsewhere, Red Hat gained 3.6 per cent to $45.27 after the software company reported better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings and raised its forecast for the year.Micron Technology was up 3.1 per cent to $8.43 while Nvidiaadded 3 per cent to $16.21. The S&P technology sector was up 0.9 per cent.The healthcare sector saw almost no losses in the session, helped by gains from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer after the companies said their blood thinner Apixaban (Eliquis) had seen some positive trial results. Bristol-Myers was up 5.7 per cent to $29.33 while Pfizer added 1.8 per cent to $20.65.In other news, Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, was up 5.5 per cent to $1.16 after reporting a smaller-than-
expected first-quarter loss driven by a decline in expenses and stronger same-store sales growth.Lennar, the homebuilder, also reported a loss that was better than analysts had expected. Its stock was up 2.3 per cent to $18.51, but it was still 1.8 per cent lower over the year.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, rose 5.3 per cent to $56.93 after its first-quarter earnings beat earnings targets and the company raised its outlook for profit growth this yearConAgra, the maker of Healthy Choice frozen meals, was down 0.2 per cent to $25.37 after its earnings fell short of expectations and investors worried about the effect of higher commodity costs."
110;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;PC makers step up efforts to combat iPad;;The fightback by PC makers against Apple’s iPad intensifies this week as new products and prototypes go on show at Computex, the world’s second-biggest consumer electronics trade fair, which opens on Tuesday in Taipei.PC makers have seen sales fall in the past year as consumers have flocked to the iPad. Now, more than a year after the iPad’s launch, they hope to hit back with their own tablet models and notebooks and netbooks.HP, Acer, Asus and Lenovo are among PC makers expected to unveil new tablet and notebook PC models at Computex.Chipmakers such as Intel, Nvidia, AMD and Arm will reveal plans for chips that would allow for more powerful and less battery-intensive mobile devices.These products represent a two-pronged strategy by PC makers: on the one hand, a big push to revive consumer excitement in laptops, and, on the other, to compete head-on with Apple’s iPad 2 tablet with either cheaper or more creatively designed versions of their own.Another focus of the show is likely to be PC makers’ plans for notebooks or tablets based on Chrome, Google’s operating system that was previewed by the internet company in May.A number of hardware makers have already started selling their tablets, such as Acer’s Iconia, the Eee Pad Transformer by Asus, and Motorola’s Xoom.However, while some models, such as that of Asus, have been selling well in the US, total sales volumes of these rival tablets are still far behind those of the iPad. None have captured consumers’ imaginations in the same way.This has been partly due to supply constraints for high-end touch screens as a result of the disruption caused by the Japan earthquake.Lenovo, which launched its LePad in China in late March, said on Thursday it was facing a supply shortage. The LePad, which will launch in the US in July, is being manufactured by Compal and Wistron of Taiwan.Whatever the sales figures for tablets – and estimates vary wildly – reviving consumer interest in notebook PCs is also becoming increasingly urgent.Research firms are providing hard evidence that consumers are showing less commitment towards forms of computing other than tablets.Global desktop and notebook PC sales declined slightly in the first quarter to 81.3m units down from 81.6m a year earlier, according to a report by the IHS iSuppli research firm last week.However, Acer, the number three PC maker and one that relies more than others on netbooks, saw its shipments fall by 20 per cent year-on-year as that category’s appeal faded in the face of competition from tablets.“IHS believes that the jury is still out on exactly how much tablets are cannibalising PC sales,” Matthew Wilkins, principal analyst for compute platforms research at IHS said.“However, the rising number of tablet models on the market, along with certain high-profile product launches during the first quarter, caused confusion among consumers as to exactly how to view the tablet platform relative to the PC platform,” he added.IHS iSuppli predicts shipments of traditional PC-style tablets will be outstripped 10 to one by media tablets such as the iPad over the next five years with 889m of such tablets shipped by 2015 compared with 89m PC tablets.However, it thinks PC makers could benefit from new hybrid formats, such as where tablets can be docked with keyboards and turned into laptops.Asus, which has enjoyed success with its Eee Pad Transformer tablet, on Monday unveiled the Padfone, a design for a smartphone that could be fitted into a tablet. It also said its next Eee PC netbook, which would run on the Meego operating system or on Windows, would be sold at $199.Intel sees notebook PCs being completely reinvented over the next two years to fend off the challenge from tablets.At its analyst day this month, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said notebook PCs would become more mainstream-priced consumer electronics devices. In a description that sounded like Apple’s MacBook Air, he said they would become “ultra-thin, ultra-capable” portable devices with all-day battery life, higher performance than the fastest laptops, instant-on capabilities, touch features and constant internet connectivity.Intel sees low to mid-teens percentage growth in PC sales continuing over the next several years as they become more affordable in emerging markets. On average, it took 175 weeks of income to buy a notebook computer in China in 1995 but this was down to seven weeks by last year.Acer likewise sees greater opportunities in notebooks than in tablets. Oliver Ahrens, head of Acer China, said so far demand for its Iconia tablet appeared very strong but it would wait to see if that continued before it made a strong production push.“We see notebooks as a content creation device and tablets as a content consumption device, so we expect notebooks to remain very strong,” said Mr Ahrens. “In the past, consumers have had to replace their notebook every 18 months because of the processor and software upgrades and I am not clear about how consumers will be convinced to replace their tablets at the same frequency.”He added that the Android operating system had yet to become more attractive to consumers. “It is not sexy enough,” he said.
111;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Fund manager latest to fall in inside trade push;;Samir Barai, a US hedge fund manager who directed his analyst to “shred as much as u can” weeks before his arrest, is the latest Wall Street trader to fall in a crackdown on insider trading.Mr Barai, a one-time Citigroup hedge fund portfolio manager who launched his own $100m (£62m) fund, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud and obstruction charges on Friday in the latest in a series of convictions for the US attorney’s office in Manhattan since it widened the net in its expansive insider trading investigation.Last month a jury convicted Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, on conspiracy and on insider trading charges.Mr Barai – who recorded some of his phone calls because of a hearing impairment – was arrested in February for paying cash to a consultant with Primary Global Research and officials at public companies in exchange for earnings and other information before it was publicly released.He allegedly received the secret information about technology companies from 2006 to 2008 from Winifred Jiau, a consultant with Primary Global, a California expert network firm that matches traders with industry experts.Ms Jiau received monthly payments of as much as $10,000 for her information, according to court filings.Also on Friday, Sonny Nguyen, a senior financial analyst for US chipmaker Nvidia pleaded guilty to conspiracy by providing information about Nvidia to Ms Jiau and Stan Ng. Mr Nguyen resigned on Thursday. The company said it was co-operating with authorities. Mr Ng has not previously surfaced in the investigation.The two guilty pleas will increase the pressure on Ms Jiau, who has been charged criminally and is scheduled to stand for trial beginning Wednesday in connection with the scheme.Ms Jiau lost a court bid in May to have the phone recordings thrown out.According to court filings, Mr Barai often shared the secret information that he obtained from Ms Jiau, who in turn received advanced earnings information from two sources at Marvell Technology and Nvidia.The case also draws in executives who previously worked at SAC Capital, Donald Longueuil and Noah Freeman. The two men were friends with Mr Barai. They have pleaded guilty to insider trading and Mr Freeman is co-operating with the government, while Mr Longueuil is not.In late November 2010, after Mr Barai read news articles reporting expansion of the US attorney’s office investigation into insider trading, he typed a message to his analyst, Jason Pflaum, on his BlackBerry.“Shred as much as u can,” Mr Barai told him, according to court documents. Mr Barai then told Mr Pflaum to leave his laptop with the doorman of his apartment building so that Mr Barai could collect it and “encrypt it [a]nd do a dept of defense delete” so the contents could not be restored.Mr Pflaum has pleaded guilty and is co-operating with the government.
112;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-05-19T21:06:02Z;Economic data offset LinkedIn debt surge;;Shares in LinkedIn more than doubled on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering, while the wider markets edged a little higher after a mixed set of data on US employment and manufacturing.The business-focused networking website was up 109.4 per cent to $94.25 after pricing on Wednesday night at $45 a share, which was already at the top-end of its projected range.The stock reached an intraday high of $122.69, up 173 per cent.“This is what I would call a speculative frenzy, and it is not going to end well,” said James Dailey, the chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.LinkedIn has received a huge amount of attention as the first US social networking and web 2.0 company to go public, ahead of its Facebook, retail services company Groupon and social games service Zynga.Many commentators have been asking whether the lofty valuations put on some of these point to the emergence of a technology bubble, akin to the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s.“This is a very rich valuation, which is reminiscent, to say the least, of the year 2000 exuberance,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors, a wealth management firm.But Mr Dailey said it was too early to talk about a bubble in the technology sector. “There has been a bubble in the use of the word bubble,” he said.The strong first day from LinkedIn had little impact on the wider technology sector, however, which was led lower in the session by chipmakers after Goldman Sachs cut its view on the sector from “neutral” to “cautious”.The investment bank’s rating on Intel was reduced from “neutral” to “sell” sending shares in the chipmaker down 1.4 per cent to $23.54.Applied Materials, which was also downgraded, lost 1.2 per cent to $14.33 while Nvidia fell 1.4 per cent to $17.78.That left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 0.9 per cent and S&P technology index up 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent to 1,343.50 after better-than-expected employment data outweighed a disappointing number from the Philadelphia Fed on manufacturing.Employment numbers showed that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits had fallen by 29,000 last week to 409,000, lower than the 420,000 economists had been expecting. But the figure was still above the 400,000 mark, which is the point at which economists conclude the economy is adding jobs.But the Philadelphia Fed’s reading on mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity tumbled to 3.9, indicating very little expansion. This was a sharp fall from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“There is still some worry that labour market gains may be faltering a bit,” said Joshua Shapiro chief US economist at MFR.Separately, data showed that sales in previously occupied homes had fallen slightly in April, in another sign that the US housing market remained depressed.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent at 12,603.81 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent higher at 2,823.24.The retail sector was again in focus after another raft of mixed earnings reports and the S&P retail index was down 0.1 per cent.Shares in Advance Auto Parts fell 10.2 per cent to $63.48 after the spare-part retailer’s earnings missed analysts forecasts.The company said earnings in the first quarter were $1.35 a share on $109.6m, short of the $1.38 a share expected.Sears Holdings was down 2.6 per cent to $73.86 after the retailer reported a disappointing loss in the first quarter.The owner of Sears and Kmart posted a net loss of $170m, or $1.58 a share, compared with a net profit of $16m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period in 2010Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, lost 3.9 per cent to $40.80 after reporting slightly better than expected earnings, but giving a current-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, saw a 59 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, exceeding expectations and sending shares in the company up 2.9 per cent to $63.11.Big Lots, another discount retailer, was down 10.6 per cent to $33.74 following reports that it had decided not to put itself up for sale.
113;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-05-13T21:56:50Z;Poor earnings reports weigh on US stocks;;The technology sector lost ground after an escalation in Yahoo’s dispute with Alibaba Group and a number of badly received earnings reports, helping to lead the wider markets into negative territory for the final session of a volatile week.Yahoo slid 3.6 per cent to $16.55 after the group claimed that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group, had sold one of its big assets without board or shareholder approval. Yahoo owns about 40 per cent of Alibaba.These losses followed a 7.3 per cent drop in Yahoo shares on Wednesday after the original announcement that Alibaba had offloaded the fast-growing online payment unit. Alibaba Group has denied that it sold the asset without board approval.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Nvidia, the chipmaker, fell 10.9 per cent to $18.26 after its first-quarter results failed to impress investors. Shares in sector peer CA suffered a similar fate, dropping 8.6 per cent to $22.90 after its fourth-quarter results.These losses left the S&P technology sector down 1.2 per cent, making it one of the worst performing sectors on Wall Street, and helped knock the S&P 500 down 0.8 per cent to 1,337.77. The benchmark index was down 0.2 per cent over the week.Financial stocks also helped to drive the S&P 500 lower on Friday, as the sector suffered from renewed unease over the mounting debt crisis in Greece.JPMorgan Chase was down 2.1 per cent to $43.15 while SunTrust Banks fell 2.2 per cent to $27.47. The S&P financial index, the worst performing sector on Wall Street, lost 1.5 per cent.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.8 per cent to 12,595.52 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index 1.2 per cent lower at 2,828.47.The Nasdaq was flat over the week and the Dow fell 0.3 per cent over the period.Losses on Friday were limited by some upbeat data showing a rise in consumer confidence this month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 72.4 for May, a three-month high, as Americans turned more optimistic about the economy.Separately, the consumer price index of inflation showed that prices had not risen dramatically in May, with the price of goods excluding food and energy gaining a modest 0.2 per cent.The week on Wall Street began with strong gains as the markets recovered from 1.7 per cent losses in the previous week and sentiment continued to ride high following bumper official employment numbers on Friday.“The jobs data on Friday were off the charts,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, lifting sentiment on Wall Street for the first few days of the week.But on Wednesday the rebound was derailed by a sharp drop in commodity prices, which dragged down the energy and material sectors. Energy and material stocks fell 3 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the day, leading the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1.1 per cent to its worst one day drop in nearly two months.This left the S&P energy index down 1.4 over the week and the materials index 1.9 per cent lower. Both indices are down 7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively so far in May.Transportation stocks failed to rise during the week, despite a further fall in oil prices, indicating that investors were afraid that the high oil price could hurt economic growth.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was 1.6 per cent lower over the week and the S&P airline index was 0.3 per cent lower.“The real disappointment this week was that the fall in oil prices did not energise the markets outside the energy sector,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Microsoft’s $8.5bn acquisition of Skype was the big deal news of the week, and left shares in the technology group down 3.3 per cent to $25.03 over the five days.Goldman Sachs shares fell 5.6 per cent over the week to $141.46 after Wall Street analysts said the bank could still face charges from the US Department of Justice for its conduct during the financial crisis.Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities on Thursday dropped Goldman to “sell”, while Chris Maimone of Standard & Poor’s lowered his rating to “hold”.Citigroup lost 8.1 per cent to $41.53 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday.These losses helped the S&P financial index drop 2.1 per cent over the week.Elsewhere, Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for Dollar Thrifty, sending shares in the takeover target up 17.3 per cent to $81.83 over the week. Hertz fell 2.7 per cent to $16.39.
114;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-05-10T01:54:34Z;Nvidia buys UK’s Icera for $367m;;Nvidia, the US chipmaker, on Monday announced a $367m cash deal to buy privately held UK rival Icera.The deal will allow Nvidia to compete better with Qualcomm and Intel in the growing market for smartphone chips.The sale of the Bristol-based chip company will also come as a relief to the European venture capital community, which has invested heavily in the company. VC companies including Amadeus Capital Partners, Atlas Ventures, Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and DFJ Esprit have poured about $250m into the company since it was founded in 2002. It has been one of the biggest recent investments in a European semiconductor start-up.“It was such an iconic investment, if that had gone wrong, we would have been in real trouble,” said Hermann Hauser, founder of Amadeus Capital Partners.However, the sale price is a far cry from the $1bn stock market flotation that Stan Boland, Icera’s chief executive and co-founder, had originally envisioned for the company.“It is hard to be a small company innovating in the mobile space because it is a big boys’ game,” said Mr Boland, a serial entrepreneur. Being part of a large company such as Nvidia, he said, would give Icera the credibility it needed.“We were aiming for an IPO for quite a long time but it is more important to make sure we can be successful for the long term.”Mr Boland said he expected to remain running the Icera business for “several more years”.Icera’s top management owned 20 per cent of the company and should receive more than $73m from the sale. This adds to the already considerable wealth amassed by Mr Boland and his co-founder Simon Knowles when they sold a previous chip company, Element 14, to Broadcom for $594m in 2000.Icera, which makes an innovative type of radio chip for mobile broadband dongles and smartphones, is potentially a challenger to large US companies such as Qualcomm and Intel.Its products had been approved for use by more than 50 mobile phone operators, including Orange, Vodafone and AT&T. However, it has struggled to secure deals in the mobile handset market and was yet to generate any cash.The acquisition of Icera allows Nvidia to consolidate its already strong position in smartphones and tablets.It made a breakthrough with its Tegra processor, which now powers some of the best-known tablets in the market, as well as the “super phones” such as the LG Optimus 2X and Motorola Atrix 4G.
115;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-05-08T23:15:31Z;Tablet talk: how does the iPad 2 measure up?;;Apple insists 2011 will be the year of its iPad 2, but plenty of rivals are launching their own tablets in the hope of stealing the technology company’s thunder.About 60m tablets will be sold in 2011, according to IMS Research, the industry analysts, and Apple is likely to be responsible for three out of four of these. Is such dominance justified? After testing the iPad 2, Samsung’s Galaxy Tab and the Motorola Xoom, as well as seeing several other tablets demonstrated close-up, I believe the iPad faces strong competition in several areas.DesignIt would be hard to match the looks of the iPad 2. Apple honed down an already classic design with its second attempt at a tablet, making it 15 per cent lighter and shaving 33 per cent off its thickness. The basic Wi-Fi version weighs just 21.2 ounces and is 0.35 inches thick.But the iPad 2 still has a large bezel framing the 9.7-inch screen, while other tablets such as the Motorola Xoom are heading towards edge-to-edge screens.Samsung is into its second-generation designs as well, refining its Galaxy Tab line-up. A 10.1-inch version, which goes on sale in the US on June 8, is slightly thinner and lighter than the iPad 2, despite its bigger screen size. At 0.34 inches thick, it weighs 20.98 ounces.SpeedThe iPad 2 is twice as fast as its predecessor, with a dual-core A5 chip giving it two processing brains instead of one. There is also an updated graphics chip that dramatically improves handling of video and games.However, many rival tablets run dual-core processors from Nvidia, a specialist graphics chipmaker. Its Tegra 2 will be followed by a quad-core processor in the summer, so the iPad 2 is likely to be outgunned by the end of the year.SoftwareThis should be no contest. There are more than 65,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad 2. New possibilities are created in gaming as cameras and a gyroscope have been added. The software is maturing too – Apple raised the bar with the introduction of its GarageBand and iMovie apps at the iPad 2’s unveiling, offering rich tools to create music and edit movies. Version 4.3 of its operating system enables faster browsing and allows more apps to stream video wirelessly to a television.In contrast, the Android Market – the rival to Apple’s App Store – has only about 100 apps designed for tablets. However, with so many manufacturers using Android to power their devices, this number should climb rapidly in the coming months, just as it did for smartphones. Expect to see many of the best iPad apps replicated for Android tablets.Version 3.0 of the Android operating system, codenamed Honeycomb, is the first purpose-designed for tablets and it has enough innovations to make Apple’s iOS seem a little old-fashioned.Instead of static app icons, an Android tablet’s desktop interface can have a live feel to it, with widgets for e-mail and calendars to scroll through. Items such as pictures, books and videos can also be stacked and flicked through.Multitasking is easier, with large thumbnails of previously used apps appearing on screen at the touch of a button, while notifications and settings are easier to access and better summarised on screen. The Android Market can also feed apps to tablets over the air if they are chosen through a PC’s browser – there is no need to tether devices, with everything being managed in the “cloud”.The HP Touchpad, due this summer and featuring Palm’s webOS operating system, also has a more sophisticated interface than the iPad. It stacks and links items too – an e-mail and a web page can be grouped together, for example. Apps can be displayed as cards to be flicked through, and are closed by flinging them off the top of the screen.Screen sizeThe iPad comes in just one screen size (9.7 inches diagonally), with a resolution of 1,024 x 768 pixels and in a shape that does not fit the 16:9 ratio of widescreen movies and television. Apple offers no improvements to the screen with the iPad 2. Its rivals have a range of screens and higher resolutions – the Motorola Xoom’s is 10.1 inches with 1,280 x 800 pixels and a wider aspect ratio that is better suited to movies. The Samsung Galaxy Tab and BlackBerry PlayBook are seven-inch tablets that fit in a jacket pocket. Samsung is offering a choice of 8.9-inch or 10.1-inch screens.CamerasThese are the big addition to the iPad 2, enabling video conferencing with FaceTime and high-definition video recording. But the front and rear cameras are both less than one megapixel, have no flash and offer distinctly average results when it comes to photos. I took much better pictures and video with the Xoom, which has a five-megapixel rear-facing camera with dual-LED flash, along with a two-megapixel front-facing camera.PriceThe iPad starts at $499 in the US for a 16Gb version, but I find that size inadequate given the number of apps worth buying, including sizeable games, along with music, books, videos and photos.Although Apple argues its competitors struggle to match it on price, I bought the 32Gb version of the Wi-Fi-only iPad 2 for $599 – the same price as the 32Gb Wi-Fi-only Xoom. The BlackBerry PlayBook also matches the iPad’s price. Its 16Gb version sells for $499, albeit with a smaller screen, while the seven-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab is available for $350, although it runs an earlier version of Android.MagicIn the words of Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, the iPad is a “magical and revolutionary” device – and indeed it is, in the sense of author Arthur C. Clarke’s assertion that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. Apple’s mystique is also at work in its marketing, its retail stores, the allure of its brand and ingenious features such as the new covers that latch on to the iPad magnetically to protect its screen.Rivals may match the iPad on price and beat it on specifications, but that old Apple magic will be harder to dispel.
116;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-05-05T18:50:33Z;Intel wants grip on mobile market;;The revolution in chip design announced by Intel this week is being seen as an attempt to see off a threat from Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer, which challenges its dominance in microprocessors.The world’s biggest chipmaker by sales on Wednesday unveiled a breakthrough 3D structure for its next-generation processors that the US company estimated could give it a three-year lead over competitors.Intel already has 80.8 per cent of the PC processor market, compared with 18.9 per cent for its rival AMD, according to figures released on Thursday by IDC, the research firm.However, it has failed to produce chips power-efficient enough for use in mobile phones and tablet computers, where Arm-based chips dominate.In particular, Apple’s iPhone and iPad handheld devices have used chips based on Arm’s designs, rather than Intel’s.Arm is also moving into Intel’s core PC market. IDC predicted that more than 13 per cent of PC processors would be based on Arm’s architecture by 2015.However, with Intel’s new design promising to cut power consumption in half compared with its current generation, a breakthrough into phones should be nearer.The design’s introduction on chips with circuit widths of 22 billionths of a metre will go into mass production later this year.“We’ve been asking what’s your road map to get into cell phones?” said Len Jelinek, semiconductor manufacturing analyst at iSuppli, the research firm.Lee Simpson, semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said: “This is Intel starting to advance into mobile.”As early as next year, he said, customers such as Apple could be considering Intel chips for their devices.Arm, however, made light of the threat. “There is no real surprise in the announcement,” said Ian Drew, executive vice-president of marketing at Arm. “3D technology has been talked about for a decade.“Yes, Intel is the first to announce it, but there are lots of people following them quite quickly. We also need to wait and see how these chips will work in practice,” said Mr Drew.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a pivotal manufacturer for Intel rivals Qualcomm, Nvidia, and others, said its chips would remain competitive with Intel’s even though it would not use 3D transistors until the 14-nanometre generation arrived.The company said that while Intel would have more powerful transistors as a result of its new design, TSMC’s chips would have better interconnections and higher transistor density such that, “in terms of overall performance we won’t lag behind Intel”.Shang-Yi Chiang, vice-president of research and development, said TSMC had worked on 3D transistors since 2003.“If anyone is going to push Moore’s law to the furthest, TSMC will be there,” he said.Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies, said that to rival Arm-based chips, Intel may have to wait an extra generation and a further two years, when it can shrink circuitry to 14-nanometre widths.“As far as being competitive with Arm, I think the 22nm generation may be close to par but maybe not at par and will certainly not be enough reason to uproot the established architecture,” he says.“When it gets to the 14nm generation, it may have enough of an edge that the device makers and carriers will look at that.”Arm shares fell 7.3 per cent on Wednesday on speculation about the Intel announcement.They rebounded by nearly 3 per cent on Thursday. Many analysts took the view that Intel’s advance posed little immediate threat.A bigger loser was Soitec, a French semiconductor maker that pioneered an alternative technology for dealing with increasingly small-sized chips.Soitec shares have fallen more than 9 per cent since Wednesday.
117;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Demand for new chips boosts AMD profits;;Advanced Micro Devices, number two in PC microprocessors to Intel, reported first-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations as it saw strong demand for its first generation of “Fusion” chips, combining a video engine with general computer processing.Both AMD and Intel are moving this year to processors that handle both video and general data on the same chip. AMD’s “Brazos” platform featuring these “accelerated processing units” (APUs) sold well in the first quarter and the Silicon Valley company said it expected the higher end Llano platform to be widely available in systems in the current quarter, offering improved graphics and all-day battery life in notebooks.“APU unit shipments greatly exceeded our expectations and we are excited to build on that momentum now that we are shipping our Llano APU,” said Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer and interim chief executive, in a statement.However, he acknowledged during an analyst conference that there has been “continued softness” in AMD’s server business, where it has lost market share to Intel’s processors.But he said he expected to see market share gains in the second half, with AMD introducing a new “Bulldozer” chip design in servers in late summer.Mr Seifert took over the chief executive role in January from Dirk Meyer, who left after a disagreement with the board over strategy. The chief financial officer said the board was “actively interviewing” for a permanent successor.AMD said its graphics chip business appeared to gain some share from its chief rival Nvidia during the quarter and it said it had picked up business from Apple, where its chips featured in the latest MacBooks.Overall revenues of $1.61bn were in line with analyst expectations, while underlying profits of 8 cents a share topped Wall Street estimates of 3 cents. AMD said it expected second-quarter revenues to be flat to slightly down, again in line with analyst figures of $1.59bn.AMD shares fell 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading on the news to $8.67.
118;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-04-11T15:01:43Z;Intel unveils first chip for tablets;;Intel is launching its first chip designed for tablet computers in an attempt to wrest control of the fast-growing market from UK-based Arm, whose chip architecture is now behind the majority of smartphones and tablets.The world’s biggest chipmaker will on Tuesday announce the availability of “Oak Trail”, the first product released by its newly-formed “netbooks and tablets” group, at a conference in Beijing. Intel expects more than 35 devices to be using Oak Trail starting from May, including ones from Fujitsu and Lenovo.While Intel has long dominated the market for processors in desktop and notebook computers, it has yet to make significant headway in supplying chips for smartphones and tablets – devices now having an impact on demand for traditional PCs.It had unsucessfully tried to enter the smartphone market last year with a chip codenamed “Moorestown”. Not a single smartphone company chose to use Intel’s chip, which was considered too large and power-hungry.Doug Davis, general manager of the new group, on Monday said the new chip would deliver “architectural enhancements for longer battery life and greater performance”.Smartphone sales are this year expected to increase by half and tablet shipments nearly quadruple, according to analysts. By contrast, PC shipments are expected to increase by only about 10 per cent compared with last year.The problem for Intel is that most smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhone and iPad, are powered by chips based on Arm’s architecture and designed by a variety of companies such as Qualcomm, Nvidia, Samsung, and Marvell.“[Intel] knows perfectly well that the . . . tablet market is being defined right now. And if the company doesn’t become a player immediately, its prospects of getting into the market in the future will only grow dimmer,” said Matt Wilkins, principal analyst at iSuppli.Intel concedes that it is late to the market in supplying chips for tablets, but says there is still time to catch up. “We don’t see [competition in the tablet market] as a 100m dash. It’s a marathon …this is the beginning of the beginning,” George Chacko, platform marketing manager at Intel, said.Intel is hoping to do so by delivering quicker technical advances than the rest of the industry. It aims to accelerate the rate it introduces new processors, with each new version being smaller, cheaper and using less power, to three within the next three years.Intel’s new chip may also have a broader impact on the tablet industry, according to Philip Winslow, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “Oak Trail” will be “critical to the medium-term success” of any tablet using the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system by helping to extend the battery life of a Windows-based tablet from about 5 hours to 7.5 hours. Windows is not widely used in tablets now because it is not optimised for tablets and uses a lot of power.But Gartner expects Apple – which uses an Arm-based processor manufactured by Samsung – to still claim nearly half of the global tablet market even by 2015.In smartphones, Intel is now pinning its hopes onto a next-generation chip, named Medfield, to be launched later this year.
119;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-04-04T20:54:17Z;US airlines hit by Southwest woes;;Shares in Southwest Airlines lost ground after a problem with one of its planes on Friday caused hundreds of its flights to be cancelled over the weekend, while the wider markets were broadly flat as gains in the materials sector were balanced by losses in technology stocks.The largest US airline by number of domestic passengers lost 1.7 per cent to $12.46 following the news that one of its aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing when a hole formed in its canopy.This then prompted planes to be grounded over the weekend and Monday as the airline examined its planes looking for metal fatigue and cracks.Related stocks also lost ground in the session. AMR, American Airlines’ parent company, was down 1.9 per cent to $6.27 while Hawaiian Holdings lost 2.5 per cent to $5.88.In the wider markets US equities struggled for direction, with the S&P 500 moving only fractionally higher to 1,332.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,399.96, just a hair’s breadth away from 12,400, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,789.19.The materials sector led the gains, boosted by deal activity and slightly higher commodity prices. Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, was up 12 per cent to $66.34, after it purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m.Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn hostile bid for Equinox Minerals, sending US shares in the Toronto-based miner up 30.1 per cent to $7.76.Massey Energy, the coal miner, was up 0.9 per cent to $69.87 while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, added 1.3 per cent to $55.77. The S&P materials sector was up 0.7 per cent.But these gains were balanced out by losses in the technology sector after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales of semiconductors fell 1.1 per cent in February from the previous month to $25.2bn.Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company, lost 2.9 per cent to $30.60 while Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, fell 3.6 per cent to $17.55. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.9 per cent while the S&P technology index fell 0.5 per cent, the worst performing of the S&P 500 sectors.This neutral session followed on from 0.5 per cent gains on Friday after news that 216,000 US jobs had been created in March and that the unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low at 8.8 per cent.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the losses sustained following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. The index is 0.7 per cent below the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.According to Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund, technicals are going to be key over the coming months.He argues that if the S&P advances past 1,344, the mid-February high before the revolt in Egypt, then the index will continue up to 1,400. “If it fails to get to 1,344, we are going to retest the floor of 1,280,” he said.In corporate news, shares in Ambassadors International plunged 76.8 per cent to $0.65 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. Ambassador is the parent company of Windstar Cruises, the cruise ship operator.In the preceding two days shares in the company had rocketed in value, gaining 194.7 per cent.Pfizer, the drugmaker, added 0.8 per cent to $20.54 after agreeing to sell Capsugel, the world’s largest maker of hard capsules, to private equity group KKR for $2.4bn in cash.The sale will allow Pfizer to buy back common stock this year in excess of the $5bn in repurchases it was planning. But Pfizer also lowered its revenue forecast for 2011 and trimmed its 2012 revenue guidance as a result of the deal.Shares in Ford Motor continued to gain ground after news on Friday that it had overtaken General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker in March, while reporting a 19 per cent gain in US sales.The carmaker was up 2.6 per cent to $15.56, helped by an upgrade by Credit Suisse to “neutral” from “underperform”.Shares of defence contractor General Dynamics fell 5.2 per cent to $73.37 after Gulfstream Aerospace, its business jet unit, said that a jet crashed during a test flight on Saturday.
120;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-03-14T18:48:08Z;Ex-McKinsey partner traded tips for cash;;Anil Kumar, the former McKinsey partner, testified in a New York court on Monday that he told Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of hedge fund Galleon Group, about strategic plans and earnings guidance for at least three McKinsey clients in exchange for payments.Mr Kumar, a government witness at the insider trading trial of Mr Rajaratnam, told the jury how he leaked details of “super-confidential” negotiations by chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices to buy either Nvidia or ATI Technologies, the graphics companies.The court heard the 2006 talks were so secret that the project was at first code-named “Supernova,” and then “Go Big”, said Mr Kumar, who advised AMD on the deal in his capacity as a McKinsey’s consultant.When Mr Kumar updated Mr Rajaratnam that AMD was going forward with the ATI deal, he said he recalled the hedge fund founder questioning him, since Nvidia was the stronger of the two companies. “I said, come on,” Mr Kumar recalled. He told Mr Rajaratnam: “I’m in the inner circle” referring to AMD.He also recalled later telling Mr Rajaratnam that AMD would pay at least $20 a share, a premium to where the company was trading at the time.Mr Kumar said he knew that Mr Rajaratnam was buying AMD stock, but he did not want to know the specific details.When Mr Rajaratnam sought to renegotiate his payment, saying he would pay him after the trades were placed, Mr Kumar objected saying it was too much of a “slap” in the face to acknowledge that he was involved in a “bigger” crime.Mr Kumar received a “bonus” from Galleon of $1m that year for supplying information about the AMD deal.Not all the deals worked out. Mr Kumar told Mr Rajaratnam that another one of his clients expected to lose money, so Mr Rajaratam took a short position on the stock. But the company announced a takeover, causing the stock to rise instead. Mr Kumar said that Mr Rajaratnam said he was “very upset about losing money” this time.Mr Kumar also offered an account of Mr Rajaratnam’s providing him with unsolicited records from Intel – a rival of AMD.Prosecutors are expected to play recordings of the phone calls between Mr Kumar and Mr Rajaratnam.Mr Kumar’s account came on the second day of his testimony for prosecutors in Mr Rajaratnam’s trial.
121;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-03-11T22:48:56Z;Wall Street rebounds from sharp losses;;Following the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit north-east Japan, the strongest in 140 years, the US’s KBW property and casualty index fell 0.7 per cent, even as the broader market saw gains.Insurance analysts said that losses to private insurers would be limited, in part because Japan maintains a government quake insurance fund. The KBW index recovered from an earlier 2.2 per cent tumble.“The initial take on today’s event, centred about 180 miles from Tokyo, is that it likely is less severe in terms of industry losses,” said Brian Meredith, analyst at UBS.Aspen Insurance Holding, which has exposure to Japanese quakes, fell 4.2 per cent to $27.59. Platinum Underwriters fell 4.6 per cent to $37.83. ACE Ltd, which recently purchased protection to limit earthquake losses, was up 0.5 per cent to $61.37.However, US refineries and steelmakers were seeing sharp gains as the price of oil fell further, partly on expectations that consumption in Japan would fall.Tesoro, the petrol refiner, led the S&P 500 risers, gaining 8.5 per cent to $24.51. AK Steel rose 5.7 per cent to $15.46. US crude oil dipped below $100 a barrel at one point.“There could be some rebuilding in Japan to offset weaknesses coming out of China,” said Steve Coker, portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. “But now that oil’s coming off, there are higher expectations for steel and commodity names.”Energy, up 1.6 per cent, and materials, up 1.3 per cent, led the broader market higher on Friday.The S&P 500 index was up 0.7 per cent, to 1,304.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,043.94.Retail sales, which account for about 70 per cent of US economic activity, helped the closely watched Philadelphia Semiconductor index bounce back. The index was up 0.6 per cent, recovering from a 5.5 per cent drop in the previous two sessions after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the sector earlier this week. As measured by the US commerce department, February sales of $387.1bn were the highest in four months.The index’s move was led by National Semiconductor, which gained 3.8 per cent to $14.70, along with Micron Technology, which rose 3.2 per cent to $10.24. Nvidia rose 0.7 per cent to $18.05.Hewlett-Packard, the PC maker, was up 0.6 per cent to $41.73 after hitting its lowest point of the year on Thursday. Apple rose 1.6 per cent to $351.99.There are still concerns, however, that sales will be weak, especially with a flood of “tablet” PCs, such as the iPad and Xoom, entering the market.“Tablets … are a delaying factor in notebook purchasing decisions in developed markets,” said analysts at JPMorgan Chase.Verizon, which provides WiFi to tablets, fell 1.5 per cent to $35.85. Technology was still the biggest loser for the week, with the Nasdaq Composite index falling 2.5 per cent. It was the worst week for the index since last August.JDS Uniphase, which makes fibre optic connections for large telecoms companies, slid 22 per cent to $21.26. Technology groups have overtaken financials as the largest sector in the S&P 500. Finisar lost 46 per cent to $23.21, after it warned that the next quarter would see a sharp drop in activity in China.For the week, the Dow was down 1 per cent, and the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent. Losses were led by energy stocks, which fell 4 per cent as oil prices eased.Analysts said the market had been at a tipping point in the past week, with each of the major indices falling below their 50-day moving averages at one point.“We’ve had three weeks in consolidation, as the market was coiling to do something, spurred by geopolitical risks,” said Bernard McDevitt, director of trading at Cheevers & Company. “That is looking like it will resolve itself to the downside.”On Friday, RC2, a toymaker that makes Thomas the Tank Engine models, saw its shares rocket 11 per cent to $28.31 after Tomy, the Japanese group, said it would pay $640m to acquire it.Warner Chilcott, the drugmaker, rose 2.6 per cent to $23 after it announced a secondary offering, a further exit for the private equity group that had taken the company private.
122;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-03-07T22:45:07Z;Wall St gives up gains amid global uncertainty;;Shares in Starbucks ticked higher after a rating upgrade and comments from its chief executive officer about future acquisitions. But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock. The news sent shares in Western Digital up 16.2 per cent to $34.87.Accuray, the medical equipment maker, said it would buy TomoTherapy, a radiation treatment company for about $277m, or $4.80 a share in cash and stock. TomoTherapy was up 24.5 per cent to $4.57 while Accuray fell 10.1 per cent to $9.Shares in OCZ Technology Group were up 15.4 per cent to $9.12 after the company announced that it expected to report record fourth-quarter revenue. The company said it expected revenue of approximately $64m, an increase of nearly 100 per cent from the $32.4m reported in last year.Ciena, a maker of network equipment for phone companies, fell 9.8 per cent to $25.98 after reporting first-quarter results and forecasting that second-quarter revenue would come in below estimates.On Sunday, it was two years since the recession lows for the stock market. Since March 6 2009, when the S&P reached an intraday low of 666.79, the market has almost doubled.Since then, financials have added 169 per cent, consumer discretionary stocks are up 148 and industrials have added 143 per cent. One of the biggest gainers has been Netflix, which has gained 452 per cent to $207.40.
123;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-02-09T02:06:24Z;Light cast on alleged insider trading;;When Jason Pflaum joined Barai Capital in 2008 as an analyst he immediately hit the phones, calling public company contacts cultivated over the years by his boss, Samir Barai, prosecutors allege.Mr Pflaum spoke with insiders at Fairchild Semiconductor and Actel, who allegedly gave him quarterly earnings information, including revenues, inventories, and gross margins, before the group released their earnings, according to court filings. By trading on the information, Mr Barai’s fund allegedly made $500,000 in profits. In exchange for the tips, prosecutors allege the Fairchild source received $48,000.The Fairchild source was one of many contacts maintained by Mr Barai, who allegedly shared the information with Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil, two portfolio managers at the SAC Capital hedge fund group.The men operated a “triangle of trust” and worked with their own sources to glean non-public information about at least six companies going back to 2006, according to Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan. Two years later, Mr Pflaum allegedly destroyed documents at the direction of Mr Barai, and later pleaded guilty in a co-operation deal with the government in its ongoing investigation of alleged insider trading on Wall Street.A spokeswoman for Fairchild said the company was co-operating with the probe. SAC has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Lawyers for Mr Barai could not be reached for comment and Mr Longueuil attorney declined to comment.Authorities said more arrests were expected. The SEC said last week that at least 11 hedge funds could be implicated in the alleged insider trading scheme.Mr Freeman and Mr Barai both maintained a network of inside sources at public companies and through Primary Global Research, an expert network firm that matches money managers with experts, according to court filings.During regular conference calls, prosecutors allege, they shared the information with Mr Longueuil. They often listened together on calls with Winifred Jiau, who allegedly provided inside information about Marvell Technologies and Nvidia, according to court filings. Ms Jiau has denied wrongdoing.Mr Freeman worked as a research analyst for Brookside Capital, the hedge fund affiliate of Bain Capital. In 2005 he moved to small Boston-based hedge fund Sonar Capital, where he was head of technology research, then subsequently joined SAC. He was let go last year.Mr Longueuil worked as an analyst at Empire Capital, a technology focused hedge fund with $850m under management from 2004 to 2008. Empire declined to comment. Mr Longueuil subsequently joined SAC and was terminated last year.After news reports last autumn that prosecutors were expanding their investigation to include expert network firms, Mr Barai began to panic, according to court filings.“I think U [sic] just go into office. Shred as much as u can. Put all ur data files onto an encrypted drive,” Mr Barai pecked out on a BlackBerry Messenger note to Mr Pflaum.Mr Freeman, who is co-operating with prosecutors, in December secretly recorded a conversation with Mr Longueuil in which Mr Longueuil allegedly described how he destroyed a USB flash drive and two external hard drives filled with information he obtained from company insiders.“You take two pairs of pliers, and then you rip it open” and pull apart the contents, Mr Longueuil said. During a 20-block walk around the city, Mr Longueuil said he threw the contents of the destroyed memory cards “in the back of like random garbage trucks”.
124;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-02-01T08:53:11Z;Arm Holdings benefits from smartphone boom;;Increased demand for smartphones and tablets has boosted full-year revenues and pre-tax profits at Arm Holdings, the Cambridge-based chip maker whose designs feature in the Apple iPhone.Warren East, Arm chief executive, said the group’s designs were being used in an increasing number of electronic products, and that growth in licensing and royalties was behind increases in the group’s full-year turnover and pre-tax profit.The chip designer also said it signed a record 35 processor licences during the final three months of 2010.In January Microsoft said that it would use chips based on Arm’s designs to power the next generation of its Windows operating system, while Nvidia recently signed a licensing deal to use Arm designs for computing markets.Such high-profile deals, together with rumours that Arm could be a takeover target, have fed into the share price, pushing the stock to 10-year highs.Mr Warren dismissed talk of a possible takeover by a rival such as Intel, and said he was not concerned by the high valuation on the stock.“We are keeping our nerve and sticking to our knitting,” he said.Arm’s low-energy chips are found in more than 90 per cent of the mobile phones sold globally, and the group has benefited from demand for smartphones, which use more of the group’s chips per device than a basic handset. Arm also expects its chips to increasingly feature in devices such as smart meters and servers.The chip designer said it was well positioned to further gain market share in 2011 and expected that dollar revenues for the full-year “to be at least in line with market expectations”.For the full-year to December 31, pre-tax profits rose from £47.3m to £110m on an IFRS basis.Sales rose from £305m to £406.6m and earnings per share more than doubled from 3.11p to 6.36. A final dividend of 1.74p was proposed, up 20 per cent, bringing the total pay-out to 2.9p (2.42p).Arm shares, which have almost trebled over the past year, on Tuesday rose 33½p, or 6.5 per cent, to close at 549½p.● FT CommentMr East is playing the long game. Arm has made its mark over the past few years by selling energy efficient chips for mobiles. But what once seemed like catering to a niche market now looks like a clever move. Not only are phones getting smarter but the launch of the iPad is pushing Arm towards the higher margin PC market dominated by Intel. Arm is also dipping into the server sector, betting that a push towards “cloud computing” will drive demand for its energy-efficient chips. Arm shares are trading at a steep 54 times prospective earnings for 2011. But if Arm can achieve its vision of selling 100bn cumulative chips by 2020, the valuation may not look so silly.
125;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Qualcomm beats forecast as sales soar 25%;;Qualcomm, the leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales, raised its 2011 forecasts significantly on Wednesday as it eyed a significant expansion into tablets, e-readers and consumer electronics in the home.The San Diego-based company reported a record first quarter helped by strong smartphone sales. It raced past Wall Street expectations for its earnings and outlook, prompting its shares to rise more than 6 per cent to $55.07 in after-hours trading.The second-largest US chipmaker after Intel reported that revenues rose 25 per cent year on year to $3.35bn and earnings per share were up 42 per cent at 71 cents. Analysts expected profits of 59 cents a share on sales of $3.2bn, according to a Bloomberg survey.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said Qualcomm had benefited from smartphone unit sales that grew 70 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter and were expected to grow 50 per cent this year.He highlighted US operator Verizon Wireless’s planned launch of an iPhone containing Qualcomm chipsets in February and Microsoft‘s demonstration of the next version of Windows, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, as positive developments for the company.The company said that a dual-core version of Snapdragon with chipsets capable of producing advanced graphics and making 4G connections would increase Qualcomm’s presence in the tablet sector this year.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia has made the running in the sector with its Tegra 2 processor featuring in tablets such as the Motorola Xoom, which will be launched this quarter.Qualcomm announced its biggest acquisition this month – the $3.1bn purchase of chipmaker Atheros.Steve Mollenkopf, executive vice-president, said the deal would mean Qualcomm “could accelerate the extension of our technologies and platforms beyond cellular to computing, consumer electronics and networking”.Qualcomm raised its revenue guidance for its fiscal year ending in September by $1.2bn, with $650m of this driven by an improved outlook for its chip business and $550m due to improving conditions in its licensing business. It said royalties from the latter would benefit from the resolution of a licensing dispute with an unnamed company which had been underpaying Qualcomm.The chipmaker expects sales of $3.45bn-$3.75bn in the current quarter, up 30 per cent to 41 per cent on a year ago and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $3.14bn. The group raised its forecast for fiscal-year sales to about $13.9bn, up from prior guidance of about $12.7bn.
126;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Former Galleon managers admit insider trading;;Two former Galleon Group portfolio managers pleaded guilty to trading ahead of corporate takeovers based on inside information and agreed to co-operate with the government in its case against Raj Rajaratnam.Former portfolio manager Adam Smith, 38, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in a federal court in New York on Wednesday. Prosecutors allege his trades resulted in $1.3m in profits.Former trader Michael Cardillo also pleaded guilty to having received and traded on inside information in stocks such as JM Smucker and Procter & Gamble, federal prosecutors said.Mr Cardillo’s lawyer said her client “has taken the first step in moving on with his life”. Mr Smith’s lawyer said his client “made a mistake” and acknowledged it.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against both men.The guilty pleas increase the pressure on Mr Rajaratnam, the hedge fund billionaire, who is scheduled to go to trial on February 28.According to prosecutors, Mr Smith directly shared non-public information with Mr Rajaratnam and others at the hedge fund. If he testifies, he would be the only Galleon employee identified so far who could provide evidence against Mr Rajaratnam.Mr Rajaratnam has denied the allegations. A spokesman for Mr Rajaratnam on Wednesday declined to comment.According to prosecutors, Mr Smith was tipped by employees at technology companies Nvidia and Intersil about their quarterly earnings. He then allegedly shared that information with Mr Rajaratnam and others who profited from trading. Mr Smith also allegedly destroyed computer files and documents in October and November 2009 after Mr Rajaratnam’s arrest, court papers say.Mr Smith began his career at an investment bank and worked at Galleon from 2002 until 2009. Mr Cardillo was employed at Galleon from 2003 until late 2009.The new court documents link Mr Cardillo to another previously identified string of alleged insider traders through Craig Drimal, a trader at Incremental Capital who worked out of Galleon’s offices.Mr Drimal allegedly provided inside information about 3Com and Axcan to Mr Cardillo, who made $730,000 in illegal profits, court documents allege. Mr Drimal received information about a 3Com acquisition, from Zvi Goffer, a trader at Schottenfeld Group, say court papers. Mr Drimal and Mr Goffer have pleaded not guilty.Mr Smith of Galleon was also tipped by an unnamed investment banker about three corporate takeovers and shared the tips with Mr Rajaratnam, say court filings. Among the deals Mr Smith knew about in advance were Integrated Devices’ acquisition of Integrated Circuit in 2005, Advanced Micro Devices’ acquisition of ATI in 2006, and a potential acquisition of Vishay in 2008.Morgan Stanley advised both AMD and Integrated Devices on their transactions, according to Dealogic, a research firm.Last week, a Morgan Stanley banker was referred to in court filings as having been alleged by prosecutors to have tipped the AMD deal to an intermediary, who passed the information on to Mr Rajaratnam, according to court filings. The bank said the banker was placed on leave.A lawyer for the banker, Kamal Ahmed, said his client is co-operating with Morgan Stanley’s investigation and he expects his client will be fully exonerated.Nvidia previously surfaced in the government’s expanding insider trading probe. Prosecutors charged Winifred Jiau, who once consulted for Nvidia and was employed with research firm Primary Global, with tipping two unnamed hedge fund managers about Nvidia and Marvell Technology.

Halliburton, the second-largest US oilfields services company reported a profit of $605m, or 66 cents a share, up from $243m or 27 cents a share, as revenue from its North American operations soared 83 per cent from a year earlier due to a resurgence of drilling.Its stock was up 0.9 per cent to $39.55.The news helped the sector, with Cameron International rising 2 per cent to $51.27 and Schlumberger, which reported a 31 per cent jump in profit on Friday, up 0.9 per cent to $84.25. Material and technology stocks recorded the strongest gains.The S&P materials index rose 1 per cent to 235.69 as some commodity prices ticked up after the wobble in the previous week.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, was up 4.1 per cent to $16.43; Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore and coalminer, rose 1.6 per cent to $82.96.These gains helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,290.84 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1 per cent to 2,717.55. The Nasdaq has added 28.2 per cent since the start of September, outperforming the S&P which is up 23 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.9 per cent to 11,980.52, flirting with the 12,000 mark that was last reached before the financial crisis in June 2008.The technology sector strode forward with Intel up 2 per cent to $21.24 after the chipmaker announced that it was going to buy back $10bn in stock.Motorola rose 4.1 per cent to $38.66 while Apple was up 3.3 per cent to $337.45 Nvidia was up 11.3 per cent to $24.73 after Barron’s, the financial magazine, wrote a positive article saying shares in the chip designer could “practically double”.The S&P technology index was up 1.8 per cent to $454.43.Investors were broadly optimistic ahead of a what will be a cluttered news week. In the next five days numerous earnings results, a Federal Reserve meeting and the president’s State of the Union address are expected. Earnings reports are due from 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, Starbucks, Caterpillar and Microsoft, among others.Stocks struggled to see gains last week in spite of strong quarterly profit results as investors have come to expect forecast-beating figures. The S&P 500 lost ground even after solid earnings results from Morgan Stanley, General Electric and Google.More than 70 per cent of earnings reports so far this season have surpassed expectations. Markets have also found it difficult to climb higher in recent days on the back of the strong earnings season due to a widely held belief that stocks on Wall Street are due for a correction after rising nearly 23 per cent in the past five months.“Everyone is ready for a big correction but the strong earnings figures and the economic numbers are just not giving them an excuse for one,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “We could see a 3 to 7 per cent correction some time in the first quarter . . . Trees do not grow to the sky.”The other big results news of the session was McDonald’s, which reported fourth-quarter earnings up 2 per cent and in line with forecasts. The fast-food company reported weaker than expected December sales due to poor weather and warned that food costs would likely rise in 2011. The stock was up 0.5 per cent to $75.38, recovering from losses in early trading.In deal news, Rock Tenn, the paper and packaging manufacturer was up after agreeing to buy its bigger rival Smurfit-Stone Container for $3.5bn, creating North America’s second-largest paper container producer.The move, which will triple Rock Tenn’s revenue to $9bn, sent the company’s shares up 3.7 per cent to $59.55. Smurfit-Stone was up 27.2 per cent to $35 on the news, which was announced on Sunday.The consumer discretionary sector was weighed down by RadioShack, which fell 11.3 per cent to $15.62 after the electronics retailer projected weak earnings for the fourth quarter and said Julian Day, chairman and chief executive, planned to retire in May.Also in the sector, JC Penney was up 7.2 per cent to $32.52 after it announced restructuring plans.Overall, the S&P consumer services index was up 0.4 per cent to 305.22."
128;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Intel to pay $1.5bn in Nvidia settlement;;Intel is close to winding up extensive legal disputes surrounding its microprocessor business following an agreement to pay rival chipmaker Nvidia $1.5bn.The deal represented an out-of-court settlement between the two Silicon Valley companies and is similar to one reached with another neighbour, AMD, in November 2009.Intel’s rivals have been named as victims of its alleged monopolistic practices in investigations by regulators in Japan, Korea, Europe and the US.Intel’s chips are in four out of every five PCs sold and its settlements with AMD and Nvidia end its rivals’ complaints that Intel has used its superiority to try to exclude them from the market.Nvidia and Intel said on Monday they had agreed to drop all outstanding legal disputes between each other.A new six-year agreement for the cross-licensing of their technologies has been signed and Intel will pay Nvidia $1.5bn in licensing fees over the next five years.Intel had also agreed a five-year cross-licensing deal with AMD and paid it $1.25bn, with AMD agreeing to drop all complaints.The world’s biggest chipmaker settled its biggest outstanding case with regulators last August, when it agreed with the US Federal Trade Commission to use an open industry standard to make it easier for other chipmakers to connect their own products to its chips.The technology has been moving faster than the legal arguments involving Intel over the past 10 years.Last week, Intel introduced new processors combining graphics and media engines with the main processor for the first time.This could reduce the need for separate graphics chips made by Nvidia.However, Nvidia’s own graphics processing units are now challenging Intel’s chips as all-purpose processors and Nvidia is moving towards greater involvement in mobile computing, with chips based on the architecture of the UK’s Arm, rather than Intel’s x86 processor designs.“This agreement signals a new era for Nvidia,” said Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia chief executive.“Our cross licence with Intel reflects the substantial value of our visual and parallel computing technologies. It also underscores the importance of our inventions to the future of personal computing, as well as the expanding markets for mobile and cloud computing.”Nvidia shares were up 4 per cent in extended trading on the news in New York at $21.45, while Intel’s were flat at $20.69.
129;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-06T23:04:27Z;Microsoft strengthens the outlook for Arm;;"Arm Holdings is the pin-up of the UK technology sector. The Cambridge-based group, whose chip designs feature in electronic devices made by international brands such as Samsung, Sony, Nokia and Apple, has seen its share price rise more than 150 per cent in the past 12 months as investors bet big on the group’s growth potential.On Thursday Arm shares rose by as much as 13 per cent after Microsoft told visitors to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Arm chip designs would feature in a new version of the Windows operating system.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said that Microsoft would roll out a new class of less energy intensive chips based on Arm designs and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.The move is part of efforts to widen Windows beyond basic personal computers to portable devices, and Microsoft signalled that it would be two to three years before Arm chips featured in its devices.Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies, says Microsoft’s announcement was little more than confirmation that Arm was making good on its promise to widen the range of devices on which its chip designs can work.The market has long anticipated that Arm-based chips would feature in Windows 8 and had priced that into the stock. Following the announcement by Microsoft, graphics specialist Nvidia also said that it would be developing a new Arm-based core processor for desktops and servers.Both announcements underline how Arm, whose low-powered chip designs feature in 95 per cent of mobile phones sold worldwide as well as in other products, is widening its market. The group has until recently made little headway in the higher-power computer chip segment where Intel dominates.Arm’s focus on designing energy efficient chips for phones has been buoyed by the launch of smartphones such as the iPhone, as each device uses more Arm- designed chips than a conventional “dumb” handset.But its business model looks even more clever given that Arm’s chips are now being used in tablets, a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.Arm’s chips appear in Apple’s iPad, and will feature in Microsoft’s next range of mobile products.The iPad’s success has opened the floodgates to copycats from rivals such as Toshiba, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard. And with analysts predicting nearly 60m devices could be sold next year, Arm’s presence in the segment has boosted its value.Richard Holway at TechMarketView says that if consumers treat their tablet computers more like their phones and upgrade their devices more often, even those estimates may be too conservative.A move up the scale towards mobile PCs will enable Arm to command higher fees for each chip sold, though the market is smaller than for phones.Yet even given the strong outlook, Arm’s market
capitalisation of more than £6bn looks full.Arm has created a solid business model licensing its designs and collecting royalties once the chips are in operation. Yet analysts expect Arm to report full-year pre-tax profits of only about £140m on sales of nearly £400m next month.Sandeep S Deshpande, analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, says the stock looks expensive. Prospective earnings for 2014, for example, when he estimates as many as 200m tablets could be sold globally, would put Arm on 30.2 times earnings per share. To put that into perspective, Google and Apple, two other high-growth companies, are expected to trade at 11.6 times and 10.8 times 2014 earnings respectively, based on consensus estimates.Arm points out that its chip designs also appear in microcontrollers and printers and says that the company’s chips will start appearing in servers in the next five years.Speculation that Arm could be a takeover target for a big US group has also fed into the share price.Warren East, chief executive, insists that there would be little value in any one of its customers buying the company given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to remove the cost of researching and designing chips for a wide range of clients.Analysts largely agree. The most likely candidate would be Intel, which has the cash to make a purchase and could use a deal to squash its competition. But even a deal by Intel seems unlikely given it would likely face competition issues from regulators.The greater risk is that Intel hits back by eating into Arm’s market share in chips for phones. Intel’s Atom chip, which has been used in netbooks, has been adapted for smartphones.Ian Drew, head of marketing at Arm, says the company knows “it can’t rest on its laurels” and will continue to innovate.In the meantime, investors look set to keep buying into the company’s potential. Arm is “the lighthouse” of the UK tech sector, says Mr Deshpande. How long that light shines for remains to be seen.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and Paul Taylor"
130;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-06T22:01:09Z;Retail sales report weighs on US stocks;;Gap, Target and Macy’s were among the retail stocks that fell after weak festive holiday trading but positive news from the jobs market helped US stocks pare losses.The final verdict on retailers’ holiday shopping season was disappointing as many large chains missed their estimates.Retail Metrics said its index of same-store sales had risen 3.2 per cent against analysts’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1.6 per cent while the wider consumer discretionary sector sank 0.7 per cent. The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained. Nvidia soared 13.8 per cent to $19.33, while Qualcomm added 1.2 per cent to $52.67 and Texas Instruments gained 1.4 per cent to $33.25.Intel, which used to dominate the processor market, fell 0.8 per cent to $20.77.Initial jobless claims edged up by 18,000 to a total of 409,000 last week, but the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits fell. The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.
131;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-06T21:23:06Z;Microsoft needs to rethink tablets;;If Microsoft needed a change of technology strategy to give itself a chance of catching up with Apple’s iPad, it was evident this week in the US prices that Taiwan’s Asus unveiled for its own forthcoming line of touchscreen tablet computers.Three of the machines, which will run on the Android operating system from Google, will carry price tags of between $399 and $499 – a level competitive with the least expensive version of the iPad, which sells for $499.But the fourth machine, carrying Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating software, will cost buyers $999.In reaching down into the tablet market from its perch in the PC world, Microsoft has been found wanting.Even though it was the company that pioneered full, keyboard-less computers nearly a decade ago – although the tablet PCs it spawned rely on a stylus, not fingers, for contact – must make this message all the harder to swallow.Its earlier software was designed for full-powered PCs, capable of running the gamut of heavy-duty applications and with hardware specifications to match.But Microsoft has more than just price to catch up on, as it revises its plans for Windows on mobile devices.“There is only so much you can do with Windows 7 on a touchscreen,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, consumer PC and tablet analyst at Forrester Research. “It isn’t designed for a touch experience.”The answer, according to Microsoft, will come in a complete rewrite of Windows to make it more suitable for all the lightweight, touchscreen personal computing devices of the future – not just today’s tablets, like the iPad.It will also entail an erosion of the central “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has presided over the PC era, as the software company looks beyond its traditional chip partner to extend its software to silicon produced by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments – all of which use designs from UK-based Arm.The silicon used in these devices will require less power, will pack more of a computer’s functions into less space and should prove more reliable, according to Steven Sinofsky, head of the Windows and Windows Live internet businesses.Unveiling the plans now will give the many hardware makers that have built their own strategies around Microsoft technology time to plan for the new direction: but it also means a wait of two-three years before the software company has a true response to the iPad.Microsoft may be taking longer than some, but it is not the only one to have been scrambling this week to present a coherent response to the iPad.Much of the anticipation around tablets at the annual Consumer Electronics Show this week has been centred on the Android operating system, which Google originally designed to run on so-called smartphones.A new version, codenamed Honeycomb, has been designed to accommodate the larger screens of tablets.But while tablets designed to run on Honeycomb have been in plentiful supply, hard evidence of the software has been in short supply among the Las Vegas slot machines and craps tables this week.Google was reduced to issuing a tease for the latest version of Android late on Wednesday, offering what it called a “sneak peek” of Honeycomb.Motorola, one of the many hopefuls lining up behind the software, predicted that it would be the first out with a full Android tablet, with the machine on sale before the end of March.For Microsoft, meanwhile, there may have been little choice but to dig in for the long haul. Its Windows Phone 7 smartphone software, released to considerable acclaim late last year, supports many of the main functions users also look for in tablets, said Ms Ebbs.These include accessing Facebook, catching up with e-mail or watching video.But that software was narrowly designed for small screens, according to Microsoft executives, and has a user interface and closely defined hardware requirements that are not suitable for tablets.With the iPad expected to dominate the booming tablet market this year, the long wait has just begun.
132;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-06T08:45:32Z;Microsoft links with Arm in tablets move;;Shares in Arm Holdings rose as 13 per cent in early London trading on Thursday after Microsoft announced overnight that the UK-based group’s chip designs would feature in a new version of the Windows operating system.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, revealed that Microsoft would be rolling out a new class of lower-powered chips based on Arm designs and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments as part of efforts to widen Windows beyond basic personal computers to portable devices.The announcement was made ahead of the official start of the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the industry’s flagship annual event.Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies, said that the market had long anticipated that Arm-based chips would feature in Windows 8 and had priced that into the stock. However, he said the official announcement was likely to keep feeding into the share price. A move into PC chips will enable Arm to command higher fees for each chip sold, though the market is smaller than for phones.The move is a boost for Arm, whose low-powered chip designs feature in 95 per cent of mobile phones sold around the world and in a range of other products but have made relatively little headway in the higher-power computer chip segment where Intel dominates.Following the announcement by Microsoft on Wednesday, graphics specialist Nvidia also said that it would be developing a new Arm-based core processor for desktops and servers. The move puts Nvidia in direct competition with Intel.Warren East, Arm’s chief executive, has said that the company expects to benefit from an expected leap in demand for tablet computers, which are seen as a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.The success of the iPad has prompted companies including Toshiba, Motorola, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard to rush to bring out their own tablets.Microsoft said Arm-designed chips would not start to be seen in new devices for another two or three years. Arm’s chips currently feature in a version of Windows that runs on the US group’s smartphones.In July, Arm signed a deal with Microsoft to extend and expand on an existing long-running licensing agreement. The deal gave Microsoft access to Arm’s core architecture, rather than licensing one product at a time. Microsoft had until relatively recently relied on Intel to supply most of its chips, though it has been widening its relationships with other chipmakers and designers.Shares in Arm have risen more than 150 per cent over the past year, boosted by speculation of a possible shift into supplying designs for Microsoft and news that Arm’s chip designs featured in iPhone 4 and iPad, Apple’s highly successful tablet computer.The group, which is trading on 44 times 2011 earnings, has also been seen by some as a prospective takeover target.Arm, whose shares were trading at 532½p early on Thursday, makes its money by licensing its chip designs to semiconductor makers and then collecting royalties once the chips go into new products.Mr East continues to insist that buying the company would make little sense to another chipmaker, given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to service lots of customers with its designs, thereby saving them the cost of research and development.

135;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-06T00:21:11Z;Microsoft in Windows tablet move;;Microsoft has broken with two and a half decades of company history with plans to extend its next Windows operating system beyond the realm of traditional PC chips, repositioning itself for the upheaval in personal computing touched off by Apple’s iPad.However, the change in technology strategy, which marks a turning point in the so-called “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has dominated the PC era, will not bear fruit in new devices for “two to three years”, a Microsoft executive said.The world’s biggest software company announced its plans on Wednesday, on the eve of the annual International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which is set to see the unveiling of a slew of touch-screen tablet computers designed to compete with the iPad.Companies including Motorola and Toshiba showed off tablets on Wednesday that will run on a new version of Google’s Android operating system, which is also being revised to make it a stronger competitor to the software underpinning the iPad. While no launch dates or prices were given, executives indicated they planned to put the devices on sale before the end of March.Lenovo and Samsung also showed off hybrid devices with built-in keyboards that can be used either as a tablet or a laptop PC, echoing a design already launched by Dell.Despite the coming spate of rivals, most analysts predict that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet category this year.Microsoft played down the competition with Apple as it demonstrated Windows running on a new class of chips with lower power requirements, making them more suitable for portable devices.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said the new technology direction was intended eventually for a wider family of machines than tablets. The change will put Windows on chips based on a design by the UK’s Arm Holdings and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.Microsoft presented the move as part of a broader strategy that would benefit Intel and AMD, makers of traditional PC chips.The next version of Windows will run on so-called “system on a chip” hardware – integrated pieces of silicon that combine processor, memory, graphics and other functions that previously required larger circuit boards.A version of Windows for smartphones already runs on ARM chips, but Mr Sinofsky continued to resist calls for Microsoft to use this to mount an earlier challenge to the iPad.
136;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2011-01-03T19:41:09Z;Tablets set to steal the show at CES;;Tablets galore, a fightback from notebook PCs and new takes on television are expected to be among the highlights of the world’s biggest Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, is expected to unveil its latest take on slates (or tablets) when he delivers an annual eve-of-show address on Wednesday.He will be sandwiched by announcements and demonstrations of tablets running rival Android, webOS and QNX operating systems, from the likes of Toshiba, HP and Research in Motion.Toshiba unveiled its first tablet for the US on Monday – it has a 10.1-inch high-resolution screen, front and rear cameras and greater connectivity than the Apple iPad, with USB ports and an SD memory card slot included. But, like many tablet makers, it is waiting for Google to release its next version of Android, code-named Honeycomb, which has been specially designed to accommodate tablets, in the first half of 2011. Apple is expected to update the iPad in the meantime.Rivals to the iPad have been handicapped by the lack of a mature operating system and HP has delayed its big splash on tablets while it readies ones based on the webOS operating system from last year’s acquisition of Palm. They should be on display this week, along with the BlackBerry Playbook from RIM.“This is going to be the year of the superphone and the Android tablets,” says Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive of graphics chipmaker Nvidia, referring to high-powered smartphones also on the way.In televisions, manufacturers have also been waiting for Google, with its Android-based Google TV web interface still in need of work. While Sony has launched Google TV televisions, Toshiba has dropped plans to show Google TV-based sets at CES, saying the software is not ready enough.Vizio, a leading LCD TV maker in the US, will show internet-connected TVs based on Android, but with Vizio’s own interface running on top. It is also breaking out into tablets and phones, showing a slate and a smartphone running the same interface.Vizio says it is standardising on simpler “Theater 3D” polarised 3D glasses, which a number of eyewear makers will be displaying at the show. “They use the same standard as the movie theatres, they’re much more comfortable for consumers, they don’t have to be charged and they don’t cost $150 a piece,” says Matthew McRae, Vizio chief technology officer.3D without the need for glasses will be shown on smaller screens such as those of cellphones, games consoles and on a Toshiba notebook PC.The traditional PC industry, led by Intel – which is launching new chips code-named Sandy Bridge that integrate graphics processing – will be pointing out the extra performance of notebooks over tablets.
137;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-12-29T20:26:24Z;US consultant charged with insider trading;;Federal prosecutors charged a California consultant at an “expert network” firm with allegedly passing inside information about two technology groups to hedge fund traders.Prosecutors allege that Winifred Jiau of Fremont, California, provided non-public information about Marvell Technology Group and Nvidia ahead of earnings announcements to hedge funds in exchange for $200,000 in fees she was paid by an expert network firm.The charges are the latest by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan in an expanding insider trading investigation of public companies’ employees passing information to hedge funds through expert network companies that connect them.According to court papers, Ms Jiau’s tips about Marvell’s financial results for the quarter ending in May 2008 were used by two unnamed hedge fund traders to make more than $820,000 in profits.Ms Jiau relayed information to the hedge fund traders from sources within Marvell, the complaint says.The government’s case was aided by a research analyst at a New York hedge fund who is co-operating with the investigation as well as digitally recorded phone conversations the principal trader at the same hedge fund had with Ms Jiau.The recordings were turned over to the authorities when they executed a search warrant last month.In another call, Ms Jiau gave the two traders Nvidia’s revenue number for the second quarter of 2008 and said the company would announce a stock buy-back on August 15, the complaint says. Ms Jiau said her contact was a “sales guy”.Four days later, Nvidia announced earnings that matched the revenue number Ms Jiau allegedly provided, as well as a $1bn increase to its stock repurchase programme.A spokesman for Nvidia said Ms Jiau was a contractor for the firm and left a year ago.Marvell did not respond to a request for a comment.
138;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-12-16T19:42:05Z;Lack of content leaves 3D TV sales flat;;Big-screen 3D TVs are not the hottest items this holiday season.Best Buy, the biggest electronics retailer in the US, reported this week that slow sales of 3D TVs had contributed to disappointing quarterly results.“We do not agree …that 3D TV and [internet-connected TVs] are the next great things,” said analysts at Wedbush Morgan Securities, citing a lack of 3D content for TVs.“We remain pessimistic that 3D TV will be widely adopted by any but the most hardcore gamers.”The obstacles facing 3D adoption include weak western economies and consumers opting for other consumer electronics items, such as tablets and smartphones.Many are put off by the price and the inconvenience of glasses needed to enjoy the experience. Only about 4m 3D TVs are expected to have shipped worldwide this year – about 3 per cent of global HDTV sales.In 2011, analysts are expecting success for the Nintendo 3DS, a handheld game console that will not require special glasses to play 3D titles and movies on its 3.5-inch screen.The smaller screen size and a single viewer sitting a short distance from it at a relatively fixed angle makes it easier for the format to be served without eyewear.This means some laptops, tablets and mobile phones will be equipped with 3D-capable screens next year that will not need glasses.Apple could once again lead the trend – it was granted a patent this month on a 3D projection system that accommodates multiple viewers without glasses.Sony and Samsung hope their TVs will encourage sales of other devices – Sony’s PlayStation 3 console, Blu-ray 3D players and 3D camcorders and digital cameras, where consumers will want to hook up and display their 3D-recorded content on a bigger screen.More content should also help TV sales in 2011, with some major broadcasters adding 3D channels and Hollywood planning to release more than 50 movies in the format next year.Aside from a wide choice of TVs from Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, Mitsubishi and a number of other TV makers, 3D is also featuring in other devices.Sharp is launching an Android smartphone with a 3D-capable display in Japan this month. Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, has enabled 3D viewing and gaming on PC monitors and laptops with its chipsets and special glasses.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent lower at 2,518.21 and fell 2.1 per cent over the week.Energy and materials stocks led the fallers as commodity prices dropped. Range Resources lost 3.1 per cent to $42.07, Newmont Mining declined 2.3 per cent to $61.55 and CF Industries fell 6.3 per cent to $119.65.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were lower, with six down more than 1 per cent.But the semiconductor index was a fraction higher after an increase in Intel’s dividend and better results from Nvidia than expected.Intel shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $21.53 after it raised its dividend by 15 per cent to 18 cents per share.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said the company’s strong cash flow and its confidence in the future meant it could return more money to shareholders.Nvidia, which makes chips for computer graphics cards, rose 5.2 per cent to $13.26 after it reported its quarterly earnings. The chipmaker forecast higher sales for the current quarter and said its mobile business will grow significantly in the next year, when tablets and smartphones will use its Tegra chips.“Our Tegra business should be quite large – it’ll be one of our largest businesses over time,” said Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive, who added that it would also increase the company’s gross margins.But the wider technology index continued to fall, down 1.4 per cent.Technology stocks suffered on Thursday after Cisco issued a downbeat outlook, saying that a decline in government spending, especially in US states and in Europe, was hitting sales.Walt Disney shares bounced back after falling when the company accidentally released its quarterly results late in Thursday’s session rather than after the closing bell.The earnings disappointed some investors as income from pay-TV services for ESPN, which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year.But Disney was optimistic, forecasting rising advertising sales, pricing and theme park attendance, which sent shares up 5.1 per cent to $37.75.“While the fourth quarter of 2010 was hard to dissect at best and messy at worst . . . forward trends are robust,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who slightly raised their price target for the company.In retail, JC Penney fell 3.4 per cent to $31.13 after it beat expectations with its quarterly profit, but sales were hit by discounting and the chain’s decision to wind down its “Big Book” catalogue business.In contrast, shares in smaller rival Dillards jumped 9.7 per cent to $30.82 after it reported same-store sales rose 1 per cent in its third quarter.Elsewhere in the consumer discretionary sector, DR Horton, the housebuilder, reported a narrower quarterly loss than expected but said demand was soft after the homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $11.51."
140;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-10-28T16:07:12Z;World’s fastest supercomputer in China;;China has ousted the US as the maker of the world’s fastest supercomputer, signalling the country’s increasingly vigorous push to develop advanced technology.The new system, known as Tianhe-1A, was developed by the National University of Defense Technology and unveiled at a supercomputing conference in Beijing on Thursday.With a speed of 2.5 petaflops – meaning the system can make 1,000 trillion calculations per second – the Tianhe-1A is faster than the Jaguar, a system at a national laboratory at the University of Tennessee which topped the last global ranking published in June. The machine belongs to Dawning Information Industry, a company backed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at the National Center for Supercomputing in the northern port city of Tianjin.Nvidia, the California-based graphics chip design company whose chips are used in the new machine, confirmed that it is “the fastest system in China and in the world today”.Zhang Yunquan of the Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who compiles China’s top 100 supercomputer list, said he expected Tianhe-1A to top the next global supercomputer ranking which is due to come out next month.“Having the fastest supercomputer will give us a feeling of pride, it will be like winning gold medals at the Olympics, it will excite people,” he said.The fact that supercomputers are crucial for everything from national security-related sectors such as telecoms and defence operations to product design could raise concerns in the West about China’s growing capabilities.China’s jump to the top in the supercomputer field underscores Beijing’s clout in attracting world-class research and development operations.While the country’s own companies and research institutions still lag behind tech powers such as the US, Japan or Europe in self-developed innovations, it has been relatively successful in pushing multinationals into building sizeable research operations in China.Different from some other countries in the supercomputer race, core components or the Tianhe-1A are made by foreign companies: it uses Nvidia and Intel chips, while a supercomputer which is in the works by Japan’s Fujitsu relies on Japanese technology only.However, experts at HPC China, a supercomputing conference in Beijing, said on Thursday that key intellectual property rights in the new Chinese system were developed and held domestically.“This shows that our system integration and research and manufacturing capabilities have reached world standards,” said Mr Zhang. He said the next step would be to strengthen China’s capabilities in software, where the country still relied too heavily on foreign technology.Some chip technology experts said the top spot for Tianhe could be a one-off as Japan unseated the US before in the rankings in 2002. However, the new system is part of a broad, sustained effort, illustrated by the fact that China placed 24 such machines in the last global top 500 supercomputer ranking in June.Xinhua, the official news agency, said the Tianjin Meteorological Bureau and the National Offshore Oil Corporation had both started trials with the new computer, and it could also be used for the animation industry and biomedical research.
141;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-10-24T16:41:33Z;Jobs unlikely to overstretch Apple cash;;Apple chief executive Steve Jobs’s declaration last week that the technology company wants to hold on to its $51bn in cash and securities because it sees “strategic opportunities” ahead, has provoked speculation about what it might acquire.With one of the largest cash hoards in the world and a business that spans hardware, software and content distribution, the possibilities are wide.Among the most fanciful ideas being batted around by outsiders are takeovers of Facebook, the social network valued in private share sales at more than $30bn, and perhaps Disney, the media group worth $67bn, including a large stake held by Mr Jobs.But either would break Apple’s long-running pattern of investments – it has never paid more than $500m for a target – which risks straying into unfamiliar arenas. Former executives and bankers said they would be shocked if the maker of the iPhone, iPad tablet and Mac computer did anything as far-reaching.“I don’t think they will buy anything big any time soon. It is just not in their genes,” said a former Apple strategist.Instead, ex-employees and analysts noted that Apple has historically bought smaller companies with intellectual property and strong talent in areas of growing importance for the company. Modest deals in the past have resulted in the iPod – which grew out of contracts with software engineer Tony Fadell and outside design firm PortalPlayer – as well as the software behind the popular GarageBand music composition and Final Cut video editing programmes, which appear on its computers.A key emphasis for Apple now is the company’s push into internet-connected television, with its Apple TV streaming media player, relaunched in September. It is a complex, technology-intensive battleground, where Apple faces already established cable operators and well-heeled Silicon Valley competitors, such as Google.Apple last month licensed know-how in the sector from Rovi, a company that propelled the technology provider to a record $5bn market capitalisation. Apple could easily buy the company, or one of its competitors, outright.Other logical extensions of Apple’s clout would be in chip design or manufacturing, where the company has bought in the past, and desktop software and internet services, including advertising and content streaming.With a $14bn market capitalisation, Adobe Systems could be one of the largest software targets to tempt Apple, in part, for defensive reasons. In the smartphone sector, Apple is in a major fight for superiority with devices running on Google’s dominant Android operating system. A key advantage of the latter is they have the ability to display videos based on Adobe’s Flash technology.Mr Jobs has complained that Flash is “buggy” and consumes too much battery life, but he may still want to take charge of the company, improve the software, and optimise it for Apple devices.Adobe also has an enviable presence on Microsoft desktops with its free Reader document display program. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, recently discussed with Adobe possibilities for the companies to work more closely and even mentioned a possible offer, which no doubt prompted Apple to consider contingency plans.More plausible would be a deal to strengthen Apple’s shift toward streaming content for use on all its devices, rather than making consumers download shows or music for use on a particular device.For that purpose, Apple could benefit from a content delivery network with significant infrastructure, such as Akamai, which stores copies of website data at locations around the world to get the material to users faster. Akamai is worth $8.5bn, but it has smaller competitors.Apple has also sought more control over the hardware in its devices, allowing it to differentiate its products, control features and maintain secrecy. It bought Silicon Valley chip start-up PA Semi in 2008 for $278m, which helped it develop the A4 microprocessor used in the iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod Touch.That was based on a chip design by the UK’s Arm Holdings, prompting speculation that Apple could buy that company. It seems unlikely given Arm’s open business model of licensing designs to most of the world’s chipmakers.Private investors and analysts said Nvidia, the $6.4bn market cap Silicon Valley graphics chipmaker, is a more likely target.But there is a chance Apple will do nothing. Mr Jobs has often hinted at future purchases without a major move. Given Apple’s near-death in the 1990s, Mr Jobs “likes having a huge cash cushion”, a former executive said.
142;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-10-14T17:13:13Z;Intel ready to close the gap on rivals;;Intel issued a clear warning this week that it intends to be a leading player in tablets, a category where its microprocessors have so far failed to figure.The world’s biggest chipmaker has so far been happy to defend its dominant position in netbooks with its Atom processor, while biding time for the tablet market to mature.But weakness in netbooks in the third quarter and fears that sales could be cannibalised by tablets has brought Paul Otellini, chief executive, off the fence.In pointed remarks during Tuesday’s analyst conference call covering Intel’s quarterly earnings, Mr Otellini said he wanted to respond to “the big question on everybody’s minds” of how Intel would respond to its lack of a presence in tablets. He congratulated Apple on inventing the category and predicted tablets would expand the computer market just as netbooks had done.This fitted with his forecasts earlier this year that tablets would be “additive” rather than taking away from other PC sales, but this time he went on to admit that tablets could impact some PC sales.“At the margin, they probably will. Consumers will have a limited amount of discretionary income and some will choose to purchase a tablet instead of upgrading an existing PC or purchasing a netbook in any given period,” he said.But in the long run, tablets would help grow the overall PC market, he insisted. “At Intel, we are going to utilise all of the assets that are at our disposal to win this segment,” he said, adding that Intel was working with partners on tablets running Windows, Android and its own MeeGo operating system.However, Intel is unlikely to dominate in tablets in the same way it has taken over the netbook category.AMD, its closest rival, is launching its Ontario platform, a low-power chip competitor to Atom, next year. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia also competes here with its Tegra processor.Both could win customers manufacturing 10-inch tablets, which could run Windows and serve as netbook replacements. Tablets, with screens of about seven inches, are seen more as enlarged smartphones. Makers may favour Arm-based chips from established smartphone suppliers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.This category of chipmakers are moving into e-readers and tablets after the failure of the smartbook category, which attempted to combine a netbook’s features with the long battery life, connectivity and always-on state of a smartphone.

Employment fell by 39,000 after a revised gain of 10,000 in August.On average, economists had forecast a rise of 20,000 although there had been a broad range of estimates.The report is watched by some investors as an indicator of what the government’s non-farm payrolls report could show on Friday. Economists had forecast a rise of 75,000 in private payrolls for Friday’s report. “[The figures] reinforce yet again that the recovery is not at this stage where it will be adding private-sector jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.But she said that the direction of the market could quickly change during the session as traders were watching the direction of the dollar, and considering the potential for another round of quantitative easing. She added that the Federal Reserve had made it clear that easing was dependent on the employment picture.Technology shares led the fallers, dragging the Nasdaq down, after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded semiconductors to “underweight” because of fears of a slowdown in demand in Asia.The S&P 500 technology index lost 0.6 per cent with the semiconductor index declining 1.6 per cent. Rubicon sunk 6.9 per cent to $19.51 and graphics chipmaker Nvidia dropped 4.8 per cent to $10.78.Cloud computing companies also suffered.

AT&T, which had been the only telecoms company to offer the iPhone, fell 1.1 per cent to $28.62.Apple, which had been falling, pared its losses to finish up 0.1 per cent at $289.19.In deals news, General Electric agreed a $3bn deal to buy Dresser, which makes gas engines used in oil and natural gas production equipment, as part of an expansion of its energy business. Dresser is majority owned by funds managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC and First Reserve Corp. GE said the acquisition should contribute to its earnings next year.Shares in General Electric rose 2.4 per cent to $16.90. helping push the Dow up.Motorola fell 0.9 per cent to $8.56 after the communications equipment maker said it may spin off its mobile phone business early next year.In financials, M&T Bank sunk 5 per cent to $78.91 after Allied Irish Banks said it would start to sell its 22.4 per cent stake in the US lender. The stake, valued at $2.2bn, will be sold in a US public offering to help fund the troubled Irish bank. US-listed shares in Allied Irish Banks fell 4.5 per cent to $1.28. Earnings news started to dribble out before the official start of the reporting season on Thursday.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, reported a wider than expected loss and forecast weak results for next year. But the shares, down 39.7 per cent this year, rose 0.3 per cent to $48.65.The owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains reported third-quarter results that were in line with analyst expectations.Yum!

Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $65.41 after it just missed top-line expectations.
144;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-08-29T16:13:31Z;Silicon Valley to have big say on smart TVs;;Silicon Valley is set to influence the future of television in the same way it has come to shape smartphones.As phones grew more sophisticated and added computer-like capabilities, the industry strayed into the area of expertise of Valley companies. Thus Apple developed the iPhone, Palm introduced the Pre and Google has rolled out its highly successful Android operating system.Televisions and set-top boxes are now adding similar features – powerful processors, fast video chips and more sophisticated operating systems and interfaces.The actual silicon content of TVs has grown dramatically since the switch from analogue TVs with cathode ray tubes to flat LCD panels serving digital content.Many are now backlit by LEDs, lighting which is made of and driven by silicon chips.The iSuppli research firm sees internet-enabled televisions giving a major boost to silicon chipmakers, with networking semiconductors, TV systems on a chip (SoCs) and more memory needed.It predicts a compound annual growth rate for video decoding chips, DRAM memory chips and Wi-Fi integrated circuits in internet TVs of more than 55 per cent, creating a $2bn market by 2014.The central and graphics processors (CPUs and GPUs) of Valley companies Intel and Nvidia are likely to be used extensively to deliver video and web services.Intel said at its analyst meeting in May that it was struggling to cope with demand for its latest Atom chip. It was faced with an order backlog of more than 1m units, and customers including France Telecom and Telecom Italia waiting to put the chip in their set-top boxes.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said then that the biggest revolution since television went from black and white to colour was about to take place. Eric Kim, who was then head of its Digital Home group added: “We’re seeing the beginning of explosive growth…right now, we’re gearing up for a massive retail launch of [connected devices] this year.”Intel is aiming its chips at the 300m TVs, 200m set-top boxes and 100m Blu-ray players it expects to be sold a year by 2014.However, technology companies have failed to make an impression on the TV market in the past – Intel’s own Viiv platform for media PCs in the digital living room, introduced in 2006, never made an impact.“Before Viiv there was [Microsoft’s] Web TV, tech companies have all tried to develop ways to distract us from our TVs with multiple applications like e-mail and none of them have really worked out, so I do wonder,” says Kurt Scherf, principal analyst at research firm Parks Associates.Intel began to address the TV market seriously two years ago with its Atom 3100 processor and a partnership with Yahoo, which introduced internet widgets to the TV screen offering weather forecasts, stock quotes and social networking updates.Now, with its more powerful 4100 processor it has switched its focus to Google TV as providing an operating-system platform to drive widespread adoption of internet TV.“Multiple manufacturers can adopt it and the requirements of supporting one-off designs reduces significantly for us,” says Wilfred Martis, general manager of retail consumer electronics at Intel.“Manufacturers can add their own user experience on top of Google TV if they want, just like what’s happening in smartphones with Android.While Intel sees internet TV as a significant new growth market for its chips, Google is eyeing it for its advertising potential as it brings search to the TV set through its Android operating system and Chrome browser.At the launch of Google TV, Rishi Chandra, a senior product manager, cited the key metrics for the internet company – Americans spend five hours a day on average in front of the TV, $70bn a year are spent on TV advertising in the US alone, while worldwide there are 4bn TV users.Those are big numbers even for a company built on big numbers. The statistics were presented as an opportunity for its developer community, but the earnings potential for Google and the threat to the traditional advertising industry are clear.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,173.48, down 5 per cent over the five days.Fears about the pace of the economic recovery dominated markets this week after the Federal Reserve downgraded its outlook for the economy.Weak Chinese economic data weighed on the industrials, materials and energy sectors. Data showed on Friday that US retail sales rose less than expected in July,
up 0.4 per cent compared with a forecast increase of 0.5 per cent.Excluding cars and petrol, purchases fell 0.1 per cent, showing that underlying consumer confidence remained shaky.Separate data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent and by 0.1 per cent excluding food and energy.Lawrence Creatura, vice- president and portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said July was not a significant month in the retail calendar and investors would be focusing on the back-to-school season as well as retailers reporting earnings next week for indicators of consumer confidence.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose slightly more than expected in August but investors were un-moved by the data. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector declined 1.1 per cent, with the S&P 500 retailers down 1.4 per cent.JC Penney, the department store chain, warned of an “uncertain” outlook for consumer spending and lowered its profit forecast for the year. It projected a profit of $1.50 a share compared with a previous forecast of about $1.64.In the last quarter, revenue met analyst expectations and net income rose to $14m compared with a loss of $1m for the same period last year. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $19.82.Nordstrom dropped 7.2 per cent to $31.05 after it maintained its full-year forecast and said its expenses rose. The chain reported earnings in line with analyst expectations.In other earnings news, Nvidia rose 4.8 per cent to $9.39 in spite of a widening in its quarterly loss.The chipmaker said profit margins would rise in the third quarter because of a new range of products. It was reported that the company was working on a microprocessor for tablet devices that would compete with Intel products. Intel fell 1.5 per cent to $19.15.DeVry, the operator of for-profit further education colleges, enrolled more students, revenue rose and earnings for the fourth quarter almost doubled to a better-than-expected 99 cents per share.But it fell 5.7 per cent to $42.71 ahead of a Department of Education report on its proposed requirements for student loan eligibility.In deal news, Blackstone Group agreed to acquire the Texas power producer Dynegy for $4.50 a share, a 62 per cent premium on Thursday’s closing price.After Blackstone assumes Dynegy’s debt, the acquisition’s value will total about $4.7bn.Blackstone will sell four natural gas-fired assets, owned by Dynegy, to NRG Energy for about $1.36bn in cash. Dynegy surged 59 per cent to $4.42, Blackstone fell 3.5 per cent to $10.63 and NRG Energy was down 2 per cent to $21.96.Vaccine biotechnology company Emergent Bio-Solutions said it had agreed to buy Trubion Pharmaceuticals for up to $135.5m in cash and shares as it tried to expand its product pipeline into oncology and autoimmune diseases.Emergent Biosolutions fell 5.8 per cent to $17.43 while Trubion Pharmaceuticals soared 50 per cent to $4.50."

Claims dropped by 11,000 for the week ending July 24 to a seasonally adjusted 457,000. Analysts had forecast the number of claims falling to 459,000.John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, said that it would take three more weeks of data to get a clear picture without the impact of summer factory shutdowns. He added that claims remained above the level that was consistent with sustained job creation.Comments by James Bullard Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President warning of the danger of deflation failed to move the market but confidence was shaky ahead of on Friday’s GDP announcement.Colgate-Palmolive and Kelloggs weighed on the S&P 500 Consumer Staples sector which fell 1.1 per cent. Shares in Colgate-Palmolive fell 6.8 per cent to $78.12. The company reported weaker-than-expected sales rising 2 per cent to $3.81bn, below analyst forecasts of $3.94bn.It also warned that currency devaluation in Venezuela would hit its full-year figures harder than previously anticipated. But it posted a better-than-
expected quarterly profit.The cost of recalling about 28m boxes of cereals last month weighed on Kelloggs’ quarterly results. Net income dropped 15 per cent to 79 cents per share compared with average forecasts of 94 cents per share. The company also cut its full-year forecast.

147;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-07-20T21:49:43Z;Intel nears settlement in market abuse probe;;"Intel seems close to putting behind it a decade of market abuse complaints from round the world in a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission this week.The deal will include concessions on the US chipmaker’s business practices, according to a person familiar with the settlement, but will not include fines because the FTC does not have the authority to issue civil penalties.A resolution with the FTC would complete investigations by the national regulatory authorities in the US, Europe, Japan and South Korea into complaints that the world’s biggest chipmaker has abused its market dominance.The FTC inquiry has been more wide-ranging than those of its predecessors. The processor technology that drives the world’s computers has changed significantly since Intel’s rival Advanced Micro Devices first filed a complaint to the European Commission in 2000.The central processing units (CPUs) made by Intel and AMD under Intel’s “x86” designs are now rivalled in importance by graphics processing units (GPUs) as PCs are used for more multimedia tasks.The FTC had alleged in a case launched last December that Intel used “threats and rewards” aimed at PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM to coerce them not to buy AMD CPUs.It also alleged Intel secretly redesigned key software to stunt the performance of rivals’ chips that were licensing its “x86” microprocessor design.But, in addition, the FTC alleged that Intel was repeating in GPUs its tactic of slowing down competitors, such as graphics chipmaker Nvidia, so that it could catch up.“There also is a dangerous probability that Intel’s unfair methods of competition could allow it to extend its monopoly into the GPU chip markets,” the FTC said.Intel at the time responded to the FTC allegations saying the FTC case was misguided and based on claims it had not fully investigated.Intel, which has a more than 80 per cent global market share in computer microprocessors, is expected to accept curbs to its marketing of its chips, according to the person familiar with the FTC settlement.The FTC declined to comment on reports of a settlement and Intel said talks were continuing and it had nothing to add at this point. Nvidia also declined to comment.David Balto, a former antitrust attorney at the FTC, has warned that the commission needs to pay special attention to GPUs in its remedy if it is concerned about future competition.“For a GPU remedy to work, you need at least three elements – a licence to the x86 [design], a clear agreement about interoperability between the GPU and CPU, and finally a strong enforcement mechanism – with clear standards and a timetable for prompt resolution of disputes,” he said.While the FTC had taken Intel to court, both parties asked for a one-month suspension of proceedings in June to try to work out an out-of-court settlement that would lead to a consent order being agreed. The suspension ends on Thursday but, while it can be extended, a deal is expected to be announced by the end of the week.A similar case brought by the New York attorney-general last year is still outstanding and Intel is appealing against a record €1.06bn ($1.44bn then) fine imposed by the European Commission in May 2009.The South Korean FTC fined Intel about $26m in 2008 and Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ruled in 2005 that it had abused its monopoly power and the company accepted a “cease and desist” order. Intel paid AMD $1.25bn last December in settlement of a civil action its rival brought over the same issues.AMD said a new five-year cross-licensing agreement with Intel would allow it to
compete on a level playing field."
148;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-07-08T14:33:48Z;Wall Street gains on positive data;;US stocks held on to the previous day’s gains on Thursday as a positive jobs report and decent retail sales data helped ease worries about a potential double-dip recession.Jobless claims were 454,000 last week, modestly better than the 460,000 expected. However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22. The leading tax preparer said Russell P. Smyth resigned as chief executive. Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
149;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Imagination more than trebles profits;;Imagination Technologies, the graphics chip designer, more than trebled full-year pre-tax profits thanks to strong demand for its technology in products such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad.The company said it was seeing demand from makers of netbooks, tablets and set-top boxes, which need graphics chips for their increasingly sophisticated multimedia displays.Pre-tax profits rose to £10.2m in the year to the end of April, from £2.7m last time.Earnings per share increased from 3.7p to 6p.Hossein Yassaie, chief executive, said the company was on track for 200m devices using its semiconductor designs to be shipped this year.Some 500m devices a year could be shipping within a few years, as smartphones come to dominate the handset market. Imagination earns about 30 cents of royalty per chip.Revenue rose 26 per cent to £80.9m. However, the numbers just missed market expectations, heightened by the recent successful launch of the iPad.Earlier this week Apple revealed that more than 3m iPads had been sold, less than three months after launch.Shares in Imagination, which have nearly trebled in value over the past year, slipped 5p to close at 295p.Imagination provides designs to chip companies such as Intel, Samsung and Texas Instruments, which in turn supply makers of consumer electronics devices.Intel and Apple both have significant shareholdings in the business and Imagination shares have been driven up 30 per cent in the past quarter on rumours of a takeover bid by Apple.Analysts, however, said such a deal was unlikely.“For the share price momentum to be sustained, Imagination needed to deliver significant upgrades.“It is therefore disappointing to note that Imagination has stuck to its original 200m royalty unit shipment guidance …in spite of the media frenzy around the unit shipments of its key customer’s latest products [Apple iPad and iPhone 4],” said Arun George, analyst at Execution Noble.Analysts are also wary of the increasing competition Imagination faces.That is coming from companies such as Nvidia, the graphics specialist, and Arm Holdings, which has a strong relationship with mobile phone chipmakers, and offers a rival graphic processor design.
150;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-06-08T20:59:35Z;US stocks gain after choppy session;;The bulls staged a moderate rally late in the session on Tuesday but the main indices remained near their closing lows for the year so far.Comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, after markets closed on Monday that the US recovery was proceeding, though at a “moderate” pace, provided some comfort to investors.Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, said he expected trading to remain choppy in the near term and stay within the current trading ranges.“Two factors that could lead to a bounce-back are Libor rates coming down, indicating that banks are trusting each other more, and any sort of practical unity [of action] by European leaders,” Mr Shea said. “Currently we are seeing a lot of talking and not a lot of walking.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent to 1,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 9,939.98 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,170.57.Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 3.8 per cent to $56.94 as the deepwater oil driller was downgraded to “sell” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs and “underperform” from “market perform” at FBR Capital Markets.US-listed shares in BP fell 5.7 per cent to $34.68. The commander of the US spill-response team said it was not known how much crude continued to leak from the company’s Gulf of Mexico well. BP faces pressure by US lawmakers to reduce its dividend payment.Caterpillar rallied 1.4 per cent to $56.61 after the construction equipment company affirmed its long-term profit target. It said it expected to earn $8 to $10 per share during 2012.Talbots, an apparel retailer, lost 9.5 per cent to $12.20 in spite of reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profit. It forecast full-year earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Dollar General gained 2.1 per cent to $29.83 after the discount retailer reported its first-quarter results and raised its profit forecast for the full year. It expects to earn as much as $1.69 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share.Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s pushed 2.4 per cent higher to $68.38 as it reported better-than-expected May sales. Established restaurant sales were up 4.8 per cent globally.But the company said a weak euro was expected to lower full-year profit. About 41 per cent of McDonald’s revenues were recorded in Europe last year.Rival Burger King said on Monday it was also expecting unfavourable currency conversion effects to hurt its full-year results. The chain was up 0.8 per cent to $18.37 on Tuesday.Materials stocks were some of the session’s best performers as the price of gold and copper rose.Southern Copper added 6.3 per cent to $27.89, Newmont Mining climbed 2.3 per cent to $56.45 and Alcoa rallied 2.4 per cent to $10.76.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was 4.8 per cent higher at $61.48. The metals producer was upgraded to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC, but the broker reduced its 12-month target price to $80 from $85.“We believe that FCX’s cash flows should benefit from US dollar strength, especially at its operations in Indonesia and South America,” the broker said.Intel, a maker of semiconductors, was down 0.6 per cent to $20.18 and Nvidia, which makes visual computing technologies, fell 2.8 per cent to $11.18.Internet-based stocks were also lower, weighed down by several downgrades at Bank of America.Amazon fell 2.6 per cent to $118.84 as the broker lowered its target price to $150 from $155 and Google declined 0.2 per cent to $484.78 as its target price was cut to $630 from $685. Netflix, an online film rental company, bucked the trend to rise 1.1 per cent to $110.33 as its target price was increased to $130 from $120 at Caris.JPMorgan Chase rose 2.9 per cent to $37.78 on reports it is selling about $716m of bonds tied to commercial properties on less favourable terms than when the debt was issued.Bank of America was up 3.4 per cent to $15.33, Citigroup added 2.2 per cent to $3.72, and Morgan Stanley advanced 1.2 per cent to $25.59.
151;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-05-31T19:52:08Z;Large claims for tablets are a little hard to swallow;;"Computex, the world’s second-biggest IT trade fair, does not officially start until Tuesday, but already the hype is in full swing about which tablet personal computer will challenge the iPad as the hottest product of the year.The chief executive of Nvidia, the specialist graphics card company that is also a big supplier of chips for tablet PCs, kicked things off by making the prediction that within five years “tablets will be the world’s biggest computing category”. Jen-hsun Huang said tablets could even surpass netbooks and notebook PCs in terms of volume.This is a bold claim, given that Gartner, the technology research group, expects only 12m tablet-like devices to be sold this year and even the most optimistic projections say that tablets would only take up 50m-60m of the 700m PC units sold by 2014.Mr Huang says, however, that three key factors missing in the past are now coming together to make this possible.For tablets to succeed, the industry needed effective touchscreen display, a mobile processor (such as Nvidia’s Arm-based Tegra processors, Mr Huang would say), and a suitable operating system.While the first two have arguably been present for a while, it was not until recently that Google’s Android emerged as a potent challenger.“We finally have an operating system to unite behind …now we need to raise the bar on what tablets are capable of,” Mr Huang says.Solar loses its shineWith BP still struggling to plug its broken deep-water well in the Gulf of Mexico and end what looks like the worst oil spill in US history, these should be sunny days indeed for investors in the relatively clean business of renewable energy.Even solar power, the midget among renewables in terms of its current output, is credited with a bright future. The International Energy Agency said this month that solar plants could be producing 22 per cent of global electricity needs by 2050.Unfortunately, as European investors are now being reminded, solar power in particular depends heavily on subsidies. And the arrival of a new age of austerity to rescue the public finances of eurozone member states means some governments are regretting their earlier generosity.Nowhere is this more obvious than in Spain. The problem is not just that the embattled Spanish government will reduce subsidies for new projects; the industry regards cuts as inevitable, even sensible, given that subsidies are delivered via the wholesale prices paid to producers and will have to be repaid eventually through higher prices for consumers. More serious is the fear that the government will cut previously agreed subsidies for projects already built or under construction.Uncertainty over possible retroactive subsidy cuts has cast a long shadow over the sun-drenched Spanish landscape, and Miguel Sebastián, industry minister, has so far done little to allay the doubts.Two initial public offerings in renewable energy have been recently postponed, at least in part over the uncertain future of Spanish price support. Abengoa, the energy and engineering group, expects its profits to be affected at least temporarily by changes to the subsidy regime. FCC, the infrastructure and services group, has just announced a freeze on €600m ($737m) of investments in two thermo-solar plants.Unfortunately for the industry, solar power subsidies are an easy target in times of crisis.It does not help the industry’s case that profit margins on some new plants have soared as a result of the falling cost of solar panels, that they stand to make outsize profits for the best part of 20 years, and that the technology thus subsidised is often out of date even before it is installed.Nor is it any help that the National Energy Commission has been investigating solar plants reportedly producing power at night; investigators say what happened was that wind producers registered as solar generators to claim the higher subsidies available.Still, Spain should avoid throwing out the renewable energy baby with the dirty bath water.Thermosolar energy is regarded as being a more competitive source of bulk electricity than arrays of photovoltaic cells. And the promotion of wind energy, despite the occasional abuses, has been a big success, reducing Spain’s energy import bill, cutting its carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging the growth of internationally competitive energy companies.Supporting renewable energy through subsidies is not necessarily foolish. But Spain’s experience shows that it needs to be done with more forethought and a better assessment of costs and benefits.world.view@ft.com"
152;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-05-31T12:09:03Z;Tablets to become biggest computing category: Nvidia CEO;;Computex, the world’s second-biggest IT trade fair, does not officially start until Tuesday but already the hype about which tablet personal computer will challenge the iPad as the hottest product of the year is in full swing.The chief executive of Nvidia, the specialist graphics card company that is also a big supplier of chips for tablet PCs, kicked things off by making the prediction that within five years “tablets will be the world’s biggest computing category”.

It’s also a jab at Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive who earlier said tablets would not “eat the notebooks’ and netbooks’ lunch“.Mr Huang says, however, that three key factors missing in the past are now coming together to make this possible.For tablets to succeed, the industry needed effective touchscreen displays, a mobile processor (such as Nvidia’s Arm-based Tegra processors, Mr Huang would say), and a suitable operating system.While the first two have arguably already been present for a while, it was not until recently that Google’s Android emerged as a potent challenger.“We finally have an operating system to unite behind . . . now we need to raise the bar” on what tablets are capable of, Mr Huang says.As device makers unveil a host of new tablet PC models over the next few days of Computex, consumers and tech investors alike will certainly be looking to see which has really raised the bar on the iPad.
153;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-03-27T02:26:51Z;Nvidia’s Direct route to fastest graphics card;;Incredible detail, natural movement, photo-realism and 3D are the imagery-grabbing headlines from Nvidia for its new flagship PC graphics processor (GPU), unveiled at the PAX East gamers’ show in Boston on Friday.The $500 GeForce GTX 480 may be blazingly fast, but Nvidia itself has been exceedingly slow in releasing the product a full six months after its rival AMD launched its equivalent card – the $400 Radeon HD 5870 – catching last October’s Windows 7 upgrade to the Microsoft operating system.“We really wanted to have our products in the market timed with that,” Drew Henry, general manager of Nvidia’s Desktop GPU business told me, at a demonstration of the new card in San Francisco earlier this week.“This is one of the few times we’ve come into the market pretty late, but we’ve held our market share and in many areas have grown it.”Nvidia needed more time to develop its new “Fermi” architecture, which should run through the full range of its graphics cards by the end of the year.Like AMD, Nvidia is taking advantage of new programming interfaces – DirectX 11 and DirectCompute 11 – in Windows 7 that boost both gaming performance and tasks such as photo editing and video rendering and transcoding.The 480 may cost 25 per cent more than its ATI rival, but Nvidia says it is 27 per cent faster using DirectX 11 than any other GPU.In the demo, I was impressed how tessellation – the density of the tiles that make up images – had been boosted to give extra authenticity and depth to game environments, such as details on cobbles and walls and in waves and water. More powerful ray-tracing produced photo-realistic images of cars [pictured].The video game graphics made possible by the 480 and its 470 sibling, also launching on Friday at around $350, should exceed the quality of those on consoles and satisfy the most demanding gamers.However, this “enthusiast” segment of the market is set to shrink over the next three years, according to a report this week by Jon Peddie Research.It represented 46 per cent of dollars spent in 2009 on PC gaming hardware, but JPR estimates this will shrink to 35 per cent in 2013 as lower-priced “Performance” and “Mainstream” graphics cards gain ground.“PC hardware has caught up to most of the software and people are able to play computationally intensive games on Performance level systems,” said Ted Pollak, JPR video game analyst.Jon Peddie, president of JPR, said that for all levels of hardware “gamers are ordering, building, and modding their rigs with components that just a few years ago were simply not available with any economy of scale.“SSDs [Solid Stae Drives], water cooling, gaming mice and keyboards and other components have come to the Performance class and gamers are starting to snap them up.”
154;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;HP faces raft of complaints in China;;Chinese lawyers have filed a complaint on behalf of more than 170 consumers against Hewlett-Packard, requesting that the Chinese government order a recall of allegedly faulty notebook computers.The move is the first time the world’s largest PC brand has faced organised action from overseas consumers.It is a sign that shoppers in the world’s most populous market are increasingly aware of their consumer rights and more willing to fight for them.The complaint, seen by the Financial Times, was delivered to the General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) on Monday.It requests that the quality watchdog investigate the quality of HP notebooks and order the company to buy back or exchange allegedly faulty machines bought by the plaintiffs and to compensate them for losses. It also calls for AQSIQ to request a recall of the notebooks.Laweach, a not-for-profit website that helped organise laptop users for the case, said Chinese buyers of certain HP laptop computers sold since 2007 had faced malfunctioning screens and overheating problems on a massive scale.The complaint said the problems were due to faulty graphics cards produced by Nvidia, a chipmaker which supplies several PC makers with this component.In July 2008, Nvidia publicly acknowledged quality problems with some graphics cards and announced it was paying PC makers to deal with resulting problems.The complaint said that although HP had offered an extension of warranty periods for some notebook models, that was not a thorough solution to the problem.“We have also noticed that HP in the US offered consumers extended warranty periods for even more models and compensated them for transport costs, but in China, it has not made a statement or offered services, and openly discriminated against Chinese consumers,” the complaint said.Jiang Suhua, a lawyer at Yingke Law Firm in Beijing, said the group was not taking HP to court because the absence of class action in China meant the prospects for such action were dim. He said he hoped AQSIQ would order a recall, and consumers could then negotiate compensation with HP.AQSIQ has increasingly muscled in on consumer rights. So far this year, in the car market alone, the quality watchdog ordered recalls of two Mitsubishi models, two Peugeot models, one Citroën model and one Chrysler model.A decision in the HP case would set a new precedent, however, as Chinese law so far has clear rules only for recalls of cars, food products, drugs and toys.“We hope we can set a precedent and help strengthen the protection of consumer rights in China,” said Mr Jiang.HP said it was not able to comment by the time of going to press. AQSIQ declined to comment.The issue has come to light just as HP announced it would sue MicroJet Technology, a Taiwanese maker of printer ink cartridges, and three other companies, alleging their products infringed its patents.
155;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-03-02T06:56:23Z;Intel, Nvidia, Freescale boost netbooks, eReaders;;"With a never-ending need for better battery life and performance from netbooks and eReaders, there was welcome news this week from chipmakers Intel, Nvidia and Freescale on more efficient processors.Intel released a faster version of its latest “Pine Trail”-codenamed Atom processor, lifting it to a 1.83Ghz clock speed from 1.66Ghz. Nvidia said its new ION separate graphics processor would give a 10x graphics performance improvement over Pine Trail netbooks that just use integrated graphics.Freescale promised faster page turns , higher resolution and longer battery life on eReaders from its new chip.Intel made little fuss about the new Atom version and with good reason,according to Engadget . It said it saw no noticeable improvement in speeds, but held out hope that Intel wouldannounce further Atom improvements at the CeBIT tech show on Tuesday.Nvidia announced its next-generation ION processor at CeBIT. Despite their uneasy relationship as companies, Nvidia has been tying ION to Intel’s Atom processors to boost the performance of netbooks and enable more powerful operating systems.The Silicon Valley company says the new ION will power netbooks that can run Windows 7 Home Premium rather than the Starter edition that comes with more basic machines.ION enables streaming HD video and smooth graphics for PC games. Its Optimus technology chooses between the ION processor and integrated graphics depending on the application, thereby maximising battery life, which it says it is stretching to ten hours.While netbook IONs have eight processor cores, a 16-core version will be used in all-in-one PCs.
The 10-inch screen Acer Aspire One 532G , on sale in April, and 12-inch ASUS 1201PN netbook are expected to be the first new ION netbooks to be introduced. New all-in-one PCs with ION will include the ASUS EeeTop 2010PNT and Lenovo C200.Freescale announced its first processor designed specifically for eReaders, the i.MX508, incorporating ARM’s Cortex-A8 design and the latest E Ink controller.Current eReaders are noticeably slow in their page turns and low in resolution. Freescale said the new chip would run at 800Mhz making it twice as fast as its previous processor adapted for the market.The added power would make flipping through a digital book much faster and enable the chip to cope with larger format eReaders, higher resolutions and colour.Integrating the E Ink display controller will reduce the number of parts and lower costs – Freescale expects $150 devices to be available later this year, down from $200 budget versions now."
156;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-02-02T23:03:45Z;Trader revealed as key Galleon witness;;The identity of the key co-operating witness in the Galleon insider-trading case was disclosed on Tuesday with the unsealing of a plea agreement struck in December between federal prosecutors and David Slaine, a former employee of hedge fund Chelsey Capital.Mr Slaine, 50, is a well-connected Wall Street trader who not only co-operated with the probe of the alleged Galleon insider-trading ring, but wore a secret recording device to capture conversations with at least one defendant in the case, said a person familiar with the matter.According to the court filings disclosed on Tuesday, Mr Slaine pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges that helped generate $3m (£1.88m) in profits for his hedge fund.The specific instances to which he pleaded guilty occurred in 2002, when Mr Slaine received information from two insiders at UBS indicating its research department was about to downgrade its rating of Nvidia, a technology stock.Mr Slaine said he persuaded Chelsey Capital to sell short about 200,000 shares in the stock, while he shorted 75,000 shares. When the research was published, and Nvidia’s shares fell, Chelsey and Slaine reaped profits of $69,000 and $33,000 respectively.Mr Slaine’s role in the Galleon case first emerged in November, with the filing of criminal charges against 14 individuals, including Craig Drimal, a former bouncer who worked in Galleon’s offices but who was not employed there.According to the complaint in that matter, Mr Slaine, identified only as “CS-1”, received a piece of paper from Mr Drimal listing the stock symbols of four companies, all of which would be acquired by other companies.Mr Drimal allegedly told Mr Slaine to destroy the list and to be careful about trading in those securities because it was not publicly known that they would be takeover targets.Mr Drimal was arrested several months ago as part of an expansion of the US government’s case. Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon’s founder, and several others have been accused of passing inside information among hedge funds. Mr Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail..
157;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-01-21T23:26:33Z;Will tablets be swallowed?;;Tablet devices, the small computers with touch screens and no keyboards, have failed to crack the consumer market for the computing industry in the past two decades and face a make-or-break year in 2010.The likelihood of success or further failure should become clearer this month, with many models already unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and Apple expected to launch its version of a tablet computer next week. So far, analysts are divided on whether the category can succeed.Deloitte predicted this week that “tens of millions” of tablet computers would be sold this year. It described them as “the Goldilocks of devices [not too big, not too small]”.The Gartner research firm said it was struggling to find a clear need in the marketplace for “an in-between device that is too big to fit in your pocket and lacking a keyboard”.Shawn DuBravac, research director of the Consumer Electronics Association, positioned “Tablet 2.0” between the IT-centric approach of netbooks and smartbooks, the small-scale notebook PCs, and eReaders, which have focused on content and subscription deals.He saw a battle between competing concepts in the five to 15-inch range of screen sizes. “What can come in and take over is open to question,” he says.At CES, Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, a long time proponent of tablets, showed off three, including the HP “Slate”.However, HP itself did not share further details on the device’s availability and Dell was equally vague about a tablet it previewed at the show.“This emerging category of PCs really should take advantage of the touch and mobility and capabilities of Windows 7, and are perfect for reading, for surfing the web and for taking entertainment on the go,” said Mr Ballmer.Improved hardware and software are certainly helping to make tablets more appealing. Windows 7 supports multi-touch applications, battery life has improved, screens are better and high-definition video is possible with the latest graphics chips and processors from companies such as Nvidia.“2010 is the year of the tablet, this is a category that’s got our name on it,” says Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia chief executive, referring to his chips’ ability to deliver high performance without quickly draining a battery.“We have been weaned on the iPhone with this idea of touch and tablets, all of these kinds of behaviours have been taught to us now and consumers are comfortable with them.”However, many of the new tablet makers are not thinking enough about the consumer experience, according to Geoff Walker, marketing manager at touch-screen supplier NextWindow.“I looked at probably 30 tablets at CES and [their makers] were talking about the hardware – the screen size, the storage, the weight, the operating system – but when I asked them about how people were going to use it, they really hadn’t thought about that,” he says.Most observers are looking to Apple and its chief executive Steve Jobs to define what the consumer experience should be on a tablet and help to drive adoption in the same way the iPhone has changed the smartphone market.“I was in the front row at Steve Ballmer’s speech at CES and the tablet to him was like another piece of hardware that’s running Windows 7,” says Robert Scoble, a popular blogger and former “evangelist” of tablets for NEC of Japan.“I don’t think Steve Jobs is going to do that. I expect him to show off something new and some new interaction that most people haven’t considered yet with the world.”Mr Scoble hopes an Apple tablet would allow textbooks and magazines to be read with multimedia elements and internet content could be served up on a TV by the device.Michael Gartenberg, analyst at the Interpret research firm, says Microsoft has not been successful in trying “to shoehorn PC functionality” into a tablet, but Apple should have a different approach.“Apple understands that for 15 years people have tried making these devices and they’ve all failed and I would hope they would have a different take on what the right functionality might be,” he says.“At the end of the day, these have not become mass-market devices and Apple does not typically look to build for tens of thousands. It is looking for tens of millions in sales.”
158;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-01-21T23:11:33Z;Its competitors still cannot touch the iPod;;"It is over a decade since I dumped my Sony Walkman mini-disc player in favour of one of the first portable digital music, or MP3, players – a device called the Rio PMP300 manufactured by Diamond Multimedia.It had a small LCD screen and a circular pad with control buttons, and could store 12 tracks on its 32MB of internal memory. One AA battery provided power for eight hours or more.Devices such as the Rio paved the way for a slew of innovative portable digital music and multimedia players, including Apples iPod, launched in October 2001, and a huge accompanying ecosystem of add-ons, ranging from cases and chargers to docking stations and speaker systems.Apple’s latest offering – a version of the iPod Touch, released a few months ago and priced from $299 (£234 in the UK, €289 in most of Europe) for the 32GB model – reveals how far we have come since the Rio.This latest release comes among mounting evidence that the portable digital music player market may have run out of steam. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, there were relatively few new devices on display, and iPod sales appear to have reached a plateau, with replacement purchases accounting for perhaps half of sales.Most smartphones do a reasonable job as multimedia players, although loading music can be a challenge unless its an iPhone or Windows Mobile-based handset.Nevertheless, there are good reasons to buy a dedicated portable multi­media player and there are some excellent devices available.They include the latest iPod Nano, which features a built-in digital video camera and FM radio, Microsoft’s touchscreen-based Zune HD player which uses Nvidia’s powerful Tegra processor, and Sony’s X Series Walkman (arguably the best digital music player Sony has produced).But in terms of ease of use and flexibility it is difficult to beat the third-generation iPod Touch with its 3.5in touchscreen, tight integration with the iTunes online store and elegant design. The 32GB and 64GB versions (though not the 8GB model) are faster than earlier versions and incorporate a number of new features, including voice control and more advanced graphics support.Best of all, the Wi-Fi-enabled iPod Touch can download and run most of the free and low-cost software applications available in Apple’s App store – without requiring a costly monthly phone contract – making it an ideal device for BlackBerry owners or those who already own a smartphone.The latest Touch is basically an iPhone without the mobile phone capabilities or digital camera. It runs version 3.1 of Apple’s iPhone operating system (existing Touch owners can upgrade for $5) and features the same microprocessor, graphics engine and memory as the 3GS iPhone.Additional hardware features include an integrated microphone built into the earbuds – though I would still recommend upgrading them. The Touch does make it easy to download and play back video (it supports iTunes video rentals and comes with a YouTube player) and podcasts, and is of course an excellent music player, but then so are most of the competitors.What makes the Touch stand out from the competition is all the other things you can do with the device, which also includes peer-to-peer gaming capabilities and lots of software features not seen on earlier models.Out of the box it comes with Apple’s excellent Safari internet browser, a photo viewer, an e-mail reader that is compatible with most enterprise, web and standard Pop e-mail services, and a raft of utilities, including calendar, clock, contacts, maps, voice memos and weather.In addition, it provides access to most of the 100,000-plus apps in the iPhone Apps store, including games, social networking applications, internet radio players, voice recorders and news readers.If having that number of options sounds daunting, Apple has introduced a neat feature that may help. Genius App suggests app store downloads based on apps you have already purchased.A similar music feature called Genius Mixes generates automatic play lists based on songs in your iTunes library. Generally, I found both worked well.Overall, I think the 32GB version of third-generation iPod Touch represents the best value for money and is a great way to explore the iPhone Apps world without having to buy an iPhone.That said, the Touch is not perfect and lacks some features found in rivals, such as the FM tuner and noise-cancelling technology found in Sony’s X Series Walkman or the Zune HD’s ability to send a high-definition video to a television and sync wirelessly to a PC.If you want a smaller device with a video camera, the iPod Nano is a good alternative but it lacks the Touch’s sophistication.In terms of audio quality, the Sony device may have a slight edge over the competition, but the Apple players trounce all comers when it comes to peripherals such as cases, docks and speakers.The portable digital music player category as a whole may be mature but, as I discovered, there is still enough innovation going on to make it interesting.paul.taylor@ft.com

159;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
160;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2010-01-04T05:00:29Z;Smartbook debut threatens netbook rise;;The netbook faces a challenge this year as the highest growth category in the personal computer market by a younger upstart – the smartbook.Smartbooks will make their full debut this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chipmaker Freescale heralded their arrival with the launch of its reference design for the category.The name signifies the marrying of smartphones and netbooks in a smaller laptop that has key advantages over a netbook. Smartbooks feature all-day battery life, constant internet connectivity through the 3G phone network, rather than relying on WiFi hotspots, plus lower costs that will encourage operators to offer them free to subscribers.The arrival of smartbooks could put Intel and Microsoft, the dominant hardware and software players, on the back foot. Microsoft is not providing an operating system to run on the new machines, while Intel, whose Atom processor has so far dominated the netbook category, is not a contender in smartbooks.Smartbooks will run instead on microprocessors based on designs by the UK’s ARM, similar to those used in the majority of mobile phones.The category is being promoted by wireless and graphics chipmakers such as Freescale, Nvidia, Marvell and Qualcomm, which have been unable to grab a significant share of the netbook market.They are entering the fray as PC makers call on their smartphone expertise as they find that ever-smaller machines attract consumers. Notebook sales have overtaken those of desktop PCs in the consumer market and netbooks have become the fastest growing part of the notebook market.“We’re going to see an explosion in the next couple of years of these new type of devices and that’s going to change the PC landscape,” says Henri Richard, chief sales and marketing officer at Freescale. Freescale’s processor was in the first smartbook released – the Sharp Netwalker launched in Japan in the autumn.“This ‘tweener’ category – between the phone and netbook – is actually a pretty attractive alternative. A device that is not really a phone and has PC-like characteristics expands the category,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies.Improved battery life and performance in a new generation of netbooks running on Intel’s Atom microprocessors could blunt the impact of smartbooks. The new devices are already late arriving – they should have gone on sale in numbers during the holiday season.
161;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2009-12-30T21:57:09Z;Wall St struggles to push higher;;US stocks struggled to push higher on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened and investors looked ahead to the end of the year.After lingering in the red for most of the day, the S&P 500 ended the session broadly unchanged at 1,126.42, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,548.51. But the Nasdaq Composite managed to close 0.1 per cent higher at 2,291.28.The dollar climbed to a three-month high against the yen as investors anticipated tighter monetary policy next year, reducing the appeal of equities.“After a great six-month run, there’s also probably a little bit of profit-taking and window-dressing going on,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.Volumes were very light, even compared with the holiday period last year, since many investors have already settled their positions following a volatile year on Wall Street.The number of shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange on Christmas eve this year was 20 per cent lower than last year while the lead-up to the new year has proved quieter so far.Aetna, the health insurer, weighed on the market on Wednesday, falling 2.2 per cent to $32.15.The group said it would have to absorb up to $65m in fourth-quarter expenses due to job cuts and building closures. Last month, Aetna said it would lay off about 1,250 workers by April next year in response to both poor economic conditions and the potential impact of healthcare reform.However, since President Obama’s healthcare speech in September, the stock has gained about 10 per cent.UnitedHealth Group, one of the sector’s largest operators, is up 8 per cent over the same period.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, announced that it had halted trials of a new treatment for lung cancer.The drugmaker said it had stopped enrolling patients for the study after an “apparent imbalance” between the number of deaths and complications among patients taking the medicine and those in control groups. Its shares were down 0.3 per cent to $18.50.However, chipmakers helped to lift the technology sector and pushed the Nasdaq ahead of other indices.Nvidia rose 3.6 per cent to $18.67 after analysts at Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”.Elsewhere in the sector, the brokerage also raised Marvell Technology Group to “buy” from “hold”, citing improving demand for computers in the recovery.Analyst Suji De Silva added that Marvell’s efforts to diversify beyond its core storage business would soon pay off, which helped push the shares 2.8 per cent higher to $20.83.Broadcom, another chipmaker, agreed to pay $160.5m to investors in order to settle lawsuits over the way it had reported stock options. Its shares were up 1.8 per cent to $31.85.Apple buoyed the sector after Kaufman Bros lifted its price target on the stock to $253 from $235, saying the company would be likely to beat estimates. Its shares were up 1.2 per cent to $211.64. Several equipment makers also continued to benefit from discussions over airport security following the botched attempt to blow up a US-bound aircraft on Christmas Day.L-3 Communications climbed 1.5 per cent to $88.50 after the Netherlands said it would start using full-body scanners for flights to the US.The company, which has already provided body scanners to the main airport in Amsterdam, was trading at a 14-month high on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Gander Mountain, which sells camping, fishing and hunting gear, rose 0.2 per cent to $5.11 after the board agreed to delist the retailer from the Nasdaq.Two of the company‘s largest shareholders have said they intend to buy out the remaining shares, taking the company private.Gander, which reported this month that its third-quarter profit had quadrupled, said regulation costs outweighed the advantages of remaining publicly listed.Among the market’s other gainers, Oshkosh, the Wisconsin-based company that makes military trucks, added 0.9 per cent to $37.85 after the company won a $258m contract from the US government.
162;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2009-12-16T19:50:30Z;US trade body sues Intel over alleged abuses;;The US Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued Intel, accusing the world’s biggest chipmaker of abusing its dominant market position over the past decade.The FTC’s action follows similar complaints by regulators in Europe, Japan and Korea. But the US regulator’s allegations against Intel are broader – it also alleges more recent anti-competitive behaviour in the graphics chip market.“Intel has engaged in a deliberate campaign to hamstring competitive threats to its monopoly,” said Richard Feinstein, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. The FTC said it would it was bringing the case to force Intel to modify its conduct and was not seeking monetary damages.“The FTC’s case is misguided. It is based largely on claims that the FTC added at the last minute and has not investigated,” Intel said.Doug Melamed, Intel general counsel, added: “This case could have, and should have, been settled. Settlement talks had progressed very far but stalled when the FTC insisted on unprecedented remedies – including the restrictions on lawful price competition.”“The FTC’s rush to file this case will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to litigate issues that the FTC has not fully investigated.”The FTC’s complaint comes a month after Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney-general sued Intel alleging it used “bribery and coercion” to maintain its dominant market position.The FTC said its case was likely to be heard before an administrative law judge in September 2010. It said it was seeking an order that would prevent Intel from using “threats, bundled prices or other offers to . . . hamper competition”.The FTC complaint mirrors those of other regulators around the world, alleging that Intel used “threats and rewards” aimed at PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM to coerce them not to buy PC microprocessors (CPUs) from its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices.It also alleges Intel secretly redesigned key software so as to stunt the performance of rivals’ chips that were licensing its “x86” microprocessor design.Last week, Intel settled a civil action brought by AMD over the same issue by paying its rival $1.25bn. AMD said a new five-year cross-licensing deal with Intel would allow it to compete on a level playing field.But the FTC complaint also alleges that Intel is repeating in graphics processing units (GPUs) its tactic of slowing down competitors so it can catch up.“There also is a dangerous probability that Intel’s unfair methods of competition could allow it to extend its monopoly into the GPU chip markets,” the FTC said. The complaint mentions graphics chipmaker Nvidia, which has accused Intel of unfair pricing policies. “We applaud today’s action by the US Federal Trade Commission,” Nvidia said in a statement.“We are particularly pleased to see scrutiny being placed on Intel’s behaviour toward GPUs, which have become an increasingly important part of the PC industry.”Intel appealed in September against a record €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine imposed by the European Commission for abusing its dominant market position. The South Korean FTC has also fined the chipmaker while an investigation by its Japanese counterpart was settled without a fine.
163;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2009-12-07T01:45:47Z;Intel abandons graphics card launch;;Intel has suffered a major setback in its attempt to expand its world-leading chipmaking business into high-end graphics.The semiconductor maker has announced it is abandoning its efforts to launch a graphics card based on a new multi-core chip codenamed Larrabee.The Silicon Valley company said Larrabee would be relegated to being used as a software development platform for internal and external use.This represents a rare failure for Intel, which has maintained relentless progress in development of microprocessors at the heart of four out of every five PCs sold.It has maintained the pace of its “tick-tock” two-year road map for CPUs (central processing units) for most of the decade – a “tick” year where it shrinks the size of its chips is followed by a “tock” year where it redesigns their architecture.But in GPUs (graphics processing units), Intel has failed to match rivals AMD and Nvidia in producing high-end chips.It is the traditional leader in producing basic graphics chips integrated into PC motherboards, but has failed to master parallel processing in order to produce the more powerful “discrete” plug-in cards of its competitors.“Project Larrabee” was announced in April 2007 as a multi-core chip that would be capable of super-fast teraflop performance – a trillion floating point operations per second.But it has been constantly delayed and executives had been vague in comments about its progress.On Friday, Intel spokesman Nick Knupfler said: “Larrabee silicon and software development are behind where we hoped to be at this point in the project.“As a result, our first Larrabee product will not be launched as a standalone discrete graphics product. We remain committed to delivering world-class many-core graphics products to our customers.”The news will be welcomed by the smaller Silicon Valley competitors Nvidia and AMD.AMD burdened itself with debt in buying the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI in 2006 for $5.4bn in order to specialise in the technology.It will now feel it has a significant lead over Intel in the eventual goal of chipmakers to fuse CPUs and GPUs into one multi-core processor.
164;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2009-11-04T22:12:08Z;Legal challenges mount for Intel;;Years after first flaring up in Europe and Asia, the global antitrust cases against Intel are finally threatening to spiral out of control in its own back yard.New York attorney-general Andrew Cuomo’s complaint against the chipmaker, filed on Wednesday, follows a private antitrust suit brought by arch-rival AMD.But it could well be only the prelude to a much bigger battle, according to former regulators and legal experts: a full-blown federal government case against the world’s biggest chipmaker, in what would be the most significant case of its kind since the US took on Microsoft a decade ago.Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission, newly constituted by the Obama administration, announced an important change in its approach to antitrust enforcement, promising to take a more stringent line in its application of the Sherman Act, one of the principal planks of antitrust legislation.The fact that New York State has moved first against Intel may simply reflect the fact that there will be a lag before this new, tougher stance results in a federal case, according to observers.Mr Cuomo’s investigation began “in the days of the last US administration, which was reluctant to bring cases like these”, said Nicholas Economides, professor of economics at the New York University’s Stern School of Business, who worked on the New York investigation. “It’s very possible the FTC will want to bring a case.”The cases against Intel, both in New York and around the world, in many ways echo the earlier, successful US complaint against Microsoft. As in the Microsoft case, they accuse a dominant technology supplier of using its power over PC makers to prevent smaller rivals from gaining a foothold.“It’s vitally important for the FTC to bring its own case,” said David Balto, a former policy director at the agency.If the federal regulators decide to take on the case, they could open a new front in the global challenge to Intel that goes beyond the issues considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, Mr Balto said. So far, the cases have centred on distribution issues: Intel’s ability to use large discounts and other means to discourage its customers from buying chips from AMD.The FTC would be more likely to look at broader issues, such as whether Intel’s dominance limits innovation in the chip industry, he added. For instance, Intel faces a complaint from Nvidia, a maker of graphics chips, that its refusal to licence some of its technology has blocked potential rivals from moving into its market.The timing of Mr Cuomo’s move could also complicate Intel’s defence strategy, both at home and abroad. It has been preparing for its first public defence in court in Delaware next year, when the AMD case is due to be heard.With a new, high-profile case to defend, it could now find it far harder to prevail in Delaware, said Mr Balto.
165;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Nvidia cloud graphics offer reality check;;Nvidia today launched a “GPU computing in the cloud” service that will allow designers to manipulate and check photo-realistic environments in a fraction of the normal time it takes on a PC workstation.The graphics chipmaker is combining “iray” rendering technology, from its mental images acquisition, with its high-end Tesla chips in a new RealityServer platform. It expects cloud computing providers to offer services based on the platform to designers of cars, aircraft, clothes, homes and office buildings.In a demonstration on the fringes of the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Nvidia showed how a photo-realistic design for an office floor (pictured) could be manipulated in a web browser in 3D, with the effects of changing lighting shown and the new views taking seconds to render rather than over more than three hours on a regular workstation.The company said the images could be accessed over the internet on any device that could run a browser, with an iPhone demonstration included in the presentation.The software will be released on November 30 and Nvidia said it would help cloud computing providers to configure their servers with the Tesla GPUs (graphics processing units).Both Nvidia and its main rival AMD have been pushing into graphics markets beyond the cards they make for PC gamers. They see a role in industries that can make use of the power of parallel processing, carried out in GPUs with hundreds of computing cores.Nvidia has led with its Tesla GPUs and will follow up with its forthcoming Fermi ones, while cards based on AMD’s latest RV870 chip have 1,600 processing cores.
166;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Flash 10.1 leaves Apple out in the cold;;There is still no agreement between Adobe and Apple over its Flash technology being allowed to boost the web browsing capabilities of the iPhone, but the same can’t be said for other devices from today.Adobe is announcing the release of Flash 10.1 at its MAX worldwide developer conference in Los Angeles. It will bring better browsing and HD performance to smartphones, smartbooks, netbooks, PCs and other web-connected devices.Around 75 per cent of all videos online are delivered using Flash, more than 70 per cent of Web games are built with Flash and the technology is used to add rich features to many web sites.Now companies such as Nvidia and Qualcomm are optimising graphics processing units (GPUs) and Arm-based CPUs for Flash with the 10.1 release, boosting the multimedia capabilities of new devices.Flash integration with Arm-based devices will negate one advantage Intel has claimed up to now over Arm, of superior optimisation of its chips and chipsets for Flash and web browsers.I was impressed by a demonstration by Nvidia last month of a beta install of Flash 10.1 being GPU-accelerated on a netbook – the new $400 HP Mini 311. They streamed 720p HD content off the web at 30 frames per second with this new integration of Flash with their ION graphics processor.Similarly, expect to see soon smartbooks and smartphones from the likes of Toshiba using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Arm-based processor optimised for Flash 10.1.On smartphones, such as Palm and Blackberry devices, Flash 10.1 will give more powerful features than the existing Flash Lite software and be less of a drain on resources.Adobe says rendering of graphics on mobile devices will be 87 per cent faster, while memory consumption will be reduced by 55 per cent.This may answer one of the alleged criticisms that Apple has of Flash – that the software would slow the iPhone’s performance to an unacceptable degree.But there will be no announcement at MAX of any agreement with Apple, Adrian Ludwig, group manager of the Adobe Flash platform told me.“We have been doing very active development in that area, but there are limitations on our ability to bring something to market,” he said.“We are constrained just like every developer by the set of capabilities expressed in the iPhone SDK and developer programme and those just aren’t sufficient. We’ve made great progress, but without direct assistance from Apple, we will not be able to get the Flash player on the iPhone.”Perhaps with every other major smartphone player becoming Flash capable with 10.1, that assistance from Apple may finally be forthcoming.UPDATE: Adobe has just announced at the MAX conference that Flash developers will be able to export their creations to the iPhone and iPod touch, easily converting them into applications for the App Store. This still leaves the Safari browser unable to play Flash.Kevin Lynch, Adobe chief technology officer, said: “The engineering teams at Adobe have succeeded in bringing the latest Flash technology to the iPhone, opening the way for the Flash community to deploy to the App Store. When Apple is ready to bring the full Web browsing experience to iPhone users, we’ll be ready to bring Flash Player to Safari.”
167;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Zune squares up to iPod;;"For the best part of a decade, Apple’s family of iPods and its iTunes online store have dominated the portable media player market and helped define a digital lifestyle.In spite of repeated challenges from rivals such as SanDisk, Microsoft and Sony, Apple has maintained its near 75 per cent market share and helped build a huge iPod ecosystem through a potent mix of marketing smarts, price management and just-in-time product enhancements.In spite of the iPod’s undeniable success (and indications the standalone portable media player market may have peaked), Apple’s rivals are not about to give up. Indeed, as I have been discovering, some of the latest products from competitors offer features that Apple’s players have yet to match.This week, Microsoft launched its long-awaited Zune HD in the US (the company has yet to announce launch dates elsewhere). In spite of the Zune moniker, the new player is a
clear attempt by Microsoft to draw a line under the limited success of earlier Zune players and start afresh. To this end, the company is phasing out its earlier players.The Zune HD is available in two configurations: 16Gb for $220 and 32Gb for $290 (almost the same as the new iPod Touch pricing). The 32GB version holds up to 10 hours of high-definition video, or 48 hours of standard-definition video optimised for the player, 8,000 songs or 25,000 pictures.Unlike previous models, the Zune HD is a stylish, super-slim device that features some technology firsts including a big, bright and bold OLED (organic light emitting diode) multi-touch enabled screen.As you might expect, the super-bright colour screen, which measures just under 84mm diagonally, is great for video. Another advantage of OLED screens is their low-power consumption. Microsoft claims the Zune HD should deliver up to 33 hours of music playback and about 8.5 hours of video from a single charge – claims that my initial tests bear out. (The device recharges in about three hours when plugged into a PC’s USB socket.)Microsoft has devoted a lot of attention to video functionality including how well the Zune links up to other devices. For example, the player is powered by Nvidia’s Tegra processor and features high-definition video output. This means users can play back video clips, movies and television shows stored on the device on a big-screen TV using an optional “AV Dock” that costs $50 and supports either an HDMI (high definition multimedia interface) cable or a composite AV cable.Meanwhile, the revamped Zune Marketplace, Microsoft’s answer to iTunes, features movie and TV show downloads and a range of games for the company’s Xbox video console in addition to an extensive music selection available for purchase and download or monthly subscription plan.Like the iPod Touch, the Zune HD is WiFi-enabled so owners can stream music from the web and synch it wirelessly to a PC, a feature that iTunes does not support. The Zune HD also comes with a nifty web browser that is optimised for this screen format and enables users to check e-mail, traffic and news and browse other sites while connected to a WiFi network. (The browser supports Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and the device comes with an on-screen virtual keyboard.)In addition, the player comes with a built-in HD radio receiver, useful if you get bored of your MP3 collection. For audiophiles, the player supports WMA lossless files as well as all the more usual audio formats.When you first set up the Zune HD, you must download the latest version of the Zune software to a PC and connect the Zune player to the PC using the USB cable connector supplied. As soon as the device is connected, it automatically begins charging the battery and synchronising content in much the same way that iTunes software does with an iPod. This is when you can opt to sync with a PC wirelessly. If you want to download content or purchase a Zune subscription, you need to set up an account.The process is reasonably painless, though I got a fright when my test device froze after updating. Fortunately, all that was required was a reset (holding the on/off button on the top edge of the player down for seven seconds).Microsoft is positioning the Zune HD to be part of “an integrated entertainment experience” that also includes its Xbox video player and Windows-powered PCs. The company also says the Zune software/service could appear on other types of devices including Windows Mobile-powered smartphones.In a nutshell, if you want to play it safe, are a Mac rather than Windows PC user, or want access the widest range of add-on software, go for the iPod Touch. If, however you want a feature-packed, portable player for a reasonable price, the Zune HD is worth considering.Apple’s iPod family will probably retain their market dominance, but based on the evidence of the Zune HD, rivals are narrowing the gap."

The two largest US banks by market capitalisation climbed 6 per cent to $26.09 and 7 per cent to $17.50, respectively, while regional banks advanced 7.3 per cent.Traders said there was little fundamental to drive buying in the sector following the sharp decline in the week, which came after the bank rescue plan from Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary, failed to inspire confidence.“I haven’t heard anything today that says, after further review, he had some substance there,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “I’m not finding any particular catalyst out there.”Still, optimism over the economic stimulus package helped the S&P 500 index close 0.8 per cent higher at 833.74. The benchmark index drifted between positive and negative territory in a choppy yet relatively subdued session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.6 per cent at 7,939.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.4 per cent at 1,530.50.The advance in financials came as the heads of eight financial institutions testified about the Treasury rescue plan before a House committee. The KBW Bank Index rallied 6 per cent.Better fourth-quarter results than expected from Marsh & McLennan pushed shares in the insurer 14.4 per cent higher to $21.41 and helped prop up the sector.XL Capital surged 61.4 per cent to $4.68 after the group disclosed plans to let go of 10 per cent of its staff and a cut in its dividend. Standard & Poor’s affirmed key credit ratings.Offsetting the bounce for financials, however, the energy sector was hurt by a sharply lower oil price after release of inventory figures and lost 1.3 per cent overall.The technology sector also underperformed, hit by a downbeat assessment of prospects from Research In Motion. The US-listed shares sank 14.5 per cent to $48.76 after the BlackBerry phone maker warned that fourth-quarter profit would come in at the low end of its targets, signalling the company had sacrificed margins to gain customers.Elsewhere in the sector, Nvidia lost 12.6 per cent to $8.15 after the graphics chip maker disclosed a worse fourth-quarter loss than expected.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said of the downbeat technology news: “These data points are a reason to sell on the surface, although RIM’s volumes are strong and a plus for component demand.”Applied Materials, the computer chip tools maker, warned late on Tuesday that chipmakers would spend 50 per cent less this year for its products. The company also posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of nearly $133m and said it would cut 14 per cent of its workforce, about 2,000 jobs. The shares edged 0.8 per cent higher at $9.77.Also weighing on the market, a report from the commerce department showed that the US trade deficit shrank 4 per cent in December as the global financial crisis cut imports and exports for the fifth consecutive month.On the plus side, shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition, the Bristol-Myers Squibb unit that is the world’s largest maker of infant formula, began trading after it raised $720m, more than expected, in the first US flotation since November. The shares rose 10.1 per cent to $26.43 in their debut session.In the consumer sector, shares in Best Buyadded 1.7 per cent to $29.19 after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction buy” list. The analysts noted that the electronics retailer stood to benefit from the bankruptcy of rival Circuit City.Results from Coca-Cola Enterprises pushed shares in the soft drinks group up 9.6 per cent to $13.10.Yet Nike edged 1.6 per cent lower to $44.31 after the sporting goods group said a global restructuring might result in the loss of 1,400 jobs, or 4 per cent of its workforce globally.Elsewhere, luxury homebuilder Toll Brotherseased 1.1 per cent to $18.37 after it emerged that first-quarter home-building revenue fell by more than half.
169;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2009-01-05T05:08:32Z;3D games and films to launch in living rooms;;Three-dimensional technology is spreading from the cinema to the home with media companies and consumer electronics manufacturers gearing up for living-room launches of the viewing technology.A number of 3D product announcements are expected at the Consumer Electronics Showin Las Vegas this week, the biggest electronics trade fair of the year, with video game devices expected to be among the first to find their way into the hands of consumers.The graphics chipmaker Nvidia will launch its GeForce 3D Vision product: 3D spectacles that link up wirelessly to a personal computer and allow gamers to play more than 350 existing PC games in 3D.Nvidia has also developed a video player that will allow 3D films to be played on a PC monitor or through one of the “3D ready” television sets that will be on display at the show.But one problem is that Hollywood studios have yet to agree on a common standard for 3D.“It’s in its infancy. One studio is going one way and another in a different direction, but we plan to support all standards,” says Ujesh Desai, Nvidia’s GeForce general manager.Also for gamers, a $400 22-inch 3D monitor from iZ3D, special glasses included, will go on sale across the US this week and the company will demonstrate at CES a version that displays Xbox and PlayStation 3 console games in 3D.With high-definition television having come into the mainstream, consumer electronics manufacturers are seeing 3D as the next big innovation that will boost TV sales, although the initial sets on display have little content to show at present.Consumers may be more ready for 3D than companies imagine. A recent survey by the Quixel research company of more than 750 HDTV owners found that about half were interested in watching 3D at home and more than a third expected 3D TV in one to two years’ time, with content coming from their cable and satellite operators and Blu-ray disc players.“Consumers have a very positive outlook on 3D, but economic conditions are making people less likely to want to pay more for it,” says Tamaryn Pratt, Quixel research principal.CES attendees will also be able to see a cinematic live sports presentation in 3D of the national college football championship game, filmed on specially modified Sony HD cameras and presented by Fox Sports.David Hill, head of Fox Sports, has already warned TV makers not to expect 3D on broadcast television unless they agree to subsidise the cost of cameras and other equipment needed by the networks to convert to the format.In the UK, the satellite broadcaster BSkyB has been trying out 3D cameras and testing the delivery of 3D programming through set-top boxes.Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of the DreamWorks Animation studio, told analysts recently that 3D on TV currently had to be watched close up in a darkened room to get the same impact as in a cinema.He said: “It’s new hardware. It’s going to take a long time before there’s wide penetration”.Additional reporting by Kenneth Li in New York
170;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-12-02T15:58:31Z;Supercomputers: Speed within reach at affordable prices;;This has been a milestone year in supercomputing. These high-performance machines, engineered to cope with the most mathematically intensive tasks, have hit new heights of power and performance, while becoming more widely available to businesses.Twice yearly, in June and November, the 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world are ranked by Top500.org, a group of supercomputing experts from the Universities of Mannheim and Tennessee and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.In June, IBM’s Roadrunner supercomputer, based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, became the first machine to achieve the long-coveted goal of breaking the “petaflop” barrier, processing more than one million billion calculations per second.In November, Cray’s Jaguar supercomputer, installed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also passed that milestone. In the most recent rankings, Roadrunner and Jaguar notched up performances of 1.105 petaflops and 1.059 petaflops, respectively.These are giant leaps. “When I started out in the supercomputer industry 25 years ago, we were all talking about the megaflop barrier – millions of operations per second,” says Margaret “Peg” Williams, senior vice-president of engineering at Cray, an established supplier in the field. “These days, that’s just dull and we’ve broken the gigaflop and teraflop barriers along the way to today’s petaflop performance.”Today, even the cheapest PC runs at gigaflop rates yet it is only 11 years since the US government spent about $33m to build ASCI Red, one of the first supercomputers to achieve one teraflop.The rate of progress equates to a 1,000-fold increase in processing power roughly every 10 years, says Dave Turek, vice president of IBM’s Deep Computing group, and that in turn has led to “enhanced fidelity”, or more refined analysis, in terms of output.“We’re now getting to the point where a supercomputer isn’t just used to model the behaviour of a single component in a jet engine, for example, but whole collections of components, working together in an integrated system.“Or we can model different processes on a much smaller or larger scale, from the effect of a new drug on a disease at a molecular level, to the impact of human behaviour on climate change over hundreds of years. And we can perform these tasks far faster, too.”This ability, he says, is largely down to parallel processing – breaking a large computing task into logical components and processing them simultaneously on a vast pool of multiple processors.The more chips added to a machine, the quicker they can process large tasks, as long as the application is engineered to run in parallel, rather than sequentially.Since parallel processing became available to commercial organisations in the early 1990s, the line has blurred between traditional supercomputing, geared to solving complex scientific problems, and high performance computing (HPC), which aims to deliver bulk processing power.Indeed IDC, the consultancy, has redefined its supercomputer category to include HPC systems costing more than $500,000.Sales of such systems, it estimates, grew by 24 per cent in 2007, to reach $3.2bn.But as the technology takes on an increasingly important role in industry and government, as well as academic research, it is increasingly the low end of the market, for HPC systems costing less than $250,000, that is the real engine of growth.The road to such growth began in the 1990s, when high-end computing systems started using standard components in place of proprietary technology.“Twenty years ago, a supercomputer was built from exotic components that made it blindingly fast and blindingly expensive as well,” says John Barr, an analyst with the 451 Group, an industry research company.Today’s supercomputers, he says, use commodity chipsets from Intel and AMD and interconnect technologies based on the widely used Ethernet and Infiniband standards. Prices have dropped and smaller organisations are now able to take advantage of the processing power.Arguably the most striking example of this came in September with the announcement of a partnership between Cray and Microsoft, which has made rapid advances in the sector with its HPC Server operating system.The two companies launched the Cray CX1, touted as ”the most affordable supercomputer Cray has ever offered”, with prices starting at $25,000.Vince Mendillo, director of HPC for Microsoft, says the CX1 is aimed at organisations in industries such as life sciences and financial services that are exploring supercomputing and do not have the in-house expertise or resources to run a fully fledged supercomputer.The partners also hope to lure scientists, and researchers with discretionary IT budgets, to use the system to run workloads locally, creating ”supercomputing on the desktop”, rather than on huge, centralised machines.A similar model is offered by chip maker Nvidia, which in November announced a “Personal Supercomputer” design, that will enable other manufacturers to build high-performance computers that look like traditional workstations.Already, a number of PC vendors, including Dell and Lenovo, have signed up to offer workstations based on this design, at prices starting below $10,000, according to Andy Keane, general manager of GPU computing at Nvidia.These machines, he says, will enable researchers to conduct at least some of their research at their desks.“Now, researchers tend to write the code on a standard notebook and then take it to the supercomputer in order to deploy it,” he says.Carrying out research at a workstation will reduce the time it takes to work on problems and crunch data, he adds.The growing availability of HPC capabilities, however, raises questions about environmental impact: they consume enormous amounts of energy.Mr Turek of IBM points out: “Energy efficiency has become as important as raw performance for the modern supercomputer. Now, it’s all about how much computing you can get out of each megawatt consumed.”
171;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;AMD launches Shanghai, expects profitability;;Despite the ringing of a major-warning bell by its stronger microprocessor rival Intel, Advanced Micro Devices is maintaining its commitment to returning to profitability in 2009.AMD, which reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss last month and softening sales, says it is cutting costs and focusing on core products to lower its break-even point.“We are going to structure the company to a point where we can start making money while retaining core investments in research and development and products,” Dirk Meyer, chief executive, told the company’s analyst day in Silicon Valley today.AMD also launched a key product today – a processor codenamed Shanghai for servers, which offers major performance improvements and is its first based on a more cost-effective 45-nanometre manufacturing technology.Last month, it announced it would spin-off its manufacturing capabilities into a new company, with the help of an investment of up to $8.4bn from Abu Dhabi investors.It is also shedding the consumer electronics business it inherited from its acquisition of the Canadian graphics chip maker, ATI.Mr Meyer, who took over from Hector Ruiz as chief executive in the summer, said AMD was one of only two companies, with Intel, that could produced leading-edge x86 microprocessors in volume and one of only two leading graphics chip makers, with Nvidia. It was the only company that had both capabilities under one roof.AMD’s ambitious plans for “Fusion” of the two has led to losses, a large debt burden and a share price that has fallen 69 per cent this year and was down 9 per cent at $2.33 in trading today.But Mr Meyer said AMD has a shot at a $46.5bn market – $8.5bn for servers, $4bn for graphics cards and $34bn for client PC microprocessors.Shanghai should give it a lift in the server category – compared to its “Barcelona” predecessor, it is on time and performing above expectations. The quad-core processor offers 35 per cent better performance with up to a 35 per cent decrease in power consumption.“I think it will have a big impact in the data centre around virtualisation,” Sally Stevens, director of platform marketing at Dell, told me.“What’s nice is that there’s no change of the motherboard, so it’s a simple drop-in of the new processor.”Dell, HP, IBM and Sun are among the first customers for the new Opteron-brand processor.Intel is hot on AMD’s heels with a new processor design called Nehalem, which will first appear in high-end desktop PCs from Monday and in servers next year.“I think Shanghai puts AMD back in the game, but it is not going to have a whole lot of unblocked sunlight,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies .“It does not make it a clear winner, with Intel breathing down its neck.”
172;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;What IT means to me: ‘Games need to be taken seriously’;;"Spending time with Jen-Hsun Huang is like taking an intensive refresher course in computer science, physics and mathematics.Mr Huang moves quickly from molecular biological simulation and CT scan image reconstruction, through protein folding, to wind-tunnel simulations and crash tests in the car industry. In between, he covers mathematical models for financial services, supercomputers, and creating a new platform for parallel computing.Mr Huang, then, is not one to stand still. Born in Taiwan, he lived in Thailand as a child, then moved with his uncle and aunt to the US. He went to a boarding school in Kentucky before moving to Oregon, where he went to high school in the suburbs of Portland. He followed that with a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University.After periods at LSI Logic and AMD, Mr Huang headed to Stanford University to take a masters degree, also in electrical engineering. Just one year on from leaving Stanford, he set about founding the graphics chip company, Nvidia.Fifteen years on, Nvidia is the last remaining independent, large-scale maker of graphics chips for computers. But Mr Huang wants Nvidia to be more than that. The reason for his rapid-fire tour of the sciences – not to mention the arts – is that he believes we are about to reach a tipping point in computing.“We saw an opportunity to move 3D graphics beyond its then-conventional markets in million dollar supercomputers and into consumer applications, primarily video games,” he says of the decision to set up the business in the early 1990s. “It’s ironic that Nvidia is now taking the technology we developed for those applications back to its scientific and industrial roots.”Originally, Nvidia set out to produce graphics chips and cards that added better display capabilities to computers, and Windows computers in particular. These subsystems became progressively more powerful, adding support for 3D graphics and programmable shading. The company added more processing cores to the chip sets, and also made them easier to program, through languages such as Open GL, mostly in order to satisfy the needs of the computer gaming industry.But six years ago, executives at Nvidia noticed that academic researchers were putting their products – also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, to an unexpected use: parallel computing, which involves multiple instructions being carried out simultaneously.“The GPU was mathematically intensive, but it was designed to display colours on a screen,” recalls Mr Huang.“We noticed that students were programming in languages such as Open GL on our GPUs to generate numbers instead of colours. On their own they had discovered the ‘general purpose’ GPU. But using a graphics language and receiving colours to re-interpret as numbers was such an arcane way of programming that it ruled out the mass market.”As a result, Nvidia adapted its GPUs to run a modified version of the C programming language, which the company calls CUDA.“That made it possible for these processors to become general purpose,” says Mr Huang. “These hundreds of processors are now collaborating to run a C program and to output numbers.“So scientists can use the GPU as a resource for general purpose computing. That is a big innovation.” CUDA is now taught as a system for parallel computing at more than 50 universities, Mr Huang adds with evident pride.An example of how powerful the GPU can be is Stanford University’s Folding@home protein analysis application, which studies the mysterious way proteins assemble themselves. Nearly half the program’s computing power, 1.25 petaflops, comes from just over 11,000 Nvidia GPUs. Some protein folding applications are 140 times quicker running on a graphics processor rather than a CPU, Mr Huang points out.But valuable though Standford’s Folding@home application undoubtedly is, CIOs might fail to see the relevance, and fail to see why they should specify what is a relatively expensive additional component, in the form of a dedicated graphics processor, rather than use the CPU maker’s integrated graphics.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Huang says they should not, at least not for mainstream enterprise desktops. “Partially, I care about desktop applications, and, partially, I don’t,” he says.“We are not interested in being a generic computing company, where we solve everyone’s problems. We seek out challenging problems for specific groups of people. It was gamers and design professionals; now it is 40m to 50m creative professionals. These are people who have a challenging, visual computing problem, and we can be helpful to them.”For others, hosted computing in some form is the best option. “If you are a gamer or a designer, put a GeForce or Quadro in your system. If you are a secretary, or data entry person, or someone running a basic enterprise desktop, you should put your computing into the cloud.”Mr Huang is, however, enthusiastic about the company’s collaboration with Adobe – the software vendor’s products can talk directly to Nvidia GPUs – and sees an interesting opportunity to move the technology from specialist applications such as Adobe’s Photoshop or Premiere video-editing package, to more general business software, such as Acrobat.“We are seeing accidental innovation, which could be revolutionary,” he says. “Acrobat is an interactive document: where does text end and 3D begin? That will be very subtle. If I see an object I can give it a twirl. I can twirl a teapot or open a car door. That innovation comes from us innovating at the extremes, and then one day a smart company such as Adobe picks it up, because it has become so pervasive.”Technologies such as 3D rendering have become pervasive, Mr Huang says, because of computer gaming. CIOs might not like gaming much, at least not on company computers in company time. But it is gaming that created the market for Nvidia, and gaming that has enabled scientists, doctors and engineers to push the boundaries of computing with low-cost hardware.Mr Huang points out that IBM’s Roadrunner, a massive supercomputer built to model how nuclear weapons age, is built partly around the same Cell processor found in Sony’s PS3 games console. The GPU would not originally have attracted the interest of university researchers, if it were not for the economies of scale brought by sales to the computer games market.Mr Huang believes the gaming community is misunderstood, and not just by CIOs. But then it was gaming that drew him to the IT industry in the first place.“I always loved video games and that started me on the path to technology as a career,” he recalls. “We were the first generation to have access to computers at home and at school. My classmates and I would spend hours creating programs in Basic and coding the machines in the labs. After that I went on to study electrical engineering.”The older generation – Mr Huang is 45 – has not accepted gaming as a worthwhile pastime, he suggests. “Bill Gates says he played a lot of games. It creates puzzle-solvers, people who are good at multi-dimensional problem solving. Research suggests surgeons are more effective if they are gamers too. Kyle Bush, the Nascar [motor racing] driver, uses video gaming to train.”Mr Huang admits that Nvidia’s association with video games has “tarnished” the company’s image. “Because we have our origins in technology for gaming and this still continues to be a significant source of our revenues, we aren’t seen as a ‘serious’ company,” he says.But despite this, technology continues to amaze him. The personal computer industry, he suggests “is having a mid-life crisis”. But developments in parallel computing, and in areas such as the embedded market, for example in cars, or in mobile devices, offer the potential to be as inspiring as the PCs Mr Huang used at college in the 1980s.“Video cameras in your car mirrors will distort and re-distort images so you can see around bends,” he predicts. “You could have a sky view of your car for parallel parking. You would see your car in the third person – that is possible with graphics processors.”If drivers could practise parking using a video game, you suspect Mr Huang would be a very happy man indeed."
173;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-10-30T18:22:13Z;Chipmaker warns of global sales decline;;The global semiconductor industry may face a sales decline of up to 10 per cent next year, the head of the world’s biggest contract chipmaker said yesterday.Rick Tsai, chief executive of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which commands half of the sector’s global market share, said foundries such as TSMC and United Microelectronics Corp were being hit as the industry faced the “unusually challenging environment” caused by the financial crisis.“We are now expecting the semiconductor industry [revenues] to decline by mid-to-high single digits in 2009,” Mr Tsai told an investor conference in Taipei.Semiconductor manufacturers round the world are reporting worsening results and reduced orders because of the looming prospect of a global recession. TSMC expects its revenue in the fourth quarter of this year to be about T$70bn ($2.1bn), a decline of about 25 per cent from the third quarter. UMC, its main rival, predicted a similar decline in fourth quarter sales on Wednesday.In spite of the gloomy outlook, Mr Tsai said the technology industry would be likely to fare better this time than during its last previous big downturn in the aftermath of the tech bubble in 2001, partly owing to advances in how inventory is managed.“We all feel the rage of the storm. However, it is different from 2001 …the magnitude is smaller,” he said.But he said that there was “still very little visibility up to now” on the industry’s outlook and that consumer demand would “play a much bigger role” in this crisis.The drop in sales is expected to be particularly steep in the coming months because many of the foundries’ customers now prefer using up their existing inventory rather than placing new orders in the face of uncertain business conditions.Foundries sell to chip design companies that do not have their own manufacturing capabilities, such as Nvidia, the graphics card maker, or to those who own plants but increasingly look to outsource production, such as Texas Instruments, which makes mobile phone chips.The hardest hit among the chipmakers so far are those who manufacture memory chips such as dynamic random access memory chips, used in personal computers, or flash memory chips, used in portable devices.That sector of the industry has already been struggling with prices falling to below production costs because of oversupply.In South Korea, Hynix Semiconductor reported its biggest quarterly loss in more than seven years. The world’s second largest memory chipmaker suffered a net loss of Won1,650bn ($1.3bn) in the third quarter, its fourth straight quarterly net loss. In the same period last year Hynix reported a net profit of Won168bn.“The problem lies in the demand side. We’re not sure when we will see a significant pick-up in demand,” said Kwon Oh-chul, Hynix’s senior vice-president of strategic planning.
174;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-09-16T15:50:45Z;The interface: Gestures will force the mouse into retirement;;"At almost 30 years old, is the computer mouse ready for retirement? Certainly, a growing band of human-computer interaction (HCI) specialists believe so. The crude language of “point and click”, they argue, seriously limits the “conversations” we have with our computers.Among them is Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini, a veteran HCI expert who joined Apple in 1978 as its 66th employee and founded the company’s Human Interface Group during his 14 years there. These days, after spells at Sun Microsystems and online healthcare company WebMD, Mr Tognazzini is a respected consultant, author and speaker with usability company, the Nielsen Norman Group.“In many ways, our continued reliance on the computer mouse reduces us to little more than cavemen, running around pointing at symbols and ‘grunting’ with each click,” he says. “A revolution is long overdue, because we need more sophisticated tools that will allow us to increase our vocabulary way beyond that caveman grunt.” Plus, the link between the computer mouse and cases of repetitive strain injury (RSI) are hardly an argument in its favour, he adds.Luckily, he says, those “more sophisticated” tools are right in front of our faces and we already know how to use them. They are, in fact, our fingers.“Look at the facts: we’ve typically got 10 of these ‘tools’; they move in a multitude of different ways; and gestural language, which came long before verbal language, is an established and intuitive form of self-expression. Even primates can be trained to express needs and intentions using their fingers,” he points out.What has historically been lacking, is the ability of computers to read and understand our gestures – but that is changing very quickly. In fact, real-time video interpretation and inertial sensors are already being used to recognise facial expression and physical movement in a number of consumer technology devices, says Steven Prentice, an analyst with IT market research company Gartner.He traces the roots of this migration to two recent events: the launch of the Nintendo Wii games console in 2006 and of the Apple iPhone in 2007. Through clever use of accelerometers and optical sensor technology, the Wii Remote (or “wiimote”) is already enabling millions of people to practise their golf swings, play rock guitar or swordfight with imaginary enemies. And since the iPhone was launched, strong sales and high user satisfaction have reinforced just how powerful and intuitive a multitouch interface can be.These early announcements have been followed by a string of others in consumer technology. In recent months, Panasonic, Sony and NEC have all demonstrated applications that use facial and movement recognition. These include, for example, video displays from Panasonic that can identify users from their faces, serve up content choices based on their individual preferences, and that allow screen control by hand gestures.It’s easy for business leaders and chief information officers to dismiss such trends in consumer preference as minimally relevant to enterprise computing – but that’s a “dangerous oversimplification”, warns Mr Prentice. “Not all consumer-targeted technologies find their way directly into enterprise IT environments,” he concedes, “but the growing adoption of these technologies by individuals in their ‘personal infrastructures’ is leading to increasing frustration and dissatisfaction with constraints and restrictions the corporate IT environment often imposes on users.”Fortunately, it’s not just the consumer technology firms that have their eyes on gestural technologies. At Accenture Technology Labs, research director Kelly Dempski has a long track record in exploring how they can be used in business applications, most recently concentrating on building multi-touch, interactive display walls.Accenture has installed such walls, for example, in O’Hare International Airport in Chicago and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Consisting of multiple screens housed in giant custom frames, they use graphics and touch-screen technology to allow passengers to check the weather at their destination, read the latest news from CNN, or find out how their team scored while they were in flight, by simply touching areas on the screen.This technology, says Dempski, could have equally valuable back-office applications, presenting vital internal data from back-end enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to employees in a control room at a utility firm, for example. “The aim is to create a mode of interaction that requires zero training but offers a high degree of interactivity,” says Mr Dempski.At Microsoft, meanwhile, researcher Desney Tan is taking HCI to new levels: muscle-computer interaction. Mr Tan and his colleagues, alongside researchers from the Universities of Washington and Toronto, have developed an armband worn on the forearm that recognises finger movements by monitoring muscle activity. They have called it MUCI, which stands for muscle-computer interface and its aim is to make controlling computers and gadgets easier in situations where the user is otherwise engaged – for example, when driving a car or in a meeting.“The human body is a prolific signal-generator,” he says. “My work is focusing on the potential of tapping into the electromagnetic signals that the brain sends to muscles, which has the potential to harness a whole range of subtler movements than simply a press or a pinch on an interactive screen.”MUCI currently works extremely well in situations where major arm movements are constrained and finger gestures are made on a flat surface, he says. Tests on volunteers have shown that after calibration, the system can recognise the position and pressure of all 10 digits with 95 per cent accuracy.“Where we want to take this research next is to capturing gestures made in three-dimensional space,” he says, adding that the ability to do that and still recognise gestures with a fair degree of accuracy will start to open the door to a huge range of potential applications – even recognising and translating sign language used by deaf people.Naturally, applications based on gestural computing place a huge strain on underlying hardware, which is forced to process a larger volume and wider range of more subtle signals. Among chip manufacturers, this is forcing a shift in focus from traditional central processing units [CPUs] to the graphics processing units [GPUs] that, up to now, have primarily been used in gaming and virtual world environments.In essence, a GPU is a dedicated graphics rendering device for personal computers and games consoles that is very efficient at manipulating and displaying computer graphics.More important, the ability to process information in a highly parallel way makes GPUs far more effective at handling a large range of complex algorithms than CPUs, which process them in a linear, one-at-a-time fashion, explains Richard Huddy, worldwide head of developer relations at chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).“Say you’ve got an application that uses a webcam to capture shots of a human subject and analyse their gestures. It will need to figure out the relationship between each frame and its predecessor in, perhaps, one-sixtieth of a second, and there’s a lot of maths involved in doing that in a smooth and uninterrupted way. A GPU will do that much, much better,” he says.In order to get its slice of the gestural computing market, AMD is already locked in a pitched battle with rivals Intel and Nvidia to deliver advanced GPU capabilities to hardware manufacturers as soon as possible, with a slew of new product announcements planned for 2009.All this means that businesses need to be prepared. No one is predicting the instant demise of the computer mouse, and certainly not of the keyboard as a text-entry tool. “Despite the many disadvantages of a design nearing its centenary, nothing else currently comes close to the functionality of the conventional tactile keyboard,” says Mr Prentice of Gartner.But there will be a “strong and unstoppable” trend towards a control interface for technology that is based on simple human gestures, rather than on indirect manipulation via physical objects such as a mouse, he predicts.He says that revolution is three to five years off for mainstream business, but it’s not too soon for business leaders to “suspend their natural scepticism” and start to think about how gestural computing might be used to address their organisations’ most intractable user interface issues.“The phrase ‘paradigm shift’ is an overused one, but it’s not often that such fundamental elements of the computer interface change, and the opportunities for enterprises able to capitalise on these changes will be substantial,” he says."
175;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-09-08T20:59:19Z;Wall St rises after government takover;;Lehman Brothers was a notable outlier from a strong rally in financials on Monday, as investors focused on the embattled investment bank’s internal woes.Although at one stage up as much as 9.4 per cent, the shares closed down 12.7 per cent at $14.15 after analysts – ahead of its much-anticipated third quarter figures – predicted larger writedowns.The sell-off came even as Lehman, which has been in talks with Korea Development Bank over a possible capital injection, said “key strategic initiatives’’ would accompany its results next week.Financial stocks led Wall Street higher on hopes the effective nationalisation of Freddie Mac and Fannie would provide a long-term fillip to the sector.Banks with exposure to the mortgage market fared particularly well. Wachovia jumped 13.4 per cent to $18.99, Bank of America climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.73 and Citigroup gained 6.6 per cent $20.32 respectively.However, institutions with large stakes in Fannie and Freddie suffered as the market capitalisation of the pair collapsed. Gateway Financial lost 24.7 per cent at $5.35, Sovereign Bancorp slid 6.6 per cent to $9.02 and Midwest Banc slipped 24.6 per cent to $4.48.Still, the sector – and the wider market – pared some of its early gains, as more bearish investors noted the government intervention was no panacea to underlying ills.As if to underscore the point, Oppenheimer issued a bearish outlook on investment banks before their third-quarter earnings.As well as Lehman, it lowered its third-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman and Merrill Lynch, which said on Monday it expected a pre-tax loss of between $300m and $350m from a plan to buy back auction-rate securities. Still, their shares edged up 4 per cent to $169.73 and gained 3.2 per cent to $27.59 respectively.Meanwhile, Regions Financial climbed 10.4 per cent to $12.24 after Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co upgraded the Alabama bank from “``underperform” to “market perform’’.It said: “We anticipate that recent credit performance will take a back seat with investors until the euphoria passes.”Meanwhile, Washington Mutual fell 3.5 per cent to $4.12 after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and named Alan Fishman as its new chief executive. He will succeed Kerry Killinger, who will retire after 18 years.In the broader market, the S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent at 1,267.79 points by the close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 2.6 per cent higher at 11,510.74 points.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Had Freddie and Fannie defaulted without the assistance of the Treasury and the Fed, the US economy would have fallen into the vortex of recession for at least five years…This action is a confidence booster.”Last week, the S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly loss since February as mounting concerns about the health of the global economy battered sentiment.Homebuilding stocks took particular comfort from the intervention on Monday and were one of the few sectors to hold on to their gains consistently throughout the session. KB Homes, Pulte Homes and Lennar climbed 14.2 per cent to $23.54, 11.3 per cent to $16.22 and 10.3 per cent to $14.95.Earlier in the day, all 10 sector groups boasted gains although by the close energy and materials had edged into negative territory.Technology also struggled to enjoy large gains. Semiconductors suffered amid concerns they were among the most vulnerable stocks to a global slowdown.UBS downgraded its recommendation on NVidia from “neutral” to “sell” and cut its price target from $12 to $11. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $11.19.UBS also cut its earnings estimate on SanDisk, pushing the shares down 5.9 per cent to $16.60. It said an oversupply of flash memory made it unlikely that prices would recover until the second half of next year.Elsewhere, UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 11.2 per cent to $10.92 after denying a report in the Chicago Tribune newspaper about a possible bankruptcy filing.Altria edged up 0.1 per cent to $20.97 after agreeing to buy UST, a move that will create the largest US producer of smokeless tobacco.
176;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-08-13T20:46:36Z;Financials lead Wall Street down;;Financial stocks led US equity markets down for a second session on Wednesday while some mixed results and an uptick in the oil price also weighed on investor sentiment.In the financial sector, another round of analyst downgrades took their toll. Citigroup cut its full-year 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, among others, while Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.JPMorgan shares fell 2.7 per cent to $36.91, Lehman dropped 4 per cent to $15.57, while Goldman gave up 1.4 per cent to $164.90 and Morgan dropped 5.5 per cent to $40.15.On Wednesday, the financial sector slid 3 per cent with Bank of America and Citigroup coming under selling pressure. The pair lost 7.2 per cent to $28.86 and 3.9 per cent to $17.81 respectively.“We continue to believe that investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation,” said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“The problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over, and we are sceptical that trying to bottom-fish will prove to be profitable.”Observers suggested that the sector might remain under pressure in the short term after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a rule limiting certain types of short-selling in a handful of stocks to expire on Tuesday.In earnings news, Deere, the maker of farm equipment, said third-quarter profits rose 7.1 per cent to $575.2m thanks to strong demand for tractors and combines.But the results missed analysts estimates and the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $67.10. The news dragged on peers. Caterpillar dipped 2.8 per cent to $69.83, Boeing fell 2.5 per cent to $64.26 and the industrial sector as a whole declined 0.8 per cent.There was better news from the technology sector.Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor machinery, projected that orders would increase between 5-10 per cent in the fourth quarter. That was better than expected and the shares rose 4.7 per cent to $19.33.Meanwhile, Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, jumped 10.7 per cent to $12.26 after the company said it would buy back an additional $1bn of shares, bringing the projected total repurchase to about 44 per cent of all outstanding shares.Equity markets pared early losses but by the close, seven of the 10 leading industry groups were still in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,285.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.9 per cent to 11,532.96, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,428.62.Consumer-facing stocks were in focus as oil prices ticked more than $3 a barrel higher, a number of retailers reported disappointing results and new data showed weak retail sales in July.Liz Claiborne, the women’s apparel retailer, was among the biggest fallers after it reported a substantial second-quarter loss and lowered its full year forecast. The shares slid 11.6 per cent to $13.18.Retailers and the broader consumer discretionary sector also took some direction from a Commerce Department report on July retail sales. The survey showed that sales fell 0.1 per cent last month. That is the first headline dip in five months and will be seen as evidence that the impact of the stimulus cheques is waning.McDonald’s fell 1.8 per cent to $62.78 and Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.9 per cent to $57.88 while the consumer discretionary and staples sectors gave up 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.Energy and material stocks were among the few consistent gainers throughout the day. Energy added 3.4 per cent, snapping a four-day losing streak, and materials climbed 2.4 per cent as heavily sold coal and metals stocks rebounded.Peabody Energy and Massey Energy rose 8.3 per cent to $58.85 and 7.8 per cent to $61 respectively while US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 6.2 per cent to $137.92 and 5.8 per cent to $88.50 respectively.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, upgraded the energy sector to “overweight” arguing that “from a technical perspective, S&P believes the correction in oil prices from the recent high of $147 to below $115 is largely over.”
177;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-07-11T17:57:52Z;AMD shares fall over $1bn charge;;Shares in Advanced Micro Devices fell to a 16-year low as $1bn in second-quarter charges highlighted its struggle to slim down operations and return to profitability.AMD announced the second writedown from its 2006 acquisition of the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI. It said it was taking an impairment charge of $880m, following on from a charge of about $1.5bn last year. It paid $5.4bn for ATI.The microprocessor rival to Intel also announced a $32m restructuring charge as it made severance payments to laid-off employees, along with $36m in other charges. The bulk of these related to its shareholding in Spansion, the memory chip maker it spun off in 2005.AMD shares fell to levels not seen since July 1992, falling to as low as $4.60 in trading in New York. This meant a 69 per cent fall in value over the past year.AMD’s acquisition of ATI represented a bold attempt to seize the initiative in a new semiconductor trend called visual computing. It envisages a blurring of the lines between linear central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors made by Intel and AMD and the parallel-processing graphics processing units (GPUs) that have been made by ATI and its rival Nvidia.AMD’s strategy has been hampered by the debt burden it has taken on, initial underperformance by ATI and Intel’s ability to massively outspend it on manufacturing plant and introducing new and more efficient processes.AMD said on Friday its impairment charge related to ATI’s handheld and DTV units within its consumer electronics division. These have been determined as non-core and analysts believe they may be sold off if they continue to underperform.AMD has suffered six consecutive quarters of losses and will report second-quarter earnings next Thursday. Analysts expect a further loss of 51 cents a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Hector Ruiz, chief executive, may provide details of an ”asset-light” strategy AMD is pursuing. It has been falling behind Intel in investment in new plant and is expected to outsource much of its production and become more reliant on ”foundry” chipmakers.AMD said on Friday the sale of older chip wafer fabrication tools would boost its gross margins by about $190m.
178;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-07-03T18:51:36Z;Wall Street shrugs off US jobs data;;US equity markets made tentative gains on Thursday but only pared losses for the week after shrugging off data showing that the US shed jobs for a sixth straight month in June and the services sector contracted unexpectedly.According to the US Department of Labor, 62,000 jobs were eliminated last month, largely in line with analysts’ expectations.Analysts noted that there was little cause for optimism on the economy. The unemployment rate, which in May jumped by the most in two decades, remained at 5.5 per cent and non-farm payrolls have now fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year.Separately, data showed initial jobless claims hit a three-month high last week, while the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell sharply in June.But equity markets proved resilient as traders bet that the poor jobs data would reduce the chance of an interest rate hike from the Fed.Industrial and material stocks were among the leading gainers, adding 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold sectors.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage, said: “Historically, we tend to rally before a patriotic holiday. The major players have already gone home, volumes are light and the path of least resistance is up.”Markets closed early on Thursday and are shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,262.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 at 11,288.54 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,245.38 points.Over the shortened week, higher oil prices knocked markets. The Dow and Nasdaq slumped into bear market territory before the Dow recovered slightly, while the S&P 500 touched its lowest level since July 2006.The S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent over the week and has now declined for five weeks in a row. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent over the week.Technical analysts warned that, having broken through the psychological support of the March lows, the S&P 500 could retest its 2002 depths.Kevin Edgeley, a technical analyst with Goldman Sachs, said: “US markets have been oversold since early June but, in an impulsive trend like this, give no reason to buy.”But investors did just that by, in particular, picking up beaten-down industrial stocks. Ingersoll-Rand added 2.9 per cent to $36.65 while Paccar climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.80.Materials snapped a three- day losing streak as steel producers bounced back. US Steel rose 1.6 per cent to $155.80 and Nucor added 1 per cent to $62.54.Even consumer-facing stocks seemed unfazed by the macroeconomic data. Consumer discretionary stocks added 0.3 per cent while consumer staple stocks rose 0.7 per cent.Safeway and Campbell Soup rose 2.5 per cent to $28.74 and 2.5 per cent to $34.68, respectively, while Kohl’s and Whirlpool climbed 3.4 per cent to $42.52 and 3 per cent to $62.69.Energy stocks were among the biggest fallers however, dropping 0.5 per cent, with refiners taking some punishment. Sunoco fell 3 per cent to $39.69 while Tesoro lost 1.6 per cent to $18.98.In corporate news, NVIDIA tumbled 30.7 per cent to $12.49 after the visual computing technologies provider said second quarter sales would be well below analysts’ estimates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said that there were some encouraging signs that equity markets might be nearing a bottom. The volatility index has moved higher in recent days, the percentage of stocks trading at or below their 200 day moving averages has increased, and energy and materials stocks have come under pressure.“While this may be seen as a problem for investors,” Mr Levkovich said, “we would stress that any weakness in the commodity and energy space can be helpful to other areas that have been crowded out by momentum-driven trading.”Still, Mr Kinahan warned that there were more losses to come. “This has been the most orderly down move of all time. Wednesday was the first sign of panic. We have further to go on the downside as we have never set a bottom until people have said ‘I have to get out at any price’.”
179;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-06-16T19:30:48Z;Vision different from reality in new graphics cards;;AMD and Nvidia unveiled next-generation graphics chips today, with both claiming their uses would reach well beyond the traditional gaming audience.AMD aimed high and fell short with its Cinema 2.0 event. It claimed its technology was responsible for a defining moment in graphics when films would extend seamlessly into interactive gaming experiences and games and their characters would achieve true photo-realism.Video of movie industry figures including Robert Rodriguez, director of Sin City, talking about Cinema 2.0 was shown, along with the filmed opinions of gamers and top developers about when photorealism would make characters in games lose their “uncanny valley” appearance.The estimates ranged from three to 10 years, but presenters at the Cinema 2.0 event said it was only months away with the new technology. However, a demo supposedly updating the AMD demonstration model Ruby to photorealism fell flat when she appeared in an earlier unlifelike incarnation superimposed on a photorealistic street scene.“We’re still in the process of updating her,” was the rather lame explanation.I was more impressed when a presenter delivered “a teraflop for 200 bucks” line – the price the basic ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card will go on sale for in about a week’s time.This is more likely to appeal to the mass-market consumer – a trillion floating operations per second made possible by a chip around a centimeter square. Twelve years ago, a whole roomful of computers fitted with 10,000 Intel Pentium Pro processors were needed to create the world’s first teraflop supercomputer.Nvidia announced its graphics had evolved “beyond gaming” but more sensibly talked about how this level of computing power would simplify day-to-day tasks, like running Windows Vista or converting movies to show on an iPod. Instead of taking five hours, movies could be transcoded in 35 minutes, it said.Its new GeForce GTX 260 and 280 cards are priced at $399 and $649.Both companies also see scientific and industrial applications for the increased parallel processing powers of their graphics processing units (GPUs).In games, it seems certain that these newer chips will allow PCs to regain a graphics edge over the fixed-specification next-generation consoles, but proclaiming them as an advance equivalent to the introduction of sound in movies is a little far-fetched.
180;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-06-02T19:48:35Z;Intel admits shortage of Atom chips;;"Intel has admitted to shortages of its latest Atom microprocessor as manufacturers scramble to compete in the “netbook” category.The world’s biggest chipmaker is expected to feature Atom at the Computex PC trade show in Taipei, where Sean Maloney, Intel executive vice-president, is to deliver the opening keynote speech on Tuesday.But, in an interview with the FT, he said Intel had received more orders than expected for the low-power processor.“We’re ramping it strongly and are still catching up with the demand. I’m not expecting the shortage to last long,” he said. Supply would still be “pretty short” in “the next six to eight weeks”, he said.Intel describes netbooks as compact mobile devices suitable for children, first-time internet users and those who want a basic second PC. They resemble miniature notebook PCs.At Computex last year, Intel demonstrated Asustek’s Eee, a best-selling netbook that has defined the category and sparked a rush to bring out rival models.Michael Dell previewed a Dell netbook the width of a pencil last week and details of an Acer netbook leaked on to the internet.Jerry Shen, Asustek chief executive, predicted in April that there would be a shortage of Atom chips until the third quarter, but the Eee would not suffer because it also used Intel’s older Celeron M processor.Intel is betting on Atom, its smallest processor, to open up four markets: netbooks; mobile internet devices (Mids), which are even smaller; consumer electronics products; and devices that use embedded processors. It predicts that these will be worth $10bn each by 2010 or 2011.Televisions that use Atom processors are also expected to be on show at Computex.Intel’s move from its PC stronghold into smaller devices is bringing it into competition with microprocessors designed by ARM.The UK company, which has dominated processor design in mobile phones, announced on Monday that its technology had been licensed for the first time for a system-on-a-chip targeting the Mid market.Its ARM11 core is in the Tegra, a mobile computer-on-a-chip being launched by Nvidia, a graphics chipmaker, at Computex.Nvidia says the chip enables high-definition video, internet access and 3D touch interfaces in smartphones and Mids.The Semiconductor Industry Association reported on Monday that worldwide chip sales grew 5.9 per cent in April year on year, from $20.1bn to $21.2bn, but were flat compared with March. PC sales were expected to grow by about 10 per cent this year and handset sales by about 12 per cent.Price falls in memory products continued to hurt revenue growth, the SIA said. Excluding memory chip sales, April semiconductor revenues grew by more than 12 per cent year on year."
181;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-05-15T20:44:26Z;Strength in techs fuels US blue-chips rally;;"Wall Street stocks extended recent gains on Thursday as investors shrugged off new data giving mixed signals about the health of the US economy while strong performances in the information technology sector bolstered the leading indices.The morning session was dominated by a number of downbeat data releases that showed slumping industrial activity across the US, rising initial jobless claims and declining business conditions among New York region manufacturers.Still, the economic outlook remains opaque. The latest Philadelphia Fed survey, for example, suggested that the contraction in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region moderated somewhat in May, adding to the fog.In spite of early losses, a run in materials and energy stocks initially pushed indices into the black and as oil prices fell back, consumer discretionary stocks picked up the slack.Meanwhile, a flurry of deal news and positive analyst comments helped information technology shares advance 2.1 per cent, underpinning gains on the major equity markets.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had overturned earlier losses to climb 1.1 per cent to 1,423.52 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,992.25. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent to 2,533.73.On Tuesday US stocks made strong gains as investors responded positively
to relatively benign inflation data and digested better-than-expected earnings re-ports from Freddie Mac.The financial sector added to those gains on Thursday, rising in tandem with the broader market rally and skirting comments by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who urged banks to raise more capital.An index of financial stocks rose 1.2 per cent. Among the leading gainers were Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which rose 2.1 per cent to $23.73 and 6 per cent to $44.77 respectively.Amid the broader market rally industrials stocks were hobbled by the manufacturing data. The S&P 500 industrials index rose only 0.3 per cent as gains for Deere & Co, which added 2.9 per cent to $83.61, were offset by losses for United Technologies, which fell 1.2 per cent to $74.29.General Electric was also in focus, after reports that it had hired Goldman Sachs to look at selling or seeking a partner for its appliances unit. GE shares fell 0.4 per cent to $32.37.A handful of results from retailers highlighted the divergent fortunes of some companies in the sector, but the respite in oil prices lifted stocks across the board.JC Penney said first-quarter net income slumped 50 per cent as shoppers reined back spending amid the US economic slowdown.Tiffany & Co, the upmarket jeweller, posted first-quarter earnings that exceeded forecasts thanks to a “promising start to the year”.JC Penney shares threw off early losses to gain 4.7 per cent to $46.32, Tiffany shares added 6.6 per cent to $48.88 while an index of consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.3 per cent.Energy and material stocks dipped in mid-afternoon but bounced back by the close, adding 1.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively.Internet and media companies provided a frisson of excitement. Yahoo added 2.3 per cent to $27.75 after Carl Icahn launched a proxy battle to force the internet search company to reopen buy-out talks with Microsoft.At the same time, CBS said it would buy web media company CNET Networks for about $1.8bn.The move will broaden the broadcaster’s reach on the internet giving it a total of 54m unique users per month. CBS shares fell 2.4 per cent to $24.23 while CNET shares jumped 43.5 per cent to $11.41. As a whole, the information and technology sector was the strongest in the S&P 500, boosted by a bullish analyst report on semiconductor companies. Intel rose 4.7 per cent to $24.97 while Nvidia added 7.8 per cent to $23.78. The leading gainer, though, was Agilent Technologies, which jumped 8.6 per cent to $35.34 after the maker of scientific-
testing equipment reported a 41 per cent jump in second-quarter profit.EMC, the maker of storage computers, followed close behind. It climbed 6.7 per cent to $17.80 on speculation that the company will sell part or possibly all of its holding in VMware."
182;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-01-29T18:07:49Z;Perspectives: Will we be able to tell reality from artificial imagery?;;There is one cast-iron certainty in what is becoming a hazy technological future: the image – and the screen on which it is displayed – will increasingly become king.On television screens, on personal computers, on digital organisers, on games consoles, telephones and music players, computer generated images of startling realism – animated and in three dimensions – will increasingly become the norm.By comparison, today’s images – excellent though they can be – will appear as dated as the daguerreotypes of the 19th century.On the one hand, this is progress. A picture may be worth a thousand words – indeed it certainly is worth a thousand words when you are trying to work out how to insert a new ink cartridge into a printer.On the other hand, this level of photorealism will bring with it a slew of problems with which governments will be forced to deal.The rate of progress in rendering realistic three dimensional computer generated images over the past few years is remarkable.The technologies have found application both in feature films, such as the recent release, Bee Movie, and in advertising. “Naturally Juicy”, a “strangely saucy” (their words, not mine) advert for Orangina involving a bear and a deer in a forest is the latest creation by The Mill, a London-based post production house which has been making a habit of picking up awards.For one minute and 45 seconds of screen time, The Mill’s 30 animators took three months to bring a galaxy of characters including a flamingo pole-dancer, a bikini-clad rabbit and an octopus waitress to life.Tellingly, the greatest challenge the animators faced was rendering fur and feathers realistically. Ten years or so ago, it would not have been possible to create such life-like imagesThe pace has been forced, however, by a couple of critical developments. First, graphics processing units (GPUs) have become incomparably more powerful.GPUs are processor chips which work in conjunction with the central processor but are designed wholly to carry out the complex mathematics required, for example, accurately to convey the texture of skin, hair or moving water. The market for GPUs is currently dominated by Nvidia, which fabricates the GeForce graphics chip family, and by AMD which makes the ATI Radeon chip line.A second innovation, pioneered by Nvidia but quickly followed by AMD, was programmable pixel shading, which made it possible to process each individual picture element. This enables the animator to treat each pixel separately and to come closer to mimicking reality. A moving, bumpy, reflective surface can be rendered by pixel shaders in ways which would have been impossible using earlier technology.There have been other, startling, developments. Henrik Wann Jensen of the University of California at San Diego is an expert in developing images in which light interacts with other materials – the patterns of light and shade created as sunlight filters through a glass of brandy, for example.Now, he has built a mathematical model based on the absorption and reflection of light which can create the image of a material when given its constituents. And it works in reverse: given an image, the software will work out what it is made of.There are, nevertheless, a number of constraints on the development of three dimensional computer generated imagery, not the least of which is the limited number of skilled craftspeople capable of working with these advanced tools.The Mill and its London competitors, the US post production world and the GPU manufacturers are all in competition for these individuals. They are often freelance, travelling the world and selling their services when an interesting project presents itself.The fact that it took about 2,000 hours to produce two minutes of final product for the Orangina advert is another hurdle. The new tools seem to have vastly increased the quality of the final image but have not significantly reduced the time taken to create it.The upside, therefore, is computer-generated movies indistinguishable from conventionally shot films and computer games where there seems to be no line between real life and fantasy.The downside is whether we are ready for this degree of photorealism on the screens that will increasingly dominate our lives. A computer game today, however violent, is still clearly a game. The advent of shoot-’em-ups indistinguishable from real life could keep researchers working on the effects of computer games on social behaviour busy for years.Second Life and other metaverses are again, today, obviously crude imitations of the real thing. What would be the consequences of a Second Life that seemed as real as real life – or at least as real as the television images that we take for granted as representing reality.One senior figure in the games industry suggested to me in all seriousness that at some date in the future, news events would no longer be filmed live – they would be created wholly in the computer.The consequences for society are difficult to predict. But it may be necessary for governments at some stage, and using technologies as yet undiscovered, to limit the extent to which computer-generated images can be presented as reality on our many screens.
183;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2008-01-29T03:58:24Z;Stop sitting on the sidelines – it’s time to play;;Scott Nettles is a professor of computer science in Texas. He has no idea I’m writing about him. Nor have I spoken to him since I left graduate school in 1991, when he was my officemate. Scott was like the rest of us, except for this: he never had trouble lining up a date. I asked him for his secret. All you have to do is ask the girl,” he said. “Most people don’t ask.”This brings me to the Super Bowl, which I’m told is this weekend. I know nothing about football. In fact, I have no idea how many people are on a team but let’s say it’s about 10. That makes about 20 people on the field. And about 100,000 people in the stadium watching. That’s how most things are in life – a few people on the field while everyone else is on the sidelines watching. It’s a bit like the college dating game where we watched Scott playing the field.Most of my life I’ve sat on the sidelines. It’s hard not to. After all, how many games can you play in? I’ve played in a few. For instance, I had aspirations of being a writer but it was only in 2002 that I got my break. I had written to Jim Cramer suggesting about 10 column ideas. One was how you could buy Duke preferred stock, which was yielding 17 per cent at the time, and sell short Duke stock to lock in the yield. He replied: “Why don’t you write about these ideas.” That’s how I started writing for thestreet.com. When one of my editors left for the FT, he introduced me to Lionel Barber, then US managing editor, now editor, who asked me to write for the Wealth page. I was no longer on the sidelines.Ideas are where everything starts. Not long ago, my business partner and I were at a San Francisco airport and our flight to New York was delayed. To pass the time we started writing ideas for internet businesses. We came up with about five. That weekend, I posted the jobs at scriptlance.com and hired developers from Bangalore and Malaysia to work on each business. The cost for any one was not prohibitive. Everything was cheap to develop and at least try out. Four flopped but one was an instant success: stockpickr.com.Last week I received a nice e-mail from a reader asking advice. He had some ideas but saw roadblocks towards starting a business. He is not unique in this respect – many people start setting up roadblocks in their early childhood. Sometimes for good reasons. Roadblocks help narrow the path. And a narrow and sure path offers security. For instance, this reader worried about affording a business when he had other financial responsibilities. But today, with a little research and outsourcing, you can start almost any business – at least any data-driven or web-driven business – for next to nothing. Let’s say less than $5,000 to get reasonable prototypes for almost anything you want to do. You can even outsource content development.The reader was also worried about protecting his ideas. My solution is this: never worry about that. Let people steal your ideas. If you’re passionate about the idea, nobody will beat you. Particularly since you only need $5,000 as opposed to $10m to do just about anything. To prove my point, here’s an idea I want to do: a hedge fund based on some of the ideas in stockpickr.com (piggybacking the great investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, George Soros, among others). Another idea I like is to play around with is building various facebook applications. You can do that for almost $0.A lot of people are worried about the time it takes to create a business, particularly if you have another job. This fear of no time is an illusion. If you really look at your time commitments, particularly if you are not satisfied with your job, you probably have a good five to 10 hours a day to play with. Stop spending all day text messaging friends and start working on your ideas. Also, while a business plan is important if you need to raise funding, don’t obsess too much about it. Once you launch the model is going to change and all your prior assumptions will be wrong. So time spent on a thorough business plan is probably time wasted.I have no real stock market advice today. The market has been cheap since the first day of this year and before and it’s cheaper now. Last week I bought Coach, Nvidia, Bank of America, Brooks Automation, and the Nasdaq and Russell ETFs. I’ll look at them again in about a year. I didn’t want to sit on the sidelines anymore, particularly when I’ve been so bullish in these columns. I desperately wanted to play.
184;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;No confusion over Fusion, AMD believes in ATI deal;;"A year after Advanced Micro Devices’ acquisition of ATI, the Canadian graphics chipmaker, the merits of the takeover are still unclear to AMD shareholders.The company has suffered four consecutive quarters of losses, its shares are down 39 per cent on their closing price on October 25 2006, the day the ATI acquisition was finalised. Gross margins are down 10 percentage points, key personnel have left the company and AMD has seen Intel move ahead of it in technological advances.At a price of $5.4bn, the acquisition was one of the biggest ever takeovers in the semiconductor industry. It burdened AMD with debt and restructuring charges and represented its biggest gamble.In a conversation with us this week, Dirk Meyer, AMD president, said he never saw it that way.""Gambling implies we didn’t have another choice. But we really believed that the only good choice was to expand our product portfolio.""We are an x86 CPU [microprocessor] company and, while the PC industry has been driven for years by it being the premium component in the box, looking forward, that’s wrong for our customers and for what users care about.""AMD needed a more complete platform for the consumer market focused around video, media and graphics performance not CPU performance, he said. ""One year on, we feel this even more so.""Mr Meyer said the timing of the acquisition was unfortunate – the microprocessor and graphics businesses took a downturn for reasons that existed independent of the acquisition. AMD had problems in its supply chain with its CPUs and became embroiled in a price war with Intel, while ATI’s next-generation chips were late and it was beaten to the punch by its rival Nvidia.He said the departure in the summer of Dave Orton, ATI’s chief executive, was pretty much as planned at the time of the acquisition.New customers are being won already, he argued. Toshiba had begun using its chips for the first time in its notebooks because AMD could offer a better integrated platform with ATI’s graphics chips.""Fusion"" – the full realisation of the benefits of the merger – is expected in 2009, said Mr Meyer. This new class of processor that integrates the CPU and the graphics processing unit (GPU) will combine AMD’s CPU skills with the graphics smarts of ATI’s engineers. By that time, he hopes PCs will be sold not on the strength of their dual core, quad core or octo-core CPU capabilities, but on the benefits they offer users in performing different tasks."

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The S&P 500 closed
0.2 per cent higher 1,541.24.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent higher at 2,792.67 having fallen as much as 1.8 per cent from its peak only to rally later. Technology was by far the best performing of the S&P’s leading 10 sectors.After the market closed Ebay, the online auction site, reported better than expected third-quarter earnings. Excluding a $1.39bn write-down of Skype, its web-based phone service, profit was 53 per cent higher at $563.8m, or 41 cents a share, compared to 33 cents expected by analysts. Revenues increased 30 per cent to $1.89bn. The stock closed up 5.2 per cent at $40.60 and was 0.5 per cent higher in after-hours trade.Intel, IBM and Yahoo reported earnings after the market closed the previous day and though all beat expectations the shares enjoyed mixed fortunes.Yahoo was the best tech performer, up 8 per cent at $28.82 after net income declined less than anticipated and revenues rose
12 per cent. Intel, up 4.9 per cent at $26.72, attracted buyers after third quarter earnings increased 43 per cent to $1.86bn. IBM fell 3.2 per cent to $115.78, in spite of increasing earnings by 6.3 per cent, as investors were spooked by a 10 per cent decline in hardware revenues.Nvidia, a graphics chipmaker, gained 7.7 per cent to $39.54 after an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners raised her profits estimate. Google, which reports today, rose 2.8 per cent to $633.48.Equity indices were volatile. The Beige Book, a survey of anecdotal reports from the Fed’s 12 regional reserve banks, said the economy was still growing but the “pace of growth decelerated since August” in five regions.“Contacts in a number of industries indicated a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity,’’ the Fed report said.“Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction.”There was more bad news for the real estate sector as housing starts slumped 10.2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.191m annual rate in September, worse than an expected 4.2 per cent slide. That followed a fall of 3.2 per cent in August. For the past year to September, housing starts are down 30.8 per cent.The S&P homebuilder index was down 2.4 per cent at 404.20. The S&P consumer staples index, a bellwether of negative economic sentiment, closed 0.2 per cent higher at 291.15.After the market closed Washington Mutual, the mortgage lender, said third quarter profit fell 72 per cent to $210m.But JPMorgan beat earnings estimates in spite of the credit squeeze in the third quarter. It offset large leverage loan write-downs and credit-loss provisions with a big jump in its asset management and treasury services businesses. The shares gained 2.8 per cent at $46.37.The S&P financial index slipped 0.1 per cent at 457.77. Citigroup was one of the most actively traded stocks, falling 0.3 per cent to $44.66, hitting its lowest level in two years. MGIC Investment, the mortgage insurer, lost 15.3 per cent to $26.16 after it fell to a $372.5m loss in the third quarter.Coca-Cola was up 2.3 per cent at $59.09 after it reported a 13 per cent rise in quarterly profits.Third-quarter profits at Altria, parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris, fell 8.4 per cent, but it raised full-year guidance saying income from continuing operations rose 18.1 per cent for the third quarter. The stock gained 0.3 per cent at $70.98.Transport stocks outperformed the market after CSX, the railway operator, increased third-quarter profits 24 per cent to $407m.

187;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2007-06-22T20:31:51Z;Blackstone fever fails to lift Wall St;;"Wall Street posted sharp losses this week as investors worried about
elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition. The S&P removed three stocks, PMC Sierra, ADC Telecom and Sanmina-SCI - all technology companies. As from next week, they will be replaced by Tyco Electronics and Covidien, two companies spun off by Tyco, while Discover Financial Services, a spin-off from Morgan Stanley, will also join the S&P.The Russell indexes were also rebalanced on Friday, and that sparked some choppy trading ahead of the close said traders.Among the leading S&P sector groups that led losses, utilities was down 4.4 per cent, healthcare was lower by 3 per cent and financials was off 2.9 per cent for the week.Real estate investment trusts and homebuilders also fell sharply this week.The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to close at 2,588.96 yesterday for a fall of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 13,360.26 for a slide of 2 per cent this week.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were hurt as the yield on the 10-year bond consolidated near recent highs.Of greater concern for the financial sector, however, was a shake-out at two mortgage hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns.Investors wondered if the episode marked the start of further problems as various banks sought to sell collateral and limit their losses to the hedge funds.Analysts at S&P said: “Recent developments underscore the market and credit risks borne by the major broker dealers as a consequence of their hedge fund investments. This is a sector-wide phenomenon that warrants close scrutiny.”Late on Friday, Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $143.75, for a loss of 4.2 per cent this week. The American stock exchange’s Broker/Dealer index declined 1.8 per cent on Friday, for a loss of 3.6 per cent this week.The bearish mood in stocks was also a function of concern over earnings and the economy.“The market is currently a little nerve-wrecking for investors,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.He said investors were worried that it was becoming harder for the economy to reflect a “goldilocks mix” whereby growth slows to stall inflation but remains strong enough to keep corporate profit humming along.Meanwhile, more professional investors are betting that stocks will suffer the summer blues.For the month of June, the number of short-selling positions on NYSE rose 6 per cent to 12.47bn shares, a record high.One bright spot this week was a rebound in deal activity after a drought early last week.Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buy-out and shares in the investment manager jumped 15.1 per cent to $62.83.Genesco rose 6 er cent to $52.57 this week after Finish Line, down 19.8 per cent at $10.13, agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories retailer.Luxottica rose 3.9 per cent at $37.15 as the Italian eyeware maker bought Oakley, a US rival, in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share. Oakley rose 12.4 per cent to $28.37 this week.Equity Inns jumped 15.4 per cent to $22.71 this week after the hotel and motel real estate investment trust was bought for about $1.26bn by a private real estate trust.Share buy-backs scaled new heights this week.Buoyed by a $10.3bn sale of its supply unit to private equity firms, Home Depot announced a $22.5bn buyback programme. That helped push its stock up 3.7 per cent to $39.36 this week.Expedia, the online travel booking site also announced a $3.5bn buyback, worth 42 per cent of its outstanding common stock. Shares rose 14.5 per cent to $29.06 this week.Semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight this week. Microchip Technology slid 10.1 per cent to $37.80 after the chipmaker cut its sales outlook.Other chipmakers fared better however, with an upgrade for Advanced Micro Devices boosting the stock 6.9 per cent to $14.57.Nvidia traded at an all-time high of $43.35 on a split-adjusted basis as the graphics chip maker revealed a new family of processors. The stock rose 10.3 per cent to $43.62.Earnings and warnings sparked activity in a number of stocks this week.Andersons, an ethanol and grain producer, rose 8.8 per cent to $45.60 after the company increased its full-year profit forecast.Sonic, the restaurant group, lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to higher prices for dairy and soybean oil and rising labour costs. Its shares fell 11.6 per cent to $21.48.Best Buy and Circuit City, the electronic retailers, provided disappointing earnings and their shares fell 6.2 per cent to $44.79 and 5.1 per cent to $15.85, respectively.Another stock in the news this week was Kraft Foods. It jumped 6.6 per cent to $36.75 on Thursday on news that Nelson Peltz, the activist investors had purchased a 3 per cent stake in the food company and seeks asset sales. Kraft was up 2.9 per cent for the week at $36.32 at the close of trade on Friday."
188;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2007-05-14T15:42:36Z;AMD launches chips to ‘leapfrog’ Intel;;The war between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices entered another phase Monday with AMD’s announcement of a family of microprocessors with as many as eight “brains”, or cores.Intel regained a technological edge last year when it released the first four-core processors by combining two dual-core ones.AMD has announced its “Phenom” processor family, with “true quad-core” – four brains linked together on the same chip – as well as dual-core processors. It is also demonstrating an eight-core processor for enthusiasts named FASN8, pronounced “fascinate”.The chips, based on an architecture codenamed Barcelona, will be available in the second half of the year.Randy Allen, head of AMD’s server and workstation division, said the products were the most significant since its Opteron server processor and Athlon 64-bit desktop processors were released in 2003, leading to market-share gains over Intel.“I think they will be pivotal in allowing us to make further progress. Barcelona is a leapfrog product that opens up the gap,” he saidIntel has been regaining share since it released processors last summer based on its own new architecture, which offered lower power consumption and better performance.It also switched to chips with smaller circuitry.“AMD has needed to bring out new products to do something about the drumbeat of introductions that Intel has had,” said Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technologies.“Intel has closed the gap and then some over the past year so this is an important launch for AMD.”AMD entered the graphics market last year, acquiring ATI Technologies, the Canadian chipmaker, for $5.4bn at a time when Nvidia, ATI’s main rival, had released more advanced graphics processing units.But it is beginning a fightback on this front on Monday, with ATI’s next-generation graphics chips going on sale, offering faster performance, particularly in showing high-definition images.“This means parity at the very least for AMD,” said Dean McCarron, semiconductor analyst at Mercury Research.“Any gaps that we saw between the ATI and Nvidia [graphics] products have essentially been eliminated.”
189;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2006-11-22T23:14:33Z;Weak yen could help Sony’s PS3 succeed;;The all-time weakness of the yen against the euro and pound could “save” the delicate economics of the PlayStation3 games console, and rescue Sony from an estimated four years of losses on its complex machine.New calculations by UBS suggest that if the historic strengths of sterling and the euro against the yen continue into 2007, Sony will make only a tiny loss on each console when the PS3 is launched in Europe next March.Recent reports by independent engineers who have stripped the PS3 to its component parts suggest that each unit is currently costing Sony a little over Y90,000 ($763). This in turn causes the company a loss of about Y30,000 every time a PS3 is sold in the US or Japan.But based on analysts’ assumptions that the high-end PS3 will be sold at retail for about €590 ($757) in Europe and Britain, Sony will be losing less than Y3,000 per unit when the revenues from those markets are translated back into yen.Fumio Osanai, a UBS analyst, said that Sony would be looking extremely carefully at yen weakness over the next 12 months, because “under current forex market conditions the European games market could save the PS3 from heavy early losses”.Sony’s company-wide calculation on currencies is that its earnings are affected up or down by Y13bn for every Y1 movement against the euro.Britain and continental Europe are expected to be strong markets for the PS3. More than 35 per cent of the PlayStation2’s global sales were made there and games analysts expect the pattern to be repeated with the new generation of consoles.However, analysis of the PS3’s high-end – and in some cases unique – components has led some to doubt that Sony can quickly cut production costs in order to reduce losses on the machine in Japan and the US.CLSA wrote in a recent note to investors that while “it took seven to eight quarters after the launch of the PlayStation2 for Sony to break even, it could take 15-16 quarters for the company to recoup its initial PS3 investment”.Because the new console has involved significantand PS3-dedicated research investment by many of the component manufacturers, Sony is understood to have less scope to force prices down at its suppliers.Games hardware has generally been treated as a loss-leader in each console’s early years, with the main profits being made on the software sales and royalties.But because of Sony’s hefty subsidy of the PS3, its economics appear fragile to some investors who say that the company could struggle to cut costs.By one analyst’s calculation, which assumes that Sony makes about $10 in revenues on each game whether produced by itself or a third party, 30 games must be sold per PS3 console – compared with eight for the PlayStation2 – to make up for the losses which Sony will incur over the next few years before the hardware itself achieves break-even.The recently-conducted dissections of the PS3 have uncovered a previously hidden goldmine for the many component makers – mainly Japanese and Taiwanese – which stand to gain from the PS3’s success.Yoshiyuki Kinoshita, a Merrill Lynch analyst, believes that a new cycle may have developed. Where previously electronic component makers supplying to the game console makers could not make good margins, the latest generation of machines will deliver a sharp boost to profits.The biggest components include Nvidia’s Reality Synthesiser costing $129, the IBM Cell processor costing $89, D-ram memory from Samsung at $48, and the Seagate hard drive at $54.The PS3 consumes eight times more electrical power than its predecessor and Delta Electronics of Taiwan has specifically designed the unit to cope.Similarly a unique heat piping system has been designed by Furukawa Electric to dissipate the extraordinary heat generated by the machine’s central processor.
190;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;US shoppers buying subsidised PlayStation3;;The thousands who queued outside stores across the US on Thursday night for the midnight launch of the Sony PlayStation 3, the most expensive of the next-generation consoles, will have a bargain on their hands, according to a new report.The PS3 costs $499 in its basic version, but its parts and manufacturing expenses are costing Sony $806 – a loss of $307 per machine, according to the research firm iSuppli.A $599 version with wi-fi connectivity and a larger hard drive is losing Sony $240 per unit.Both versions are already seen as costly compared to Microsoft’s Xbox 360, which has $299 and $399 consoles, and Nintendo’s Wii, launched this weekend at $250.But iSuppli says the PS3 provides more processing power and capability “than any consumer electronics device in history. Because of this, the PlayStation 3 is a great bargain”.Nevertheless, the substantial loss Sony is taking on the machine is far greater than that sustained by Microsoft when it subsidised the launch of its Xbox 360 a year ago. The $399 version contained parts worth $525 – a loss of $126 per unit.The console makers expect to reduce their losses on machines over the five to 10 year life cycle of their products as parts become cheaper, making break-even or a small profit possible. The bulk of their revenues come from selling or licensing game software for their platforms.The PS3 is the only console to include a high-definition DVD drive inside, with Sony pushing its Blu-Ray optical drive in a standards war with Toshiba’s HD-DVD version.Surprisingly, the Blu-Ray drive is not the most expensive part of the PS3, which iSuppli took apart to price each component.That honour goes to the Reality Synthesizer, a graphics chip made by Nvidia and costing $129. The Blu-Ray drive costs $125 and a revolutionary Cell processor from IBM is $89.“With the PS3, you are getting the performance of a supercomputer at the price of an entry-level PC,” said Andrew Rassweiller, iSuppli senior analyst.Sony’s loss on the console could be many of its buyers’ gain. Although genuine fans had queued to buy the PS3 at midnight there were others looking to turn a quick buck.More than 2,000 PS3s were already being listed for sale on eBay on Thursday, with one unit selling for nearly $3,000.The PS3 is guaranteed to sell out in stores due to production problems causing supply shortages. Around 400,000 units were expected to be available for the US launch.

PNC sank 4.4 per cent to $70.40.Cablevision Systems jumped 10.7 per cent to $26.50, after the Dolan family, which controls a majority of voting shares, offered to take the communications and media group private in a $19.2bn deal, including debt.Google rose 2 per cent to $429.00, after it signed deals with Sony BMG and Warner Music to stream music videos on its website.After the markets closed, Google also announced that it had bought online video service YouTube.Chipmakers were at the forefront of the tech rally. National Semiconductor rose 3.6 per cent to $24.04. Nvidia continued to climb, adding 6.4 per cent to $33.92. The chipmaker has gained more than 80 per cent since July amid bid speculation.Healthcare stocks sold off after UBS cut its rating on several pharmacy benefit managers from “buy” to “neutral”.UBS said lower prescription drug costs would decrease margins for the groups, which administer drug plans for employers and insurance groups. Express Scripts shed 6.7 per cent to $68.96, Caremark Rx tumbled 4.1 per cent to $51.19, and Medco Health Solutions dropped 2.4 per cent to $55.75.Steelmakers were in strong demand, pushing the S&P Steel Index to a three-month high. US Steel climbed 4.7 per cent to $63.39, while Nucor pushed up 3 per cent to $52.67.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent or 1.08 points 1,350.66. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent or 11.78 points at 2,311.77.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent or 7.60 points at 11,857.81.Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was its lowest in five weeks with 1.16bn shares changing hands.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said the thin holiday staffing on Wall Street was making it difficult to see trends in trading.“A lot of people are out today and taking a three-day weekend,” he said. “I’m not sure much of it means anything.”Mr Paulsen added that some comfort could be taken from the generally muted reaction of overseas markets to the North Korea nuclear test.Exchanges were in focus, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rising 6.3 per cent to $521.49, after news reports that it was exploring a possible tie-up with Deutsche Börse. Chicago Board of Trade dipped 3.3 per cent to $133.27 after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform”.

200;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;AMD to buy ATI for $5.4bn;;Advanced Micro Devices on Monday took its biggest gamble in its attempt to keep pace with its larger rival Intel, buying graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for $5.4bn in the second largest takeover in the semiconductor industry’s history.AMD has confined itself to building the central processing units (CPUs) of computers until now. The acquisition of ATI allows it to offer the accompanying logic and graphics chipsets in an own-brand “platform” approach that will match that of Intel.But it is buying ATI in the middle of a price war with Intel, at a time when it is committed to spending billions of dollars on expanding its manufacturing capacity and when its shares fell to a 52-week low of $17.41 on Monday.AMD said it would pay $4.2bn in cash and offer 57m AMD shares, which closed at $18.26 on Friday. This would mean it paying $20.47 for each ATI share, a 24 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday.AMD has obtained a $2.5bn loan commitment from Morgan Stanley to help finance the cash portion and has around $3bn in cash and short-term investments available.The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter is the biggest since Texas Instruments acquired Burr-Brown for around $6bn in 2000, according to the Wall Street Access research firm. It will create a company of 15,000 employees, with ATI’s top management team being integrated into that of AMD and its main Toronto facilities being maintained.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, told an analyst conference call he did not expect significant redundancies, although the elimination of overlaps would mean savings of $75m in 2007 and $125m in 2008.Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, said he believed the deal would be meaningfully accretive to earnings in 2008, before charges associated with the acquisition.The deal will mean major shifts in the industry. To date, AMD has worked with a range of chipset manufacturers to complement its microprocessors and relied on its Silicon Valley neighbour Nvidia and ATI to offer PC manufacturers best-of-breed graphics chipsets.AMD insisted on Monday that a relationship with Nvidia could still be maintained in some areas of its business. But the close competition between Nvidia and ATI in the graphics field, mirroring that of Intel and AMD in microprocessors, has taken on a new dynamic.Meanwhile, Intel has been a significant customer of ATI, using its chipsets in situations such as shortages of its own chips. It is highly unlikely to do so with ATI under the wing of its biggest rival.Dave Orton, ATI chief executive, said 30 to 40 per cent of revenues for its logic chips came from Intel in its last quarter and Mr Rivet said $80 to $100m a quarter in ATI revenues were Intel related.

202;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2006-07-24T20:51:51Z;High-definition benefits of AMD deal are clear;;Analysts may have difficulty processing the financial logic. But the changing digital landscape, in which smooth high-definition images are becoming as important as fast-opening software applications, means AMD’s takeover of ATI appears to make complete technological sense.For some time, there has been an intellectual debate in the industry on whether the graphics processing unit (GPU) is achieving primacy over the central processing unit (CPU).With graphics cards made by the dominant players Nvidia and ATI coming loaded with 256Mb of memory and capable of floating-point calculations 10 to 15 times faster than AMD and Intel CPU microprocessors, there is no doubting their superior power at delivering images to a computer or TV screen.But the CPU, as its name suggests, is still central to the basic workings of electronic devices and AMD on Monday made it clear the two would continue to co-exist doing their separate tasks, although it envisages one day combining them on a single chip.In the meantime, it will be mixing them in different strengths and combinations, and with other chipsets, to serve different markets.There will be general purpose, data centric, graphics centric and media centric products for business and consumer PCs, mobile users and living-room consumer electronics devices.ATI is supplying graphics chips for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii games consoles, as well as for digital television.Microsoft’s new Vista operating system requires much more powerful graphics to run its visually sophisticated interface, and handheld devices need more graphics muscle to handle 3D gaming and TV pictures.All these areas represent exciting opportunities for the new company, but its initial targets will be more prosaic.AMD has more than a 25 per cent share of the market for microprocessors in consumer desktop PCs and enterprise servers in its battle with Intel. It has less than 15 per cent of the market for notebook PCs and enterprise desktops.It says these latter markets are worth $16.7bn and represent major growth opportunities.Intel has excelled in offering business computer makers such as Dell an integrated set of its own chips – it is the largest maker of integrated graphics chips – that have enabled it to outpace AMD, which has gathered accompanying chips from an assortment of manufacturers.“This deal enhances our time-to-market capability in those product categories that require a lot of platform-level work,” Dirk Meyer, AMD president, told the Financial Times on Monday.“We can ensure the platform’s stability, and that’s hard to do in the enterprise.”Rob Enderle, analyst with the Enderle group, said in a blog note on Monday that becoming a “me too” vendor in those areas would not allow them to take much share from Intel. “They have to be better and one of the areas where Intel has been weak is in PC graphics. Both ATI and Nvidia have better graphics solutions than Intel and, by acquiring ATI, AMD gets to step ahead of Intel on system performance.”The competition was moving from a parts level to a platform level, he noted, and AMD’s Silicon Valley neighbour, Nvidia, was being left as the odd man out.AMD has relied more on Nvidia than ATI for accompanying chips in recent years, but Mr Meyer said it decided to buy ATI because it was a better cultural fit and had leadership in mobile and consumer electronics areas.It is also cheaper to buy than Nvidia, but AMD is still saddling itself with some serious debt.Standard & Poor’s Rating Services placed AMD’s B+ rating on Creditwatch with negative implications on Monday.Separately, an S&P chip analyst downgraded AMD from Strong Buy to Hold, noting the deal’s execution risk and debt burden.
203;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;AMD close to $5.5bn deal for ATI;;Advanced Micro Devices is near to buying the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for around $5.5bn, according to people close to the deal.Any agreement would represent a major gamble by AMD to put itself on a level footing with its bigger rival Intel, which makes its own graphics chips.The asking price suggests AMD would have to offer a substantial number of its own shares as part of the deal or take on debt. It had cash balances of $2.5bn at the end of June, but is spending billions on developing new chip plants, including $2.5bn in capital expenditure next year.An AMD spokeswoman said on Friday it did not comment on rumour or speculation. Its shares closed nearly 16 per cent lower at $18.26 after poor second-quarter results and rumours of the deal. ATI’s finished 6 per cent higher in Toronto at $18.77.The takeover, which could be announced in the next few days, could also be a blow to AMD’s Silicon Valley neighbour Nvidia, whose shares fell 7.5 per cent on Friday. AMD has combined its microprocessors with both Nvidia and ATI graphics chipsets, but may side in future with ATI’s products.At the same time, ATI has been providing third-party chipsets to Intel and could lose that business if it is bought by AMD.Analysts have long speculated that the bigger microprocessor companies could buy the graphics chipmakers, but the logic has never been compelling.Intel is already the biggest maker of graphics chips with the integrated chipsets it sells for computer motherboards. It is also in a cost-cutting mode and has just sold its division making chips for mobile phones.AMD has always reasoned it can offer best of breed graphics by choosing chipsets from either ATI or Nvidia. It has also sought to focus on microprocessors after spinning off its Spansion memory chip business last December.But it may feel it has to match Intel’s graphic abilities to compete with it in future in new markets such as the “digital home”.In its last quarter, 23 per cent of ATI’s total sales and 70 per cent of its operating income came from non-PC businesses, according to Merrill Lynch.It reported revenues of $653m for the quarter and earnings per share of 12 cents.
204;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2006-07-12T20:51:18Z;Wall St sells off on earnings and oil worries;;Wall Street turned sharply lower yesterday, depressed by continued nervousness over earnings reports, and higher oil prices.The fall was led by the Nasdaq, which sank after a regulatory fine for Microsoft triggered a sell-off across the technology sector.Losses deepened over the course of the afternoon, at one point pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 11,000.Microsoft was a millstone for the Nasdaq, after it received a fine of $280m from European regulators for not complying with a 2004 antitrust ruling. Its shares dropped 2 per cent to $22.64, extending its losses this year to 12.7 per cent.Most other technology stocks were dragged lower. Dell Computer lost 4.4 per cent to $22.38 after UBS cut its price target on the stock. Apple lost 4.8 per cent to $53.96, after an analyst said he expected Apple would warn that its earnings might be lower than forecast.Network Appliance, maker of data storage systems, continued to slide, losing 6.9 per cent to $28.60. It has shed 16 per cent in less than two weeks, in a fall aggravated by rival EMC’s warning earlier this week that profits would fall short of estimates.Semiconductors suffered worst. Having sparked Tuesday’s afternoon rally, the sector slipped again, and was the worst performer in the S&P 500 in the morning. Intel shed 4.2 per cent to $17.88, its worst day since January and Nvidia lost 4.8 per cent to $18.23. Sun Microsystems, however, bucked the technology trend, adding 2.6 per cent to $4.00.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent, or 13.92 points, at 1,258.60 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8 per cent, or 38.62 points, at 2,090.24.

Citigroup cut its price target on the stock by more than 20 per cent to $40 during the week, citing threats to Ebay from Google.The group also announced a management shake-up, changing senior executives in several of its divisions.Chipmaker PMC Sierra also came under pressure, after the departure of its chief financial officer. The shares fell 16.3 per cent to $7.75.Other chip stocks to suffer included Nvidia, which lost 9 per cent to $19.37 and Broadcom down 8.5 per cent to $27.75.Paul Mendelsohn chief market analyst at Windham Financial Services attributes the tech slump to increasing competition amongst chipmakers.“The price war that’s taking place in semiconductors is hurting the sector,” he said.Economic data out on Friday showed that the US economy created 121,000 jobs in June, fewer than had been expected. This sign of slowing economic growth was accompanied by higher than expected wage inflation data.“That number concerned me. We are not really increasing jobs at anywhere near full capacity,” said Mr Mendelsohn.“The increase in hourly earnings indicates pipeline inflation is out there, and it is accelerating with commodity prices.”By the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent or 8.60 points, a loss of 0.4 per cent on the week at 1265.48. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent or 25.03 points, leaving it 1.9 per cent lower for the week at 2,130.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent or 134.63 points lower on the day, down 0.5 per cent for the week at 11,090.67.3M was the biggest faller on the Dow after it said second quarter and full-year profits would come in below expectations.

208;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2006-03-06T17:01:09Z;James Altucher: Waiting for the Big One, in pyjamas;;"The other day my broker at [insert top three investment bank] called me to say Shanda Interactive was getting bought by Softbank for $25 a share. “It’s definite, man.” A week later, Shanda had a 30 per cent drop in revenues and the stock fell almost 20 per cent, down to $13 and change. Yesterday, a different broker at a different bank told me Nvidia had a huge chip malfunction with one of its shipments to Edom, its biggest distributor.My question is: “why do I know this?” Why, of all the people in the universe, am I getting the call about this privileged information? A truck loses a wheel on a dirt road in China, a bunch of chips fall to the ground, busted, and is now worthless. About 12,000 miles away, James Altucher gets the call 15 minutes later – “short this little baby!” In Tokyo, Masayoshi Son lets it slip to his shoeshine boy that he likes playing “Legend of Mir II” in his spare time and might buy the Chinese company that makes it. Who gets the call four minutes later? Me.And I’m not just talking about stock tips. We all know stock tips are mostly useless. But this feeling of “why am I here?” applies to other situations. A few months ago, I got a call about “a great deal”. Every deal has its story so I listened. “Big internet company from the 1990s. Auction site. Went private, then got bought, then got bought again. Now it’s going public in a reverse merger. Revenues kicking ass. We’re raising $75m so it can go public in a reverse merger. Goldman Sachs is investing in the deal. We have $65m hard-circled.
Can you help us find the final $10m?”In other words, this great internet company, which went public in the 1990s, soared to $300 a share before getting bought at $2, is going to destroy Ebay, and has Goldman Sachs and 10 other “big names” as investors. And I forgot to mention: “The guy that sold XYZ company to [big media company] for $500m is going to be the CEO.” So now all they need to conquer the world is . . . me.Or what about the company that has a new vodka sponsored by [insert popular reality TV star here] and has deals with every big alcohol distributor in the world, and now needs help finding the final $500k to close an impressive deal? There’s an investment banker super-pumped about the move who is now hanging out at the water cooler thinking of the only person in the world who can handle this serious challenge. That’s me, sitting in my pyjamas, watching soap operas at 10 in the morning with my three-year-old daughter.The reality is, of course, that those two deals can’t get done. And if they get done [actually, one of them did – they closed at $65m instead of the hoped for $75m] they are going to go bankrupt. Nobody is out to give me money for free. Nobody cares about me at all. Nobody wants to do me any favours. And nobody needs my help unless in the privacy of their office urinals they are staring at the ceramic wall, thinking, “damn, how the hell am I going to get this one done?”Once in a blue moon, a miracle happens, and someone who for some reason doesn’t know better, accidentally makes the call to me, and money results. So, consequently, I have to take every call, listen to every story, and ask myself the same question again and again: “Am I smoking crack?” It’s a sensible question to ask when someone wants to give me free money.Like the man who is being forced at gunpoint to allocate $15bn for “a major consortium of pension funds”. He calls me. “Can you handle a $500m allocation to your fund?” The answer is no. “Well, what about if we give you $25m a month, like clockwork?” So now, once again, I ask: “Am I smoking crack?”So I have to take the call. And I have to follow up. And send financial reports, network, make calls, attend meetings. And then follow up to those meetings: “It was great meeting you. Let’s work on those next steps.”Hence, a day, a week, a month of schedules fills up and my three-year-old has to watch Spanish soap operas all by herself. But, they say, “it will all be worth it”.And sometimes I forget to return a call and then I have to wonder – was that The One? The One, which the Prophets spoke of on the Day of my Birth? The call that was going to fulfil my descendants’ dream of financial security so they can focus on making the world a better place?Oh, Lord, I hope so, but thank You that at least I can use the material for a Financial Times column."
209;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Delays likely for Sony’s PlayStation 3;;Sony’s next-generation PlayStation 3 video game console might not appear in key markets this year and could cost the electronics giant $900 per unit to produce initially, according to Merrill Lynch analysts.Sony has indicated a Spring launch for its console in Japan and the industry is not expecting a North American launch until November. But Hitoshi Kuriyama of Merrill Lynch in Japan says there are reports that the PS3 could be delayed by between six and 12 months, meaning an autumn launch in Japan and a late 2006 or early 2007 launch in the US.Also, Merrill Lynch analysts in San Francisco have estimated that the initial bill of materials for PS3 could approach $900, falling to $320 by three years after launch.The implications are that Sony could have to decide to make a substantial loss on the PS3 through subsidies or risk low sales at the higher price and hand the advantage to Microsoft – first to market with its Xbox 360 next-generation console.Delays will also have an impact on revenues for companies supplying components for the PS3 such as Nvidia, which is making the graphics chip, as well as games publishers.Merrill Lynch says the revolutionary multi-core Cell processor, developed with IBM and Toshiba, at the heart of the console appears to be difficult and expensive to manufacture, costing at least $230 per unit initially. The Blu-Ray DVD drive, which is a new Sony standard in competition with Toshiba’s HD-DVD, will cost an estimated $350. With expensive memory, graphics and other components the total cost could be $900 per unit in 2006.As a result, the analysts suggest that Sony could limit supplies of the PS3 this year to 2m-3m in order to reduce such losses. Costs will begin to fall in 2007 and the parts should cost only about $320 three years after launch.Sony is likely to reveal more on its plans for the console at the Game Developers Conference in San Jose in March and the E3 video games show in Los Angeles in May.
210;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2006-02-17T22:03:52Z;Rising crude puts lid on Wall St gains;;"Wall Street retreated on Friday as rising crude prices and disappointing guidance from technology bellwether Dell put a lid on the market’s recent upward momentum.Sentiment took a knock in morning trading after crude prices jumped more than $1. Weak crude prices had helped pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a fresh four-and-a-half year high earlier this week. But oil rallied yesterday after concerns over supply disruptions were rekindled by new turmoil in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer.Along with energy prices, Dell’s fourth-quarter results also weighed on the market. Although quarterly revenue and net income both saw double-digit growth, shares in the computer maker fell after it said current-quarter growth would be lower than market estimates.Banc of America Securities cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, saying continued pressure on operating profit margins would keep the stock rangebound. Dell shares dropped 4.9 per cent to $30.38 yesterday, although for the week, the stock was only down 4.4 per cent.Dell’s weakness pulled the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5 per cent to 2,282.36, while the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,287.24 and the Dow dipped 0.1 per cent to 11,115.32.Nonetheless, Wall Street ended the week with solid gains, with the Dow up
1.8 per cent, the S&P 1.6 per cent higher and the Nasdaq up 0.9 per cent.Stocks have steadily advanced this week on hopes that the strength seen in the US economy would outlast the Federal Reserve’s interest rate tightening cycle.“The data that came in this week were strong but not completely FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] unfriendly,” said Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research.“They showed that the economy would continue growing after the Fed stops its interest rate hikes but they were not so strong that the Fed would feel the need to continue intervening.”Technology stocks were a key focus this week, with Hewlett-Packard’s strong performance providing a sharp contrast to Dell’s worsening fortunes.HP shares surged 8.1 per cent over the five sessions to $34.07 after it delivered a stronger-than-expected set of quarterly results. The computer maker beat both revenue and earnings forecasts, suggesting that its huge and controversial merger with rival Compaq was paying off.The week also saw a number of large deals taking place, including Merrill Lynch’s $9.5bn deal with fund manager BlackRock.Merrill Lynch shares rose 3.8 per cent on the week to $75.56 after announcing the deal to acquire a 49.8 per cent stake in BlackRock to combine their investment management units. The combined unit would continue to trade under the BlackRock name and have around $1,000bn in assets under management.BlackRock, meanwhile, soared 11.5 per cent to end the week at $146.58 in spite of being downgraded by Morgan Stanley.Meanwhile, reports that corporate raider Carl Icahn had given up on plans to take control of Time Warner drove shares in the media conglomerate down 2.9 per cent to $17.78.Still on the deals front, Keyspan jumped 12.3 per cent to $40.41 to become the top gainer on the S&P following rumours that the biggest natural gas seller in the US northeast could be put up for sale at a price of $6.5bn.Boston Scientific was the second-best performer on the S&P. It shares gained 11.8 per cent to $24.45 on news that finance chief Lawrence Best had bought up 200,000 shares of the company for $4.5m.UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley, in a research note, said the purchase was “a positive sign on the value of the stock”.Best’s purchase followed a sharp fall in Boston’s share price in recent weeks as investors expressed reservations over the group’s pending $27bn acquisition of rival medical device maker Guidant.Other strong performers included Eastman Kodak, which ended the week
6.9 per cent higher at $26.27 after Legg Mason Capital Management revealed that it had built up a 25 per cent stake.Chipmaker Nvidia was another stand out, climbing 8.1 per cent to $47.47 after it beat market forecasts with its fourth-quarter profit.Consumer electronics retailer Radioshack was less fortunate, slumping 11.8 per cent to $19.08 as its earnings disappoint."

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
212;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2005-11-29T21:34:38Z;Wall St loses gains as rate fears re-emerge;;Wall Street failed to muster a convincing rally on Tuesday despite lower crude prices and a raft of positive economic data.In the end, news of stronger-than-expected consumer confidence, a jump in demand for durable goods and record new home sales served mainly to raise fears of inflation. After making sharp gains in morning trading, the main indices pulled back on concerns that the Fed would continue its interest rate hikes in face an overly robust economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually flat, down 2.40 points at 10,888.32, as was the broader S&P 500, up .05 points at 1,257.51. The Nasdaq Composite index, dragged down by losses in Google, fell 0.3 per cent, or 6.66 points to 2,232.71.“Modest is best for the market at the moment,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards and Sons. “The market is at the point where economic data that is good makes the bond and equities market nervous about what the Fed is going to do to interest rates. You want growth but modest non-inflationary growth.”Google was back in focus, albeit for a different reason. After soaring past $427 a share earlier in the week, its shares fell 4.7 per cent, or almost $20, to $403.54. The retreat came after an analyst did the unthinkable and downgraded the stock.Apple Computer, another stock which has seen intense demand this year, also went into reverse. The company, which has been bid up by investors in recent days on expectations of strong sales for its iPod nano music player, drop 2.2 per cent to $68.10.Dell and Oracle, both of which have been struggling in recent weeks, saw a reversal of fortunes. The former rose 0.7 per cent to $30.42 while the latter gained 1.5 per cent to $12.73.On the corporate front, Calpine plunged 56.8 per cent to $0.54 after the troubled power producer announced the departures of Peter Cartwright, its founder, and chief financial officer Robert Kelly. The fall came amid rumours that Mr Cartwright would not have left unless Calpine was preparing to file for bankruptcy.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia lost 6.3 per cent to $35.48 after both Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan cut their ratings on the stock, with the latter citing valuation concerns.“We believe that Nvidia stock, which has doubled over the past year and trades near its 52-week high of approximately $38, is fairly valued,” the broker said in a research note.Merck staged a modest recovery, rising 1.6 per cent to $30.02 after its shares lost more than $3bn of its market value in the previous session.News of record new homes sales failed to lift the housing sector. The Philadelphia Housing Index finished almost unchanged, up 0.04 per cent, after falling 2.8 per cent the day before. Pultes Homes rose 0.7 per cent to $41.85 while Toll Brothers lost another 1.6 per cent at $34.44.US Steel, once a Dow component, gained 7.7 per cent to $45.78 following news that it had appointed a new chairman.
213;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2005-11-10T22:25:36Z;Demand for Treasuries sparks Wall Street rally;;Stocks on Wall Street mounted a strong recovery on Thursday after strong foreign demand in a US Treasury auction – interpreted by traders as a sign of growing global confidence in US assets – sparked a late broad-based rally.A string of positive economic data, including stronger consumer confidence and a sharp drop in crude prices, offset more worying developments, such as a larger-than-expected September trade deficit and further bad news from the embattled auto sector.“This just shows how long of an attention span the market has,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., of the turnabout. “But don’t expect it to last. It is still too early to speak of a year-end rally.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average shrugged off early losses to close up 0.9 per cent at 10,640.10, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent to 1,230.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.0 per cent at 2,196.68.Homebuilders and airline companies led the charge. The Philadephia Homebuilding Index recouped much of its losses from earlier this week, gaining 2.6 per cent while the airline sub-index rose 4.2 per cent, boosted by lower oil prices.Optimism that lower fuel costs would also boost consumer spending pushed retailers higher. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, moved up 1.7 per cent to $49.04 while its smaller rival Target jumped 4.1 per cent to $58.85, after it reported a 34 per cent increase in third-quarter profit from the previous year.Other gainers in the retail sector included Best Buy, up 2 per cent to $47.48 and Urban Outfitters, which rose 4.4 per cent to $31.48 on the backs of strong third quarter figures.The auto sector took another day of beating, as General Motors hit a new 13-year low. Shares, which have lost almost 40 per cent of its value since the year’s start, fell another 4.6 per cent to $23.51, its lowest point since 1992. It suffered from renewed selling after it had to restate its earnings for 2001 and for the second quarter of this year, following accounting errors.The sector was further weighed by losses in Visteon, which plunged another 9.8 per cent to $5.99 after the beleaguered auto parts maker identified its own accounting problems.On the Nasdaq, investors initally appeared disinclined to bid up Intel, despite the giant chip maker’s offer to increase its dividend and make a $25bn stock buyback, but by the close its shares had gained 1.8 per cent to $25.24.Meanwhile, Cisco, another key bellwether tech stock, was off 3.4 per cent off at $17.15. After Wednesday’s bell, the company reported a 7.1 per cent drop in earnings for its fiscal first quarter.JDS Uniphase, which makes fibre-optical networks equipment, lost 4.3 per cent to $2.24 on profit-taking in spite of a rosy fourth quarter earnings outlook. Nvidia fell 3.7 per cent to $33.49 on profit-taking, despite Morgan Stanley raising its target price after the chip maker reported a 50 per cent rise in third quarter profit.Yahoo gained 2.5 per cent to trade at $38.69 after saying it would not be bidding for AOL, the unit of Time Warner, which barely moved, up 5 cents at $17.71.On the earnings front, weak third quarter earnings pushed food retailer Whole Foods Market, down 4.85 per cent at $139.66. The organic food retailer said quarterly profit plummeted 68 per cent from the year before.
214;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2005-08-11T22:39:02Z;Nvidia pushes profits higher;;Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, signalled it was fighting back against its biggest rival ATI, reporting second-quarter profits nearly 15 times higher than a year earlier.Nvidia said net income to July 31 was $74.8m, or 41 cents a share, compared with $5.1m and 3 cents in the previous year. Sales of $574.8m grew 26 per cent from $456.1m.Analysts had expected profits of only 34 cents a share but sales of $585.4m, according to Thomson Financial.Silicon Valley-based Nvidia and Canada's ATI divide up the market for specialised graphics cards that plug into the motherboards of computers. Intel is a major rival in chips integrated directly on to the motherboard.A year ago, Nvidia had a 50 per cent market share for the standalone cards, compared to ATI's 46 per cent, according to Mercury Research. It was down to 41 per cent, with ATI on 56 per cent, in the second quarter.But ATI has recently missed forecasts and suffered inventory build-ups as well as production problems with its latest chips, while Nvidia has successfully launched high-end chipsets.Nvidia said it had seen record revenues for its media and communications processors that offset declines in Wireless Media Processors.Microsoft has switched from Nvidia to ATI for its next-generation Xbox 360 games console, due in November, and Nvidia said there would be no more shipments for the existing Xbox in the third quarter.This left it needing to replace the $70m in second-quarter Xbox sales to hold revenues flat in the third. But with a much better quarter expected for PC sales in the back-to-school period and a return to growth for wireless media processors: “We believe we have a good chance to offset the lost Xbox revenue and have flat to slightly up revenues,” said Marvin Burkett, chief financial officer.
215;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Nvidia ends shipments of chips for Xbox;;Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, said on Thursday it was ending shipments of chips for Microsoft's Xbox game console in the current quarter as what was once one of its biggest customers moved on to its next-generation machine.Microsoft is expected to release the Xbox 360 in November, featuring a graphics chip from rival ATI. Microsoft had informed Nvidia it would not take any more product after Nvidia's second quarter, ending August 1.The news was a clear indication that Microsoft was cutting off production of the old Xbox and of the imminent release of its successor. In contrast, Sony is still selling its original PlayStation console several years after the launch of the PS2.Nvidia's inclusion in the original Xbox, launched in 2001, had been a major boost for the Silicon Valley company, but other areas of its business have since grown and Microsoft is no longer one of its top-ten customers.An Nvidia chip will feature in the PlayStation 3, expected next year, and the company said revenues from that would begin to flow in after the technology licensing started in the third quarter.The graphics company reported record sales in its first quarter ending May 1 of $583.8m, up 24 per cent on a year earlier. Net profits were $64.4m or 36 cents per diluted share, compared to $21.3m or 12 cents a year earlier.Analysts had expected sales of $579.7m and earnings of 28 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.Nvidia said there had been 20 per cent growth in chip sales for high-end PCs and its next-generation GPU (graphics processing unit) was set to be unveiled at the E3 computer games trade show next week.The company said it had been forced to write off handheld inventory after Motorola cut its orders for chips for 3G phones as demand failed to meet expectations.Nvidia expected the handheld segment to return to growth in the second half. It was bullish on the current quarter, usually the seasonally slowest with sales down 5 to 10 per cent on the previous quarter. Instead, Nvidia forecast sales would be flat to slightly up.Nvidia shares rose nearly 9 per cent in after-hours trading to $24.75 on the news.
216;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2005-02-06T17:12:17Z;Nvidia comes back into focus;;"Wired magazine is to technology what Cosmopolitan is to fashion. So when Jen-Hsun Huang featured on the cover of Wired in July 2002, it seemed to confirm that the young entrepreneur had joined the industry's elite. Nvidia, the semiconductor company he co-founded, had delivered four consecutive years of triple-digit growth. Wired was not alone in wondering, as its headline asked, whether the graphics chip company could be ""The Next Intel?""With hindsight, the timing could hardly have been worse. If 2001 had been a fairytale year for Mr Huang, 2002 turned into a horror story. New products were delivered late and to mixed reviews. Market share began sliding.The company's stock price, which peaked at $70 in January 2002, slid to $7 by October. Its market value fell from $11bn to $1bn in that period - the kind of reversal from which technology companies rarely bounce back.Against all odds, however, Nvidia is on the rebound. Its secret? A willingness to change and an absolute determination to learn from experience.At 41, Mr Huang is already a battle-hardened chief executive. He says: ""If there is one thing that all great companies have in common, it has got to be that they admit to their mistakes.""While this is probably true, the semiconductor industry is almost uniquely unforgiving. Every 18 months or so, chipmakers double the number of transistors - the on/off switches that are the building blocks of the circuits etched on to the surface of silicon chips. This allows the design of increasingly powerful and complex products.The result is that today's premium-priced, cutting-edge chips are tomorrow's bargain-basement commodities. Companies that make mistakes either in manufacturing or design are punished severly. Nvidia slipped on both counts.Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, former engineers at Sun Microsystems. The Taiwan-born and US-educated Mr Huang was then a rising star at chipmaker LSI Logic, which did contract manufacturing for Sun.When the older men invited him to join their new venture as chief executive, he agreed, adding his manufacturing and business skills to their backgrounds in chip design and computer graphics. He was 29.At that time, the PC graphics market was in its infancy. Personal computers were used mainly for spreadsheets and word processing. Microprocessors, the central brains of computers, handled what little graphics processing was required.But Nvidia saw that increasingly sophisticated video games and other multimedia applications would require of a new class of specialised graphics chips.They were not alone in this conviction. The 1990s witnessed a struggle for survival among more than 20 companies making PC graphics chips. At first it seemed as if Nvidia would be among the casualties. Its first product, the NV1, was a flop.""The NV1 was an integrated chip that handled everything - audio, video, joystick controls,"" recalls Mr Malachowsky. ""The trouble was that PC makers at that time had an audio guy, a video guy and a joystick guy, each responsible for buying components. We made a great product that didn't match the business model of our customers.""Mr Malachowsky and his engineers went back to the drawing board. Fortunately, their second attempt made it to market before the company ran out of money. In 1997, Nvidia launched its Riva 128 PC graphics chip to rave reviews.For the next five years, Mr Huang and his team hardly put a foot wrong. Each generation of Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, set new standards for colour rendition, detail and realism. The acquisition in late 2000 of 3dfx, once a potent rival, emphasised Nvidia's supremacy. In 2001 came a deal with Microsoft to supply GPUs for its Xbox games console. Only ATI, the Canadian chipmaker with a strong franchise in low-power GPUs used in notebook computers, seemed able to stay the pace.Nvidia's annus horribilis began in February 2002 with news that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its accounting. Things went from bad to worse when the company had to go to arbitration to solve a pricing dispute with Microsoft over Xbox chips. Most seriously of all, Nvidia's most ambitious GPU to date - the NV30 - was delivered late and to mixed reviews from gamers, the most discerning consumers.So, what went wrong? Mr Huang, softly spoken and reflective, is happy to answer the question: ""There are only so many risks you can take at any one time without it turning out badly. We bit off too much.""To be sure, the NV30 was an ambitious design, incorporating 130m transistors on a single chip, up from 60m for its predecessor, which had been launched only a year earlier. To squeeze so many transistors on the chip, it had to be made using the very latest processes. TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker contracted to produce the NV30, struggled to master the technology.At the same time, Mr Huang believes the architecture of the NV30 was flawed. Crucially, while most of the design was ambitious, the architecture employed only four pixel pipelines, the same number as the previous generation. Since the number of pipelines helps dictate how fast the chip can operate, this contributed to the less-than-stellar performance of the product.The CEO draws two lessons from this. The first is technical: when it comes to graphics processing, more pixel pipelines is always better. The second is organisational: the small teams of three or four engineers that designed the core architecture of earlier chips were simply not up to the task of bringing such large, complex products to fruition. ""Our project teams now include 30 to 40 people from all different disciplines,"" he says.With larger project teams has come greater emphasis on hierarchy and process. The acquisition of 3dfx was a moment of truth, says Mr Malachowsky. The deal added 100 engineers to his 300-strong hardware team. But when he came to integrate the new arrivals, he realised that information about Nvidia's practices and design approach was not available. He says: ""We had a really strong [development] process but it lived in the heads of our engineers. Our documentation was a mess. Within a week of their arrival I got passionate about documentation.""For an organisation that had hitherto relied on engineering ""superstars"" to make sure projects were delivered, the move to a more process-oriented management style came as a shock. The hope, says Mr Malachowsky, is that ""process doesn't have to mean bureaucracy"".It is too early to know whether these steps will be enough for Nvidia to regain its momentum. While the contract for the next- generation Xbox has gone to ATI, Mr Huang in December unveiled an agreement with Sony to jointly develop graphics processors for the PlayStation 3, expected to be launched next year.Meanwhile, Nvidia's latest generation of PC graphics chips, the NV40 launched last year, was delivered on time to positive reviews from the gaming cognoscenti. Some of the market share ceded to ATI in 2003 has been clawed back.Mr Malachowsky says: ""When we look back in 10 years' time, we will see that the best thing that ever happened to us was that we stumbled."" With the stock price stalled at about $20 (£10), investors will be hoping he is right.For other articles in the corporate turnround series click here"
217;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2004-12-07T19:05:49Z;Nvidia to provide PlayStation graphics;;Nvidia, a video chip maker, is to provide the graphics engine for Sony's next-generation PlayStation.Nvidia shares rose more than 8 per cent on the news as analysts forecast the company could earn more than $100m a year in royalties for the inclusion of its graphics processing unit (GPU) in the best-selling console.Nvidia received a similar boost when it was chosen to provide the graphics chip for the Microsoft Xbox. Xbox sales were responsible for about 15 per cent of revenues in its last fiscal year.But Nvidia has lost out to ATI Technologies, its fiercest competitor, with Microsoft choosing ATI for the graphics engine in its next-generation console.The Xbox 2 is expected to be launched in late 2005, followed by the PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2006.In a joint announcement in Tokyo and Santa Clara, California, Sony and Nvidia said they were developing systems involving a custom GPU based on Nvidia's GeForce processor and Sony's Cell CPU a central processing unit being developed with Toshiba and IBM.?The combination of the revolutionary Cell processor and Nvidia's graphics technologies will enable the creation of breathtaking imagery,? said Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's chief executive. The companies said it was under a multi-year royalty-bearing agreement with the GPU as the base for a range of applications and included in other Sony products.Ken Kutaragi, Sony Computer Entertainment chief executive, said: ?In the future, the experience of computer entertainment systems and broadband-ready PCs will be fused together to generate and transfer multi-streams of rich content simultaneously.?The new processor will be manufactured at Sony's Nagasaki chip factory and a facility owned with Toshiba.
218;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2004-12-07T07:07:29Z;Just the job 07.12.04;;Darryl Still, Head of Developer Relations, NVIDIASo what do you do all day?Do you get a standard reply to this? I suppose a typical day for me would be working with developers and buyers in the gaming sector. There are two sides, really. The first is to ensure with developers that the software they are developing works with the hardware and that the general public is buying. The other is to work to make sure that the people who have our hardware know about the software titles that are good for them to buy.How long have you been doing this?I’ve been doing this job for two years, but I’ve been in computer games for 20 years. Well, I did leave it for three years, but then they came and tracked me down and dragged me back into it.Are developers nice to work with?My experience is that they are. I have to work very closely with developers, because the people who have paid money for our graphics card want to be sure that they are getting the best experience out of it that they want, and that means playing the best games. But the great thing about developers is that they are usually great gaming enthusiasts themselves, so they love talking about this kind of thing, and they have a real commitment to making the games as good as they can be.Is this any kind of job for a grown-up person?No, absolutely not. That’s probably why I enjoy it so much.What’s your favourite game?I really like playing the Championship Manager series. It’s about being a football manager, and I actually manage a boys’ football team, so that might be why I like it so much. I also like The Sims and Sims 2. I tend to prefer management strategy game playing, over arcade game playing.What would you be doing if you weren’t doing this?I would hope that I would be playing a lot more cricket and watching a lot more football. But I would probably have to have set up my own company because I don’t think anyone else would have me to work for them.fiona.harvey@ft.com
219;NVDA;Nvidia Corp;2004-10-19T06:32:28Z;Is extra intelligence a dumb plan?;;"For subscribers, the mobile phone that impersonates a portable TV set or an instant news service could be gimmick or gold dust. Mobile phone operators are hoping for the latter. The success of so-called “smart phones” - tiny computers which can be used to make voice calls - is likely to prove critical to their efforts to raise the average monthly revenue per subscriber (arpu) from its present level of about £24 in the UK to a figure which will rapidly recoup their investment in 3G phone licences.Smart phones, of which about 25m are expected to be sold this year worldwide compared with 600m conventional GSM handsets, are the key to exploiting the full potential of the 3G networks. The bit that gives them their intelligence, the operating system, comes from a variety of manufacturers. Symbian is market leader with 15m phones already in use, but Microsoft, Qualcomm and various companies offering Linux are also in the frame. The world’s largest chipmaker Intel, Nokia and Symbian have in the past four weeks agreed to work together to create standard chip sets for smart phones.To judge from the wealth of software and hardware now on offer to complement the first models such as Sony Ericsson’s Symbian powered P910, smart phones could soon have more functions than there are blades on a Swiss Army knife. Operators, however, are engaged in a deadly guessing game: which are the applications which will tempt users to spend a little more each month, so jacking up that all-important arpu.And there are concerns, amply illustrated in a recent Capgemini study, that while phone manufacturers add complexity to compete with each other, users simply want a cheap phone that works well and reliably. So what do you want your phone to be today?MOBILE PUBLISHER - MACROMEDIAFlash Lite is Macromedia’s mobile take on its well-known Flash technology for websites - it’s what makes text swirl across the screen. The Lite version, loaded into the handset, provides much the same effect. It’s already being used by NTT DoCoMo and T Mobile.Now Macromedia is launching an information service called Flash Cast. Content providers will use its authoring tools to develop multimedia content. Operators will offer the service - it could include, for example, world news, horoscopes and the latest football scores.Subscribers will subscribe for the channels they want to see - the direct comparison is with pay-TV. Conventional WAP services are stuck in the dark ages by comparison.YOUR LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHIC - SHOP SCALADOYou may already have a camera built into your phone, but with software from the Swedish company Scalado, designed to create, edit and manage high resolution images (up to three megapixels), you can also have a mobile photoprocessing studio.Pierre Elzouki, Scalado’s business development manager, points out that even the best phones are short of memory and image-processing power, and so phone pictures are rarely of high quality. Scalado’s software “engine”, which can be downloaded to the phone, takes over image management, reducing, it claims, the amount of memory required by a factor of 50 while improving the speed of image manipulation by up to 10 times - eye candy for phone makers who want to offer quality photography as a selling point.The software allows you to play with the images in a variety ways, adding the look of an oil painting or creating the kind of illusion made by distorting mirrors.THE CINEMA IN YOUR POCKET - NVIDIAA new silicon chip devised by Nvidia, the US company behind the image processing chips in many PCs and games consoles, will make it possible to view movies on your phone.The new chip, catchily named the GoForce 3D 4500, is the company’s first move into 3D imaging on hand-held devices. Essentially it relieves the phone processor chip of the burden of working out how to display 3D moving images on the screen, allowing very fast processing. Prototypes are capable of playing movies with remarkable fidelity.A key feature of the chip is a mechanism which conserves battery life by turning off power to parts which are not being used. Nvidia chief executive Jen-Hsun Huang says: “It consumes almost no power. The hand-held revolution is really happening.”Nvidia expects to announce deals with smart phone manufacturers shortly.A GLOBAL NAVIGATOR - TELMAPThe phone as navigational aid is an obvious application, already exploited by companies such as Webraska of France and PTV of Germany. A comparative newcomer to the mobile phone field is Telmap, an Israeli company with expertise in digital mapping. It provides directions and routes using a combination of diagrammatic maps on the screen of the phone, together with voice instructions and text. It can be installed in a car, but it can also be used on the street by pedestrians.A key element is the company’s data compression technology which enables maps and directions to be downloaded rapidly to the phone from Telmap’s computers in Israel, the US and the UK. The company has agreements with a range of partners including Navteq, Mapit and MapData Sciences who provide the geographic data; the system includes a worldwide database of restaurants, hotels, theatres and cinemas and places of interest.AN ELECTRONIC WALLET - VIVOThe UK may be moving towards “chip and PIN”, but ViVO Tech, a Silicon Valley group, anticipates there will be market segments where its “contactless technology” will be of value. Vivo customers will simply wave their phones near a special reader to make a payment. “People prefer to wave their phones over the reader than to point at it,” says Jorge Fernandez, ViVO chief executive.All the major card companies are testing the system - a collaboration between the US company and Philips - with Mastercard likely to be the first to deploy it on a large scale. A key point is that the reader is compatible with most POS systems, so retailers should not have to upgrade their terminals."
