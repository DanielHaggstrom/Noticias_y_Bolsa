It will vote against nomination committee chairmen at any company in the S&P 500 index that still has an all-male board from 2017 onwards.Clare Payn, head of corporate governance for North America at the UK fund house, said: “We feel there really should not be any all-male boards at this stage, as investors have been talking about this for so many years.”According to S&P Dow Jones, the index provider, four S&P 500 companies still have an all-male board: Coty, the beauty products manufacturer; Dentsply Sirona, the dental equipment company; PayChex, a provider of human resources services; and TransDigm Group, the manufacturer of parts for commercial and military aircraft.Another 177 companies in the S&P 1500 index, and 18 companies in the MSCI USA index of America’s 622 biggest businesses, have no female directors. Join us on April 19 for a conversation about women in the corporate worldLGIM’s stance goes further than most of its competitors. Several of the world’s largest fund companies, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity and Aberdeen, are pressing for greater gender diversity on boards, but have not committed to voting against directors at companies with all-male boardrooms.Helena Morrissey, a leading campaigner for gender equality in the workplace, urged other investors to harden their approach to the remaining companies lacking female directors.Ms Morrissey, who will become head of personal investing at LGIM next month after leaving Newton, the investment boutique, earlier this year, said she felt “exasperated” by the lack of progress on board diversity in the US.She said: “If a company doesn’t change [its board structure], then [investors] ultimately should vote against at least the chair of the nomination committee. It is bizarre that you would not [apply a tougher voting policy]. It is a failure.”A spokesperson for PayChex said a female director had recently resigned, and that a “search is actively under way for her successor”, while Coty said it planned to add a woman to its board before July. A spokesperson for Dentsply Sirona said: “We see [diversity] as a priority in future board member selection.” TransDigm did not respond to requests for comment.Investors are concerned about the lack of female directors in many of the world’s largest economies. Numerous academic studies have suggested companies with diverse boardrooms perform better, are less prone to scandal, and avoid groupthink.Women account for 20 per cent of directorships in the US, compared with 25 per cent in the UK and Australia, and more than 35 per cent in France and Norway, according to figures from MSCI, the data provider.Last week Hermes EOS, an influential adviser to large investors, urged Rio Tinto shareholders to vote against the re-election of the Anglo-Australian mining company’s chairman at its annual general meeting because of slow progress in improving the diversity of its board.LGIM decided to vote against all-male boards at Britain’s largest companies in 2015, and extended that policy to include FTSE 250 companies last year. Aviva Investors, the London-headquartered asset manager, also decided to vote against all-male boardrooms in the UK in 2014.Since these voting positions were adopted, a number of UK-listed companies, including Glencore, the mining company, Jimmy Choo, the luxury shoemaker, and JD Sports, the retailer, have appointed female board members.Abigail Herron, head of responsible investment at Aviva Investors, said the fund house plans to extend its UK voting policy to companies with all-male boards in North America, Europe and Japan.She said: “Having a voting policy against all-male boards is a very useful tool. It is such a powerful way to drive change.”Ms Payn added: “Of course it would be helpful if other [investors] took a tougher stance on all-male boards. I will not sit here and tell them how they should vote, but if we collectively came together, that would push companies even further.”ConvaTec, the UK provider of healthcare products that floated last October, is the only company in the FTSE 100 without a female board member.The number of companies in the FTSE 250 without a woman on their board has more than halved since 2015, to nine. The remaining companies with all-male boardrooms include Euromoney Institutional Investor, the financial publishing business; MetroBank, the challenger bank; and Centamin, the gold miner. "
1;TDG;Transdigm Group Inc;2009-10-05T14:51:38Z;Dividend deal marks recovery in credit markets;;A unique type of debt sale re-emerged last week, raising eyebrows about just how far and how fast the credit markets have snapped back from last year’s lockdown.A unit of TransDigm Group, the Ohio-based manufacturer of parts for commercial and military aircrafts, sold $425m of junk bonds with most of the proceeds to pay a special cash dividend to its stockholders and to make cash dividend equivalent payments to certain options holders.Such transactions, known as dividend deals, are common in bull markets, particularly for companies with private equity sponsors, but they have been scarce in the past year.After the excesses of the credit boom, financial officers and investors have focused on repairing balance sheets and reducing debt rather than paying out cash to shareholders, let alone borrowed cash.“These deals explicitly ask bondholders to accept greater credit risk through the form of higher leverage for the benefit of equity holders,” analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a recent research report. “Such transactions were the hallmark of an earlier credit era and their return is a notable sign of the complete return of credit markets to pre-Lehman functioning and beyond.”The TransDigm deal comes amid a dramatic rebound for junk bonds, reversing last year’s flight to quality that led to a record loss for this type of debt. With official rates near zero and signs of an economic recovery, investors this year have poured $26bn into mutual funds that invest in the debt of companies with ratings below investment grade, according to Lipper FMI.Low-rated companies have been able to sell more than $100bn of debt, according to Dealogic, in some cases obtaining the breathing room to avoid default. The total return for junk bonds year to date is 48 per cent, a Merrill index shows.“It was inevitable that issuers would return to doing dividend deals sooner or later, but this is sooner than most observers would have expected,” said Martin Fridson, CEO of Fridson Investment Advisors.TransDigm’s finances can withstand the additional debt and a large pipeline of other dividend deals is not building now, observers said. But more such deals could surface if the market remains strong, giving some investors pause. “It puts me back on my heels,” said Dan Fuss, vice-chairman at Loomis Sayles. “Dividend deals make me more cautious about the high-yield sector.”Officials for TransDigm and Credit Suisse, which was lead manager on the deal, declined to comment. TransDigm’s largest shareholder, Berkshire Partners, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
2;TDG;Transdigm Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
