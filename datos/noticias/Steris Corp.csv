Such equipment would have competed with gamma ray technology sold by Steris.Martin Brunninger, analyst at Jefferies, said it was a “rare loss for the FTC, against the odds” — but added he felt it was the correct decision.25%Steris says the shift in domicile to the UK would reduce its effective tax rate to this by 2016, from 31.3% currently“We were of the view that the FTC didn’t have a leg to stand on. But the clumsy performance from Synergy at the court hearing led us and many investors to believe that the transaction was broken,” he said.Mr Brunninger predicted “significant growth” for the merged group.The cash-and-shares deal will deliver a windfall for Synergy chief executive Richard Steeves, who founded the business in 1991 and still owns a 3 per cent stake.The company has benefited from rising demand for sterilisation equipment to fight hospital superbugs, such as MRSA and clostridium difficile. It is a big supplier to Britain’s National Health Service and has expanded globally.Steris has said the shift in domicile to the UK would reduce its effective tax rate from 31.3 per cent to about 25 per cent by 2016 but insisted the main reasons for the deal were strategic.Shares in Synergy were up 43 per cent at £22.64 on Friday afternoon, valuing the company at £1.3bn. Steris stock gained almost 7 per cent to $68.01 after the court ruling late on Thursday.
1;STE;Steris Corp;2015-06-15T09:03:47Z;US companies regain their appetite for tax inversion deals;Push for deals increases in spite of White House crackdown on controversial foreign takeovers;US companies have regained their appetite for controversial foreign takeovers that allow them to move overseas and escape US taxes, in spite of a White House crackdown to restrict so-called tax inversions last year.According to several senior corporate advisers in the US and Europe, demand for such deals has picked up significantly in recent months and set the expectation that more transactions will be announced this year.The largest attempted tax inversion in more than a year was revealed last week when it emerged that Monsanto, the US agribusiness company, had structured its unsolicited $45bn takeover of Switzerland’s Syngenta as an inversion that would allow it to move its domicile to the UK, where corporate tax rates are lower. Syngenta has refused to engage with Monsanto and rebuffed its takeover approaches so far.The desire for inversion deals comes amid feverish deal activity led by the US, as companies look to use cheap debt and high share prices to squeeze every possible synergy, including tax benefits, out of potential takeovers.But the attempted inversions fly in the face of the US government, which moved last year to reduce the attractiveness of these deals after a flurry of transactions in 2014. US President Barack Obama has labelled the practice “unpatriotic”.The US Treasury took specific actions in September designed to limit the benefits of inversions after at least 15 US companies struck such transactions last year. A number of others, including drugmakers Pfizer and AbbVie, launched ultimately failed bids at tax inversion deals.“For some companies considering mergers, today’s action will mean that inversions no longer make economic sense,” the Treasury said at the time.The measures were designed to prevent an inverted US company from using various structures to access its deferred overseas earnings without paying US taxes. The Treasury also homed in on transactions where the target company’s shareholders would only own between 20 and 40 per cent of the newly formed company, by strengthening the requirements on the US company seeking the inversion.“Initially executives were shocked by the decision taken by the government and decided that they didn’t want to hear about inversions any more,” said one banker who helps with tax structuring on mergers and acquisitions.However, he said that corporate boards were looking at tax inversion proposals at a pace that was nearly the same as before the US government clamped down on the move. “They are willing to take more risk and structure deals in a way that goes around the new rules not against them,” the banker said.Why does Monsanto, the agricultural seeds and chemicals group, want to buy rival Syngenta? One of the main answers is Roundup. Continue readingIn addition to lower future corporate tax rates, other benefits to would-be inverters include their ability to access future non-US earnings — as opposed to their existing cash piles — free of US tax, and their ability to take generous tax deductions on loans between different parts of their business.At least three tax inversion deals have been reached since the US Treasury action: medical equipment maker Steris said it would buy the UK’s Synergy Healthcare for $1.9bn, Cyberonics took over Italy’s Sorin for close to $3bn, and US networking equipment maker Arris agreed to acquire the UK’s Pace for $2.1bn.“The simple answer is that transatlantic M&A involving healthcare and pharma companies is coming back. Those kinds of businesses in particular lend themselves to inversion, because they already have tax planning constructs within them,” one international M&A lawyer said.When asked in April about the possibility of Pfizer seeking another tax inversion deal after its unsuccessful attempts to buy the UK’s AstraZeneca last year, the company said it was focused on reducing its expenses, including tax.Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, said: “The new rules — or not the new rules, the new proposed rule change — does make it more difficult to immediately realise any benefits from being redomiciled. But it really depends upon the target.”Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Megan Murphy
2;STE;Steris Corp;2014-10-13T17:55:26Z;Steris makes UK tax leap with $1.9bn Synergy inversion deal;US clampdown fails to prevent medical equipment maker from moving domicile;Steris Corp has become the first American company to agree a deal that allows it to lower its tax burden by moving overseas since President Barack Obama’s administration announced measures to clamp down on the practice.The $1.9bn cash-and-share takeover of the UK’s Synergy Healthcare casts doubt on the ability of the US government to prevent so-called tax inversions after a wave of such deals this year.Ohio-based medical equipment maker Steris will move its domicile to the UK to lower its effective tax rate from 31.3 per cent to about 25 per cent by 2016.Steris insisted that tax savings were not the main purpose of a deal that will increase its global reach in the growing market for equipment and services that help hospitals prevent and control infections.However, the decision to move its domicile to the UK to take advantage of Britain’s lower corporate tax rate and shelter overseas revenues from US taxes showed that the US clampdown has not closed the door to such deals altogether.“The Treasury measures were aimed at stopping the most egregious cases of US businesses using a deal to buy a mailbox in Ireland but this is not that kind of transaction,” said one person close to the deal.The person argued that, by moving its domicile to the UK, Steris would avoid exposing Synergy to the US’s 35 per cent corporate tax rate, which, in addition to being the highest in the developed world, is also unusual in being applied to a company’s global revenues.Salix, a US biotech company, this month scrapped its plans for a $2.7bn inversion deal with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals of Italy, blaming the “political environment” for the decision. Bankers and lawyers say that inversions are still possible – but that the economic benefits and strategic rationale have to be strong.Pfizer, the US drugmaker, is among those still looking for potential inversions after its failed £69.4bn approach for AstraZeneca of the UK in May.Steris is the 14th US company this year to strike such a deal, according to data from Credit Suisse and Dealogic, joining others including Burger King, the fast-food chain, and AbbVie, the drugmaker.By paying for the transaction with 30 per cent of its shares, Steris will be able to take advantage of rules that allow US companies to move their domicile overseas, while keeping its operational headquarters in Ohio.Shares in Steris rose 2 per cent to $57.50 in early US trading, while Synergy shares closed 31.4 per cent higher at £18.40 in London trading.Steris, which has a market capitalisation of $3.4bn, was advised by Lazard and Wachtell, Lipton, Rose & Katz and Jones Day.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
