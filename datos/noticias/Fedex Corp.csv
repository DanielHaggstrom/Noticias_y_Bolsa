1;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-12-17T22:05:41Z;FedEx shares slide after second profit warning;Shipping group cites weak economy, intense competition and rising costs;FedEx cut its annual earnings guidance for the second time in three months, after a weaker global economy, higher costs and the loss of its delivery deal with Amazon dinged its latest quarterly results.Shares in the US economic bellwether dropped more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading.The shipping giant on Tuesday said it planned to curtail hiring and cut air freight capacity in response to disappointing earnings. It said it now expects current-year earnings of $10.25 to $11.50 per share, excluding certain expenses and adjustments, having previously estimated between $11 and $13.FedEx had already warned once this year that increased trade tensions and higher costs in its ground shipping business had put pressure on its bottom line.It is dealing with a growing set of rivals in the logistics arena, including Amazon itself, which has expanded its own fleet of cargo jets and delivery vans. Like its main rival UPS, FedEx has invested billions of dollars in its network to handle the influx of ecommerce parcels, as more consumers choose to shop online and demand ever-speedier delivery.Operating results declined “due to weak global economic conditions, increased FedEx Ground costs from expanded service offerings, the loss of business from a large customer, a continuing mix shift to lower-yielding services and a more competitive pricing environment,” FedEx said.In its fiscal second quarter that ended in November, FedEx booked adjusted earnings of $2.51 per share, below the year-ago period’s $4.03, as revenue fell to $17.3bn from $17.8bn. Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of $2.76 on $17.58bn in revenue.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the revised guidance reflects weaker than expected revenue in each of the company’s transportation segments, as well as higher expenses amid a shift to costlier home delivery services.“In response, we are implementing reductions to the global FedEx Express air network to better match capacity with demand. We are also further restricting hiring and pursuing opportunities to optimise our networks, including investments in technology aimed at improving our productivity and lowering our costs,” he said.In June, FedEx said it would not be renewing a FedEx Express air service contract to deliver for Amazon, and would instead focus on the broader ecommerce market. It later announced plans to end home delivery of Amazon packages in the US, though it will still handle parcels for the online retailer internationally.Logistics groups are also grappling with a shortened calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, intensifying the holiday rush.“Fiscal 2020 is a year of continued significant challenges and changes for FedEx, particularly in the quarter just ended due to the compressed shipping season,” said Fred Smith, FedEx’s chairman and chief executive.Mr Smith also said the company has forecast that FedEx Ground operating margins will rebound in the fourth quarter, “as the bow wave of costs for these changes is absorbed.”FedEx shares had risen 2.8 per cent this year as of Tuesday’s close, well behind the broader S&P 500’s gain of more than 27 per cent.
2;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-09-20T04:42:14Z;China detains FedEx pilot as company faces scrutiny in country;Logistics group has been probed by authorities repeatedly amid trade tension with US;A pilot with FedEx was arrested by authorities in China in the latest setback for the US logistics company in the country, where it has been under a series of investigations against the backdrop of a simmering trade war between Washington and Beijing.The Memphis-based company said in a statement on Friday that an employee had been detained and released on bail after airport security in Guangzhou found an unauthorised item in his luggage. “FedEx confirms that Chinese authorities in Guangzhou detained and later released one of our pilots on bail after an item was found in his luggage prior to a commercial flight,” it said.100+The number of packages sent by Huawei but not delivered by the US companyFedEx did not identify the pilot or the nature of the item. “We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts,” the company said.The US State Department confirmed that it was “aware of the arrest of a US citizen in Guangzhou . . . and are monitoring the situation”, but declined further comment citing privacy considerations.FedEx has found itself in Beijing’s crosshairs in recent months amid an escalating US-China trade war.The world’s two largest economies have been slapping tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods, while Washington earlier in the summer imposed an effective ban on US companies selling components to Chinese telecoms company Huawei. In July, a Chinese government investigation into FedEx concluded that the logistics company had broken the law by not delivering more than 100 packages to the Shenzhen-based telecoms group.FedEx has apologised for missed deliveries to Huawei and blamed the issue on an operational error. That probe followed an earlier announcement by Beijing that it was compiling a list of unreliable foreign companies, which was widely viewed as retaliation for the Huawei ban.The news has spooked international businesses operating in China but Beijing has yet to formally add any companies to such a list. “While China's entity list is in the making, some industry analysts believe that FedEx will be added first due to the company's multiple violations of China's laws and regulations,” Global Times, the state-run nationalist tabloid, wrote on Friday.The comments were the latest in a series of attacks on the company, which has been accused of colluding with the US government.“Based on repeated odd incidents, we have good reason to suspect that FedEx’s business in the Chinese market is interfered with by the US government, especially US intelligence department”, it said last month.News of the arrest was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which identified the pilot as Todd Hohn, a former US Air Force colonel.Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Beijing

4;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-09-18T17:32:17Z;FedEx: train wrecks;Logistics group blamed macroeconomic woes for profit warning, but may only have itself to blame;Profit warnings come in four sizes: small, medium, large and FedEx.The US logistics giant has taken an axe to its earnings forecast. It said full-year adjusted profits could fall as much as 25 per cent below its previous target. The cut is the equivalent of a $1.3bn reduction to last year’s adjusted operating profit.Investors are no strangers to bad news from FedEx. The US’s trade war with China, weakening global growth, a split with customer-turned-competitor Amazon and higher operating costs have all taken their toll on the business in recent quarters. Even so, the magnitude of Tuesday’s cut, coming just three months after the target was first issued, and with still three quarters left to the current year, was a shock. The market responded by knocking the stock 14 per cent lower on Wednesday. It is FedEx’s biggest one-day sell-off since December 2008.FedEx was quick to blame macroeconomic woes. But a much milder 1.8 per cent decline in the shares of rival UPS suggests FedEx has itself to blame.FedEx bet big in 2016 with the €4.4bn acquisition of Dutch shipping company TNT Express. Three years on, it is still trying to combine the business into its operations. A cyber attack on TNT in 2017, which drove away customers and increased costs, did not help. Integration costs are now expected to total $1.7bn through fiscal 2021, more than twice that forecast just two years ago.The financial drain has in turn left FedEx in a weaker position to navigate a global slowdown and cash in on surging ecommerce volumes.Tuesday’s sell-off puts FedEx shares at 11 times forward earnings, below its five-year average of 15 times and a quarter below UPS. Perhaps a buying opportunity, but Lex is not convinced. Holiday peak shipping season is just around the corner. Amazon’s push into parcel delivery means competition will get stiffer. Fuel costs are rising. FedEx needs to deliver its promises as reliably as its workers deliver parcels.
5;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-09-18T17:23:36Z;FedEx shares plunge on gloomy economic outlook;Shipping group is a bellwether of consumer and business activity but has issues of its own;FedEx shares plunged 13 per cent on Wednesday after the logistics group reported its weakest sales growth in a decade and alarmed investors with a gloomy assessment of the global economy.The S&P 500 company, often regarded as an economic bellwether given its exposure to world trade, lost about $6bn of its market value as it also slashed its profits outlook for the rest of the year.In the latest warning from corporate America of a deteriorating outlook, Fred Smith, FedEx founder and executive chairman, said the world economy “continues to soften” even though the US consumer remained “a remarkable driver”.Pointing to contagion risks of Washington’s trade war with China, he warned that Europe and Germany in particular would feel the pinch unless the dispute was soon resolved.“There is a lot of whistling past the graveyard about the US consumer and the United States economy, versus what’s going on globally,” he told analysts on a conference call.“Germany’s contraction is because . . . they’re not selling as much to China, which is a huge customer of Europe,” he added. “Most people don’t think about [that].”FedEx, which handles more than 15m shipments each day, predicted annual world trade volumes would contract this year for the first time since 2009.All major exporting economies had been hit by a trade slowdown, especially those in Asia with high exposure to China, said FedEx executive vice-president Brie Carere. Brexit uncertainty, she added, was weighing on several countries in Europe as well as the UK, where “no sector has been immune to the negative impact”.Wall Street analysts, however, questioned whether the latest disappointing results from FedEx, whose quarterly revenues were unchanged from a year ago at $17.05bn, said more about the company’s own difficulties.The Memphis-based company, which previously anticipated a low-single digit percentage point increase in adjusted earnings per share this financial year, now expects a decline from $13.25 last year to between $10.00 and $12.00.“This is, I think, the fifth straight quarter of either missing . . . numbers or cutting guidance,” Scott Group, analyst at Wolfe Research, said on the call, questioning whether further reductions could be in the pipeline.Among other setbacks, executives cited costs in the FedEx ground shipping business and the recent end of a tie-up with Amazon to deliver packages in the US. FedEx called time last month on its contract with the ecommerce group, which is taking more control of its shipping.While the Amazon relationship represented only a small proportion of revenues, Mr Smith said near-term profits would be hit given “flow-through to the bottom line”.FedEx said it was trying to deal with its challenges in part by reducing capacity. The company had already reduced US domestic flight hours and was now planning to retire at least 20 aircraft, it said.Other initiatives include improving ground handling of large packages to accommodate items like TVs, tyres and furniture. It was also deepening ties with US retailers, who have been expanding their ecommerce options, and has signed delivery deals with companies such as Chewy and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
6;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-09-17T21:11:55Z;FedEx cuts outlook as trade row lingers;Shares drop 9% after-hours as first-quarter earnings fall short of Wall St forecasts;FedEx offered a dimmer outlook for its current fiscal year and booked quarterly earnings below Wall Street’s expectations, as the group continues to grapple with the fallout from the US-China trade spat and a severed ground-delivery deal with Amazon.The US shipping giant, seen as an economic bellwether, said Tuesday that increased trade tensions and additional weakening of global economic conditions prompted it to lower its fiscal-year earnings forecast. It also cited increased costs in its ground shipping business, a higher effective tax rate and the “loss of FedEx Ground business from a large customer” in August.FedEx already warned back in June that trade uncertainty and a slower global economy would weigh on its 2020 financial results. The company has also been caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment maker.That same month, the company said it would not be renewing a FedEx Express air service contract to deliver for Amazon, and would instead focus on the broader ecommerce market. Later, in August, FedEx said it would end home delivery of Amazon packages in the US, though it will still handle parcels for the online retailer internationally.The Memphis, Tennessee-based company now expects earnings of $10 to $12 per share before a year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment. Three months ago, the company said it anticipated a low-single digit percentage point increase from its 2019 result of $13.25.Excluding costs related to the integration of TNT Express, FedEx estimated fiscal 2020 earnings of $11 to $13 per share before the retirement plan adjustment, compared with its prior forecast of a mid-single digit percentage point decline from $15.52.In its first quarter that ended August 31, FedEx recorded net income of $745m, or $2.84 a share, down from $835m, or $3.10 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings fell to $3.05 from $3.46, missing analysts’ average estimate of $3.15.Revenue was flat at $17.05bn, roughly in line with forecasts.Shares dipped more than 9 per cent in after-hours trade. FedEx has gained 7.4 per cent year-to-date, lagging the broader S&P 500, which is up 19.9 per cent over the same period.
7;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-08-07T17:06:01Z;FedEx scraps package delivery deal with Amazon;Shipping company’s decision comes as e-commerce giant expands its own delivery network;FedEx will no longer deliver Amazon packages in the US, as the ecommerce company steps up competition in shipping and logistics with the traditional carriers it has long relied on.The delivery company said on Wednesday that it would not renew its contract with Amazon for ground delivery — bringing packages to customers’ homes — when it expires at the end of August. That followed FedEx’s decision in June to not renew its Express air service contract to carry Amazon packages between warehouses and delivery hubs. FedEx will still deliver packages internationally.The move sent FedEx shares down as much as 3 per cent in early trade in New York. Amazon were down less than 1 per cent amid a broader market pullback.“This change is consistent with our strategy to focus on the broader e-commerce market,” FedEx said in a statement. An Amazon spokeswoman said: “We are constantly innovating to improve the carrier experience, and sometimes that means re-evaluating our carrier relationships.” Relations between Amazon, which sends billions of parcels to customers every year, and its delivery partners have grown more fraught in recent years as the ecommerce company has expanded its in-house delivery network.It leases a fleet of cargo planes that it operates as Amazon Air and is building a $1.5bn air freight hub. Amazon also owns freight trailers and vans, and it has created a new network of contractors who carry items over the so-called “last mile” to shoppers’ doorsteps. The company said in June it plans to begin delivery by drone in the coming months.Amazon’s move to take more control of shipping comes as costs have ballooned and it tries to get orders to customers ever more quickly in the face of rising competition.The standard it has set of free and fast delivery has been widely adopted by other retailers looking to grab a larger share of online sales. Amazon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars this year to cut shipment times to one day for members of its Prime subscription programme. Walmart and Target have also unveiled faster shipping options, including same-day and next-day, in an escalating delivery war.Amazon spent $27.7bn on worldwide shipping last year. It sends packages through a number of delivery partners, including UPS and the US Postal Service as well as its own network.Analysts at Cowen estimated that in 2018, 4.4 per cent of Amazon’s 2.3bn US packages were carried by FedEx, compared with 55 per cent by the post office and 23 per cent by UPS. Recent estimates by Rakuten Intelligence suggest that Amazon itself is delivering nearly half of packages to customers’ houses.FedEx said Amazon accounted for 1.3 per cent of revenue last year. It has been trying to expand its business with other ecommerce retailers, investing in fulfilment centres and offering delivery seven days a week.
8;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-07-26T04:29:36Z;FedEx accused of breaking Chinese law on Huawei parcels;China state media reports a widening of investigation into US logistics company;An investigation by the Chinese government into FedEx showed the US parcel delivery service broke the law by not delivering packages to the country’s leading telecoms equipment maker Huawei, state media alleged on Friday.A report by state-backed Xinhua news agency also alleged that the probe had uncovered other violations of Chinese law by FedEx but did not provide details, in findings that come against the background of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.FedEx could not be immediately reached for comment.In June, Xinhua reported that Beijing authorities were investigating FedEx for “undermining the legitimate rights and interests” of Chinese clients.The probe, followed by an announcement that China would launch a list of unreliable foreign companies, has been viewed as retaliation for an effective ban on Huawei products in the US earlier this year.The trade dispute, in which both the US and China have levied hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on one another, has demonstrated the potential to engulf companies and individuals loosely connected to the hostilities.FedEx apologised in June for misrouting the packages after Huawei said articles sent from Japan were diverted to the US rather than to intended destinations in China.Authorities had conducted an investigation into FedEx and found that it had not delivered more than 100 packages connected to Huawei, Xinhua said.The logistics company has said the failure to deliver parcels was due to an operational error, but Xinhua said the investigation had found that this “was not in line with the facts”.News of China creating an “unreliables list” of foreign companies has also spooked foreign groups operating in China.Although the list was announced just days after the investigation into FedEx, no companies have been formally added to it, and it is unclear what repercussions a group would face if it was listed.“The unreliable list system is under process and will be released soon,” a commerce ministry spokesman said on Friday.The retaliation against FedEx comes as China widens its retaliation against measures brought by the US and other countries against Huawei and its employees.Two Canadian citizens — Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who worked for International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, who arranged tours into North Korea — were detained in China in late 2018 shortly after Canadian authorities arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou following a US extradition request.The pair were formally arrested in May on charges including stealing and illegally providing state secrets, and spying and gathering intelligence on state secrets.China’s actions have been widely viewed as retaliation for the arrest of Ms Meng, and have sent a chill through the foreign business community over fears that political disputes between Beijing and other countries could result in the arbitrary detention of foreign citizens.Additional reporting by Xinning Liu in Beijing
9;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-06-25T21:46:06Z;FedEx warns trade battle will hit 2020 results;Package delivery group has become caught up in US clampdown on Huawei of China;FedEx on Tuesday topped its twice-lowered expectations for quarterly earnings and cautioned that a slower global economy and trade uncertainty will continue to drag on its business in the next year.The logistics company, considered an economic bellwether, had already cut its outlook for the year ended May 2019 in the previous two quarters, hampered by a slowdown in China and weaker trade globally.And its current fiscal year, ending May 2020, macroeconomic weakness, trade uncertainty and a “strategic decision to not renew a customer contract” will knock the company’s results further, FedEx said.The company announced earlier this month it would not be renewing a FedEx Express contract to deliver for Amazon, saying it would instead focus on serving the broader ecommerce market.Amazon accounted for a small portion of the parcel carrier’s total revenue — less than 1.3 per cent in the 2018 calendar year, according to FedEx.“While we are adjusting our costs to mitigate revenue weakness and market shifts, we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities, improve our long-term efficiencies and reduce our cost to serve,” FedEx chief financial officer Alan Graf said in a statement.FedEx said it expects a mid-single digit percentage point decline in earnings per share in fiscal 2020, before a year-end retirement plan accounting adjustment and excluding the costs of integrating TNT Express. Adjusted earnings were $15.52 a share in fiscal 2019.FedEx has been caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, since the US commerce department added Huawei to an “entity list” of companies barred from purchasing US technology without government approval.FedEx apologised after misrouting some packages destined for Huawei in China from Japan, sending them to the US instead. China said it launched an investigation into the company, igniting concerns that Beijing could blacklist FedEx.The company, based in Memphis, Tennessee, sued the US commerce department on Monday, alleging that restrictions put in place by the Trump administration have placed “an unreasonable burden” on FedEx by forcing it to check millions of packages shipped each day for potential violations.“FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,” it said in a statement.In its results released after the bell on Tuesday, FedEx booked a net loss of $1.97bn in its fourth quarter that ended May 31, down from a profit of $1.13bn in the same period a year ago. On an adjusted basis, FedEx earned $5.01 a share, better than the $4.85 forecast by analysts.Revenue climbed to $17.8bn from $17.3bn, roughly in line with Wall Street’s estimate.Shares in FedEx rose 1.3 per cent to $157.98 in after-hours trading.
10;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-06-07T18:52:44Z;FedEx to no longer provide express shipping for Amazon in US;Move comes as ecommerce giant moves to take more control of logistics and fulfilment;FedEx said on Friday it was not renewing its contract to deliver Amazon packages by air in the US, in the latest fallout from the ecommerce company’s push to take more control of logistics and fulfilment.FedEx said the decision only affected its US contract for FedEx Express service — meaning shipments by cargo plane that take packages between Amazon warehouses and delivery hubs. It will not impact other existing contracts with Amazon for international delivery and with other FedEx business units, both companies said. FedEx will continue to deliver Amazon packages to customers’ homes.“We respect FedEx’s decision and thank them for their role serving Amazon customers over the years,” Amazon said.Amazon has ramped up its own delivery network in recent years, including leasing a fleet of cargo planes that it operates as Amazon Air and building a $1.5bn air freight hub in Kentucky. It is also doing more of its so-called “last mile” deliveries to customers itself, and said this week it would start delivery by drone in the coming months.Amazon represented less than 1.3 per cent of the parcel delivery company’s revenue last year, FedEx said. That is lower than previous estimates from analysts at Cowen who last year estimated that Amazon accounted for no more than 3 per cent of FedEx revenue.FedEx said its decision was meant to enable it to “focus on serving the broader ecommerce market,” which it expects to grow from 50m to 100m packages a day in the US by 2026. The company has invested in its own fulfilment centres serving retailers’ ecommerce operations and has made a push to sign up small and medium-sized businesses as customers.
11;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-06-01T14:11:33Z;China to probe FedEx over diverted deliveries as trade tension rises;Investigation follows allegations by Huawei that US company did not send packages to intended recipients;Beijing authorities will investigate FedEx for allegedly “undermining the legitimate rights and interests” of Chinese clients, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, less than 24 hours after China’s commerce ministry said it would compile a list of “unreliable” foreign companies.Xinhua said FedEx had not delivered packages to their intended recipients in China in violation of “laws and regulations governing the express industry in China”.The agency did not identify the FedEx clients involved or say what penalties the US delivery company could face. Last week, however, Huawei said FedEx had diverted packages sent from Japan to the US rather than to its offices in China. FedEx is reported to have apologised for what it said was an error.The US delivery company also said that it would fully co-operate with any regulatory investigation.“Our relationship with Huawei Technologies and our relationships with all of our customers in China are important to us,” FedEx said.US-China trade tension was ramped up again on Saturday morning when Washington began collecting 25 per cent tariffs on many Chinese goods arriving at its ports. Earlier in the day Beijing began implementing its own higher retaliatory tariffs on much of its $60bn target list of American goodsHuawei is at the centre of this escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.In May, the US placed Huawei on a blacklist restricting its access to US components — a directive that could potentially cripple the company.The US decision to blacklist Huawei, which came shortly after the US hiked punitive tariffs on about half of all Chinese exports to the US, has made it even more unlikely that the two countries can pave the way for a truce when Mr Trump and Xi Jinping attend a G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan.China responded to Mr Trump’s tariffs with counter-tariffs of its own that took effect on June 1.The commerce ministry’s announcement on Friday that it would compile a list of unreliable foreign companies that harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies was widely interpreted as retaliation to the Trump administration’s decision to restrict Huawei’s access to US components.The commerce ministry has not yet formally added any companies to the list, which could target US companies that withhold components from Huawei.Beijing officials have signalled that they could also retaliate against the US by withholding supplies of rare earths, most of which are mined in China and vital to many high-tech products.US companies operating in China are bracing themselves for potential retaliatory measures in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to increase tariffs and restrict Huawei’s access to American components.Because the US exports far less to China than China exports to the US, Beijing cannot match Mr Trump’s tariffs dollar for dollar. But Chinese officials have said they will not target US companies in revenge, many of whom are large employers and taxpayers.Micron, a Idaho-based chipmaker that has alleged its proprietary technologies were stolen by a Chinese rival, is the subject of an antitrust investigation by Beijing regulators.
12;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-03-20T18:58:31Z;FedEx: post truth;Operations can matter as much as macroeconomics;Quarterly earnings for FedEx are thought of as a seminar on the state of the global economy. Unfortunately, for its shareholders it is also a session on underwhelming corporate operations. Late on Tuesday, the logistics titan reported another weak quarter with the company’s CEO Fred Smith admitting the results were “below our expectations”. Later management offered its deep thoughts on a moderating US economy and the knock-on effects of a slowing China. All very interesting, if you work at a think-tank or macro hedge fund.As for FedEx shareholders, they will have noted only that earnings for the latest quarter fell nearly a fifth. Moreover, the company cut its profit forecast for the fiscal year that ends in May, having already done so in December. Slowing trade and economic growth is a challenge for FedEx. But its immediate problem is its poor integration of TNT, the rival it bought in 2016.FedEx shares in the last year are down a third while the S&P 500 is up nearly 4 per cent. The company said it would spend cumulatively $1.5bn through 2021 on integration costs. Additionally, the company forecast $800m of restructuring and redundancy costs. The slowing global economy is clearly evident in FedEx’s quarterly result. Within its largest segment, Express, which represents more than half of revenue, international export package revenue fell by 3 per cent.When a research analyst noted that FedEx’s profit margins had not changed, that heavy capital expenditures meant free cash flow had turned negative, Mr Smith snapped that Wall Street was always “give me the money”. FedEx has high operating leverage. Even modest slowdowns hit profits hard.That means that if the company’s operations improve even slightly, earnings growth can rebound sharply. But do not count on it. FedEx will only meet its full year forecast if the global economy does not deteriorate any further.

14;FDX;Fedex Corp;2019-03-19T20:59:55Z;FedEx cuts earnings forecasts again due to weaker global growth;Shares slide almost 6% as concerns rise about slowing economic activity;FedEx reported quarterly results below its own expectations and again lowered its full-year earnings outlook as it battles a continued trend of weaker growth in global trade, sending its shares more than 5 per cent lower.The company on Tuesday said unfavourable exchange rates, higher costs for its ground transportation services and declining revenue for its FedEx Express international business weighed on its results in its third quarter, offsetting some positives, such as lower fuel costs.FedEx, which is typically regarded as a bellwether for global economic activity owing to all sorts of packages and mail it ships around the world, previously spooked the market in December when it cut its full-year adjusted earnings outlook and warned of “ongoing deceleration in global trade”.It took a box cutter to those numbers again, trimming the range for full-year adjusted earnings of $11.95 to $13.10 a share, before accounting adjustments related to a mark-to-market retirement plan, which represented part of a broader effort to rein in costs to mitigate the weakness in its international business units. The range was down from its December forecast of between $12.65 to $13.40 a share.In the three months ended February 28, FedEx reported a 3 per cent increase in revenue to $17bn from a year earlier — which fell short of the median of analyst expectations of $17.7bn in a Refinitiv survey.Reported earnings dropped 63 per cent year-on-year to $2.80 a diluted share, having been boosted in 2018 by a number of tax benefits, and were one cent short of Wall Street estimates. Adjusted earnings were down 18.5 per cent at $3.03 a share, missing market expectations for $3.11.“Our third quarter financial results were below our expectations and we are focused on initiatives to improve our performance,” said Frederick Smith, chief executive, in a statement.“Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue, as seen in the year-over-year decline in our FedEx Express international revenue,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer.That comes in the wake of rival package delivery company UPS saying in January it experienced a “challenging” holiday quarter that saw revenues in the three months to the end of December rise by less than the market expected.The company’s FedEx Express division has also had a tough time. In early December, the unit’s head abruptly departed, prompting analysts to speculate the division was in trouble. His replacement was then elevated to group-wide chief operating officer in February, and it was in mid-March that FedEx named Don Colleran as chief executive of the Express division.FedEx shares dropped 5.6 per cent in after-hours trading to $171.30. This compares with a low of $159.70 a share hit in January on heightened investor concerns after the previous cut in earnings guidance.
15;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-12-18T22:10:59Z;FedEx delivers outlook cut, sending shares lower;;Parcel delivery company FedEx on Tuesday slashed its full-year outlook, sending shares lower as it warned of “ongoing deceleration in global trade” and European weakness.The Tennessee-based company considered an economic bellwether said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $15.50 to $16.60 a share, lower than its previous outlook of between $17.20 to $17.80 a share.“Global trade has slowed in recent months and leading indicators point to ongoing deceleration in global trade near-term,” said Alan Graf Jr., chief financial officer. “These trends, coupled with the change in service mix at FedEx Express, are negatively impacting the segment’s financial results.”FedEx shares fell more than 5 per cent to $176.55 in after-hours trade.The lower forecast accompanied a reported 9.2 per cent year-on-year rise in quarterly revenues to $17.8bn in the three months ended in November. That was just ahead of analysts’ expectations for $17.75bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.Net income rose to $935m compared with $775m in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, earnings per share rose to $3.51 from $2.84. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $4.03 topped forecasts for $3.94.“While the US economy remains solid, our international business weakened during the quarter, especially in Europe,” said chief executive Frederick W. Smith. “We are taking action to mitigate the impact of this trend through new cost-reduction initiatives.”FedEx said it is offering buyouts to eligible employees, as well as limiting hiring, cutting discretionary spending and reducing international capacity at FedEx Express.The abrupt departure of David Cunningham, head of FedEx Express, earlier this month prompted some analysts to speculate that it signalled trouble at the division. On Tuesday, the company said revenue in its Express segment rose 5.8 per cent to $9.6bn in the fiscal second quarter, while operating income rose to $620m, up from $601m in the prior-year quarter.The company said “lower-than-expected express package volume due to European economic weakness that accelerated during the quarter” is delaying the benefits of its 2016 acquisition of TNT Express.FedEx shares are down more than 26 per cent year-to-date.
16;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-12-13T11:00:24Z;US slowdown or Amazon effect? Investors divided over index fall;The Dow Transports is seen as a barometer of the economy, but this time may be different;To the list of areas where Amazon is wreaking disruption, from retail to cloud computing, add another candidate: a stock market index that has been watched by investors as a barometer of the US economy. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, the less well-known sibling of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, includes railroad operators, airlines and shipping companies whose fortunes are tied closely to economic activity.The transport index has fallen more than 9 per cent since the start of December compared with between 3 and 4 per cent for other equity market benchmarks. That is exactly the kind of divergence that gives support to bears, who worry about trade wars and see slowing global growth.“I do not think we are heading for a recession, but we are seeing a global economic slowdown and the Transports are reflecting that,” said Michael Underhill, chief investor officer at Capital Innovations.But Mr Underhill and other market participants point out that idiosyncratic factors are pressuring some influential index members. That potentially reduces the signalling power of the Transports index.Shares of FedEx, which has the biggest weighting in the index, have lost more than 17 per cent since the start of the month, in part due to concerns about Amazon Air, the ecommerce giant’s in-house freight delivery service. Amazon has been expanding its own shipping operations, both on the ground and in the air, to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders.In early December, Morgan Stanley warned that investors “may be missing the risk” Amazon Air posed to growth at FedEx and rival UPS.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley said Amazon Air’s growth represents 2 per cent of potential revenue lost for UPS and FedEx in 2018 and at least 10 per cent by 2025, based on an analysis of Amazon Air’s overlap with the shipping companies.Unlike the S&P 500, an index that reflects the market capitalisation of its members, the Dow Jones Transportation and Industrials indices are calculated on the basis of each member’s share price, which means a company with a high share price exerts a big influence even if its market cap is small.FedEx accounts for about a quarter of the month-to-date loss in the Transports index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Add in UPS, whose shares are down 12 per cent this month, and the two stocks threatened by Amazon Air account for about 3 percentage points of the index fall.Those who think that the underperformance of the Transports could be the canary in the coal mine signalling an economic slowdown are not deterred, however. “FedEx does skew the reading on the Transports index, but does not wash it out entirely,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.It is particularly notable that the transport index is falling sharply even as oil prices have been going down, something that should be giving transport stocks a lift.“Energy is typically a big part of their cost structure — they should be doing better than they are,” Mr Colas said. “The Transport index performance mirrors what other financial markets like the flattening of the Treasury yield curve are telling you: slower growth. It is just one more brick in the wall.”
17;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-12-04T20:56:26Z;UPS, FedEx tumble as analyst warns of Amazon Air risk;;Amazon Air took the wind out of United Parcel Service and FedEx shares on Tuesday, as Morgan Stanley warned that investors have yet to fully account for growing competition from the ecommerce giant’s freight delivery service.But it, too found itself on the receiving end of issues pertaining to shipping, amid reports on Tuesday afternoon that a task force set up by US President Donald Trump has recommended that the US Postal Service should have the authority to charge market rates to deliver most packages.Amazon has sought to expand its own shipping operations, both on the ground and in the air, to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders. The retailer has leased dozens of aircraft to create a fleet of cargo jets, and it plans to build an air hub capable of housing 100 planes. The moves — in addition to an order of 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans for ground deliveries — could reduce Amazon’s reliance on logistics companies such as UPS and FedEx, whose networks have been strained by growing ecommerce shipments.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley said Amazon Air’s growth represents 2 per cent of potential revenue lost for UPS and FedEx in 2018 and at least 10 per cent by 2025, based on an analysis of Amazon Air’s overlap with the shipping companies. The investment bank also sees Amazon Air weighing on volume growth for the companies’ domestic air and express operations.“For now, investors are focusing on Amazon’s last-mile efforts but we believe the challenge in Air is just as relevant,” a team of analysts led by Ravi Shanker wrote.Morgan Stanley cut its price target for UPS to $87 from $92 while lowering its FedEx target to $230 from $240.“We expect this drag to intensify once Amazon Air has all 40 planes in the air (and potentially 100 planes if it runs its planned air hub at capacity) and as its utilisation improves to UPS/FedEx levels,” Mr Shanker said.As for Amazon, the buildout of its air fleet should result in savings of $2 to $4 a package, or a total of $1bn to $2bn, according to Morgan Stanley’s research. However, those savings will largely offset shipping cost increases from third-party carriers in the short run.Shares of UPS and FedEx slipped into bear-market territory during Tuesday’s session, reflecting a loss of at least 20 per cent from recent highs. UPS fell 6.8 per cent, and FedEx was down 5.5 per cent amid a broader market rout driven by trade and economic concerns. The Dow transport index, of which UPS and FedEx are members, was headed for its worst day since June 2016.Amazon slipped 5 per cent amid reports that a task force created by President Donald Trump recommended that the US Postal Service should have the authority to charge market rates to deliver most packages. Mr Trump has accused Amazon of using the Postal Service as its “delivery boy,” saying the company should pay more in fees.
18;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-09-19T04:03:41Z;US business groups rail against Trump’s China tariffs;Trade associations support pushing Beijing to open markets but say tactics ‘ineffective’;Donald Trump’s newest round of tariffs on Chinese imports puts off the worst of the impact until after US retailers’ critical Christmas season and spares a few businesses, including smartwatches and high chairs, but corporate America still decried the move as costly and counterproductive. Washington’s largest trade associations have spent months ramping up campaigns against the escalating trade war, identifying state by heartland state how many jobs and export dollars would be put at risk. In public hearings, small business owners making everything from fishing nets to wooden crates urged Washington to reconsider, but Mr Trump tuned out the chorus. “As thousands of businesses have testified and explained in comments to the administration, tariffs are a tax on American families,” National Retail Federation president Matthew Shay lamented after the new 10 per cent tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports was announced. It was “disappointing” that the administration had ignored the voices of those affected, he said. Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, said his industry appreciated the exemption of some connected devices but was still worried about the impact on printed circuit assemblies, routers and networking equipment. Tariffs were an ineffective — and possibly illegal — too, he argued. “Congress has not given the president or the [US trade representative] a blank check to pursue a trade war.”The Trade Act of 1974 says that the president must consult with the private sector and “shall take the advice received” into account in setting trade policy, John Murphy, senior vice-president for international policy at the US Chamber of Commerce, echoed on Twitter.Congress has not given the president or the [US trade representative] a blank check to pursue a trade warSeveral US business groups support the idea of pushing China to open its markets to US imports, and penalising it for intellectual property infringements, but disagree with Mr Trump’ tactics. “The administration has correctly identified the real problem of China’s discriminatory trade practices. But unilaterally imposing tariffs is the wrong way to achieve real reforms,” the Business Roundtable said, urging Washington to work with its allies to push for long-term reforms in China. Craig Allen of the US-China Business Council, which represents about 200 US companies that do business with China, said the administration’s focus on market access, IP rights and technology transfer was correct but using tariffs was “counterproductive”. Tom Donohue, the Chamber’s president, agreed the US had “serious issues to resolve with China on market access, unfair subsidies, technology theft, and cyber security” but expressed dismay that the administration did not heed US companies’ warnings about rising costs and lost jobs. Before announcing the latest measures, Mr Trump played down the extent to which tariffs were increasing prices, tweeting that “cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable”. Companies from Coca-Cola to Whirlpool have announced price increases, however, expressing confidence in a strong economy allowing them to pass the burden to customers. “We cannot afford further escalation, especially with the holiday shopping season right around the corner,” Mr Shay said. The administration’s decision “has not gone the way we hoped it would”, Macy’s chief executive Jeff Gennette told a CNBC conference on Tuesday: “We’re going to see how the customer votes on this.”Some business groups said the biggest disruption came from the uncertainty produced by the trade dispute. “With every day that passes without progress on a rules-based, bilateral trade agreement with China, the potential grows for manufacturers and manufacturing workers to get hurt,” the National Association of Manufacturers said. “Now is the time for talk — not just tariffs”.The escalation of the trade tensions comes at the start of the US reporting season, when companies are expected to spell out the impact on their earnings and outlook. FedEx, the Memphis-based courier that is seen as a bellwether of global business confidence, said on Monday it had started to see economic activity “moderate” in China as a result of the trade tensions. Hours before Mr Trump announced the latest tariffs, Fred Smith, FedEx chairman and chief executive, told analysts that the US-China trade dispute was “worrisome to everyone . . . because history is very, very clear that countries that pursue the most open markets are the ones that prosper the most”.Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx’s chief marketing officer, said China-US business represented only about 2 per cent of the company’s revenues, of which only about a quarter could be affected by the promised new US tariffs. It had not yet seen significant shifts in customers’ supply chains, he added, but expected them to diversify their sources of supply if the trade tensions continued.Several companies remain unsure of the administration’s next steps. Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Danaher, told analysts last week that the industrial group had no privileged insight into the administration’s thinking despite being headquartered in Washington. “The narrative out of the White House . . . and the US trade representatives changes as often in our minds as it does in yours,” he said.Listen: How one US port is dealing with Trump’s trade warAdditional reporting by James Politi in Washington
19;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-09-17T21:29:42Z;FedEx shares slide as Q1 earnings miss offsets revenue beat;;FedEx shares slid outside normal trading hours after weaker-than-expected earnings in its first quarter outweighed revenue that beat forecasts and a boost to the company’s full-year outlook.The Tennessee-based courier, which is sometimes regarded by investors as a proxy for global growth, reported revenue of $17.1bn in the three months ended August 31, an 11.8 per cent increase from a year ago and ahead of the $16.9bn forecast by analysts in a Thomson Reuters survey.Reported net income was up about 40 per cent from a year ago to $835m. Before taking into account expenses related to the company’s integration of TNT Express of 30 cents a diluted share, EPS was $3.46 a diluted share, which came in well under market forecasts for $3.81.For the full year, FedEx maintained a forecast for revenue growth of 9 per cent from 2018’s $65.5bn, which still implies a better result than Wall Street predicts. The company raised its forecast range for reported earnings by 20 cents to between $15.85 and $16.45 a diluted share, before accounting for adjustments related to a company retirement plan.As well as reiterating that these forecasts assume moderate economic growth, FedEx added these numbers also assume “stability in global trade” — a remark that was absent three months ago at its full-year result.Frederick Smith, chief executive, said: “We are very optimistic about our prospects for profitable growth and remain confident we will reach our goal to improve FedEx Express operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.”FedEx shares were down 3.1 per cent in after-hours trade. At the end of normal trading hours on Monday, the company’s year-to-date gain was 2.5 per cent.
20;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-08-09T04:00:30Z;End of pension fund tax break looms over Treasury market;Bond buying by corporate pension funds may have kept a lid on long-term interest rates;US Treasury traders are bracing for the end of a tax break that they say has encouraged companies to funnel billions of dollars into their pension funds and helped keep a lid on long-term interest rates.Companies have raced to top up their pensions ahead of the expiry of the tax break on September 15, and their pension funds have in turn been significant buyers of long-dated Treasuries.Demand for long-term Treasuries has kept yields low, even as short-term rates have risen, leading to a flat yield curve and intense debate over what that signals for the economy. The terms of that debate could change depending on what happens to yields if pension fund bond buying subsides next month.Under tax reforms introduced at the end of last year, the US cut the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, but companies have been allowed to deduct pension contributions at the old, higher rate for most of this year. The grace period was designed to encourage companies to deal with pension fund deficits.“We have seen a lot of accelerated pension fund contribution activity this year. New money has flowed in from contributions and that needs to be invested,” said Matt McDaniel, who leads pension fund consultancy Mercer’s US financial strategy group.Among companies taking advantage, General Electric has promised to contribute $6bn to its pension over the course of 2018. FedEx made contributions of $2.5bn to its pension plan for its fiscal year 2018, which ran to May 31, up from $2bn for the previous year and $660m for 2016, according to regulatory filings.“One of the most powerful forces in the market place is this pension buying that is taking place,” said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global Securities.Pension fund deficits, while still large, have improved in part due to rising bond yields and stock market strength. That has reduced the incentive to buy risky assets in the hope of closing the gap. Instead, many funds prefer to buy long-dated Treasuries whose returns more closely match their liabilities.The looming tax credit deadline has added a sense of urgency to the activity. Wells Fargo analysts estimate a further $40bn to $60bn of Treasury buying from pensions funds in the coming months.“If you put more cash into pensions now, then you get this significant tax benefit that goes away in two months,” said Boris Rjavinski, rates strategist at Well Fargo Securities. “The long end of the Treasury curve is definitely feeling this effect of Treasury buying.”The longest maturity Treasury bond lasting 30 years has seen its yield rise by less than shorter-dated yields this year, flattening the yield curve and raising fears of a slowdown in the economy. Short-dated yields have risen above longer-dated yields before every US recession of the past 50 years.Once September passes and pension funds have less incentive to buy bonds, some traders and analysts anticipate a rise in yields heading into the back end of the year, steepening the yield curve.“Every day for months now there has been steady buying of 30-year Treasuries,” said a trader at one large bank. “That goes away after September.”Others disagree. Pension funds could remain big buyers after the deadline, investing cash allocated to them before September and continuing a rotation out of equities and into bonds, said Mercer’s Mr McDaniel.“There is a sound argument that long bond rates are unlikely to rise very quickly because there is so much pent up demand from pension funds looking to de-risk,” he added.Sign up to the FT Markets WhatsApp group to receive daily markets news and analysis alerts.
21;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-07-02T09:00:25Z;Amazon delivery plan poses threat to US Postal Service growth;Logistics spending spree aims to find other ways to get parcels quickly to customers;Amazon’s plan to foster a network of small delivery businesses is set to exacerbate a slowdown in the growth of US Postal Service package delivery, analysts say.Package delivery is the fastest-growing part of USPS and is expected to overtake first-class mail as the largest contributor to revenue next year, according to research estimates from Cowen. But Amazon’s increasing need to put parcels in customers’ hands in a day or hours has sharpened its focus away from the post office.The changing dynamics come amid a review of the postal service’s finances ordered by President Donald Trump, a vocal Amazon critic. He has called for USPS, which lost $2.7bn in its latest fiscal year and which has not reported a profit in the past decade, to double the rates it charges the online retailer.Amazon and the postal service do not disclose the terms of their contract, but analysts believe it is profitable for USPS. The post office has been buoyed by an acceleration in the past few years in package shipping, thanks to the rise of ecommerce, which has mitigated a drop in total mail volume.Cowen projects USPS’s share of Amazon deliveries will drop to 45 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2015. That will be driven by a shift in packages toward independent courier companies and, increasingly, deliveries made by Amazon itself and by individuals and small businesses working directly for Amazon.The postal service cannot match the speed that they want“We’re already seeing a massive deceleration in volume growth” of USPS parcels, said John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst. Increases slowed from 26 per cent in 2015 to 15 per cent last year.Amazon said its moves were meant to complement, not replace, existing relationships. “We have great partners in our traditional carriers and it’s exciting to continue to see the logistics industry grow,” said Dave Clark, its senior vice-president of worldwide operations, at the launch the new delivery programme last week.A USPS spokesman said the agency “continue[s] to attract ecommerce customers and business partners because our customers see the value of our predictable service, enhanced visibility, and affordable pricing”.Amazon has a number of delivery options in addition to USPS. It sends packages through UPS, FedEx, DHL and courier services and, increasingly, it employs its own drivers and signs up people to deliver packages with their own cars through a programme called Flex.UPS and FedEx will also lose share in the shift, but analysts say those two are less exposed to Amazon’s whims in the near term.“UPS and FedEx have seen the writing on the wall for a long time and they’ve diversified. It’s going to take a long time for Amazon to make a dent,” said Tuna Amobi of CFRA Research. “But there’s no question the market understands that UPS and FedEx are going to be disrupted by this. It’s just of question of when.”Amazon’s logistics spending spree, including building delivery centres, buying planes and truck trailers and launching programmes such as Flex and the Delivery Partner Service, reflects growing demand for faster delivery from the 100m members of its Prime subscription programme. Its shipping costs ballooned to $21.7bn last year from $11.5bn in 2015.Prime members get free shipping, often in as few as one or two days. Amazon is also expanding options for free same-day delivery and beefing up Prime Now, which delivers food and household items within two hours.“The postal service cannot match the speed that they want. For a customer to get something delivered on the same day they order it from Amazon, it needs to be in the post office system at 6am,” Cowen’s Mr Blackledge said.With its $13.7bn acquisition of US grocer Whole Foods last year and its $1bn purchase of mail-order pharmacy PillPack last week, Amazon is venturing into new retail categories where demand for quick delivery is even higher.In addition to expanding its shipping capacity, Amazon may also be positioning itself for contract talks with carriers, said David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein Research.“Holding a press conference and rolling out a truck decal doesn’t cost much and may help negotiations” with USPS or between USPS and the White House, he said.
22;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-06-28T07:38:15Z;Amazon encourages entrepreneurs to build logistics network;Tech group will provide vans and other services in bid to control last-mile delivery;Amazon is rolling out its own fleet of vans to deliver packages to US customers’ doors in the ecommerce group’s latest push for greater control of its sprawling logistics network.The company is encouraging individuals to launch delivery businesses that will lease van fleets from Amazon, which will offer discounts on uniforms, fuel and insurance coverage.It says it wants to keep start-up costs as low as $10,000, with business owners potentially making as much as $300,000 in annual operating profit with fleets of up to 40 vehicles.The new programme will give Amazon additional options for “last mile” delivery of its parcels, which are typically handled by FedEx, UPS and the US Postal Service. The company also uses individual drivers to deliver packages in US cities using their own cars under a programme called Flex.“Customer demand is higher than ever and we have a need to build more capacity,” said Dave Clark, senior vice-president of worldwide operations.Amazon has been investing heavily in logistics in recent years amid surging demand in online shopping. This has included buying cargo planes and truck trailers and building an extensive network of delivery hubs.Analysts estimate that Amazon’s share of the US ecommerce market is expected to nudge to over 50 per cent by next year. Worldwide shipping costs topped $21.7bn in 2017, and it sent more than 5bn packages to the more than 100m people around the world who subscribe to its Prime programme, which offers fast free delivery of packages in as few as one or two days in 17 countries.In the US, the volumes of items Amazon ships have strained the capacities of some traditional partners and pushed the company to seek a bigger role in getting its deliveries into customers’ hands.President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Amazon and chief executive Jeff Bezos, recently lashed out at the company over its financial dealings with the US Postal Service. Mr Trump has called for the company to pay higher rates and has ordered an audit of the postal service’s finances.Amazon said its efforts were meant to complement, rather than replace, its existing relationships with carriers such as the postal service. “We have great partners in our traditional carriers and it’s exciting to continue to see the logistics industry grow,” Mr Clark said.
23;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx earnings top view on higher rates, deliveries;;Package delivery company FedEx on Tuesday posted upbeat quarterly results buoyed by higher base package shipping rates as online shopping boosts deliveries.The Tennessee-based company, considered a bellwether for the economy, said revenues rose 10 per cent to $17.3bn, ahead of expectations for $17.25bn, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.FedEx’s ground network saw revenue growth of 12 per cent year-on-year to $4.8bn. driven by 6 per cent average daily package volume growth and higher base rates. Meanwhile, its Express business, which providers customers with a time-specific delivery commitment, saw revenues jump 9 per cent from a year ago to $9.6bn.Net income rose to $1.13bn or $4.15 a share, compared with $1.02bn, or $3.75 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $5.91 topped expectations for $5.71 a share.The results include a $255m net tax benefit from corporate structuring transactions like the integration of the company’s Express business with TNT Express, which it acquired in 2016. It also saw a $133m benefit from foreign tax credits associated with distributions to the US from its offshore operations.“It was a year of opportunities and challenges — anticipated and unexpected — and FedEx emerged more competitive than ever,” said chief executive Frederick Smith. “In all my years at FedEx, I have never been so optimistic and so sure of our strategy and our ability to deliver an exciting future.”FedEx has benefited from the growth of online shopping, although it faces growing competition in the space.Ahead of FedEx’s results, Amazon announced a service called Hub by Amazon for the storage of packages delivered by Amazon and other third-party senders. The service appears to feed into Jeff Bezos’ delivery logistics play for his ecommerce juggernaut — Amazon has already filed patents for a drone delivery system, leased planes, opened its own cargo air hub, snapped up a fleet of delivery trucks and rolled out its “Shipping with Amazon” service in Los Angeles earlier this year, in a move largely viewed as a challenge to FedEx and UPS.Both parcel delivery companies have also been caught in the crossfire of the escalating US and China trade spat.Looking ahead, the company is targeting fiscal 2019 revenue growth of about 9 per cent and adjusted earnings between $17 and $17.60 a share, excluding pension adjustments and the costs of integrating TNT Express. The company also said it is targeting capital spending of $5.6bn.FedEx shares, which are up 3.5 per cent year-to-date, initially fell in extended trade but quickly reversed those losses to trade flat.
24;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-04-13T16:34:23Z;Trump escalates Amazon clash with US postal price review;President ramps up personal crusade against online retail group founder Jeff Bezos;"Donald Trump has increased the likelihood of Amazon being charged more by the US Postal Service by ordering an official review of the mail agency’s pricing of package deliveries.In an unexpected move, Mr Trump established a task force to evaluate the “operations and finances” of the post office after spending recent weeks amplifying his complaints that the post office is losing out on shipments for Amazon.The move shows the president is continuing a personal crusade against Jeff Bezos’s online giant even as the tech-related worries of lawmakers on Capitol Hill revolve around Facebook, whose founder Mark Zuckerberg they grilled this week.A White House executive order creating the task force — to be led by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin — said it would examine “the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS’s role in competitive markets”.Despite Amazon’s high-tech credentials, it relies on about 230,000 postal workers to deliver millions of packages along the “last mile” to many American homes.I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery BoyDiscontent over the alliance of the postal service with Amazon appears to have become entangled with Mr Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post — one of the president’s least favourite media outlets.Amazon struck a landmark deal with the post office in 2013 under which the organisation agreed to start Sunday deliveries for Mr Bezos. The deal, on terms which are kept secret, is due to expire later this year.Paul Steidler, senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a free market think-tank, said: “The president and people in his administration can make queries about that contract and hold regulators’ feet to the fire to make sure it is profitable and does not pose a danger to taxpayers.”Package deliveries for ecommerce have been a source of revenue growth for the postal service, going some way towards offsetting a sharp decline in letter volume. But the post office has still posted a net loss in each of the past 11 years, including a $2.7bn loss in 2017.The US postal service accounts for around 40-50 per cent of Amazon’s US shipping costs, according to an estimate from analysts at Credit Suisse, with every 5 per cent increase in postal charges adding $400m extra to the company’s annual costs.If the White House review, announced late on Thursday, led to a 15-20 per cent increase in postal service rates, the ecommerce company would have to boost its annual Amazon Prime fee in North America by $20 to cover the extra costs, the analysts added.Allies of the postal service say it cannot lose money on its work for Amazon since it is barred by law from charging its customers less than the cost of delivery.Critics of the post office, however, say its metrics are wrong. It is accused of underestimating how much it costs to serve Amazon because its data are incomplete and it has not updated the way it allocates overheads to reflect more parcel deliveries.“There is too much chaos and too much of an arbitrary approach to the numbers at the postal service,” said Mr Steidler.In one tweet this month, Mr Trump said: “I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy.”The executive order says: “The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout.”The task force is required to summarise its recommendations in a report for the president within 120 days.Although radical changes to the postal service would require legislation by Congress, Mr Trump has another chance to influence it by appointing people to fill nine vacant seats on its board.Amazon has stayed silent about Mr Trump’s criticism, but it has built a team of eight in-house lobbyists registered to work on postal issues, part of the largest group of staff lobbyists of any big tech company in Washington.Private-sector delivery companies such as UPS argue that the post office is undercharging Amazon to prevent rivals — mainly itself and FedEx — from grabbing more ecommerce business.The task force will also examine the postal service’s business model; the implications of the decline in mail for its monopoly on letter delivery; the definition of its “universal service” obligation to reach all households; and its role in small towns and rural areas.In addition to Mr Mnuchin, the task force will comprise Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House budget office, and Jeff Pon, director of the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management.Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber in Washington"
25;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-04-06T16:27:22Z;Trump’s battle with Amazon raises post trauma;President’s attack on online retailer highlights pricing issue for America’s mailmen;Amazon is synonymous with advanced technologies from drones to robots, but Jeff Bezos’ company has a low-tech underbelly that Donald Trump has dragged into the spotlight: the US post office.For all his inventions, Mr Bezos has not created anything to match the achievements of 230,000 postal workers who deliver mail to 327m Americans. He has made the US Postal Service a pillar of his empire by using the biggest public-sector employer to carry millions of Amazon packages the “last mile” of their journey.Mr Trump is infuriated by the alliance of the postal service with a billionaire who also owns the Washington Post — one of his least favourite media groups. This week, the president repeatedly criticised the postal service as part of an attack against Amazon that injected new volatility into its share price.“I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,” Mr Trump said in one tweet.In simple terms, Mr Trump is wrong. But his intervention has sparked debate about the post office. It was already part of a battle over how regulated businesses with public-sector heritage should set prices for services that compete with the private sector.If they don’t know their costs, then how can they charge [for] them appropriately?To critics, the postal service shares Amazon’s inclination to prioritise sales growth over short-term profits. In a contentious report last year, Citigroup said it was essentially subsidising Amazon.Private-sector deliverers such as UPS argue that the post office was undercharging Amazon to prevent rivals — mainly itself and FedEx — from grabbing more ecommerce businesses.UPS and Amazon have traded blows in regulatory filings. UPS accused Amazon of lobbying to defend what UPS saw as the post office’s unjust control of prices for the final stretch of deliveries.Amazon accused UPS of “rent seeking” by raising prices in a way that harmed consumers and showed that it was no victim of unfair competition.“The post office is not doing well with Amazon, that I can tell you,” Mr Trump tweeted this week. “The playing field has to be level for everybody. That’s very important.”While Mr Trump has taken aim at the arrangement, online shopping has been a boon for the post office. Letter volume fell from 203bn to 154bn between 2008 and 2016 as people turned to email. But ecommerce propelled parcel volumes in the opposite direction, from 3.3bn items to 5.2bn, over the same period.Steve Hutkins, a New York University professor who runs a Save the Post Office blog, said the post office had no obligation to maximise profits. “The postal service is just trying to break even. There is no reason to produce profits. They’re just trying to stay above water.”In a January op-ed in The Hill, a post office spokesman said “we seek the optimal mix of price and volume to deliver the maximum revenue and return”.But the post office has posted a net loss in each of the past 11 years. The losses were exaggerated by a 2006 law requiring it to pre-fund health benefits for retirees. In 2017 it was in the red to the tune of $2.7bn. Even under its own preferred profit measure, which excludes items management cannot control, it lost $814m.Amazon unveiled its deal with the post office in 2013 when the organisation agreed to start Sunday deliveries for Mr Bezos, who was sharpening his focus on quick shipping as a competitive advantage.Amazon has formidable logistics. It has more than 100 warehouses and sorting centres in the US, has leased 40 cargo jets to start an air hub, and bought thousands of truck trailers. It has also made moves towards delivering more of its own packages. But for now much of its system is geared towards feeding packages into the post office.Mr Trump is wrong about Amazon costing the post office money since it is barred by law from charging its customers less than the delivery cost. However, that does not mean it could not charge more.Critics also point out that in a recent regulatory filing the post office could not fully account for the cost of Sunday deliveries. “If they don’t know their costs, then how can they charge [for] them appropriately?” asked one naysayer.In the Citigroup report, which argued the post office needed to raise prices to cover its true costs, analysts said that in an extreme scenario rates would go up by 50 per cent, with FedEx and UPS following on with 20 per cent hikes of their own. The bank estimated that would push up Amazon’s annual costs by $2.6bn. Mr Trump gleefully tweeted the figure last week.The president has some leverage. The post office board is currently empty and Mr Trump has the authority to fill its nine vacant seats. Its 2013 contract with Amazon expires this year and time is short for negotiations on a new deal.If post office officials took the presidential cue and pushed up prices, Mr Bezos would feel the pain.Follow @barneyjopson on Twitter

Authorities in Texas said the suspect had attempted to evade the police and detonated a device inside his vehicle. Shots were fired.The police used surveillance video from a FedEx store in south Austin to track the suspect, and eventually through store receipts and cell phone technology found the suspect at a hotel in Williamson County.Since March 2, four bombs have exploded in Austin resulting in the death of two men and injuring five people. Early this week a fifth bomb exploded at a FedEx distribution centre in Schertz, 60 miles from the state capital. Police said the community needs to remain vigilant as they don’t know whether the suspect posted or placed other explosive packages.

Analysts had been looking for sales of $16.15bn, according to Thomson Reuters data.FedEx credited its results to higher base rates and a 6 per cent gain in average daily package volume growth. Increased volume and lower fuel prices helped to offset some drags including higher peak holiday season costs at its FedEx Express service as well as the impact from a cold and stormy winter in the US.Frederick Smith, FedEx chairman and chief executive, added:“Execution of our long-term growth strategies, customer demand for the unique value of our broad portfolio of solutions and healthy growth in the global economy are driving our performance. We expect strong operating performance in each of our transportation segments in the fourth quarter.”A $1.5bn benefit related to US tax reform helped FedEx’s profit soar over estimates to $2.07bn, or $7.59 a diluted share. Adjusted for special items, net income of $1.02bn, or $3.72, compared to adjusted earnings of $625m, or $2.30 a share, in the year-ago period.Analysts were looking for adjusted income of $825.12m, or $3.11 a share.FedEx has benefited from the growing popularity of ecommerce, as more consumers opt to shop at home and have their purchases delivered to their doors. But concerns have grown recently that it may soon face an existential threat from some of the same companies that bolstered it, with Amazon said to be eyeing a delivery service of its own.It said earlier on Tuesday that it was adding 500 new locations in Walmart stores across the US where customers can pick up or drop off packages.FedEx shares, which rose 34 per cent last year, are relatively flat so far in 2018. They rose more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading.

In Georgia, where Delta is based, lieutenant-governor Casey Cagle responded by vowing to block a tax bill that would benefit the airline “unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA”.The political backlash contrasts with the reaction to FedEx’s decision to maintain its discounts for NRA members, which has prompted social media calls to boycott the courier company, and highlights stark differences between states over gun policy.With Congress unlikely to agree on any changes to federal gun laws, the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead has sparked a round of policy action at state level. But some proposed measures look set to exacerbate a stark divergence in gun laws.While elected officials in left-leaning states seek to avert more mass shootings by tightening access to guns, their counterparts in conservative strongholds such as Georgia are seeking to loosen gun laws, in the belief that safety comes from more people carrying weapons.“Especially when Congress fails to act you often find states jump in — and this seems to be one of those moments,” said Robert Spitzer, the author of five books on gun policy and chair of the political science department at the State University of New York.He noted that the 2012 massacre that killed 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut inspired a wave of state-level policy measures, adding: “We’re not quite at that stage yet, but there’s clearly been a lot of movement.”On Monday, Gina Raimondo, the Democratic governor of Rhode Island, signed an executive order establishing a “red flag” policy aimed at keeping guns away from people deemed a threat to themselves or others — making Rhode Island the first state to take such a step since the Florida massacre.Last week, Ms Raimondo and the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced plans to share more information about people prohibited from owning a firearm in each state, and to trace guns transported across state borders.But in right-leaning Indiana, a state Senate committee passed a bill last week that would abolish a $125 lifetime fee for a handgun permit and a House committee advanced a bill that would let some people carry firearms on school property.In Kansas, the state Senate is considering a bill that would lower the age at which people can carry concealed weapons in public from 21 to 18.Mr Spitzer said the shift towards more lenient gun laws in parts of the US was driven by a combination of NRA lobbying clout and Republican lawmakers’ fears of being challenged from the right in primary elections this year.But he added that the changes tended to be “fairly incremental”, citing moves to let judges carry guns or to broaden the range of places where people are permitted to have concealed weapons.Others challenged the idea that gun policies were becoming more polarised. Billy Rosen, deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, a group campaigning to curb gun violence, said: “From our perspective, the good is outweighing the bad.”He added that since Sandy Hook, some bipartisan consensus had emerged on the need to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, with 25 states, including several led by Republicans, enacting laws to restrict access.“This is a hard battle. The gun lobby is working hard,” Mr Rosen said. “But I’m seeing more and more a shift where common sense prevails in blue states and even red states.”Some of America’s largest companies have felt emboldened to take public stances on issues ranging from transgender rights to race relations by surveys showing the public increasingly expects chief executives to speak out. Since the Florida shooting, polls have also shown a growing majority of Americans support tighter gun laws.Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who has funded gun control campaigns, hailed Delta’s move, telling the CECP conference of chief executives and investors on Monday “it doesn’t cost them anything” because most customers supported the stance.But in Georgia, Republican senator Rick Jeffares said on Twitter: “I’m leading the charge to let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable.”Delta offered no reaction on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York
29;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-02-27T00:53:26Z;FedEx defends NRA member discounts but backs assault rifle ban;Company says it will not discriminate against legal entities such as gun lobby group;FedEx has defended the discounts it offers members of the National Rifle Association, even as it made a statement on Monday strongly opposing the US gun lobby group’s stance on assault rifles and other gun safety issues. The courier company is the largest of the brands left offering special deals to the NRA’s 5m members after a number of companies, including Delta Air Lines and MetLife, cut ties with the gun lobby group following the February 14 shooting that left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.Campaigners, including students from the school, had responded by using social media to urge consumers to boycott FedEx. FedEx defended its stance, saying it was a “common carrier” under federal law “and therefore does not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views”.The NRA is one of hundreds of organisations to whose members it offers discounted shipping rates, the company said. Most brands that ended their partnerships with the NRA in recent days declined to explain their reasoning. In contrast, FedEx offered a detailed account of its stance on gun policy, noting that it differed with that of the NRA. “FedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,” the company said.“While we strongly support the constitutional right of US citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused. We therefore support restricting them to the military.”The gun debate remains one of America’s most divisive political subjects, and one on which few large companies have chosen to take a public stance, but two opinion polls published in the past week show a growing majority of US voters oppose the easy availability of assault rifles.US companies have become more outspoken on political issues ranging from marriage equality to climate change in the face of growing pressure from consumers, employees and investors.Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has funded gun legislation campaigns around the US, told a New York conference of investors and chief executives organised by CECP — The CEO Force For Good — that companies such as Delta had cut ties with the NRA because “they don’t care what the NRA does. They care about their customers, which is the public.”He said he doubted that Washington would introduce meaningful gun control legislation. “Congress is not rushing to walk away from the NRA. Why? Because their customer is the NRA. The NRA is funding their campaigns . . . They’ll do some meaningless stuff but they still want to get their money from the NRA.”

31;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-02-25T16:22:49Z;More US companies cut ties to NRA after school shooting;Pressure from customers and campaigners forces corporate America to act;"Airlines, banks, car rental companies, hoteliers and insurers have cut their ties to the National Rifle Association after the latest US school shooting, as pressure from customers and campaigners forced corporate America to take sides on one of the country’s most divisive social issues. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Starkey, a hearing aid manufacturer, said over the weekend that they would end the deals they had offered the NRA’s more than 5m members.They join a growing list of companies severing links with the gun lobby group since a teenager with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Their statements followed a social media campaign to boycott brands with NRA partnerships that had prompted similar moves from car rental brands including Avis, Enterprise and Hertz, hoteliers Best Western and Wyndham, insurers Chubb and MetLife, and Symantec, the technology group behind the LifeLock and Norton digital security brands.The speed with which so many companies have distanced themselves makes this one of the most effective boycott campaigns of recent years. Few of the companies volunteered the reasoning behind their actions, with most announcing their decisions in terse tweets, but First National Bank of Omaha said “customer feedback” had prompted it to end the contract under which it issued an NRA-branded Visa card. The NRA responded with a statement accusing the companies of punishing its law-abiding members “in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and pledging that the brands would be “replaced by others who recognise that patriotism and determined commitment to constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve”.Social media sites, under fire for helping promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods about the shooting, have helped project the boycott campaign, with Stoneman Douglas students Emma González amassing a larger Twitter following than the NRA. Ms González and fellow student David Hogg were among those using social media to put pressure on brands including FedEx that had maintained their NRA partnerships, and on politicians siding with the gun industry. Efforts to introduce tighter gun laws in the wake of past mass shootings have failed, but Mr Hogg predicted that his generation’s ability to mobilise on social media would make this shooting different.“You’ve had an entire generation of kids growing up around mass shootings and the fact that . . . they’re starting to be able to vote explains how we’re going to have this change,” he told ABC News.Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku also came under pressure from campaigners including Shannon Watts, founder of the gun reform group Moms Demand Action, as their digital video services carry NRATV, an NRA-owned channel which airs shows including Armed & Fabulous and Love at First Shot.The targets of the #neveragain campaign have extended beyond companies with direct deals with the NRA to include large money managers and local pension funds, including those managing money for teachers, which own shares in gun manufacturers. Among the companies reviewing their ties to gunmakers was Bank of America, which said on Saturday that it was joining others in its industry “to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings”.It declined to comment on which other companies were involved, but said: “An immediate step we’re taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.""Companies taking a stance on one of the most sensitive topics in US politics risk a backlash from NRA members and others on the right of US politics, but opinion polls show growing public concern about America’s gun laws.A Quinnipiac University poll last week reported that 66 per cent of US voters supported stricter gun laws, up from 47 per cent in December 2015, with 97 per cent backing universal background checks and two-thirds wanting a nationwide ban on assault weapon sales. A CNN poll published on Sunday said 70 per cent supported stricter gun laws, the highest level since 1993.The pressure on businesses to isolate the gun industry marks the latest occasion in which online campaigns have forced chief executives to speak out on political issues including climate change, immigration, and marriage equality.Last year, companies including Amazon and Nordstrom faced the #grabyourwallet consumer boycott campaign targeting retailers selling Trump brands, as CEOs such as Merck’s Kenneth Frazier resigned from Donald Trump’s manufacturing council and Walmart’s Doug McMillon criticised the president’s failure to repudiate white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia."
32;FDX;Fedex Corp;2018-02-09T12:26:51Z;Amazon said to be near own delivery launch, UPS, FedEx shares drop;;It’s the news that investors in parcel delivery heavyweights UPS and FedEx have been dreading.Shares in both companies fell more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Friday after a report said Amazon is just weeks away from launching a new service that would allow it to deliver more of its own packages.According to the Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce giant will roll out “in coming weeks” a new programme that will see it pick up packages from third party merchants on its website and deliver the goods to consumers.Dubbed “Shipping with Amazon” or SWA, the report said the service will initially be only offered in Los Angeles, but Amazon hopes to expand it to other cities later this year.Amazon has been making moves towards running its own delivery logistics network in recent years — filing patents for a drone delivery system, leasing planes, opening its own cargo air hub and buying a fleet of delivery trucks.But the SWA programme — rumours of which have been circulating for more than a year now — would mark Amazon’s boldest attempt yet to lessen its dependence on UPS and FedEx for the most crucial part of its appeal to shoppers — quick, reliable delivery.Report of the delivery move comes a day after Amazon announced plans to offer free two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year for its Prime members. The service began yesterday for customers in Austin, Cincinnati, Dallas and Virginia and will be rolled out to other cities this year.Shares in UPS, up just 2 per cent over the past 12 months, dropped 5.3 per cent ahead of the bell. Fedex shares fell 5.1 per cent, although they remain up more than 27 per cent over the past year.

Fedex also hit a fresh high above $250 a share, giving the company a market cap of more the $68bn.Investors and analysts pointed to figures from Amazon and the PMI data in explaining the gains. Amazon said on Tuesday that more than 5bn items shipped with Prime in 2017 while the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in December hit 60.6, its highest level since surveys began in mid-1997, according to figures released on Tuesday.“We re seeing accelerating global growth and still a relative low interest rate environment,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. “It points to a positive first day of trading for 2018.”
34;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
35;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx sees strong start to holiday season, expects big windfall from tax reform;;FedEx has become the latest US company to praise President Donald Trump’s tax reform plan, saying the proposed bill could boost its full year earnings by as much as $5.50 per diluted share.The parcel delivery group said a reduction in the main US federal corporate tax to 21 per cent from 35 per cent could increase earnings by between $4.40 to $5.50 per share for the current fiscal year, which ends on May 31.The comments come as FedEx said the strong growth in online shopping this holiday season should help the company mitigate some of costs it incurred from the devastating cyber attack on its TNT Express unit earlier this summer.“We are on track for another record holiday-shipping season,” said chief executive Frederick Smith.FedEx said it now expects fiscal 2018 earnings excluding pension adjustments to come in at $11.45 to $12.05 per share. That is up from the $11.05-$11.85 a share range it gave in September when it was forced to downgrade its view in light of the cyber attack. However it remains lower than its original forecast of $12.45-$13.25 a share.The change in guidance was given alongside FedEx’s fiscal second quarter results. For the three months to end of November, revenue was up more than 9 per cent to $16.3bn, easily topping analysts expectations of $15.7bn. Net income came in at $775m, or $2.84 a share compared to $700m or $2.59 a share in the year ago period. Adjusted for one-off items, net income was $3.18 a share, compared to expectations of $2.88 a share.Like rival UPS, Memphis-based FedEx is benefiting from the explosive growth in online shopping, which is driving up shipping volume at both is domestic and international units. The holiday shopping season tends to be both companies’ busiest and FedEx’s positive comments helped send its shares 1.3 per cent higher in after hours trading.

He also called on the private sector to improve accountability in denying North Korean and other malicious actors the ability to launch cyber attacks.The WannaCry attack in question drew on a tool developed by the US National Security Agency known as Eternal Blue, which allowed the malware to spread not via email, as is typical, but through file-sharing protocols set up across the internal networks of organisations – many of which criss-cross the globe.The result was one of the fastest-spreading and damaging cyber attacks to date. The virus itself, a piece of ransomware, had first been used in a less damaging form by criminal networks earlier in the year.
37;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-10-05T17:34:31Z;Amazon/UPS/FedEx: Ship shape;Amazon has managed to find a trickier business to jump into;E-commerce is a brutal, grinding business with scant profits and little margin for error. So Amazon naturally wants to drill deeper into another dicier business: transport and logistics. The internet juggernaut has a pilot programme in the US called Seller Flex. Here Amazon would deliver products to customers marketed on its website by third-party sellers, as part of the two-day free shipping programme called Prime.The latest foray into delivery should not be surprising for a company already investing in trucks, planes and drones. Shares in UPS and FedEx dipped following a Bloomberg report on Seller Flex but, for all the established companies that Amazon has hurt, the shipping companies may be the most resilient.UPS and FedEx have a collective enterprise value of nearly $200bn, after the sector essentially consolidated into a duopoly. Complex logistics requires technical expertise and capital investment on a scale only a handful of companies can match.The e-commerce boom has been a tailwind for the pair in recent years and its proportion of revenue is only supposed to accelerate. The problem is shipments to consumers are not as profitable as transporting to businesses. Residential customers are spread out, so resources (fuel, labour) are wasted delivering a gift to grandma.UPS and FedEx then have ramped up capital expenditures, together expected to be $10bn this year or nearly a 10th of revenue, in order to cluster deliveries more efficiently and create “synthetic density”.Such investments are worthwhile and compare favourably with retail. Both FedEx and UPS have operating margins greater than 10 per cent. UPS boasts a return on capital above 20 per cent.In 2016, net shipping expense at Amazon jumped 43 per cent, year over year, to $7bn (total retail revenue was 124bn). Amazon’s promises to customers about quick turnrounds has forced it to wade into an extremely expensive business where it will not be able to cut out FedEx and UPS altogether. And the part of the delivery chain it has entered happens to be the costliest. Amazon investors should be more worried than those at the shipping companies.
38;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;UPS, Fedex drop on Amazon own delivery service report;;First it was brick and mortar retailers. Then it was grocers. Now Amazon is reportedly looking to disrupt the package delivery industry with its own in-house service.Shares in UPS and Fedex both fell more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday after Bloomberg said Amazon is experimenting with a new delivery programme called “Seller Flex” in which the e-commerce juggernaut will pick up packages from third-party sellers on its website and deliver the goods to the consumers.Amazon has been making moves towards running its own delivery logistics network in recent years – filing patents for a drone delivery system, leasing planes, opening its own cargo air hub and buying a fleet of delivery trucks.But the Seller Flex service, which Bloomberg said has already started on a trial basis this year on the west coast with a broader roll-out planned in 2018, would mark Amazon’s boldest attempt yet to lessen its dependence on UPS and Fedex for the most crucial part of its appeal to shoppers – quick, reliable delivery.America’s addiction to online shopping was a boon for both UPS and Fedex with the surge in e-commerce related deliveries padding the companies’ bottom lines and sending their shares to fresh highs this year.

Hurricane Harvey, which caused deadly flooding in parts of Texas, also dragged on earnings.That combined to drive a 16.6 per cent drop in net income to $596m in the fiscal first quarter, from $715m in the year-ago period and translated to earnings of $2.19 a share in the first quarter, down from $2.65 a share in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.51 a share missed analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.09 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.However, revenues at FedEx, considered a bellwether for the economy, rose 4.1 per cent from a year ago to $15.3bn, in line with expectations.While most TNT Express operations resumed during the quarter, volume, revenue and profit still remained below previous levels, the company noted.The company also lowered its outlook for fiscal 2018 to reflect the estimated impact of the cyber attack. The company now expects earnings in the range of $11.05-$11.85 a share, down from its previous outlook for earnings of between $12.45-$13.25. That was below the $13.01 per share that analysts were looking for, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.FedEx said it was re-examining the cyber insurance market after the attack by the NotPetya virus. The virus began in Ukraine but hit companies in 60 different countries and was believed to have been “weaponised cyber tools that were stolen from the US governments”, said Robert Carter, a FedEx executive, on the earnings call.FedEx shares, which are up 16 per cent so far this year, declined 2.7 per cent in after-hours trade.

That translated to earnings of $2.19 a share in the first quarter, down from $2.65 a share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.51 a share missed analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.09 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.“The impact of the cyberattack on TNT Express and lower-than-expected results at FedEx Ground reduced our first-quarter earnings,” said Alan Graf Jr, chief financial officer. “We are currently executing plans to mitigate the full-year impact of these issues.”Global operations of TNT Express — the international express transportation, ground delivery and freight transportation group it acquired in 2016 — were “significantly affected” following the NotPetya cyberattack, which resulted in the disruption of its communications systems.The cyberattack had a negative impact on earnings of about 79 cents a share, while deadly Hurricane Harvey had an impact of about 2 cents a share.Meanwhile, operating income at its ground segment rose 3 per cent to $626m, slower than the 14 per cent growth seen in the prior-year quarter and 7 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of last year.Despite this, revenues at the Tennessee-based company rose 4.1 per cent to $15.3bn, broadly in line with expectations.*FedEx lowered its outlook for fiscal 2018 to reflect the estimated impact of the cyberattack. The company now expects earnings in the range of $11.05 to $11.85 a share, down from its previous outlook for earnings of between $12.45 to $13.25 a share.FedEx shares, which are up 16 per cent so far this year, declined 2.7 per cent in after-hours trade.Note: The piece was amended to reflect revenue expectations.

This figure included corporate, public and individual pensions.Agnes Grunfeld, author of the report and vice-president at MSCI, the data provider, said funding levels at corporate pensions globally have suffered since the financial crisis because of record-low interest rates, disappointing fixed-income yields and an ageing population.“There will be a lot of pensioners relying on these payments. If [businesses] get into enough of a hole, you worry about companies abandoning these payments,” she said.Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the asset management consultancy, said pension fund liabilities at companies across the world have ballooned because of low interest rates. Interest rates are used to calculate future liabilities.Unless rates rise to around four per cent, which nobody is expecting over the rest of this decade, many pension plans will struggle to honour their obligations“We are staring at a time bomb,” he said. “Unless rates rise to around four per cent, which nobody is expecting over the rest of this decade, many pension plans will struggle to honour their obligations.”Large pension deficits have contributed to the collapse of businesses, including BHS in the UK, leaving workers’ retirement income at risk.There are also fears that rising deficits could derail corporate expansion and hurt dividend payments, as companies plug funding holes.Ms Grunfeld said deficits are putting “huge pressure” on businesses. “Companies are not ignoring this. But it is hard to catch up when you have headwinds that you don’t have a lot of control over,” she said.“They are juggling all of these demands on their capital. Balance sheets are also suffering because of pension obligations,” she said.In recent years, many companies, including Verizon, Delta and FedEx, have attempted to tackle deficits by pumping additional cash into their pension schemes. Others, such as British Airways and the UK’s Royal Mail, have closed defined benefit schemes, which pay a retirement income based on an employee’s final earnings, or reduced benefits.Earlier this year, DuPont, which merged with Dow Chemical at the end of August, paid an extra $2.9bn into the company’s main pension fund to boost its funding level.“This action demonstrates that we are funding the pension and reducing the overall underfunding liability so that our plan participants can continue to rely on their pensions now and in the future,” the company said.Other corporate pension plans have responded to rising deficits by changing their investment strategies. Schemes are switching to liability-driven investing, which attempts to invest based on the future cash flow needs of a plan, or moving into riskier asset classes. Other businesses are offloading their schemes to insurance providers.Justin White, a principal at Casey Quirk, the consultancy, said this shift in investment strategy will have an impact on asset managers. “The underfunded issue affects how investors view their portfolios and the types of strategies they will demand,” he said.According to MSCI, companies operating in the utilities, telecoms and healthcare sectors have the largest underfunded benefits compared with revenues. MSCI said it used this metric to help account for a company’s size and as a link to its ability to pay future contributions.Swiss corporate pensions had the largest underfunding ratios in 2016, followed by the US, while Australian businesses had the smallest pension funding gap compared with revenues.John Ralfe, a pension consultant, said whether companies can cope with large deficits will depend on the business’s size.“The real problem for investors and pension schemes members are those companies where the pension liabilities and deficits are very large in relation to the market capitalisation of the company,” he said.

Some UK and Canadian residents were also affected, it said.On a special website set up to address consumers’ concerns, chairman and chief executive Rick Smith appeared in a video, saying that the hack “strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I deeply regret this incident and I apologise to every affected consumer and all of our partners.”Another potential complication for the company is that public filings show that three senior executives, including chief financial officer John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8m in the days after the attack was detected.With a breach like this, you’re going to be seeing fallout and aftershocks for many, many monthsAn Equifax spokesperson said the trio, who sold a “small percentage” of their holdings, “had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares”.Analysts noted that big companies are under near-constant bombardment from criminals, “hacktivists” and disaffected insiders, all trying to breach their defences.Attempts range from “watering hole” attacks, where employees gather at spoof websites that implant malware, to more complex schemes led by state-linked groups.The raid on Equifax comes in the wake of the WannaCry virus attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in 150 countries this May, debilitating the British National Health Service and companies including FedEx and Renault.Yahoo revealed last December that attacks between 2013 and 2016 had compromised the personal information of more than a billion users, data which included names, phone numbers, birth dates and passwords.Equifax is one of America’s big three credit-reporting agencies, along with Experian and TransUnion. The companies gather data on consumers’ borrowing habits, so that potential lenders can see what type of risk they would be taking in supplying a new credit card or loan.Equifax said on Thursday it had found no evidence of unauthorised access to its core consumer or commercial credit-reporting databases.Such a breach would have been “the kind of hack that financial nightmares are made of”, said Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law. Credit-reporting agencies “have all the critical details of your financial life that would enable a wrongdoer to wreak havoc with your finances,” he said.But George Avetisov, chief executive of HYPR, a provider of biometric authentication software, said the potential theft of personally identifiable information was serious enough.Such data are “a gold mine, better than any username or password cache you could want,” he said, noting that the information could be used to open new accounts or to perform social-engineering attacks.“You can change your username and password, but what are you going to do with your social security number?” he said. “With a breach like this, you’re going to be seeing fallout and aftershocks for many, many months.”
43;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-08-21T07:13:29Z;Total to buy Maersk Oil for $7.45bn;;Container shipping group AP Moller-Maersk has agreed to sell its oil and gas division to Total for $7.45bn, as it seeks to focus on its core transport and logistics businesses.The sale marks the first step in Maersk’s move to break itself up and is likely to be the biggest single transaction. Maersk will receive approximately $4.95bn in Total shares, and Total will assume $2.5bn of short term debt to fund the remainder of the deal. It will also take over all decommissioning obligations, worth around $2.9bn.The Danish group is getting rid of all its energy-related businesses – which also includes drilling rig and oil tanker units – to concentrate on being a transport and logistics group, centred on the world’s largest container shipping line. It gave itself a two-year deadline last September to achieve the break-up through sales, stock market listings, or mergers.Maersk has boosted its container business by buying Hamburg Süd, the German operator with a strong position in Latin America, for $4bn. It is also seeking to integrate closer Maersk Line with its port terminals business and other logistics arms in an attempt to become the UPS or FedEx of container logistics, according to Soren Skou, chief executive.Maersk said it expected to record a gain of about $2.8bn from the deal and that it would return a “material portion” of that to shareholders, subject to securing its investment-grade credit rating first. Shareholders could expect an extraordinary dividend, share buyback, or distribution of the Total shares Maersk will receive in the deal.Total promised to “maintain Maersk Oil’s strong position in the North Sea,” and its deal comes after it said last month it was ready to make acquisitions while global assets were still cheap.Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of Total, said in July that the company had a “strong balance sheet” and would “take advantage of the low-cost environment by being able to launch profitable projects and acquire resources under attractive conditions”.Total has proved more resilient than many other oil companies following the price slump that struck the industry from 2014, cutting costs faster and earlier, which is now allowing it to invest in new projects.It has already started making major investments, earlier this year signing a multibillion-dollar agreement to develop part of South Pars — the world’s largest gasfield shared between Iran and Qatar.The transaction is subject to regulatory approval from the Danish Minister of Energy and a consultation process with Total employees. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
44;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-08-03T23:38:40Z;Bats fires up debate over NYSE and Nasdaq closing auctions;Operator argues against objections put to SEC over proposal for alternative model;Bats, a unit of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, is hitting back at opponents of its efforts to create an alternative to the closing auctions run by rivals New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq in what is shaping up to be a sharp industry debate.The so-called closing auction is conducted by NYSE and Nasdaq, which handle nearly all US corporate listings, and produces the official closing prices each trading day. These are used by index providers and both active and passive asset managers to calculate levels and performance. With the growth of index investing and exchange traded funds, the closing auction has become an even more critical part of the overall system.In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bats argued against its opponents, including NYSE and Nasdaq, and their claims that its plan could hurt investors by, for example, fragmenting the auction and distorting prices.“Both Nasdaq and NYSE seem to be comfortable with creating duelling closing auctions themselves but they are unwilling to allow for a non-disruptive closing process when it creates competitive pressures on their revenues,” Bats said.While US equities trade on about a dozen exchanges and through a myriad of dark pools during the trading session, the official closing price is set through the auction on the listing venue. That guarantees a certain amount of trading volume to the home exchange. Growth of ETFs — which need to create or redeem shares by the close of trading — has contributed to an increase in volumes late in the trading day.Bats, which is the second-largest US exchange after NYSE but is the only corporate listing on its own exchange, has said that it proposed a competing process to NYSE and Nasdaq at the request of market participants including agency broker-dealers and asset managers, which would introduce competition and cut costs.Some large asset managers, such as T Rowe Price, however, oppose the plan, while S&P Dow Jones Indices, the owner of the benchmark S&P 500 index, has urged caution.“In keeping with the overall ethos of passive investing, SPDJ applauds any measures that decrease costs, increase transparency and generally result in greater utility for investors,” its chief executive Alex Matturri, said in a letter to the SEC. “However, given the increasing importance of the closing auction to those same investors, and the apparent concerns that a competing facility could have unintended consequences, we respectfully advise great caution in approaching any changes to this aspect of our market structure.”Listed companies such as FedEx have also urged the SEC not to approve Bats’ plan.Supporters of the Bats plan include Sifma, the US trade group for the securities industry, and rival exchange IEX.IEX, which is attempting to become a listing venue itself, has previously taken a few jabs at NYSE and Nasdaq, saying that their objections “are meritless and represent nothing more than an attempt to maintain monopoly control over closing market orders for listed stocks and the revenue those orders provide.”*This article has been amended. GTS, a high speed trader and designated market maker at NYSE, was erroneously listed as a supporter of the plan, but the company opposes it.
45;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-07-17T13:23:34Z;FedEx: Cyber attack ‘likely’ had material impact as effects linger;;FedEx, the package delivery company, disclosed on Monday that the cyber attack against its TNT Express unit “likely” had a material impact, with customers “still experiencing widespread service and invoicing delays”.The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said in a filing with US securities regulators that it had “experienced [a] loss of revenue due to decreased volumes at TNT and incremental costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and the remediation of affected systems”.“We cannot yet estimate how long it will take to restore the systems that were impacted, and it is reasonably possible that TNT will be unable to fully restore all of the affected systems and recover all of the critical business data that was encrypted by the virus,” FedEx said, adding that it does not have “cyber or other insurance in place that covers this attack”.FedEx said that it was impacted by the Petya virus, which began in Ukraine on June 27 before spreading to 60 countries. The malicious program encrypts, or scrambles, data, making it very difficult or sometimes impossible to restore it. Numerous other companies were also hit, including Mondelez and WPP, the advertising shop.In the case of the TNT attack, FedEx said that it was infected through a Ukrainian tax software product.TNT Express, which FedEx acquired towards the end of last year, is an international express transportation, ground delivery and freight transportation group. It operates in more than 200 countries.Read more:Petya attack raises fears of escalation of global cyber arms raceFedEx’s TNT Express unit ‘significantly affected’ by computer virus
46;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-07-07T16:46:51Z;Petya attack raises fears of escalation of global cyber arms race;Virulent malware sets alarm bells ringing among companies and security agencies;The Petya cyber attack, which struck organisations in more than 60 countries last week, has set alarm bells ringing for corporations and security agencies across the world. The virulence of the malware attack has raised fears of a new and dangerous escalation of the global cyber arms race.What is Petya and how did it start?Petya is the name given to the aggressive cyber attack which began in Ukraine on June 27, and spread to affect many of the world’s largest companies.Variants of Petya have been used in limited attacks for the past year, but this one was different. The malware was boosted with a suite a powerful capabilities and its operators used a more complex method of delivery than seen previously.The malware attack looked like a form of ransomware — upon infection, it encrypts its victims’ computer files and demands a ransom payment to unscramble them — but is in fact purely destructive in nature.After careful analysis of Petya and the methods used by its operators, cyber security experts and western intelligence officials believe a nation state rather than a criminal group is responsible. The prime suspect is Russia.Petya’s origins provide a clue to its purpose. The infection was deliberately targeted at Ukrainian organisations. Hackers penetrated the computer systems of a Ukrainian accounting software firm, MeDoc, weeks before the attack.In a complex and carefully plotted operation, they then hijacked a legitimate software update sent by the company to clients — which include many of the largest businesses and government departments in Ukraine — and used it to deliver Petya. Because the software update was genuine, Petya was able to bypass most firewalls or anti-virus systems.How did it spread from Ukraine?Like WannaCry, the ransomware attack which spread around the world in May, Petya made use of sophisticated tools to boost its virulence.Both WannaCry and Petya appear to have used US cyber weapons, designed by the National Security Agency and leaked online earlier this year in another operation linked to Russian intelligence.WannaCry depended on one weapon, known as Eternal Blue, which enabled it to spread far and wide across the internet. Petya makes use of several NSA weapons, grafted into its architecture with far greater care, however.Petya is not designed to spread across the web, but rather, is focused on being able to much more effectively spread within closed organisational networks.The malware spread worldwide because many large international businesses had subsidiaries in Ukraine with computer systems linked into their global networks.Once Petya was delivered into those organisations through the MeDoc accounting update, its ability to exploit local administrator privileges allowed it to rapidly move up the chain and break out of Ukraine.How come corporate victims proved so susceptible?Whereas WannaCry could be stopped by simply updating outmoded software, Petya overcame such limitations with its exploitation of administrator privileges.This allowed it to spread with relative freedom within networks using legitimate credentials. The malware’s initial delivery method — what cyber security professionals refer to as the attack vector — was also particularly hard to guard against.Nation state hackers, in particular Russia, have become increasingly adept at exploiting third-party organisations such as law firms, accountants or consultants as stepping stones in their attacks.Organisations are no longer as vulnerable as their weakest computer but their corporate partners’ weakest computers too. For multi-nationals with hundreds of relationships across the world, this is a particular challenge.How much damage has been done?Some of the world’s largest multinationals were severely hit by Petya.Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, has warned of a 3-percentage-point cent drop in sales growth because of disruptions to shipping and invoices. Reckitt Benckiser, known for Durex condoms and Nurofen painkillers, predicted a £110m sales hit.Others affected include WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, Maersk, the biggest shipping company, TNT, the package delivery arm of US-based FedEx, and DLA Piper, the global law firm. All telephone and email communications at DLA Piper were knocked out for two days after the Petya attack.So far only Mondelez and Reckitt have revealed the financial impact of the malware, but others will have lost revenues and incurred costs from repairing or replacing IT systems.As companies count the damage the malware has inflicted on their operations, many are likely to invest more in cyber security.How likely is another attack?Cyber security experts fully expect more attacks of this nature. Petya did not come as a complete surprise: attacks on Ukrainian businesses have been increasing in recent months, including attacks utilising ransomware for destructive purposes. Cyber aggressors’ tolerance for collateral damage is increasing too.Western security experts worry what Petya may indicate about Russia’s willingness to do huge damage to businesses in pursuit of its foreign policy goals. Cyber experts meanwhile warn that whoever is responsible for Petya are unlikely to have exhausted their arsenal.Using — and consequently losing — MeDoc as an extremely effective attack method against Kiev probably indicates the attackers have even more powerful tools and methods still to play, Talos, the security arm of Cisco, warned this week.
47;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-07-07T15:36:29Z;Companies must quickly count the cost of cyber crime;Reckitt’s chief did the right thing in nailing down the numbers and disclosing them;This week, two of the world’s largest consumer groups Reckitt Benckiser and Mondelez each warned that their sales would be meaningfully hit by last week’s Petya cyber attack that spread outward from Ukraine and paralysed hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.The malware encrypted and effectively destroyed vital data, disrupting orders, shipping and other functions at each company. Ten days on, neither has fully recovered.Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, said the attack had shaved 3 percentage points off its growth rate for the quarter ended June 30, although it hopes to recover some of the lost revenue in the coming months. Reckitt, best known for Nurofen painkillers and Durex condoms, projected a 2 per cent sales drop for the quarter and a 1 percentage point fall in its full year growth rate, adding up to an estimated hit to sales of £110m.The other public companies that were hit have been less forthcoming. Shipping group AP Moller-Maersk, whose ports and order-taking systems were crippled for days, said it is still focused on recovery. “At some point of course we will need to [give numbers to the market] but we are not there yet.” And TNT, an arm of US logistics group FedEx, said it “cannot measure the financial impact” but noted that it “could be material”.Advertising group WPP has also been vague on the financial impact. “Our focus has been on restoring normal service,” WPP said. “At this stage, it is not possible to provide any further information.” The company said it was on track to provide accurate financial information with its half-year results. The WPP website suggests that investors will be waiting until some time in late August.I have sympathy for companies that are still struggling to figure out what they have lost. Transparency without the full facts can be dangerous. Back in 2015, UK mobile phone operator TalkTalk went public very quickly after being hacked. It initially warned that personal data including bank details of up to 4m customers had been stolen. The shares tanked and it suffered a customer exodus. The real number of compromised accounts later turned out to be just 156,000 people and, of them, fewer than 16,000 had bank account details stolen.TalkTalk officials defend their approach, arguing that they had a duty of care and needed to warn customers that they were vulnerable to scams and credit card fraud. However investors, who saw the company’s shares lose 40 per cent of their value in the four months after the attack, may well wish TalkTalk had been more tight-lipped in the early days after the attack.Stock exchanges, quite rightly, require companies to keep their investors up to date. So Reckitt chief executive Rakesh Kapoor pushed his team to get the numbers nailed down. “I’m quite pleased we managed to quantify, to the extent possible, the impact on the third working day of the month,” he said. “This is an area where we’ve gone faster than anyone else.”The market reaction suggests Mr Kapoor did the right thing. Reckitt shares had been falling all week as it struggled to recover. They dropped a bit more after the announcement, but have started to recover now that investors have the facts.Cyber attacks are frightening and hard for investors to evaluate. Other companies facing similar questions ought to follow Mr Kapoor’s example.brooke.masters@ft.com
48;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-07-05T01:16:39Z;Maersk, WPP and FedEx still struggling with cyber attack fallout;Groups still feeling effects a week after ransomware spread from Ukraine;Global companies ranging from shipping lines to advertising firms are still struggling with the havoc wreaked by the huge cyber attack that last week swept from Ukraine to organisations in more than 60 countries. AP Moller-Maersk, WPP, Reckitt Benckiser and FedEx all said their businesses were still not back to normal after the ransomware attack last week compromised hundreds of thousands of computers, industrial equipment and other technology. Some ports remain hobbled, packages are going missing and customers are struggling to place and track orders, the companies said.The continuing disruption at some of the world’s largest companies reflects the complexity of the attack, which cyber security analysts and western intelligence officials now believe was the work of a hostile government rather than a criminal group. Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company, on Tuesday said it had been forced to reroute ships to alternative destinations after IT systems were debilitated and it was unable to dock and unload containers at some of its 76 ports. Eleven of them were continuing to experience problems, with one terminal in Rotterdam totally unable to dock or unload ships. The company said business should return to usual “within a week”.“We’re bringing applications online according to priority and to restore critical business functions,” Maersk said. “Before we can say that we are totally up and running we really need more systems to be up, such as back-up systems for employees here.” The company, which is based in Copenhagen, was forced to suspend its main platforms for taking orders for six days. These were back up and running on Monday, but in a message to customers, Maersk said some functions, including a tracking service that allows businesses to monitor their shipping consignments, were still not functional. Ukrainian officials on Tuesday stepped up their accusations that Russia was behind the attack. The country’s security services chief Vasyl Hrytsak said: “All of this was done under the guise of financial gain but in reality the purpose was to destabilise the situation inside our country.” He added that Ukrainian, US, British and Microsoft experts were investigating together.FedEx customers took to social media to complain that packages had not arrived after the US group’s TNT package delivery arm continued to be affected: “So beyond angry with @TNTUKCare, I have two very large shipments missing which have meant I’ve missed deadlines,” said one entrepreneur on Twitter.TNT said the company was responding to customers over social media and on the phone. “We are continuing to make solid progress. Certain types of goods are more affected, there may be variations from one place to others.” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, wrote to staff over the weekend, saying progress had been faster in some areas than others. “Given the scope of the attack, there is no instant, universal fix.”Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods group that sells everything from Durex condoms to Nurofen painkillers said that it still had “outstanding issues” and would continue to update customers. It warned customers last week that they could encounter delays receiving products.Rosneft, the Russian oil producer that was also hit by the ransomware, told the Financial Times that its retail operations had returned to normal. It had previously said its production processes had not been affected.

It operates in more than 200 countries.The news comes just a day after some of the world’s largest companies were hit with a large-scale cyber attack that was similar to the WannaCry ransomware attack last month. It was not immediately clear whether the two issues were related.FedEx also offered the following details about the TNT Express services:TNT Express domestic country and regional network services are largely operational, but slowed.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were $4.25 a share, handily beating estimates for $3.87.Revenue clocked in at $15.7bn, better than the $15.5bn predicted and improving on the $13bn in sales reported during the same period a year earlier. Net income was $1.02bn, a hair off the $1bn expected.The company attributed the profit and sales beats to higher base rates and increased package volume, among other factors, as shipping companies like FedEx stand poised to cash in on the boom in e-commerce sales.Although it was unable to provide full-year GAAP earnings estimates for its fiscal 2018 — which began June 1 — FedEx says it is projecting $13.20-14.00* per diluted share, before accounting for year-end pension accounting adjustments and excluding expenses related to the integration of TNT Express business. That compares to diluted earnings per share of $11.07, or $12.30 adjusted for special items, that it posted in its fiscal 2017.It is earmarking $5.9bn for capital spending in its new fiscal year, including modernisation of its aircraft fleet to help boost deliveries and expand its FedEx Ground automation capabilities and capacity.“Investments to modernise our aircraft fleet and expand our FedEx Ground capacity are supporting our strong earnings growth,” said FedEx chief financial officer Alan Graf. “We are very optimistic about fiscal 2018 as evidenced by our earnings outlook.”The company’s shares have risen more than 27 per cent over the past 12 months. After the earnings announcement, they ticked up an additional 1.5 per cent.Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA Research, raised his 12-month price target on FedEx from $240 to $270 per share after the release, writing: “We see strong global demand likely driving volume and pricing growth over the next two years. We think FDX is well positioned to benefit from strong e-commerce growth that we expect in the coming years.”*This post clarifies the adjusted earnings guidance.

The domain was inactive, the communication failed, and so WannaCry’s code told it to carry on.This initial step would later prove to be the attack’s Achilles heel, but for the first few hours, it would go unnoticed and WannaCry would be left to propagate unhindered.Phase two of that first WannaCry infection was to find out what file-sharing arrangements the computer had, and begin exploiting them.To do so, it deployed its secret weapon — or rather, a weapon that had once been someone else’s secret: a repurposed cyber spying tool known as EternalBlue, stolen from the US National Security Agency and leaked online.———————1. On Friday morning Spanish mobile operator Telefónica was among the first large organisations to report infection by WannaCry2. By late morning, hospitals and clinics across the UK began reporting problems to the national cyber incident response centre3. In Europe, French carmaker Renault was hit; in Germany, Deutsche Bahn became another high-profile victim4. In Russia, the ministry of the interior, mobile phone provider MegaFon, and Sberbank became infected.5. Although WannaCry’s spread had already been checked, the US was not entirely spared, with FedEx being the highest-profile victim———————With EternalBlue, WannaCry, unlike almost every other form of ransomware — a malicious software that encrypts victims’ data and demands payment to release it — has become one of the most destructive cyber attacks ever seen.EternalBlue exploits a security loophole in Windows operating systems that allows a malicious code to spread through structures set up to share files — such as dropboxes and shared drives for documents or databases — without permission from users.“The widespread use of filesharing between organisations is to some extent a dream come true for a cyber criminal,” says Darren Thomson, chief technology officer of Symantec, the anti-virus and web security company. “If you can exploit a filesharing vulnerability, then you can get to tens or even hundreds of thousands of users.”What to expect, who to tell and how to limit the damageBy mid-morning, WannaCry had used EternalBlue to do just that, and tunnel through such file-sharing networks from its “patient zero” machine across the world.Spain’s Telefónica, the mobile phone operating giant, was among the first to announce publicly it had a problem. By mid-morning, employees across the company were finding themselves locked out of their work terminals. Telefónica subsidiaries in South America were affected too.In Britain, the impact of WannaCry was far more serious. At about 11am, the first hospitals in the UK began to report a ransomware attack to the national cyber incident response centre. By lunchtime, emergency services were being pulled and hospital facilities across the country were brought down.The list of infected organisations would swell dramatically in the next few hours: Chinese petrol stations operated by the state oil company had payment systems cut off; German railways lost control of their passenger information system; and FedEx’s logistical operations were disrupted.Cleaning up the mess and trying to work out the scale of the threat and how it spread is no easy task. “We’re still digging but the people with the best data — the victims — are basically burnt to the ground and have more high-priority items at this point than figuring that out,” said a senior US cyber researcher.Security analysts stress it could have been worse but for the actions of an anonymous British security researcher. After lunch on Friday, a 22-year-old cyber analyst, who writes online under the pseudonym MalwareTech, returned to his desk and spotted something crucial in WannaCry’s code — the first stage of its infection process. The obscure web address the ransomware was querying, he noticed, was unregistered and inactive. So he bought it for $11 and activated it.It turned out to be a form of “kill switch” baked into WannaCry by its creators. Activating the address told the ransomware, upon each new infection, not to proceed any further. Once he had control of it, WannaCry was stopped in its tracks.————————FT View: The WannaCry attack is a wake-up call
What is WannaCry and how can it be stopped?
Microsoft slams US ‘stockpiling’ of cyber weapons————————The respite, analysts warn, may yet prove short lived. WannaCry’s creators could yet rejig the code and start again.For law enforcement, meanwhile, the hunt is on to identify who those creators might be. The task is unenviable.“Many factors will help narrow down the search, such as the compile times, the languages the original code was written in, but direct attribution will not be possible until a person or people responsible are found,” said James Chappell, chief technology officer of Digital Shadows, a cyber intelligence firm.A key goal, British security officials said, will be to locate the command and control servers for WannaCry. But the hackers have not made that easy. WannaCry communicates with them through TOR, a deep web network designed by the US Navy to anonymise users and makes them almost impossible to track.“If I was a betting man, I would say this was most likely an organised criminal group,” said John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at Fidelis. “They are going to be found. They’ve just put themselves on the top of everybody’s dinner plate.”Perhaps it’s time to ask if we really need bitcoin / From Guy Wroble, Denver, CO, US"
52;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-05-12T19:14:44Z;What is WannaCry and how can it be stopped?;Designers super-charged ransomware using tools leaked by US National Security Agency;"Dozens of organisations and networks worldwide have been hit by a cyber weapon known as WannaCry. Already it has proved itself to be one of the most virulent and potentially destructive cyber attacks ever observed.Telefónica, the multinational Spanish telecoms network which owns O2, was among the first to report news they had been infected early on Friday afternoon. Hospitals across Britain’s National Health Service have been among the highest profile victims: patients have been affected as critical services and records were taken offlinePortugal Telecom was a victim, as was FedEx in the US, while reports were emerging of infections in Asia — such as universities in China — and across the rest of Europe. The attack used a category of virus known as ransomware. Once infected, a target’s computer has its files encrypted. The user then gets a ransom demand — usually asking for payment in a “crypto currency” such as bitcoin — which must be paid in order for access to be restored.Ransomware’s use has been on the rise. “We have seen it grow very rapidly,” said Darren Thomson, chief technology office for the cyber security firm Symantec. “Globally, we have seen a 36 per cent increase year-on-year.”There are at present more than 100 known families of ransomware propagating online. WannaCry is one of the newest. So far the perpetrators are unknown but western security agencies are scrambling to find out. Their current working hypothesis is that WannaCry’s latest incarnation, despite its incredible destructive reach, is still being wielded by a criminal organisation rather than a state or a state-backed group. According to cyber intelligence analysts studying the “dark web”, payments demanded by the ransomware’s operators can be linked back to a single bitcoin account.Until now, ransomware was regarded as a relatively rudimentary threat. It is usually spread through emails that are sent en masse to target unwary individuals. Attacks against organisations and businesses are far more unusual. Big organisations usually have sophisticated detection methods to prevent and contain infections.The version of WannaCry that spread so rapidly on Friday is different, however: its designers have supercharged it by using tools leaked by the most powerful cyber arsenal in the world — that owned by the US National Security Agency.The FT has spoken to several senior cyber security researchers and western government officials who have confirmed that NSA tools are likely to have been used by the hackers. They say an NSA tool known as Eternal Blue looks like it has been incorporated into the ransomware’s architecture; Eternal Blue allows the ransomware to spread laterally across businesses’ computer networks through a vulnerability in commonly used Windows file-sharing systems.The vulnerability explains why WannaCry has metastasised so rapidly around the world, jumping between any linked organisations that may have file-sharing arrangements set up for business purposes. As such, it has highlighted the greatest vulnerability of our increasingly interconnected digital environment. Scrubbing malware from systems is an arduous and lengthy task. The scale of infections in this case already suggests it may be an impossible one.Governments and law enforcement agencies will probably try to identify the “command and control” servers from which the malware is being run. If intelligence efforts can pinpoint those and seize control of them, then the encryption keys could be released to all infected networks.An alternative may be that WannaCry’s operators turn over the keys themselves: the success of the ransomware has made them the top global target for the west’s cyber security community overnight. Even the most hardened criminal organisation is likely to worry about such prominence. This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that Energias de Portugal took precautionary measures under police advice, but was not affected."
53;FDX;Fedex Corp;2017-04-11T02:36:52Z;FedEx Freight calls for US self-driving truck regulations;Chief seeks uniform standards for technology that is ‘coming faster than people think’;The head of FedEx Freight has called for aviation-style federal rules to govern autonomous trucking in the US, at a time when the regulatory future of self-driving trucks is still undecided.Michael Ducker, chief executive of FedEx Freight, one of the largest shipment companies in the US, told the Financial Times that it was regulation and social acceptance, not technology barriers, that would determine how soon self-driving tech became widely adopted in US trucking. “It is coming faster than many people think, just because technology is advancing so rapidly,” Mr Ducker said. “I think technology will lead, and sociological issues will lag, in this particular case.”While many self-driving car companies have lobbied to test passenger vehicles with no human drivers (and even no steering wheels), large logistics and trucking companies are taking a different approach, one that emphasises a continued role for the driver. Mr Ducker used the analogy of aeroplane pilots, who are highly trained even though aeroplanes mostly use autopilot, as an illustration of what automated trucking could look like. Trucking is the primary method of freight shipment in the US, accounting for more than 70 per cent of goods shipped and generating more than $700bn in revenues a year. Trucking is expected to be the first industry to test self-driving technology on a wide scale, because of the financial incentives for trucking companies and the relative ease of driving on highways. One concern for many trucking companies is to avoid fragmented regulations at the state level, which is the current situation, and instead to have uniform federal regulation for automated trucks. Mr Ducker said one possibility would be “standardised nationwide certification processes, just like you do for aviation”, adding that he discussed this with lawmakers in Washington last week. The US Department of Transportation is expected to issue its first guidelines for self-driving trucks later this year, which will be the first time it has addressed the issue. The lack of federal guidelines has hampered technologies such as platooning, in which one truck closely follows another, because different states have different minimum following distances. The DoT issued similar guidelines for smaller self-driving passenger vehicles last year. However, some in the industry caution that there is also a danger of over-regulation at a time when the technology is not fully developed. “We are in a homework phase right now. We need to understand what the technology needs,” said Chris Spear, chief executive of the American Trucking Associations. “Innovation is driving this, not regulation.”Another important issue for trucking automation is how much the government will invest in the digital infrastructure for self-driving technologies. Logistics companies have long lobbied for more government spending on roads and highways — and now that wishlist includes better technology to help vehicles communicate with each other and with their operation bases.The US government is expected open up a new portion of the spectrum — 5.9GHz — which the ATA and others have urged should be used exclusively for vehicle communications.

But by the close of trading on Wednesday, the stock gained 2.1 per cent, reversing its initial decline.An important component of that reversal came on the company’s earnings call with discussion of the profitability of FedEx’s so-called ground segment that handles deliveries over land using roads.FedEx has invested heavily in the business in an attempt take advantage of the rise in ecommerce as bricks and mortar shops and department stores continue to struggle.But that investment has placed a drag on profitability due to the capital expenditure. On Wednesday, FedEx indicated that the decline in margins has hit a bottom.“The question was when are we going to see ground margins recover?” said Jack Atkins, an analyst at Stephens. “They talked about a 15 per cent margin in the fourth quarter, which is much higher than I was expecting.”FedEx also discussed the growth of its express service since the acquisition of competitor TNT Express in May 2016.It offered combined profit forecasts for the first time since the acquisition of $1.2bn to $1.5bn in operating profit improvement.But despite the positive forward guidance, some analysts warn that investors should not forget the earnings miss.Despite rising ground margins, as the company slows its expansion efforts, top-line growth may moderate, says David Vernon, an analyst at Bernstein Research.“When you put the whole thing together and look out to 2020, the net is slightly positive,” he said. “There are, however, a lot of moving parts and a slower rate of investment in ground may make it harder to hit consensus estimates for top-line growth in that segment.”Elsewhere, sneaker giant Nike reported weak quarterly sales on Tuesday, and following a call with investors on Wednesday, the company’s stock price fell more than 7 per cent after it unveiled a mixed bag of indicators about its future performance.Executives said that Nike brand future orders were down 4 per cent, or 1 per cent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same time last year.The quarterly results underscore investors’ concerns that rivals like Adidas and Under Armour are gaining on Nike, a long-time leader in the market for trainers and athletic apparel.The S&P 500 healthcare sector edged 0.1 per cent higher, ahead of a contentious vote on Thursday for President Donald Trump’s reforms hitting the sector.Large health insurance company Aetna tailed into the New York afternoon, down 0.6 per cent to 128.33, while rivals Humana fell 0.1 per cent and Anthem shrunk 0.3 per cent. Cigna, however, rose 0.5 per cent.

Wall Street analysts had projected EPS of $2.62.Revenues rose to $15bn, from $12.7bn in the same three-month period in the previous year, matching estimates.The company’s shares dropped by almost 3 per cent in after-hours action. They had been up by 3 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close.FedEx said that the results were impacted by the “significantly negative” impact of fuel prices and one fewer operating day at its FedEx Express and FedEx Ground units. It was also impacted by a an expansion of its ground network.“These factors were partially offset by the benefits from yield growth at all of the company’s transportation segments,” FedEx said.Net income was $562m in the fiscal third quarter, up from $507m in the same quarter in the previous year.

After the US logistics group had its plans thwarted, its arch-rival FedEx bought TNT.The EU’s general court ruled that the commission “infringed UPS’ rights of defence” by basing its final decision on an econometric analysis that had changed from that discussed with UPS during the process.“This is a significant defeat for the commission,” said Nicholas Levy, an antitrust lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, noting that it was the first time in more than a decade that the court found that the regulator wrongly blocked a transaction.The setback comes as Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner, is weighing approvals on three megadeals — Dow Chemical’s $140bn merger with Dupont, ChemChina’s $44bn purchase of Syngenta and Deutsche Börse’s €29bn bid for the London Stock Exchange, which is struggling to win approval.Brussels may appeal the court’s decision, which opens the regulator to potential damages claims from UPS as well as TNT shareholders who lost out when the deal was blocked.However, “the bar for a damages action is significantly higher [than it was for the current ruling]”, said Georg Berrisch, antitrust litigator at Baker Botts, adding potential damages claims from investors are likely ‘an uphill battle’ but are “not without prospect of success”.[The error identified by the court this week] concerns the commission’s handling of evidence and its respect for the merging parties’ rights of defenceThe last time the courts overruled the regulator’s decision to block a deal was in 2002 when the judges annulled three decisions in one year — in the proposed deals of Airtours/First Choice, Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel.The error identified by the court this week “concerns the commission’s handling of evidence and its respect for the merging parties’ rights of defence, exposing shortcomings that the great package of reforms passed [by then-competition commissioner Mario Monti] in 2003 following a trilogy of similar judgments by the EU Courts were designed to address,” said Mr Levy.Economic models are increasingly important evidence in antitrust regulators’ analysis in Europe, the US and beyond. “Over the past decade, in particularly difficult merger cases, the economic analysis has become more and more important,” said Jonas Koponen competition lawyer at Linklaters.“It is fine to develop new techniques in order to understand and predict the effect of mergers and analyse competitive effects but it’s important also that the investigative process is sufficiently open to the parties in order to test that evidence before the final decisions are made,” added Mr Koponen.Joaquín Almunia, then competition commissioner, blocked the UPS-TNT merger in January 2013, citing concerns that the deal would have drastically reduced choice and would be likely to increase prices for small-parcel delivery in the EU.TNT was subsequently bought by FedEx for €4bn in a deal unconditionally approved in January 2016 by Ms Vestager. The tie-up did not raise concerns “because FedEx and TNT are not particularly close competitors and because the merged entity will continue to face sufficient competition from its rivals in all markets concerned,” said Ms Vestager on the day of approval.She noted that competition authorities replicated the assessment used in the UPS/TNT case to ensure “full consistency with its previous practice”.UPS welcomed Tuesday’s result and said “the most significant aspect of this decision is its impact in helping to preserve a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval”.The commission will “carefully analyse” the judgment. It said it fully recognised the importance of giving parties the full rights of defence and “strives to give parties ample and sufficient opportunities to comment and respond to the economic and econometric analysis that the commission relies upon in merger cases, notably in its in-depth investigations”.

Earlier this month, both indices closed at record levels, which is viewed by some investors as a sign of good news to come. The transports are also closely scrutinised as a barometer of broader US economic growth.Shares of Kirby, which operates tank barges, climbed 6 per cent to $68.50, Ryder System gained 2 per cent to $73.54, FedEx rose 2 per cent to $188.54 and UPS advanced 2 per cent to $106.97.Despite the enthusiasm for shipping groups, the same investor appetites did not extend to airline stocks on Friday. The NYSE Arca airline index was barely positive for the day and has lagged of late after climbing to a 15-year year higher earlier this year.The stocks have come under pressure as fuel and labour costs have risen, alongside concern a travel ban implemented by the Trump administration could curtail demand from some international markets.Shares of SkyWest dropped 5 per cent to $35.05 while Allegiant Travel and Alaska Air Group were down less than 1 per cent to $162.20 and $94.25, respectively. An advance of less than 1 per cent by Delta, United and American offset those declines.
58;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-12-22T11:47:01Z;Amazon: Cloud Atlas;Traditional carriers will need to innovate;Drones have started delivering packages for Amazon. FedEx is troubled by more earthly issues. Quarterly results this week disappointed analysts. The blame sits with the company’s ground transportation unit, which delivered its lowest margin since 2008. The companies’ differing fortunes highlight the scale of the change in customer behaviour as shoppers demand ever speedier home delivery.All carriers could ultimately benefit from increased demand for package transportation. Indeed, group revenue and net income have increased at FedEx year-on-year. But operating margins at the company’s Ground segment, which covers city-to-city shipping as well as the expensive “last mile” to the consumer, were lower than any time in 2008. Increased revenue from more packages and higher prices were offset by steeper costs.This could be a salutary tale. Amazon has such deep pockets that it can contemplate developing drones to circumvent the asset-heavy last mile journey that truck deliveries require. At the same time, the logistics parvenu is running more and more airborne deliveries using its own aircraft fleet, as an FT analysis has shown.Amazon’s planes are a threat to FedEx’s air-delivery segment FedEx Express, the only one that did not suffer year-over-year margin contractions. These flights mostly move items between Amazon warehouses. The company has more than doubled its activity in the past year.The strategy is not without risk, of course. Owning and leasing planes and other transportation equipment that Amazon could acquire is expensive. Labour disputes and strikes grounded flights earlier this year. But Amazon has a proven ability to bear capex costs or entice consumers to pay them. Traditional carriers will need to innovate instead of waiting until Amazon writes its success on the sky. Its footprint on the ground is already formidable.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.90 a share, eclipsed estimates for $2.79 a share.The Tennessee-based company said revenue rose nearly 20 per cent to $14.7bn, just ahead of estimates for $14.6bn.Like its rival UPS, FedEx, has benefitted from the growth in online shopping. The company, which acquired rival TNT Express last year in a move to grow its footprint in Europe, said the integration is “proceeding smoothly”.FedEx also said it would increase its express shipping rates by an average of 3.9 per cent, while ground, home delivery and freight rates will rise by an average of 4.9 per cent.Its adjusted full-year earnings outlook in the range of $10.85 to $11.35 a share, was just of expectations for $11.89 a share. However, excluding TNT Express integration costs the company expects to earn between $11.85 to $12.35 a share.FedEx shares, which have climbed 9 per cent so far this year, rose 1.4 per cent in extended trading.

63;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-06-21T22:12:43Z;FedEx defies sluggish trade growth but faces big pension writedown;Express parcel service’s adjusted net income beats expectations;FedEx, the express parcel service, shrugged off concerns about sluggish world trade growth when it reported adjusted net income for the three months ended May that beat expectations, up 19 per cent at $897m.However, the unadjusted figures were hit by $946m in pension accounting adjustments, expenses for the company’s €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express and charges for a legal case. The figures together pushed the company into a $70m net loss for the quarter under generally-accepted accounting principles, a figure that was still far better than the $895m net loss for the same quarter in 2015 on the same basis.The quarter marked the latest of a series when FedEx has outstripped analysts’ expectations for its adjusted results. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $3.30, against a consensus forecast of $3.27. The company also forecast adjusted earnings for the year to May 31 2017 up 11 per cent on the $10.80 achieved in 2015-16.The results were achieved in spite of a worldwide slowdown in trade growth that has severely affected some transport modes, particularly container shipping.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the past year had been a successful one “in many ways”.“Of particular note was our corporate operating margin improvement,” he said.However, the unexpectedly big writedowns sent the shares down 0.6 per cent in after-market trading in New York, to $163.FedEx and UPS, its bigger rival, have experienced a significant increase in business because of rising ecommerce volumes, but are also grappling with the challenges of unprecedented patterns of demand. Ecommerce customers often prefer cheaper, slower delivery methods to the premium services that FedEx’s traditional business users like.The changing preferences helped push up revenue in the cheaper-to-use FedEx Ground segment 20 per cent for the quarter, to $4.29bn, while operating income grew 9 per cent to $656m. The rise reflected 10 per cent growth in volumes and a change to the accounting treatment of the company’s SmartPost service.Revenue at the core FedEx Express air parcel business was flat at $6.72bn. Operating income more than doubled, from $322m to $757m, partly because last year’s results were depressed by $276m in charges, mainly for an impairment in the value of some aircraft.The company — whose results release was considerably different from previous quarters because of changes in Securities and Exchange Commission rules — said it was unable to provide a GAAP forecast for its new financial year. It said it was unable to predict the level of mark-to-market pension value adjustments or the costs of integrating TNT Express, whose takeover was completed on May 25.Excluding pension and integration costs, however, the company said it expected to achieve full-year earnings per share of between $11.75 and $12.25.
64;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx reports quarterly loss, shares fall;;Investors soured on US package delivery provider FedEx as the company reported a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter even as adjusted earnings topped analysts’ estimates.Shares in FedEx slid 1.5 per cent in extended trading after the Tennessee-based company reported a net loss of $70m or 26 cents a share in the three months ended in May, compared with a loss of $895m or $3.16 a share in the year ago period.However, adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $3.30 a share, topped analysts’ estimates for $3.28 a share.Sales rose 7.4 per cent to $13bn, ahead of estimates for $12.8bn.For the full-year the company forecast earnings in the range of $11.75 to $12.25 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates for $11.96 a share. These forecasts exclude the impact of TNT Express results — the Dutch company FedEx acquired last year — and the mark-to-market pension adjustments.Investors have been anxious about the threat to US couriers like FedEx and UPS from ecommerce retailer Amazon, which earlier this year announced that it had entered into agreements with Air Transport Services Group to lease 20 air cargo planes to support one and two-day delivery in the US.FedEx shares have advanced 10 per cent so far this year.

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.When FedEx, the express parcel delivery service, reports results investors will be eager to gauge how far it can continue to turn rising package volumes into improved profits.Analysts expect earnings per share for the three months to the end of May up 23 per cent on the same period last year, at $3.27. Those figures are in line with FedEx’s own forecast when it announced figures for the quarter to the end of February.At that point, it tightened its guidance for adjusted earnings per share for the year to May 31 from a range of $10.40-$10.90 per share to $10.70-$10.90, around 22 per cent up on the 2014-15 year.The recent growth for FedEx and UPS, its bigger rival, has come predominantly from ecommerce. That has driven particularly strong growth in FedEx Ground, the company’s cheaper road delivery network, which is likely to continue in the latest quarter. The company has also succeeded in improving margins in the core FedEx Express air package business, despite a customer shift towards lower-priced, slower delivery options.The market will also be looking for news about progress on the integration of TNT Express, the Netherlands-based express package business, which it bought in a €4.4bn takeover that completed on May 25. Robert WrightWhitbread, owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, will seek to reassure investors that it is moving back towards sales and revenue growth during a trading update for its first quarter.The FTSE 100 company is trying to recover from a difficult year, with its share price falling around 20 per cent over the past 12 months on the back of falling sales.Investors will be watching for signs that the company is on course to match analyst estimates for the full 2016 fiscal year, predicting 8 per cent revenue growth to £3.2bn.In April, reporting full-year results for 2015, Whitbread revealed like-for-like sales had risen only 3 per cent, compared to 6.5 per cent the previous year. This did not prevent chief executive Alison Brittain boosting its annual dividend by 10 per cent.Those looking for a radical change of direction may have found little new in her announcement of strategic priorities that did not change long term targets, such as to have 85,000 Premier Inn rooms and £2.5bn Costa Coffee sales by 2020.But the group has said its renewed strategic focus will see it expanding its “hub” concept in the UK, with hotels in city centre locations. It is also searching for growth in new territories such as China, where it plans to open 700 Costa Coffee stores by the end of the decade. Murad AhmedEarningsFedEx Q4 $3.29 ($2.66)Investors will be hoping that Hennes & Mauritz does not disappoint on second-quarter profits as it did last week on sales.The Swedish purveyor of fast fashion has been in the shadow of its larger rival, Spain’s Inditex, for many years and that continued at the start of this year.H&M said its sales for the quarter ending in March had risen by just 2 per cent to SKr54.3bn, about 2 per cent below analysts’ average forecast. That implied a decline in like-for-like sales growth — that of existing stores — of 6 per cent, according to analysts at Citi. They called H&M “unloved” as its shares have fallen by more than a quarter in the past year compared with a flat performance at Inditex.Citi analysts estimated that the lower-than-expected sales would cause forecasts for full-year profits to be cut by 1-2 per cent.Shareholders will also be looking closely at H&M’s gross margin, a key measure of profitability, which has fallen by 10 percentage points since 2008 to about 52 per cent as the Swedish group has faced higher purchasing prices, currency headwinds, and bigger discounts.H&M is still expanding its number of stores rapidly, however, with more than 400 added in the past year, taking the total to 4,077. Richard MilneAngry minority shareholders will be demanding reform at Volkswagen when it holds its annual shareholders’ meeting in Hanover.Volkswagen spent last week looking ahead to “Strategy 2025,” its 10-year vision, but this week the diesel emissions crisis will be in clear focus.Multiple shareholder advisory groups have already recommended opposing a vote of confidence in the company’s top leadership, and also called for a special audit of the supervisory and management boards to determine whether their duties were breached in relation to the scandal.For many, weak corporate governance played a central role allowing a certain “mindset” to take hold, leading to VW equipping 11m cars worldwide with cheat software to understate emissions in official tests. The result was VW’s biggest loss in its 79-year history.Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser, gives VW’s corporate governance a score of 10 — its worst possible rating and the lowest score for any company listed on Germany’s DAX.It cites a lack of independent directors on the supervisory board, takeover defences that entrench management, and the company’s “dual-class” voting structure that keeps power in the hands of a few groups. “Prior to the scandal, VW ignored or discounted criticism of its substandard governance practices,” said Thomas von Oehsen, associate director at the research arm of ISS.“The company argument was simple: VW is successful and is primed to become the world's largest carmaker. Last autumn, this argument collapsed, and, nearly a year later, shareholders are still waiting to see what the company will do to address its poor governance.”Investors routinely discount VW’s stock based on its corporate governance problems.Stuart Pearson. at Exane BNP Paribas, for instance, discounts the stock by 15 per cent to “reflect the shortfalls . . . laid bare by the scandal being gradually addressed by management.” Patrick McGeeEarningsH&M Hennes & Mauritz Q2 SKr3.49 (SKr3.90)Is BlackBerry, the Canadian smartphone pioneer, about to stop making handsets? Some analysts think it is just a matter of time before the purveyor of Qwerty-keyboard devices pulls the plug on its hardware business.Investors will be looking for signs that such a move is afoot when the group reports earnings for its fiscal first quarter.Maynard Um, analyst at Wells Fargo, argues the company has come to a “fork in the road” for its hardware division. Sales of its latest handset, the unfortunately named Priv, have been softer than hoped, and the group’s products barely register compared to rival smartphones made by Apple and Samsung.To offset the slumping popularity of its phones, chief executive John Chen has been pushing into software and services, with a special focus on helping companies and governments to communicate securely. The group has made a string of acquisitions in this area over the past year.Mr Um suggests that now might be the time to bite the bullet and exit the handset business altogether. Such a move might not be “all bad news,” he says, and could even end up boosting the company’s profits.While revenues would fall to just a touch above $1bn next year, he believes the company would be able to expand its operating margins and deliver adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents in 2017, compared to his current forecast for a loss of of 10 cents.“We also note this would reduce balance sheet risk and volatility as well,” he adds.Wall Street analysts are typically expecting BlackBerry to report an adjusted loss per share of 9 cents in its fiscal first quarter, on revenues of $612m, according to FactSet. David CrowInvestors in Tesco will be keeping a close eye on the company’s first-quarter update for any clues on the supermarket giant’s shift in strategy.Last week, the UK’s biggest retailer announced it was selling its Turkish business, Kipa, to local rival Migros, and it also sold Giraffe, the family-friendly restaurant chain, to Boparan Ventures, an investment vehicle that owns several restaurant businesses including fish and chip shop chain Harry Ramsden’s. Garden centre operator Dobbies was sold to a group of Scottish investors.The supermarket chain is also seeking to dispose of underperforming overseas businesses and return to its UK roots — last year, it sold its South Korean business for £4bn, and in April it sold an 8.6 per cent stake in its Asian ecommerce group, Lazada.Tesco sold Kipa for around £30m, and Giraffe is believed to have fetched a similar price. Dobbies sold for £217m.In April, Tesco warned investors not to expect a surge in profits, even as it posted its first quarter of UK sales growth for three years.Tesco posted annual pre-tax profits of £162m in 2015. That result marks a significant improvement from the £6.4bn loss for 2014 — the worst performance in the grocer’s history — when it was dragged down by £7bn of writedowns and charges.

66;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-06-16T15:24:03Z;Tradepoint Atlantic seeks to shake up US ports;Company aims to become main trade hub on eastern seaboard, with good links to road and rail;It would be easy to mistake the scene at Sparrows Point, a five-square-mile waterfront site just outside Baltimore, Maryland, for a case of simple post-industrial neglect. Weeds grow around the edges of many of the quays at the port on the site, which once employed 30,000 people and was home to a steel mill. The few surviving buildings stand amid a wasteland so desolate that even the slightest wind produces conditions like a desert dust storm.But the presence in the port of the STH Athens, a dry bulk carrying ship, testifies that the site is, slowly, coming back to life. Hilco Global and Redwood Capital, two US financial investors, are gradually turning the vast facility into a port, distribution and logistics facility named Tradepoint Atlantic.The project promises to be the only sizeable entirely privately-owned port development on the US east coast. The investors believe the availability of so much space on a site linked to sea, rail and road transport can transform how goods are distributed around the US north-east. They expect their investments, together with those of customers, to reach $1bn over the next 10 years.“It’s a global trade point, where we plan to do a great number of things for different industries,” says Kerry Doyle, vice-president for finance of the new venture.Some of Tradepoint’s plans will increase competition for the nearby Port of Baltimore, owned by the public-sector Maryland Port Administration. But James White, the MPA’s executive director, welcomes the potential for the facility to attract new capital to the area and generate extra maritime traffic.“That’s darn encouraging from where I sit — that you can grow maritime trade without having to invest government dollars,” says Mr White.The question, according to Neil Davidson, analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants, is whether shipping lines and other transport companies will be prepared to scrap their current arrangements and move to Tradepoint.“There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market share,” he adds.The investors have taken the site on partly because they have re-evaluated the risks and rewards of a site with such a long, complex history. Sparrows Point was operated for most of its 124 years by Bethlehem Steel, a steel producer that left the site littered with potentially harmful substances when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. A succession of subsequent owners tried and failed to make a success of the steel mill before production finally ceased with the bankruptcy of RG Steel in 2012.There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market shareUntil Hilco submitted its bid in 2014, investors interested in the site were deterred by the potential costs of mounting an environmental clean-up. Hilco was consequently able to buy the site, which was sold after the Bethlehem bankruptcy for $950m, for just $72m. Redwood joined the project subsequently.Bethlehem left behind some useful assets. For example, the yard on the site’s north side is currently hosting hundreds of rail tank cars that have no work because of the oil price fall.Michael Moore, chief executive of the project, highlights how Bethlehem built more than 100 miles of rail track, connected to both Norfolk Southern and CSX, the eastern US’s two biggest railroads, as well as the site’s port facilities.The transport connections are already producing new customers. Work is under way near the rail yard on a new logistics facility for FedEx, the express parcel service, which was attracted by the site’s direct connection to the US interstate highway network. This month, Tradepoint announced a deal with Pasha Automotive Services, which handles car imports for manufacturers, to start landing vehicles for Fiat Chrysler at Tradepoint from July.We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark. That’s a huge differentiatorSpace at Tradepoint is so plentiful, according to Mr Moore, that it should allow companies like Pasha to cut out calls at other ports in the north-eastern US and run their distribution from Sparrows Point.“We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark,” Mr Moore says. “That’s a huge differentiator.”There remains considerable uncertainty for the project. While the investors have not disclosed how much they have put into the project so far, Mr Doyle is only now embarking on raising the business’s first outside capital. It also remains uncertain, according to Mr Davidson, how traffic patterns on the US east coast will change once the Panama Canal expands to allow larger vessels later this month.The “$64,000 question”, Mr Davidson says, is whether US east coast ports gain market share from west coast rivals.Nevertheless, Mr Doyle predicts the project will not only transform goods movements in its immediate area but also provide a model for other, similar sites in the future.“We see this as an investment thesis,” he says. “We feel this can be replicated elsewhere.”
67;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-05-30T03:00:26Z;Could Amazon’s global delivery vision break Alibaba?;;Speculation is rife that Amazon is soon to establish itself as a global shipping and logistics expert, in a move coined internally as project ‘Dragon Boat’.While this bold strategy has the potential to significantly increase margins and position Amazon as Chinese businesses’ gateway to the West, a considered and phased implementation is essential if the firm is to gain share of the cross-border e-commerce market from industry leader Alibaba.Leaked documents suggest that the wheels are already in motion, with Amazon having begun leasing planes as well as registering itself as an ocean freight booking business. In consolidating the supply chain to provide a holistic delivery solution, the firm will in effect create a network which controls the flow of goods from factories in China to consumer’s homes in the US and Europe.While pitting itself in direct competition with the likes of FedEx and UPS, Amazon will also aim to facilitate a route to the international marketplace for smaller manufacturers ahead of Alibaba, the leading force in Chinese e-commerce.Amazon’s strategy is a shrewd one. The majority of online transactions are largely price-driven – product sales yield small margins and much of the additional margin is extracted from the shipping and delivery of goods.It is likely that Amazon will build its logistics offering from the ground up, acting as a market disruptor by automating the ordering, shipping and delivery process. To do so, the firm must ensure that it develops a keen understanding of how to efficiently navigate customs, pack consignments to balance weight-volume ratios and ensure all required paperwork is complete and accounted for.Once Amazon has found its feet in providing a global shipping and freight delivery provision, its key differentiator is the ability to tap into, and apply, its existing automated warehouse, sorting and distribution model. In taking control of first and last mile delivery, from a Chinese factory to a sorting centre or port, and from a western logistics hub direct to the consumer, it can consolidate the entire supply chain, driving cost savings as a result.While there are immediate monetary benefits from muscling in on the multi-billion dollar international logistics market already trading on Amazon deliveries, passing on a proportion of these savings to Chinese suppliers will incentivise a multitude of new entrants to export to overseas buyers.However, there are significant risks associated with this aggressive growth strategy and Amazon must learn from Alibaba’s shortcomings. Described by some as the “world’s biggest marketplace for fakes”, Alibaba’s effort to stem the flow of counterfeit products is widely regarded by anti-counterfeit groups as insufficient and the firm has been the subject of numerous legal challenges as a result.Just this month, Alibaba’s member status was suspended by the Washington DC-based International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) due to the discovery of an undisclosed conflict of interest. In retaliation, the firm’s CEO Jack Ma pulled out from his scheduled slot as a speaker at the Coalition’s annual conference.These events have caused Alibaba considerable reputational damage and Amazon will be eager to ensure it does not suffer the same fate. To avoid this, clear, swift and enforceable anti-counterfeiting regulations must be enforced by Amazon, facilitating the timely removal of products suspected to breach intellectual property legislation. Furthermore, opening the floodgates to a high volume of new products supplied by Chinese manufacturers could easily lead to a dip in product quality, which in turn could cause consumer dissatisfaction.While in practice, employing a team of on-the-ground quality assurance professionals who are on hand to examine product specifications and audit supplier factories would be the most comprehensive solution, this is unlikely to prove achievable or cost-effective for an operation of this vast scale.In reality, it is likely that Amazon will turn to its online community as quality controller, gathering customer feedback and approaching suppliers whose products are evidenced to be dangerous, ineffective or of a poor standard.Amazon’s transition to becoming an international logistics provider will be a staged process, beginning with its establishment as a shipping and freight specialist, with bolt on first and last mile services then added to encourage new market entrants.However, the installation of this far-reaching network could eventually facilitate the opposite flow of goods, providing the means for Western firms to engage with Chinese consumers. Here, the scope for product demand is somewhat more limited, with luxury goods, designer products and highly personalised items most likely to attract buyers.In launching its quest for global logistics dominance and establishing a consolidated and automated supply chain, Amazon is well-placed to challenge Alibaba for an increased share of the international e-commerce market. Ensuring that quality, legal and operational risks are identified at the offset is essential if the firm is to maintain the integrity and increase the profitability of its brand.Dominic Jephcott is CEO at global procurement and supply chain specialist Vendigital.Back to beyondbrics
68;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-05-06T00:32:48Z;Amazon deal doubles size of air cargo fleet;Group leases 20 Boeing 767 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide as it attempts to keep up with growth;Amazon has signed a new leasing deal for cargo jets, doubling the size of its fleet and underscoring its ambitions to grow its air transport network.The news comes as Amazon has been investing heavily in its logistics network and taking more logistics operations in-house. The retailer has experienced rapid growth in sales and in units shipped — which rose 28 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively, last quarter— and executives say they have had to take control over more logistics operations to keep up with growth.Under the new deal, Amazon will lease 20 Boeing 767 cargo jets from Atlas Air Worldwide, an aviation company based in New York state, for seven years. Amazon will also have the option to purchase up to 30 per cent of Atlas Air Worldwide at a predetermined price of $37.50 per share, a slight discount to Wednesday’s closing price.Amazon has previously said that its cargo fleet will be used to support the growth of Prime membership in the US, which includes two-day shipping. Analysts said the planes would probably be used to transport goods between Amazon warehouses.“I am a little surprised at the number of aircraft,” said David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein. “Going from zero to 20 was a lot, and now they’ve doubled that. It seems like they have this pressing need for expedited transport of inventory.”Amazon’s moves have raised questions about whether the company, which loses more than $1bn each quarter on shipping, may be trying to lessen its dependence on its traditional logistics partnerships such as FedEx and UPS.“It doesn’t appear to me that they are re-creating the UPS or the FedEx parcel network,” Mr Vernon said, pointing out that Amazon does not currently use UPS or FedEx for the type of rapid warehouse transport that the new fleet will provide. “It is hard to know because it is an entirely new development — we have never seen a supply chain like this built before.”Amazon said during earnings last week that it would keep investing in logistics. “We continue to add logistics capacity really to supplement our other carriers,” said Brian Olsavksy, chief financial officer. “The main driver here is to be able to handle faster and faster delivery speeds.”The deal with Atlas is similar in structure to Amazon’s first leasing agreement, in which it leased 20 jets from Air Transportation Services Group and had the option to acquire up to 20 per cent of the company.Also on Thursday, Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and chief executive, sold $670m in Amazon shares, his biggest disposal ever by value. The sale of one million shares was part of a scheduled transaction — Mr Bezos also sold 1m shares last year and in the previous year. He remains Amazon’s largest shareholder, owning 17 per cent of the company.
69;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-04-18T05:06:48Z;Uber looms over the parcel delivery business;The app-based venture is a threat to DHL, FedEx, Royal Mail and more;"From taxis to trucks, there are few areas of road transport where Uber Technologies has not already provoked anxiety, anger or dismay among rival traditional operators.Founded in 2009 as UberCab by entrepreneurs Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp in San Francisco, its app-based system allows users to summon minicabs mainly operated by owner-drivers who are contracted to Uber.It has grown like wildfire around the world and reached its billionth ride on Christmas Eve 2015.Now DHL, FedEx, Royal Mail and other courier and delivery companies are bracing themselves for an expansion of the group’s North American UberRush service into Europe. Demand in the sector has been driven by a boom in internet shopping. In the UK in 2015, 76 per cent of adults bought goods or services online; in 2008 it was 53 per cent, according to the Office for National Statistics.Uber says it “currently” has no plans to launch UberRush in the UK. “It’s too early to say,” comments an Uber spokesman, describing the US operations of UberRush as “trial activities”. However, success in the US could lead to a UK rollout, he concedes.Established delivery services are convinced that such a move is imminent. They assume UberRush will use the same smartphone technology that allows businesses to summon vans at a moment’s notice and has already allowed it to carve deeply into traditional black cab and minicab businesses.As in North America, UberRush is likely to target clients along the full spectrum of businesses from large corporations to small independent stores.In the UK the prospect adds significantly to concern at Royal Mail, which is already grappling with inroads on its parcels operations by internet retailer Amazon. Royal Mail reported a 31 per cent drop in profits in the six months to the end of September 2015. Moya Greene, chief executive, had warned previously that Amazon’s move could halve the growth potential of Royal Mail’s parcels business over the next several years and hit other rivals. “When an online retailer of the scale and size of Amazon decides to build its own delivery network, that changes the market for everybody,” she said.Gary Paulin, co-founder of equity brokerage Aviate Global, predicts that the traditional companies in the sector will not disappear but are unlikely to retain anything like their past domination of the market. However, Deutsche Post’s DHL Group suggests the business model of the US group will turn out to be “relatively niche”.7 billionMiles travelled by all vehicles in the UK in 2014It is easy to see the attraction for Uber: statistics from the UK’s Department for Transport show that last year vehicles of all types covered 7bn more miles in the country than in 2014. Vans and other light goods vehicles accounted for 2.34bn of those new miles. The miles driven by light goods vehicles, many delivering items ordered online, have risen 20 per cent in 10 years, according to the department’s estimates. The same-day courier service sector alone is now worth £7bn a year in the UK, according to market research group IBISWorld.The extent of Uber’s ambitions is set out by parcels broker ParcelHero. It predicts that established couriers will be just as vulnerable to Uber’s app-based activities as the UK’s black cab trade, which to date has had at least 500 taxis disappear from London’s 25,000-strong fleet alone, according to the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association. The ParcelHero report predicts UberRush should be able to capture 10 per cent of the global market.But the prize is much greater: worldwide annual revenue from taxi operations of all types is estimated at $22bn — a small part of the $246bn generated by global courier and parcels delivery services, as calculated by IBISWorld. Uber may yet have a bigger market to attack."

Lower interest rates in Europe make that look like a great deal.Some investors think FedEx’s €3bn deal could signal another wave of “reverse Yankee” bond issuance by investment-grade US companies in the eurozone — although American corporate treasurers did hope for a bit more encouragement than they got on Thursday from the European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi.While Mr Draghi repeated his promise to do whatever it takes to reflate the eurozone economy, minutes from the last ECB meeting underlined divisions within the central bank. The monetary stimulus package it unveiled last month — including an unprecedented promise to include corporate bonds in its quantitative easing programme — has cut the interest rate that companies need to pay on new euro-denominated debt, but there was little sign of officials talking rates lower.Meanwhile, US corporate bond yields have come down even more, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen out-surprises Mr Draghi with her dovish commentary.The yield differential between the eurozone and the US does remain elevated, of course, since for all the delay, the Fed is still facing in the direction of rate rises. American companies are looking at a 210 basis point saving on their interest bill if they issue in Europe, which is a no-brainer for companies that, like FedEx (which is buying TNT Express of the Netherlands), are doing deals in the eurozone or funding European subsidiaries.The costs of swapping the funds back into dollars is the other variable, which has made reverse Yankee issuance volatile. The cost of such swaps has increased sharply since mid-2014, peaking during the market turbulence in the middle of the first quarter.Less fearful markets have reduced the cost, though, so issuance is already likely to pick up at least modestly, and perhaps eclipse the $18.8bn recorded by Dealogic in the first quarter.It would only take a little more dovish cooing from Mr Draghi, and the skies will be full of money being shipped across the Atlantic to the US.stephen.foley@ft.com
71;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx taps hot bond market with $10bn orderbook;;Demand for risky investment-grade corporate paper remains hot.US shipping and delivery behemoth FedEx has rounded up more than $10bn in orders as it prepares to sell new bonds on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter.The company is the latest corporate borrower with a less than pristine credit rating to find ample investor appetite for new debt, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.The group follows in the footsteps of Anadarko Petroleum, HollyFrontier, Total System Services and finance subsidiaries of Ford Motor and Hyundai — all of which carry a rating between triple-B plus and triple-B minus from at least one of the rating agencies — and which completed bond sales last week.Moody’s downgraded FedEx one notch last week to triple-B, citing the group’s “significant debt-funded investments”. Standard & Poor’s assigned the new notes a triple-B rating on Monday.FedEx is expected to issue $750m worth of 10-year debt with a yield 135 basis points above the benchmark US Treasury. The launch pricing indicated FedEx would sell the new bonds with a yield of roughly 3.26 per cent.The group was also set to issue $1.2bn of 30-year paper with a yield 185 basis points above the comparable Treasury, or roughly 4.57 per cent. FedEx last sold 30-year bonds five months ago with a yield of 4.81 per cent.Investors have clamoured for a piece of lower-rated investment grade debt since bond markets started to rally in mid-February. Managers, who had crowded into higher quality bonds as debt prices slid earlier in the year, have bet heavily on higher yielding triple-B bonds.Anadarko, the US oil producer, received orders in excess of $20bn last Monday as it sold $3bn of new debt. Investors said they expected FedEx to return to market next week with a sale of euro denominated bonds to fund the group’s takeover parcel delivery company TNT.

The gains came despite a one per cent dip in revenue, as FedEx sharply lifted the unit’s profit margin by cutting costs.The strength in the express unit is “evidence of the strong execution by the FedEx team with respect to its profit improvement plan,” said Matt Troy, an analyst at Nomura.

74;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-03-17T12:36:43Z;FedEx latest US company to target euro bond sale;;FedEx, the US-based courier service, and Carmila, a French real estate company, have mandated banks to begin a set of investor meetings to launch euro-denominated bonds.Companies have been rushing to take advantage of the low yields on offer for euro-denominated debt in the aftermath of the European Central Bank’s announcement that it will begin buying corporate debt, writes capital markets correspondent Gavin Jackson.Today’s announcements come after brewer AB InBev sold the largest euro-denominated corporate bond ever on Wednesday.Last week the ECB said that it would only buy investment grade debt issued by non-financial companies established in the eurozone. However the cost of financing has fallen right across euro debt markets as investors move into bonds issued by foreign companies, junk bonds and bank debt in order to secure higher yields.So far this year 53 per cent of all euro-denominated corporate bonds sold have been sold by non-Eurozone issuers. US borrowers account for 23 per cent of the total according to data from Dealogic.FedEx is the latest in a series of overseas companies that have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs in the eurozone. The new mandate from the courier follows a bond issued by the Australian shopping centre company Scentre on Tuesday.Much of the euro debt sold by overseas companies is issued to fund their European activities, potentially providing the boost to the eurozone economy that the ECB wishes to see, while others will swap their debt back into their home currency, helping to weaken the euro.However, Transurban, an Australian toll-road operator, pulled a deal on Tuesday providing evidence that investors were actively seeking out bonds that would be eligible for the quantitative easing program.
75;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-03-16T22:14:38Z;FedEx shares jump as it shrugs off Christmas season problems;Express parcel service gains in after-hours trade as adjusted net income for Q3 uprises 18%,;FedEx shares gained 6.6 per cent in after-hours trade after the express parcel service brushed aside delivery problems during the pre-Christmas peak season to record earnings that beat expectations.Adjusted net income for the December to February quarter rose 18 per cent to $692m, on revenue that increased 8.6 per cent to $12.7bn, allowing the company, which is benefiting from surging ecommerce deliveries, to narrow its forecast for earnings per share for the year to May before mark to market pension adjustments. It now forecasts a range of $10.70 to $10.90, against a previous range of $10.40 to $10.90.Fred Smith, chief executive, hailed the “strong financial performance”, saying it had been driven by increasing demand for the “broad portfolio” of FedEx business solutions.“We sincerely appreciate the peak season efforts of our FedEx team members who delivered great service despite the challenges of stronger than expected shipping demand, driven by the growth in ecommerce,” he said.The improved profitability derived mainly from a 51 per cent jump, to $595m, in operating income at the core FedEx Express air express business, on revenue down 1 per cent to $6.56bn. The business benefited from higher yields, growing US volumes and falling costs, while revenue fell as a result of the end in fuel-cost surcharges after the sharp decline in the price of oil.At FedEx Ground, operating income fell marginally, to $557m from $559m in the same quarter last year, on revenue up 30 per cent to $4.41bn. Revenues benefited from a change in accounting for revenues of the low-cost FedEx SmartPost business and the acquisition of Genco. Inclusion of both operations reduced margins.FedEx said the narrowed forecast assumed moderate economic growth and excluded pension adjustments, legal matters and any costs related to TNT Express, which FedEx is in the course of taking over.“We now expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20 per cent to 22 per cent over last year, as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement programme,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said. “Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017, where we expect solid growth in earnings and cash flow.”The December to February figures would have been substantially different without adjustments for legal issues and the TNT acquisition. Two legal disputes together reduced net income by $169m, while TNT costs reduced net income by $15m. Those effects meant unadjusted net income fell 19 per cent to $507m, while earnings per share fell 16 per cent to $1.84.Like UPS, its main rival, FedEx is adjusting to delivering a far higher proportion of its traffic to residential customers of online retailers, instead of the business customers that previously dominated. The company was forced in December to seek volunteers to deliver packages on Christmas Day after its networks became congested. But it reported no effects from those problems in its results.FedEx’s shares had reached $153.70 in after-hours trade.

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.The UK Budget may contain yet more changes to the country’s pensions system, but the consequences of previous changes will be apparent a day earlier when Legal & General reports its full-year results.The insurer is a big player in the annuity market but the individual annuity market has been tough because of changes that were made in the 2014 Budget. Legal & General is now going for growth in bulk annuities, which involves taking on liabilities from corporate pension schemes.The results should include an update on progress in that market, and also some detail on how the EU’s Solvency II rules (which are seen as harsh on annuities) have affected the business.The other area of interest will be the dividend. The annual payout more than doubled between 2010 and 2014 and analysts at UBS expect a 16 per cent jump this time around. But they say that Solvency II and the company’s reinsurance strategy reduce future cash generation and dividend-paying abilities. They expect dividend growth to slow to 6 per cent a year between 2016 and 2019.Like those of other life insurers, shares in Legal & General have had a tough start to the year. They are down 13 per cent since the start of January. Results from rivals Prudential and Aviva prompted a jump in their respective share prices. Can Legal & General follow suit? Oliver RalphAltice has come a long way in a short time, and 2015 was certainly a year to remember. Among other things, the European cable group broke into the US market for the first time with the acquisition of Suddenlink and, shortly after that, Cablevision.Those dual acquisitions, the second of which is still to close, was a clear reminder of the group’s global ambitions.But investors looking at Altice’s full-year earnings will also be mindful that the stock fell about 50 per cent last year in a clear sign that shareholders, concerned about Altice’s leverage, want the group to digest all of its acquisitions over the past two years before pulling out the shopping basket again.At its third-quarter presentation last October, Altice shares fell 10 per cent after the group headed by Patrick Drahi said that consolidated pro-forma revenues declined 2.9 per cent while pro-forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) came in below expectations.Investors will be anxious to hear more details about progress on the integration of its various assets. They will also be keen to hear more about how quickly it is paying down its almost €50bn of net debt. Adam ThomsonNumericable-SFR, France’s second-biggest mobile operator by subscribers, reports fourth-quarter and full-year results against a backdrop of tremendous upheaval in the company.Since Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi officially took it over at the end of 2014, SFR, as it increasingly known, has slashed costs. That has boosted margins but Mr Drahi’s brutal cost-cutting has failed so far to increase revenues.Meanwhile, SFR lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers during the first nine months of last year as they went in search of cheaper offers from the likes of low-cost rival Free, or in search of better network quality.Investors will therefore be looking closely to see whether the company can report what would be the first quarter under Mr Drahi’s control showing a net addition of mobile customers.Just as important, they will be looking to see whether it has been able to attract them without having to use heavily promotional offers that eat into the business’s top line.Finally, investors will keep an ear out for SFR’s investment plans this year. Jerry Dellis, telecoms analyst at Jefferies, expects the company to announce capital expenditure during the last quarter of 2015 of €591m. If SFR confirms that, it will represent a big step-up in spending as it builds its 4G network and improves basic capability on its 3G network.

But it insisted it resumed normal operations on December 28. It has not issued a profit warning, as it would have been obliged to do if the issues had significantly reduced anticipated profits for the period.Christmas deliveries have become an increasingly important part of the business of both FedEx and UPS, its larger rival, as the ecommerce boom

77;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-03-09T17:43:35Z;Amazon leases 20 Boeing 767 freight jets for air cargo programme;Deal has potential to disrupt FedEx and UPS in the $400bn global logistics market;Amazon is taking its ambitions to the skies with a new agreement to lease 20 cargo jets in its boldest step yet to control its own logistics operations.Amazon has been expanding its reach into logistics operations over the past year, with truck trailers, shipping licences, new delivery fleets and now aircraft.The company will lease 20 Boeing 767 jets from Air Transportation Services Group, an air cargo company based in Wilmington, Ohio, that is the world’s largest owner of converted Boeing 767 freight aircraft.The new deal, under which the jets will be leased for five to seven years, marks the first time Amazon has publicly confirmed its secretive air cargo programme. The company reported $1.8bn in shipping losses last year, its worst shipping losses ever, and analysts said the move could help cut costs.The agreement raises the question of how Amazon’s move will affect other logistics providers such as FedEx and UPS, which have generally avoided commenting on Amazon’s moves towards handling its own goods. Amazon is a large client of both companies, and about 4 per cent of UPS’s volume is tied to Amazon.Amazon discovered the potential downside of relying on other companies’ delivery networks over the 2013 Christmas season in North America. UPS’s network became severely congested in December, meaning that many customers received Christmas deliveries only after December 25.Amazon has been expanding not only its cargo networks but also its last-mile delivery services, which could also prove disruptive to other logistics companies. With the introduction of Prime Now, Amazon’s two-hour delivery service, the company has started using fleets of its own drivers to take packages directly to the customer’s door.The ecommerce company has also obtained a freight forwarding licence in China, a potential step toward providing large-scale shipping services to companies that sell on Amazon.com.An Amazon spokeswoman said that the planes would be used in the US and would support growth rather than replacing existing logistics partners. “These planes provide critical capacity expansion to support the growth of Prime in the US,” spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. “At our scale, supporting growth requires adding some of our own logistics capabilities.”However, a spokesman for ATSG said the leased jets had the ability to fly internationally as well. “It’s up to them how they want to use it,” he said.Colin Sebastian, analyst at RW Baird, said the jets would initially be used to move goods between Amazon warehouses, and between suppliers and warehouses. But he expected Amazon might eventually offer cargo services to other companies, capturing a share of the $400bn global logistics market.Amazon started testing the possibility of freight operations last autumn, leasing two planes from ATSG in September, and expanding its fleet to five planes in November.Amazon’s move into air cargo comes at a time when global air cargo growth has slowed, as market uncertainty has pushed shippers towards a cheaper alternative: shipping by sea. Prices for cargo aircraft have plummeted since the 2008 financial crisis, which will have sharply cut the cost of undertaking this change.In addition to leasing the jets, Amazon also has the option to buy one-fifth of the shares in ATSG over the next five years, at a price of $9.73 per share. Shares in ATSG jumped 19 per cent on the news.
78;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-02-23T19:51:01Z;UPS, FedEx should breath easy over Amazon;;Breath easier, UPS and FedEx. Speculation has been rife that Amazon may be trying to disrupt a new industry: the business of delivering parcels. But analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon the ambitions of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos are probably far narrower.The Seattle-based company has upended the retail sector by selling a vast array of products online and getting them to customers quickly. It’s also made waves with its lucrative Amazon Web Services division, which allows companies to rent computing power. AWS now powers many big-name brands, such as Netflix.So it’s little surprise that reports indicating Amazon has been in discussions to lease cargo aircraft and buy its own trucks have left investors wondering if the company plans to take on package delivery companies, like UPS and FedEx.But Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argues Amazon’s ambitions are far less dramatic. Creating a fully-fledged delivery company would require a “large” investment and returns on that investment would be “uncertain,” he says.[Amazon's] management’s recent comments on delivery, that they are looking to “supplement our existing partners…not…replace them”, aforementioned subscale unit delivery economics, and questions about whether traditional retailers would trust [Amazon] with their package delivery make us skeptical [Amazon] is building a full fledged competitor against the parcel companies.It’s also far-fetched, Mr Nowak argues, that Amazon plans on delivering its own packages on a large scale, despite having spent about $11.5bn last year to ship an estimated 2.2bn packages. The company would not be able to reach critical mass of around 100 packages per driver per day to make such a move economically viable, he says.For perspective, UPS, the biggest US package delivery company, delivers about 220-300 residential packages per driver per day in urban areas. So what, then, does Amazon have up its sleeve?Mr Nowak says it makes sense for Amazon to make its own deliveries in certain densely-populated urban areas (think New York). He estimates there are around 10m members of Amazon’s Prime service, which charges an annual fee for unlimited free two-day delivery, across the 10 biggest US metro areas.Assuming the members order one package a month, that translates into about 380,000 packages delivered per day across the areas.“This would likely be enough density to support in-house delivery and drive long-term cost savings,” Mr Nowak wrote, adding that if Amazon could deliver 150 packages per driver per day in these areas, it would drive $220m in total annual savings.Still, Mr Nowak notes that an sort of Amazon delivery service may still be far off:While the mathematics work, we note that there is still investment required (trucks, loading docks, logistics technologies, hiring/training thousands of drivers,etc.) before [Amazon] could start to meaningfully perform its own delivery.
79;FDX;Fedex Corp;2016-02-02T15:55:45Z;UPS boosted by rising ecommerce shipments;Express parcel service forecasts 5%-9% rise in 2016 earnings;Big rises in ecommerce shipments helped UPS to overcome the effects of a strong dollar and falling fuel surcharges to report fourth-quarter results ahead of analysts’ expectations.The express parcel service, which struggled in the fourth quarter in 2013 and 2014, also forecast that 2016 earnings per share would be between 5 and 9 per cent higher than 2015.Net income for the quarter nearly tripled to $1.33bn, from $453m in the fourth quarter of 2014, on revenue up 1 per cent to $16.1bn. The change mainly reflected a series of accounting charges for pensions and US healthcare, including a fall in mark-to-market pension losses to $118m, from $1.06bn in 2014. Excluding the effect of those changes, net income rose 23 per cent to $1.41bn.Diluted earnings per share rose from 49 cents in 2014’s last quarter to $1.48, ahead of analysts’ consensus forecast of $1.43.David Abney, chief executive, said the results built on UPS’s strategy to deliver improved shareholder value.“Our flexible integrated network, close collaboration with customers and the extraordinary efforts of UPSers enabled us to achieve great service and record financial performance this quarter,” Mr Abney said.Much the strongest performance was in the core US domestic package business, which benefited most from rising ecommerce over the peak, pre-Christmas delivery season. Average daily shipments were up 2.4 per cent year-on-year, boosted by a 15 per cent rise in deferred air shipments and a 10 per cent increase in next-day air. Ground shipments grew only 0.4 per cent.UPS and FedEx, its main rival, have benefited from rising ecommerce but sometimes struggled to handle the growing volumes and the increased complexity of delivering more to consumers, rather than businesses.Quarterly operating profit for the US division rose from $444m to $1.28bn, thanks to its share of the accounting charges. Excluding those, operating profit rose 18 per cent to $1.35bn, on revenue up 2.6 per cent to $10.3bn.The international package unit was held back by the dollar’s strength. Quarterly operating profit rose from $335m to $580m, on revenues down 7.3 per cent to $3.18bn. Without the accounting effects, operating profits would have been 16 per cent higher at $624m.In the supply chain and freight logistics business, operating profits excluding the accounting charges were up 11 per cent at $199m, on revenues up 6 per cent at $2.61bn.Richard Peretz, chief financial officer, said the final quarter was UPS’s fourth consecutive quarter of beating financial expectations. “While we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth,” he said.He forecast full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, an increase of between 5 and 9 per cent against the $5.43 figure for the whole of 2015, excluding the accounting charges. Full-year earnings per share for 2015, including the various charges, were $5.35.
80;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-12-30T17:58:17Z;Christmas woes for FedEx amid ecommerce surge;Company forced to seek volunteers to help with deliveries on December 25;FedEx has become the latest of the US’s big parcel delivery companies to suffer a troubled holiday shopping season after it was forced to seek volunteers to deliver packages on Christmas Day.The problems for FedEx follow two successive holiday seasons of problems for UPS, the US’s biggest express parcel service. The company’s network became seriously congested in 2013 before it then overcompensated and had excess costs for the 2014 holiday shipping period.Both companies are struggling to adapt to the rapid growth and unpredictable patterns of consumers’ ecommerce purchases in the run-up to Christmas. IHS, the forecasting company, predicts that US ecommerce sales will have increased 11.7 per cent in November and December against the same months last year, on retail sales up just 3.4 per cent.FedEx said in a statement that its 340,000 staff had handled a “record peak holiday season”, including volunteers who made deliveries on Christmas Day.“FedEx Express expanded delivery operations on the Saturday following Christmas, delivering delayed shipments along with our normal Saturday volume, and resumed normal pickup and delivery services on Monday,” the company said.FedEx declined to give details of how many packages were delayed or of any financial effect that the situation might have. UPS in January 2014 was forced to warn that its fourth-quarter 2013 profits would be 14 per cent lower than expected after its problems handling Christmas deliveries. The delays prompted Amazon, one of the biggest customers for UPS and FedEx, to issue $20 gift cards to affected customers.Chris Christopher, IHS’s director of US macro economics, said many logistics companies had suffered glitches over the holiday period, possibly because of an under-appreciation of the volumes they would be handling.Amazon, Mr Christopher added, had opened a number of warehouses closer to centres of consumer demand, changing traffic patterns compared with previous years. “That can be another complication,” he said.Both the big package delivery companies have faced challenges adapting their networks— which traditionally handled mainly goods moving to and from offices in commercial areas — to handle more deliveries to consumers. Costs for delivering to consumers are higher than for delivering to businesses.“It’s becoming complicated,” Mr Christopher said of online ordering patterns. “There’s more dispersion [between delivery points] but also more people doing it.”UPS said that it had benefited from a “strong partnership” with customers on forecasting traffic levels and drawing up plans.“The company carefully managed demand for incoming shipping volume with maintaining full capability to deliver on time,” it said.UPS had completed its pre-Christmas deliveries on December 24 and had continued to deliver between 97 and 98 per cent of packages on time — just below normal levels — in the week of Christmas and the week before.FedEx’s shares fell 2 per cent on Christmas Eve and were little changed on Wednesday at $149.18 by markets close in New York. UPS’s shares held steady over the festive period but were down 0.7 per cent at $97.08 on Wednesday.

In 2013, the company had to deliver some packages after Christmas after a late spike in online orders clogged its network. The following year, it misjudged demand and overspent in a bid to avoid the problems from the year prior.

Some of your devotees have urged me not to criticise your strategy in the season of goodwill, to which I reply: “Bah, humbug!”I have always regarded your recourse to fourth century philanthropy and wasteful use of working capital as characteristic of an entrenched founder whose energy has been devoted to delighting underage customers at great expense while ignoring all management discipline. You have displayed little interest in covering your cost of capital, let alone exceeding it.Life at St Nicholas is one long party. Free food for your elves, who receive generous compensation to make bespoke, non-standardised products. Presents offered to anyone who writes you a begging letter and has been “good” according to some vague metric. Jingle bells, rides in one-horse open sleighs, eggnog cocktails: Oh, what fun you have with my money.Your entire enterprise exists to supply presents one day a year, yet everyone is on the payroll for 365 days. You will not even extend your franchise to Black Friday, which is a blatant missed opportunity. Meanwhile, you insist on delivering down chimneys, ignoring the fact that only one segment of your target demographic lives in a house. What is wrong with doors?In short, St Nicholas is one of the least innovative companies I have ever encountered. It is as fat and happy as its chief executive, sticking religiously to an ageing business formula that exposes it to being disrupted. I know of several technology start-ups that are raising capital to create applications on which children could bid for presents that would be made by contract artisans and delivered by unicorns.Given your lack of research and development, I have consistently argued that any surplus capital should be returned to shareholders as one-off tax-efficient distribution close to the year end — on December 25, for example. You have ignored my requests, choosing to brighten up children’s lives at random, rather than rewarding investors whose interests are aligned.The intrinsic value of St Nicholas can only be grasped on a panoramic view of the past, present and yet-to-come.Since you are too busy to engage in constructive dialogue, I held discussions this year with other hedge funds. We devised a plan for a merger of your business with related companies, followed by a series of spin-offs and initial public offerings to create more focused corporations. The structure was approved by several investment banks and law firms that are paid by the deal.By combining St Nicholas, Walmart, Macy’s, WPP and Federal Express, and then splitting them up, we would create a set of vertical businesses in the gift making, fulfilment, merchandising and events spaces. They could license the Father Christmas brand and be incorporated in Lapland for tax purposes.Recently, however, I was visited at home by three ghostly analysts, bearing fundamental research into your business. They warned me that, although I base my investment model on dividends flowing into my counting house over three to five years, the intrinsic value of St Nicholas can only be grasped on a panoramic view of the past, present and yet-to-come.Santa, I have listened to many conference calls and seen many presentations, but none has struck me with the force of these insights. It is not an exaggeration to say that I have undergone a complete conversion in my view of St Nicholas. Warren Buffett advises investors to seek exceptional managers and I now see that few achieve your longevity.You embodied the new economy before the idea had been conceived. St Nicholas is a global business, receiving signals from far corners of the earth and delivering packets over an integrated network. It works at super-high speed, faster than broadband in South Korea, and knows no boundaries. The internet is antique by comparison.Your lack of interest in profitability struck the traditionalist in me as foolish but I have come to understand the virtues of reinvesting revenues over several centuries in order to dominate your market and entrench your monopoly.Jeff Bezos, your closest logistics competitor, has copied your tactics but, although Amazon crushes small shops, department stores and big box retailers, it cannot topple you.This has helped you to build the biggest social network in the world, putting Facebook to shame. Everyone includes your messages in cards and parents pretend the gifts they buy for their children come from you — you outsource many deliveries at zero cost. By combining a jolly presence with sophisticated viral marketing, you have expanded your reach everywhere.Since these revelations, there has been a spring in my step. Coca-Cola once used your image in advertising, prompting rumours that it had invented Father Christmas, but it has nothing to teach you about branding and consumer appeal. My investment in St Nicholas has even greater potential than Mr Buffett’s stake in Coke, and I intend to hold it in my portfolio indefinitely.It used to be cold, bleak, biting weather outside, but now it feels quite warm for the time of year.Merry Christmas to one and all,Ebenezer Scroogejohn.gapper@ft.comFaith-based investment offers enduring returns / From Zaki Cooper

Its shares were down 4.1 per cent to $22.94. Chevron, an oil major, fell 3 per cent to $90.60.Oracle, the maker of business software, was one of the weakest performers on the S&P 500 after it posted mixed quarterly results after the closing bell on Wednesday.The company’s profits declined 12 per cent in the quarter to the end of November to $2.2bn, weighed down by a rising US dollar.Sales, meanwhile, fell 6 per cent to $9bn, missing estimates of $9.1bn. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 63 cents, topping estimates by 3 cents.Oracle posted a 26 per cent gain in its cloud division sales as its software-as-a-service business shined.Many of the biggest companies in the technology industry, such as Microsoft, are trying to deepen their exposure to the growing trend of companies moving computing operations from individual workstations to centralised data centres.Brad Reback, an analyst who covers the stock at Stifel Financial, said in a note to clients that he expected “strong cloud momentum to continue”.But sales of on-premise software, still Oracle’s biggest business by a wide margin, declined 7 per cent.Oracle’s shares dropped 5.1 per cent to $36.93, extending their 2015 decline to 17.9 per cent.All but one of the leading S&P 500 sector was in the red, with energy and materials suffering the steepest declines, and utilities up 0.1 per cent.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 2,041.89, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.4 per cent to 17,495.84 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.4 per cent to 5,002.55.
84;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Fellow shipping company United Parcel Service advanced 0.7 per cent to $101.25 on the news.
86;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-12-16T23:25:50Z;FedEx surges on upbeat earnings outlook;Robust results expected as ecommerce and parcel fees improve;Shares in FedEx rose in after-market trading after the express parcel service said it expected “solid earnings growth” over the next six months after recording robust results for the three months ended November.The fortunes of FedEx and UPS are often seen as closely linked to the health of the US and world economy, because they reflect business’s need to send packages to each other and deliver ecommerce products to consumers.Strong profit growth at the core FedEx Express air parcel business and at the FedEx Ground road delivery operation boosted group net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by 4.2 per cent to $691m. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $12.5bn. Adjusted net income — excluding the effect of one-off changes such as a tax revision — rose 17 per cent to $729m.The company reiterated its forecast that it would earn between $10.40 and $10.90 per share before mark-to-market pension adjustments over the year to the end of May.However, it sounded far more bullish about prospects than when it last announced results in September, when it cut the expected figure.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the improved profitability resulted from “better revenue quality”, or improved revenue per parcel, as well as ecommerce growth and cost-cutting.“We expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half of our fiscal year despite weakness in industrial production,” Mr Graf said.FedEx’s shares rose 5.5 per cent to $156.27 in after- hours trading following announcement of the results, adding to gains of almost 3 per cent during the day. GAAP earnings per share rose 5.6 per cent to $2.44, although that was short of analysts’ consensus expectation of $2.54.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the company increased margins, earnings per share, cash flows, and returns on invested capital.“These basic trends should continue well into the future barring major events or macroeconomic factors,” he said.Both FedEx and UPS have been wrestling with the challenges of handling growing volumes of ecommerce deliveries to consumers — whom it is typically more expensive to serve — at a time when traditional business deliveries are weak.Operating income at the FedEx Express air parcel business rose 26 per cent to $622m as the company raised prices and felt the benefit of its cost-cutting initiatives. Revenue fell 6 per cent to $6.59bn as fuel surcharge income fell and currency movements worked against the company.At FedEx Ground, which has been a particular beneficiary of rising ecommerce, operating income rose 13 per cent to $526m, on revenue up 32 per cent to $4.05bn.FedEx is in the course of the €4.4bn purchase of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, intended to turn the company into a far more powerful competitor in Europe.Mr Smith said that, providing the offer for TNT Express receives regulatory approval, the acquisition would “quickly broaden” FedEx’s “portfolio of solutions,” particularly in Europe.“Despite contraction of US exports due to high US dollar and low world GDP and trade growth, the overall market for international door-to-door express continues to increase, also driven by ecommerce,” Mr Smith said.
87;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-12-11T22:47:50Z;Week ahead: It’s all about the Fed;;After a rough week for global financial markets, focus next week is expected to shift squarely to the Federal Reserve.The broad S&P 500 shed 3.8 per cent this week in its steepest slide since August. At the same time, US crude oil futures tumbled, and the high-yield debt market showed rising signs of strain. Probably not exactly the conditions Fed head Janet Yellen hoped for heading into the final policy-setting meeting of the year.Nevertheless, economists broadly expect the Fed to increase short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006 as US job growth remains robust and inflation slowly heads closer to the central bank’s target.The announcement is due at 2pm ET on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Ms Yellen later in the afternoon. Investors will also get the latest look at policymakers’ forecasts for the unemployment rate, the path of interest rates and other key variables.A continued point of debate among Wall Street economists is whether the Fed will be able to deliver a message that is sufficiently dovish to avoid sparking turmoil in financial markets.Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, notes:…while the notion of a ‘dovish hike’ is somewhat absurd, it may well be the case that next week’s communications come off as dovish, insofar as emphasizing data dependency will entail stressing that there is no set commitment to future hikes. This isn’t the same as one-and-done, but rather one-and-wait-and-see-more-data.On the corporate front, business software heavyweight Oracle reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. FedEx, the US package delivery company, which is seen as an economic bellwether, is also out with its quarterly earnings that day.Traders will also get a handful of important US economic reports.Data on consumer-level inflation due on Tuesday are expected to show prices increased at a year-over-year pace of 0.5 per cent in November amid a continued drag from oil prices. Excluding the food and energy components, prices are forecast to have climbed at a 2 per cent rate, up from 1.9 per cent the month prior.A report on new home construction is due out on Wednesday. Economists expect new housing starts to have risen by 7.3 per cent in November from the month prior, while permits to build new homes may have fallen 1 per cent.Elsewhere, on Thursday, European Union leaders meet to discuss the UK’s membership in the bloc. British Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this month abandoned hope to forge a new membership deal by 2016.
88;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-11-18T06:19:58Z;Indian carriers fined for fuel surcharge collusion;IndiGo, Jet and SpiceJet penalised $40m for ‘acting in parallel’ on cargo fuel surcharges;India’s competition watchdog has imposed $40m in fines on three of the country’s private airlines after complaints from courier companies including FedEx and DHL that the carriers colluded to fix fuel surcharges for freight.Wednesday’s ruling against IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet by the Competition Commission of India is the first of its kind against the country’s airlines, though politicians have previously expressed anger at private carriers for sharp increases in fares during peak holiday travel seasons.The competition watchdog said the carriers’ imposition of fuel surcharges on freight in May 2008 — and subsequent near-simultaneous increases of the fees — “undermines the economic development of the country”.However, the CCI said it had considered “the precarious financial position of the airlines” in levying its penalty, which it set at 1 per cent of each carrier’s average turnover for the past three years.The CCI said it found no direct proof that airlines had deliberately colluded, but said they “acted in parallel” in setting the same fuel surcharges at the same time and “the only plausible reason . . . was collusion”.The competition watchdog cleared state-owned Air India and small private carrier Go Air, both also accused in the initial complaint, of any wrongdoing.The CCI was acting on a 2013 complaint filed by the Express Council of India, which represents 29 international and Indian delivery companies including FedEx, DHL, BlueDart and UPS.IndiGo said it was studying the decision, and would “take legal steps to challenge the order in the appropriate forum”. The carrier, which debuted on the Bombay Stock Exchange last month after raising $458m in an initial public offering, said it had been advised by its lawyers that “it is not in contravention” of India’s 2002 competition act.Jet, which is partly owned by UAE-based Etihad, said it was “not in contravention” of anti-cartel rules and would “pursue all available legal steps to defend its position”. SpiceJet is also expected to appeal.Kapil Kaul, South Asia chief executive for the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation, said he did not believe India’s airlines — bitter rivals in a notoriously tough market — had actively conferred with each other, but that they do typically quickly match any pricing changes by rivals.“Knowing these guys well, I don’t think they talk to each other,” Mr Kaul said. “But it’s a fact that if one airline hikes or raises a fare, everybody follows. Nobody wants to lose the upside or take the hit on the downside if somebody raises fares and they stay the same . . . If that’s cartelisation, it’s been going on for years.”India’s air freight business has expanded rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in online shopping led by ecommerce companies such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal.In May 2008, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Jet imposed a Rs5-per-kg fuel surcharge on freight as global oil prices spiked to $140 per barrel that summer.The Express Council called the fuel surcharge “an act of cartelisation” and noted it had since been increased by the airlines — virtually in tandem and by the same amount — even as fuel prices plummeted.The carriers denied the allegations, saying fuel charges were adjusted in response to changing market conditions, and were also sometimes reduced or even withdrawn.In addition to the fine, the CCI ordered the carriers to “cease and desist” from their “anti-competitive behaviour”.
89;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-11-03T05:10:44Z;Liège feels the threat of FedEx takeover;Dark clouds may be on the horizon for the TNT Express cargo centre;"TNT Express has helped Belgium become the cargo king of Europe. For nearly two decades, the Dutch express delivery company has poured money into its hub at the civilian airport in Liège, turning the struggling former coal and steel town into one of the biggest air cargo centres on the continent.After putting an initial €65m into the facility in the late 1990s, TNT has added to its investment every year since, doubling the size of its hub in 2007.Since 2000 it has invested nearly €100m in the Liège centre. The facility is now 75,000 square metres, and the eighth largest delivery centre in Europe, behind cities such as Paris and Frankfurt. But after two decades of nearly uninterrupted growth, dark clouds lurk on the horizon.Earlier this year, US giant FedEx announced a €4.4bn takeover of TNT, raising questions as to whether it would keep Liège airport as a European hub. Officially, FedEx and TNT have said Liège would remain a “significant operation” if the European Commission approves the deal.Asked how Liège would fit with FedEx’s plans, a spokesperson said: “We anticipate that all will play an important role in our network. However, the details of how our operations will work together will only be determined as our integration planning progresses.”But industry insiders point out that FedEx has air hubs in Paris and Cologne. The other big players in the European delivery market — Deutsche Post-owned DHL and US delivery company UPS — each have one airport hub, Leipzig in Germany, and Cologne respectively, which many view as essential to running an efficient cargo operation.The high cost of maintaining an air hub has Belgian officials concerned about what a FedEx/TNT deal might mean for Liège.Liège, despite its lack of international stature, has an airport that is a convenient, low-traffic facility. Limited passenger traffic means little congestion. In addition, those who operate from the airport get unlimited night flights and generally favourable weather conditions. The roads are also good. Southern Belgium lies in the middle of what logistics experts call the “golden triangle” of Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris; the city is just four hours by road from 66 per cent of the European market.Of the more than 400,000 tonnes of cargo that passed through Liège airport between January and August of this year, TNT accounted for more than half. What is more, of the 3,500 jobs at the airport — just over an hour’s drive from Brussels — TNT accounts for almost 2,000.TNT’s hub, which is open seven days a week, sorts 90,000 parcels a night, or roughly 450 tonnes. It connects Liège to 65 European airports, plus others in the Asia Pacific and the US, and it operates about 50 aircraft and 140 trucks and vans a night. For the airport, losing TNT would be like losing more than an appendage, one industry insider quips.However, Liège has attracted other suitors. UPS tried but failed in early 2013 to buy TNT. Back then, the European Commission said it blocked the proposed €5.2bn deal because it believed the combination would cut the number of package delivery companies to just two or three in certain markets.This time things could be different. The companies suggested last month that Brussels would clear the deal, saying the Commission had assured them there would be no serious objections."
90;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-10-20T22:46:42Z;FedEx poised for go-ahead on €4.4bn TNT deal;Delivery groups signal Brussels’ assurance takeover will be approved;FedEx’s planned €4.4bn takeover of TNT Express is all but certain to receive approval, the two express parcel companies have signalled, after they were assured by the European Commission that the deal would face no serious objections.The companies issued a joint release in response to a media report saying there would be no formal statement of objections from Brussels, which would have suggested serious problems for the deal.The report sent TNT’s shares, which had been languishing well below the €8 per share bid price, up 10 per cent on Euronext to €7.55. The news means that the struggling Netherlands-based operator is all but certain to be taken over some time in the first half next year.There had been persistent speculation that European competition concerns might cause problems for the deal since the commission launched an in-depth investigation— a possible prelude to an issuing of objections — in July.The commission had been expected to express concern about FedEx’s plans for its two European air hubs — in Paris and Cologne — and TNT’s hub in Liege, Belgium. The regulator had also been reported to be concerned that the merged company would have a dominant position on some routes between Europe and China and India.The statement leaves open the possibility that FedEx has given undertakings on the potential concerns. FedEx told the Financial Times on Tuesday that it expected all three of the hubs to play an “important role” in its network but gave no details of its plans.The companies’ statement says the commission’s deadline to issue a statement of objections would be October 23 but that it has assured the companies that none will be issued.FedEx agreed the takeover with TNT in April. The company had been making losses in the highly competitive express parcels market, including a €137m loss in the final quarter of last year, and had been keen to find a merger partner.TNT’s deepening financial difficulties mean that FedEx is poised to acquire the operator — founded in Australia but now a big force in Europe and a few emerging markets, including Brazil — more cheaply than its previous suitor.UPS, FedEx’s main competitor in the US, made a €5.2bn bid for TNT in 2012. However, UPS, which is stronger in many European markets than FedEx, was forced to abandon that bid because of commission concerns about the potential market power of the merged entity.
91;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-09-16T14:37:31Z;FedEx cuts 2016 forecast on weak demand;Package delivery company seen as a bellwether of the global economy reports fewer small-size deliveries;FedEx cut its forecast for the year to May 2016 as rising costs in its ground business and weak demand elsewhere produced quarterly results short of analysts’ expectations.The package delivery company, which is often seen as a bellwether of the global economy, trimmed its full-year forecast to a range of between $10.40 to $10.90 earnings per share, before year-end pension adjustments. The company had previously predicted full-year earnings per share of $10.60 to $11.10.It cited weaker-than-expected demand for its services in which operators fill trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers, and higher-than-expected operating costs at its FedEx ground road delivery services.Founder and chief executive Fred Smith, who started FedEx in 1973, said the company’s “profit improvement programme” which it instituted in 2012 was “on track and delivering impressive results”.“FedEx is performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade,” said Mr Smith.The full-year revision came as FedEx announced net income for the quarter up 6 per cent to $692m, on revenue up 5 per cent to $12.3bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 7 per cent to $2.42 — but fell short of analysts’ $2.46 consensus forecast.Shares in the company closed down almost 3 per cent at $149.46.FedEx, like its main rival UPS, is battling competition from online shopping which typically serves private homes, rather than offices of its traditional business customers. It is looking to expand its global reach following its proposed €4.4bn takeover of Netherlands-based TNT Express announced in April.Mike Glenn, vice-president for market development, said ecommerce was clearly changing the dynamics of the industry and driving “incredible growth”.But he went on: “There are also higher operating expenses that are driven by the network expansion we’ve been going through the last couple of years, mainly in the form of higher rent and depreciation.”The Memphis-based company said late on Tuesday that it would increase several shipping rates by an average of 4.9 per cent in January 2016, as people ship larger, heavier packages and residential deliveries have increased.The price rise was announced on the same day as rival United Parcel Service said it plans to hire up to 95,000 workers to handle additional business during the holiday season this year.In its biggest FedEx Express air parcel business, operating income grew 45 per cent to $545m, on revenue down 4 per cent to $6.59bn. Profitability improved because of higher prices and lower expenses thanks to favourable currency movements, while revenue fell because falling fuel prices cut income from fuel surcharges.US domestic package volumes grew 1 per cent, while FedEx international economy volumes rose 4 per cent and FedEx international priority volumes fell 5 per cent.At its FedEx ground division, operating income fell 1 per cent to $537m, on revenue up 29 per cent to $3.83bn — the sharp revenue increase reflected the company’s takeover earlier this year of Genco, a third-party logistics provider, as well as a change in the accounting treatment of the company’s economy smartpost deliveries. The accounting changes and higher-than-expected operating costs due to growing package size cut the operating profit margin.Operating income at FedEx freight, the freight forwarding division, fell 21 per cent to $168m, on revenue of $1.6bn against last year’s $1.61bn, because of lower-than-expected demand for less-than-truckload freight.
92;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-07-31T15:12:47Z;Brussels launches in-depth probe into FedEx-TNT tie-up;European Commission says proposed takeover could push up prices for business customers and consumers;Brussels has launched an in-depth probe into FedEx’s proposed acquisition of rival TNT Express, throwing fresh doubt on the $4.8bn deal.The probe is a setback for the US delivery behemoth and many analysts, who had expected the takeover to be waved through quickly by European regulators.Officials at the European Commission have derailed one takeover deal involving TNT Express, blocking an attempt by UPS to buy the Dutch group in 2013.Shares in TNT Express fell 1 per cent to €7.63 immediately after the announcement on Friday.The commission said the proposed merger “could lead to higher prices for business customers and consumers”, because of a lack of competition from rivals DHL and UPS.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, said: “Many businesses, and in particular ecommerce, rely heavily on affordable and reliable small package delivery services, and many consumers depend on these services to ensure rapid and safe delivery of goods they have bought.”Some competition lawyers had warned that the commission would find it hard to approve the FedEx TNT deal if it applied the same methodology used in the UPS bid.The commission blocked the 2013 UPS deal on the basis that the number of parcel delivery groups would have fallen to only two or three in many markets.In some countries, this would have left DHL as the sole alternative to a combined UPS and TNT — and lead to price increases, according to the European Commission.Both FedEx and TNT Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The costs of parcel delivery within Europe has fallen under the spotlight of the EU’s executive arm in recent months.Brussels is attempting to push through reforms aimed at creating a so-called digital single market, which is focused on breaking down barriers to online trade.The cost of delivery is a major hindrance for ecommerce in some markets, with huge discrepancies in price across much of Europe.Ms Vestager said: “The commission must . . . make sure that FedEx’s takeover of TNT would not impede effective competition and would not lead to higher prices for consumers.”
93;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-07-26T06:09:26Z;DHL braced for home turf fight with FedEx after TNT deal;US group’s acquisition of Dutch company should strengthen its delivery network in Europe;Each night, by the time most people in Leipzig are asleep, about 60 aircraft in DHL’s distinctive canary yellow livery come in to land at the city’s airport.From mobile phones to refrigerated vaccines, goods are transferred between jets for onward journeys to distant airports such as Bahrain and Singapore, or sorted for transport by road or rail within Europe.DHL’s hub at Leipzig, where about 100,000 parcels and documents are processed each hour, highlights the vast scale and reach of the German logistics group – one of four companies that dominate the fast delivery of packages around the world.But the four may soon become three, if regulators approve the €4.4bn takeover of Netherlands-based TNT Express by the US logistics giant FedEx. TNT reports second-quarter results on Monday.The deal poses a formidable challenge to DHL in Europe, where it is market leader, by combining the US company’s global reach with TNT’s road network in the EU, according to analysts.FedEx intends to gain European market share from both DHL and UPS by winning contracts from multinational business clients that it already serves on other continents, say Credit Suisse analysts. FedEx is also seeking to gain share in the fast-growing ecommerce market from smaller European competitors.“A key premise of the planned merger is to reduce FedEx delivery costs within Europe,” says Robert Salmon, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “Right now FedEx is uncompetitive [within Europe], they have a high relative cost to move a package as they don't have a footprint on the continent.”The TNT deal should fix this problem because the Dutch company’s network of delivery depots and lorries is expected to reduce pickup and drop-off costs for the US group in Europe.In ecommerce, these first and last-mile costs are often disproportionately high for logistics providers, and this expense has been exacerbated by the rising number of people living alone because often packages cannot be delivered at the first attempt.Though DHL, part of Deutsche Post, would remain the market leader, with 19 per cent of Europe’s courier express parcel market, the enlarged FedEx group involving TNT would have 17 per cent, based on 2013 figures from TNT.But analysts do not expect a combined FedEx/TNT to try and close the gap on DHL through a price war. After DHL lost nearly $10bn in five years in a failed attempt to enter the US domestic market, abandoned in 2008, its competitors are unlikely to pursue a price-cutting strategy on the German company’s home turf.Instead, analysts expect FedEx will aim to compete on superior quality of service.Furthermore, the threat to DHL posed by an enlarged FedEx is not likely to be an immediate one. Integrating TNT into FedEx will take time, and rivals will be quick to exploit any blunders.In an interview with the Financial Times, Deutche Post DHL chief executive Frank Appel says the company is looking forward to picking up customers.“Uncertainty is always good for the companies who are not looking for M&A,” he adds. “Of course customers are concerned [about] what it means for the service in particular for this area . . . any service disruption has significant impact.”Mr Appel also points out that while the impact of FedEx’s takeover of TNT will be felt principally in Europe, DHL is also the market leader for express courier services in Asia and Africa.Analysts agree there is probably a short-term advantage for DHL as companies that already have contracts with both TNT and FedEx are expected to seek an alternative logistics provider, to avoid concentrating such work in the hands of one group.FedEx will need to make a substantial investment in the combined business.TNT has been reeling since the European Commission blocked UPS’s €5.16bn takeover of the Dutch company two years ago.TNT lost market share to DHL and UPS during and after the failed takeover, and its net loss widened from €122m in 2013 to €195m last year. The company is cutting costs and upgrading information technology systems as it seeks to compete more effectively.TNT is geared towards business-to-business logistics rather than residential parcel delivery — a market dominated by DHL and UPS in Europe. Business-to-business delivery is more profitable, but the rise of ecommerce means logistics companies are looking to residential deliveries for sales growth.Joel Ray, analyst at Transport Intelligence, a consultancy, says: “FedEx would have to spend a lot of money on new depots if they want to reorient the business in Europe towards ecommerce.”TNT Express may have its headquarters just outside Amsterdam, but the future of the business will be decided 150 miles away — in Brussels.Officials at the European Commission are looking closely at FedEx’s proposed takeover of TNT. They have until August 3 to decide whether to approve the deal or launch an in-depth investigation.The decision is complicated by the recent history of TNT Express. In 2013, the commission blocked a €5.2bn bid by UPS for the Dutch company.This deal was nixed because it would have reduced the number of large logistics groups in many markets across the EU, which — the commission argued — might have led to increased prices for consumers.Some competition lawyers argue that applying the same logic to the FedEx/TNT deal would trigger the same result: a blocked transaction.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s combative competition commissioner, has repeatedly warned companies that she sees it as part of her role to protect consumers from the highest costs — and that she would block mergers that led to this, no matter how large or politically sensitive.On top of this, the commission has taken an unusually close interest in the workings of the delivery industry in recent months.Lowering the cost of delivery for consumers has been one of the main aims of the so-called digital single market — a package of reforms launched by the commission, aimed in part at boosting ecommerce across the bloc.A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment on the FedEx/TNT deal.

The index, which recovered slightly to close at 562.62, has lost nearly 7 per cent since the start of May.Chesapeake Energy led the declines on the index. The oil and gas producer fell 3.51 per cent to $12.09. It was followed by Range Resources, which closed 2.15 per cent lower at $52.74 and Southwestern Energy, which dropped 1.2 per cent to $23.41. Consol Energy, which was down 2.2 per cent in midday trading at $24.23, recovered to close at $24.91.While data from the Energy Information Administration showed a bigger than expected drop in overall crude stockpiles, they remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least eight decades. US refineries unexpectedly reduced their operating capacities, suggesting weakening demand for oil.Plenty of short sellers in Kythera Biopharmaceuticals had their fingers burnt after the cosmetic treatment developer struck a deal to be acquired by Botox maker Allergan.Shares in Kythera surged by more than 22 per cent to close at $74.11 following news that Allergan has agreed to buy it for $2.1bn. The deal — a mix of shares and cash — will hand Allergan what it describes as a non-surgical treatment, known as Kybella, for double chins. Some 6m Kythera shares, or nearly 30 per cent of the company’s total float, are being sold short, according to Bloomberg and Nasdaq short-interest data.FedEx suffered its biggest one-day drop in more than a year after the US delivery company reported earnings slightly below expectations for the fourth quarter. The company, which is often seen as an indicator of the health of the US economy, reported volume growth of 2 per cent for express packages and 5 per cent for ground deliveries, driven by online shopping.FedEx shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $175.88 in midday trading, their largest decline since January 2014, rising to close at $176.73. The stock weighed on the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was within sight of a 10 per cent decline so far this year.Lacklustre guidance from Adobe Systems weighed on shares of the Photoshop software maker. Shares fell 2.5 per cent to close at $77.91 after the company forecast adjusted earnings below analyst expectations — the second time this year the company has disappointed investors with lacklustre guidance.Elsewhere the wider US equity market reversed earlier losses following the latest assesment of the economy from the Federal Reserve. Janet Yellen, chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates only gradually in coming years.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to close at 2,100.31. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 0.17 per cent to close at 17,934.44 and 5,064.62 respectively.
95;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx amends rules to keep Fred Smith in top job;US delivery company’s quarterly earnings miss analysts’ forecasts;FedEx has changed its corporate governance rules to allow Fred Smith, its founder and chief executive, to remain at the head of the US delivery company for another three years.The company said on Wednesday that its board had approved a change in its corporate governance guidelines to raise the mandatory retirement age for directors from 72 to 75.Mr Smith, who started FedEx in 1973, will turn 71 in August.David Steiner, lead independent director, said the change in the rules was “consistent with the market trend of increasing the mandatory retirement age for board members”.The announcement came as FedEx reported earnings slightly below expectations for the three months to May, but predicted strong growth for the year ahead with a rise in earnings of about 21 per cent.The company, which is often seen as an indicator of the health of the US economy, reported volume growth of 2 per cent for express packages and 5 per cent for ground deliveries, driven by online shopping.Michael Glenn, executive vice-president for market development, said on a call with analysts that the company expected “moderate” growth in the world economy, with US gross domestic product rising 2.3 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 2016.Earnings per share, excluding pensions charges and some other costs, were $2.66 for quarter to May 31, the last of the company’s fiscal year. That was 4.7 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2014, but a little below the average analysts’ forecast of $2.69.Revenues for the quarter were also weaker than expected at $12.1bn, up 2.5 per cent on the year but below the average forecast of about $12.3bn.FedEx shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $176.43 in early trading in New York.Higher volumes for express and ground deliveries, and the benefits of cost-cutting initiatives, were offset by higher incentive pay for staff and unfavourable net impacts from fuel costs and the weather.Mr Smith said 2014-15 had been a transformative year, including acquisitions that “promise to strengthen our portfolio of services and change what’s possible for customers”.In April, FedEx agreed a €4.4bn deal to buy TNT Express of the Netherlands, a move that will give it a much greater presence in Europe, where it has lagged behind rivals DHL and UPS.For the year to May 2015, FedEx’s adjusted earnings per share were $8.95, up 27 per cent on 2013-14.For the coming year, the company indicated it expected EPS of $10.60-$11.10, an increase of 18-24 per cent. Those numbers exclude charges for the mark-to-market valuation of FedEx’s pension assets, which is volatile from quarter to quarter, and in the company’s view distorts the picture of the performance of its businesses.Reported adjusted earnings also excluded other costs including $276m in the fourth quarter for the retirement of 15 aircraft and accelerated plans to retire 23 more. Including those charges, the company reported EPS of $3.65 for the year, down 51 per cent from 2013-14.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the operating performance “significantly improved” in 2014-15, as the company “focused on revenue quality and executed on our profit improvement programme initiatives”.A drop in revenue at the core express delivery business because of lower fuel charges was offset by growth in volumes, including a 2 per cent increase for US domestic packages in the fourth quarter.

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.When Majestic Wine bought Naked Wines in April for £70m in cash and shares, it not only acquired a fast-growing online business, but also Rowan Gormley, its founder, and now boss of the combined group.Mr Gormley will lay out his plans for Majestic Wine and the market will be looking for signs his expertise in online retailing can help revitalise the struggling chain of 210 wine shops.Pressure from discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl has squeezed Majestic, which was forced to cut prices during the tough Christmas trading period, hitting margins. It has also been trying to fend off Waitrose at the upper end of the market.Former chief executive Steve Lewis stepped down in February, a month after shares dropped 17 per cent in a single day in January following downgrades to market forecasts.Analysts will be looking for Mr Gormley to ask tough questions about Majestic’s store target of 330 sites, its pricing and its minimum purchase policy, which requires customers to buy at least six bottles in-store.

Majestic Wine FY 25.73p (26.60p)The ground keeps shifting for Ashtead, the British group that rents construction equipment mainly to businesses in the US, as it reports full-year results.In March it raised its full-year financial forecasts amid balmy conditions in the UK and US construction markets. But twice last month the group, which rents out diggers, cherry pickers and generators, tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after United Rentals, a US rival, talked down activity in the sector given the drop in demand from oil and gas customers.Ashtead, which has a market capitalisation of £5.7bn, rebounded, proving that it still had the support of the City. A clutch of analysts have reiterated “buy” ratings for the stock, pointing to the group’s aggressive growth strategy as it looks to increase its clout in the sector.Its American business, Sunbelt, provides more than 90 per cent of group profit and the shares are valued for growth because the US has been slower to adopt equipment rental than mature markets such as the UK and Japan.

Ashtead FY 61.75p (46.30p)When FedEx, the express parcel-delivery service, reports results for the year to May 31, it will be under pressure to show that it is managing to grow while keeping costs and capacity under control.Careful management of its costs has enabled it over the past year to beat analysts’ expectations repeatedly while also avoiding some of the operational problems that have befallen UPS, its larger rival. UPS suffered severe congestion in much of its network over Christmas 2013 after underestimating traffic levels. It then overspent the following Christmas after overestimating traffic.FedEx continued its cost-cutting efforts on June 1 when it announced that it was accelerating the retirement of 15 fuel-hungry aircraft.Analysts forecast net income adjusted for one-off items up 1.6 per cent to $2.57bn, on revenue 4.6 per cent higher at $47.7bn. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 2.4 per cent to $8.93.In common with other logistics companies, FedEx faces upheaval as its business shifts towards deliveries of ecommerce purchases to homes. Express parcel services previously concentrated on handling larger bundles of packages to business addresses, which are easier to serve. The shift has encouraged a move away from higher-value, fast services and towards slower deliveries, often by ground.Although FedEx remains smaller in most markets than UPS, it is set to grow significantly in Europe and some other important geographies if its planned €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, announced in April, goes through. FedEx, which has only a 5 per cent share in the European market, is expected to face far fewer barriers to buying TNT — which has 12 per cent of the European market — than UPS did to its €5.4bn bid for the company in 2012.UPS, which has 16 per cent of the European market, abandoned its offer because of opposition by European competition regulators.
Robert Wright● The strong US dollar is likely to have hit results at Oracle hard, with lower revenues expected.Last year the currency impact weighed heavily on the US business software company, but it is expected to take an even bigger toll in the all-important fiscal fourth quarter to the end of May, when it typically records its strongest sales.Oracle has set a modest target for the quarter, with revenues growing between 1 per cent and 6 per cent in constant-currency terms.With overall results under pressure, Oracle executives are expected to direct the spotlight again on the small but fast-growing cloud business, a focus of recent earnings announcements though still representing less than 6 per cent of revenues.Disappointing quarterly results two weeks ago from Workday, a human resources company, were seen on Wall Street as a sign that Oracle had intensified cloud business competition.Analysts expect the group to report lower sales than a year ago, with revenues of $11bn, from $11.3bn last time. Pro-forma earnings per share are expected to be 87 cents, down from 92 cents.
Richard Waters● Betfair’s full-year results will serve to cement the online betting exchange’s position as the frontrunner in the gambling industry after a strong 12 months during which its shares have more than doubled in value.Analysts are expecting the company to report strong revenue growth of 20 per cent to £472.2m and an even bigger rise in pre-tax profits, which are forecast to grow 49 per cent to £91.5m, according to consensus estimates from Bloomberg.The high expectations come despite the absence of a World Cup this year and the introduction of regulations, in particular a point-of-consumption tax in December, which means gambling companies have to pay duty on bets placed by UK customers even if they are booked overseas.Betfair, which floated at a £1.3bn valuation in 2010, has spent much of its time as a public company beneath its float price of £13.The shares, which finally came back up above water in November last year, were boosted by a profit upgrade in March and are trading at more than £25.However, analysts at Numis warned this month that the share price had “got ahead of itself”, arguing that because of competition in the online gambling space Betfair deserved a lower rating and share price of £21.

97;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-05-26T17:10:12Z;Aerotropolis economic zones brace for take-off;Air travel links the world so airports might conceivably play a more central role in city life;Air travel is the thread that stitches the modern world together.Airlines carry a total of about 3bn passengers a year and air freight conveys more than a third, by value, of world trade. That ability to connect should put airports and the areas around them into the centre of town planning and even cities themselves.But even if aviation, according to the Air Transport Action Group, contributes just 2 per cent of human-generated carbon dioxide emissions, concerns about noise and pollution have put airports on the fringes.It was not always so. In the early days of flight, towns and cities competed to build easily accessible airports that would attract the new, fire-breathing engines of growth.Urban areas were later forced to relocate city-centre airports that grew into international hubs or were swallowed by urban sprawl.Kai Tak’s 1998 replacement by Chek Lap Kok makes for a less exciting final descent into Hong Kong, but the new airport handles more traffic, more safely. In 2008, Berlin’s Tempelhof, within easy cycling distance of the city centre, was another casualty.In London, many of the arguments against expanding Heathrow are based on its location within the UK metropolis.Proponents of “ Boris Island”, the Thames estuary site for a new airport favoured by London mayor Boris Johnson, have pointed to its remoteness as an advantage.Against that is the idea of an airport as the integral centre of a city, suggested in the last century by French cultural theorist Paul Virilio and championed more recently as the “aerotropolis” by US academic John Kasarda.The US has a scattering of fly-in air parks, communities of houses that centre on a runway to which the hangar/garage of each property has taxiway access. Spruce Creek in Florida is home to 5,000 aviation-friendly folk. Counterparts are to be found across the globe.On a much larger scale, Memphis in Tennessee, the home of logistics giant FedEx, has completed a plan for bringing order to haphazard development that resulted in “middle-class flight, crime and blight” around Memphis international airport.Chad Bowman, aerotropolis project manager at the city’s planning development division, says Memphis and the federal government have put $1.9m into formulating an economic development strategy that takes advantage of air, road, rail and river transport all converging in the central US city. Over the next five to 10 years, he expects this to result in investment by companies of “hundreds of millions, if not billions” of dollars.“We can package incentives and show companies that locating their business here makes sense because of the multi-modal transportation system,” says Mr Bowman. “That will create jobs, increase our tax base, and make the area more attractive to investors.”The chief value of the aerotropolis concept, says Mr Kasarda, is that “it provides its businesses with speedy connectivity to their long-distance suppliers, customers and enterprise partners, increasing company and urban efficiency.”He is advising Zhengzhou, a provincial capital south of Beijing. “The 415 sq km Zhengzhou airport economic zone, or aerotropolis, is coming along nicely,” he says, pointing to substantial increases in property investment and industrial growth in the area.The zone has become the world’s largest site for smartphone production. This, he adds, has pushed its airport to the top of the cargo growth table in China.Such feats of single-minded planning remain rare. Perhaps it is no surprise that the regions most “enthusiastic” about aerotropolises, says Mr Kasarda, are Asia and the Middle East.According to Rose Bridger, UK-based co-founder of the Global Anti-Aerotropolis Movement, “communities are largely excluded from planning and governance” and projects often entail the “displacement of rural people”. She adds: “Airports should revert to the established development model — being built to serve existing cities.”But, says Mr Bowman: “The aerotropolis concept is not just about more planes and more trains and more automobiles. It is about moving people closer to the centre of commerce and being more sustainable in our business practices. It’s about tying transportation systems together.”In London, perhaps one gap in its air services could be filled by a floating Thames heliport. That would put a liquid noise barrier between it and opponents, yet give much-needed proximity to the financial centres of the City and Docklands.
98;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;UPS rebounds to beat forecasts despite tough holiday season;Increased volume and revenue per package drives enlarged profits;"UPS, the parcel delivery service, recovered from a difficult last quarter of 2014 to report first-quarter net income up 12.6 per cent on the same period last year, to $1.03bn.Diluted earnings per share — up 14 per cent to $1.12 — exceeded analysts’ $1.09 consensus forecast for the quarter. Operating profit in the core US domestic package business increased 11 per cent to $1bn on revenue up 3.8 per cent to $8.8bn. Package volume rose 2.4 per cent and revenue per package grew 1.3 per cent.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the quarter had been a “good, solid quarter, with progress on all business fronts”.“We’re moving in the right direction,” he said. “We’re seeing growth across all the businesses.”The company reaffirmed its guidance for full-year earnings of between $5.05 and $5.30 per share.“The global economy is continuing to strengthen, although gradually,” Mr Kuehn said. “I feel good about the economic outlook, but there are still some clouds here and there.”The company’s shares rose 3.4 per cent by close of trading in New York, to $100.77.The first-quarter figures for UPS come after a second successive year of problems over the pre-Christmas delivery rush. Having underestimated likely volumes before Christmas 2013, the company overinvested last year and had expensive idle capacity.This year’s first-quarter results compare with a first quarter of 2014 when UPS, like other transport and logistics businesses, suffered heavily amid severe winter weather in North America.Mr Kuehn accepted last year’s comparable period had been relatively easy but insisted the company had still shown “good, steady growth” and that profits had improved materially.In its international package operations, operating profit grew 13.7 per cent to $498m but revenue declined 5 per cent to $2.97bn. The revenue decline reflected the increased strength of the US dollar, the company said. Without currency movements, revenue would have increased 2.4 per cent.In supply chain and freight, operating profit increased 3 per cent to $151m, on revenue up 1.3 per cent to $2.19bn. Freight forwarding revenue had suffered from the dollar’s strength, the company said. But the “flexibility of the UPS portfolio” had meant it was able to help customers during the quarter circumvent severe disruption at US West Coast ports.Mr Kuehn said the dispute had been a “mild positive” for the company. It had encouraged some shift of seaborne goods to air, helping to fill the company’s international flights. But delays to sea freight had hurt parts of the logistics business.UPS, like FedEx, its main competitor in the US, is grappling with both challenges and opportunities as a result of the rise of ecommerce. The growing business is producing significant extra volumes. But traffic flows are growing harder to predict; much of the traffic uses lower yielding, slower services and there are high costs from delivering to individual consumers’ homes, rather than in bulk to businesses."
99;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-17T22:39:09Z;Megamergers rarely mean megabucks for shareholders;Historically mergers and acquisitions have been value destroying;The strategic megamerger is back. In the past couple of weeks, consumer group Heinz announced plans to buy Kraft Foods, Royal Dutch Shell said that it was taking over BG and, this week, Nokia struck a deal to acquire Alcatel-Lucent.As with many deals aimed at industry consolidation, the acquirers have warned their shareholders that the benefits might take a while to arrive.Shell said that its purchase of BG would not be accretive for earnings per share until 2018. Nokia promised 2017 in the case of its purchase of Alcatel-Lucent. Similarly, FedEx has said that its planned purchase of TNT would have minimal impact on its bottom line in 2016 and 2017 but would be “very accretive” afterwards.Investors have every right to question these claims. Historically, mergers and acquisitions have been value destroying. A University of Virginia professor looked at several studies analysing deals struck between the 1960s through to 2000 and found that only 20 to 30 per cent of buying companies created long-term returns for investors significantly above the cost of capital. Twenty-first century mergers have been somewhat more sensible, with recent studies suggesting that about half create long-term shareholder value.But the current crop of large strategic deals gives reasons to be concerned. Global dealmaking is off to its fastest start since 2007, up 21 per cent year on year in the first quarter to $811bn. Equity prices are at frothy levels already, particularly in the US, so the mad scramble for deals could easily lead buyers to over pay. While that is less of a problem in all-share deals where the buyer’s equity benefits from market enthusiasm, investors may well ask whether cash payments could be better spent.Shell, for example, offered a 50 per cent premium over BG’s share price, including 383p per share in cash — and that money may be hard to make back if the oil price stays low.Furthermore, many of the companies involved had already made substantial cost cuts during the recent recession. Much of their future savings will have to come from finding genuine synergies, rather than simply trimming fat. Laying off employees, consolidating supplier contracts and closing redundant sites can be great for profitability but they take time.“All those measures have upfront costs and will take a year or two to break even,” says Scott Moeller, a Cass University professor. “You don’t get a payback for three or four years.”And, sometimes, the cuts do not work. A Cass study of UK deals from 1997 to 2010 found that acquirers on average failed to realise long-term gains in either efficiency (as measured by earnings over sales) or profitability (in terms of return on equity).However, there are individual cases that do prove that long waits for M&A synergies are well worth it.In 2011, drugs group Gilead spent $11bn to buy Pharmasset, which was developing treatments for hepatitis C, but could only promise investors that the deal would be “ accretive in 2015 and beyond”. Gilead shares lost a tenth of their value as some investors lost patience. But those who stuck around were rewarded. Gilead’s share price has quadrupled since then, largely because of the hepatitis drugs.Chief executives almost always benefit from big mergers because they end up with a larger remit and a pay cheque to match. Investors, meanwhile, are looking at 50-50 odds if the recent trends hold true. Proper scepticism is required.brooke.masters@ft.com
100;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-12T16:10:04Z;European M&A will test the soaring dollar;Bankers in the City of London sound more upbeat than they have for years, writes Patrick Jenkins;"Fred Smith, boss of FedEx of the US, said last week he would pay $4.8bn for Dutch courier TNT Express. That is 30 per cent less than the dollar amount that US rival UPS was prepared to stump up for TNT three years ago (before regulators got in the way).But the Dutch company’s shareholders have good reason to bite Mr Smith’s hand off.TNT’s earnings and share price have been weak for some time. In addition, this is a better offer than the dollar valuation would suggest. In euro terms, investors will receive only 15 per cent less than they would have done from UPS, thanks to the alchemy of the exchange rate. One dollar back in early 2012 was worth only 75 euro cents; now it buys more like 93 cents.Sure enough, Mr Smith cited the dollar’s appreciation against the euro as a primary driver of the deal. The broader question is whether a 12-year high in the dollar’s buying power will make 2015 a peak year for European mergers and acquisitions by US companies.M&A activity is clearly resurgent in general. The FedEx-TNT deal was dwarfed within hours by Royal Dutch Shell’s £47bn planned takeover of the UK’s BG — a transaction with little or no currency driver. And in the US, another giant pharmaceuticals acquisition was unveiled, with a bid for Perrigo by Mylan for $29bn.Until now, the M&A boom has left Europe behind. In the first three months of the year, M&A transactions in the US were up 30 per cent to $399bn — accounting for nearly half of all dealmaking — while volumes in Europe fell 4 per cent to $168bn, according to data from Thomson Reuters.But those numbers hide an interesting sub-theme in Europe. The value of inward bound deals from the US more than doubled over the 12 months to the end of March, hitting an eight-year high.Separate research from Deloitte, a consultancy, suggests that more than a quarter of all European deals last year were inbound acquisitions by US or Asian buyers — the highest proportion in more than a decade. The weak euro not only drew American buyers but many from China, too.Bankers in the City of London, where many of these European takeovers are masterminded, certainly sound more upbeat than they have for years. For them, the strong dollar is just the cherry on an already appetising cake.European targets, they argue, are fundamentally attractive because the worst of the eurozone crisis is over and a growth rebound is imminent. In addition, so their bullish pitch to potential buyers goes, cash resources are plentiful after years of steady profit accumulation and limited dealmaking. For a prospective US buyer, the M&A argument is all the more compelling because many such companies are sitting on cash piles outside the US that, for tax reasons, it makes no sense to repatriate.The low oil price is another spur. It is already prompting the kind of defensive opportunism evident in the Shell-BG deal. More broadly it makes any company with significant exposure to oil and energy prices, such as TNT, look that much more attractive.But there is a fine line between being bullish and being reckless. Mr Smith is perhaps best known for saving FedEx from bankruptcy years ago by betting the company’s last few thousand dollars on a game of Las Vegas blackjack. If the TNT deal is really rooted in a currency punt, that should worry investors.There are, after all, plenty of uncertainties hanging over Europe, undermining prospects for good M&A. The threat of Grexit and broader eurozone chaos, though mitigated, is firmly back on the agenda. A lot of European companies look expensive, too. Stock markets in Europe are not as inflated as those in more obviously thriving parts of the world, but they have still hit record highs in recent months.Electoral uncertainties in seven European countries this year, most significantly the UK and Spain, should be an additional deterrent, particularly for potential buyers in highly regulated sectors such as utilities and media. To see off all the dangers hanging over European M&A, the power of the dollar will need to be truly Herculean.The writer is the FT’s financial editor"

But it was not his Frenchness that won him the job this week as the first chief executive of the merging French and Swiss cement groups — Lafarge and Holcim — quite the opposite.Continue readingMr Dimon has been known as one of the few bank chief executives willing to challenge the regulatory architecture put in place since the 2008 crisis. Some of the individual warnings have been aired before but never woven into a Dimon crisis scenario.He said that, unlike in 2008 when JPMorgan attracted $100bn of deposits from weaker competitors, it was “unlikely that we would want to accept new deposits the next time around”.He wrote that while investors would traditionally flock to safe-haven securities in a storm, there would be “a greatly reduced supply of Treasuries to go around — in effect, there may be a shortage of all forms of good collateral” because of new liquidity requirements tying up safe assets at banks.Noting that banks underwrote stock offerings to help shore up other banks during the last crisis, he said they “might be reluctant to do this again”.● Related video: Dimon warns of volatility in next crisis
● Related FT Alphaville blog: A simpler JPMorganMylan’s $28.9bn offer takes Perrigo board by surpriseOne of the world’s largest generic drugmakers proposed buying a purveyor of cold remedies and hay fever medicines for $28.9bn, the latest in a string of takeover attempts in a pharmaceuticals industry gripped by deals fever, writes David Crow.Mylan’s unsolicited cash-and-stock proposal valued Perrigo at $205 a share, according to a letter sent on Monday to the chief executive of the Dublin-based company, which makes store-brand versions of paracetamol and decongestants.Mylan, which has a market capitalisation of $34bn, said it had discussed a combination with Perrigo’s management on a number of occasions in recent years, but the timing of its proposal appeared to take the target company by surprise.‘Eat or be eaten’ mindset to drive more deals as groups try to replace sales lost when patents expireContinue readingPerrigo said its board would meet to discuss the proposal, though few in the industry think Mylan will be able to secure an agreed deal without increasing its offer, pitched at a 25 per cent premium to Perrigo’s closing price on Friday.Some analysts suggested Mylan had moved quickly because it was itself a takeover target, possibly for Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker.Earlier this month, Mylan introduced a so-called “poison pill”, a mechanism that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders and help it fend off a hostile takeover offer.The takeover saga is the latest sign of deal activity in the healthcare industry, as companies take advantage of cheap debt to consolidate.In the first three months of 2015, the total value of healthcare deals reached $95.3bn, a 70 per cent increase on the same period a year ago, according to data from Thomson Reuters.FedEx moves to wrap up €4.4bn deal for ailing TNTWhen UPS launched a €5.2bn bid for the Netherlands’ TNT Express in 2012, FedEx, UPS’s arch-rival in the express parcel sector, sat by, writes Robert Wright.Reports suggested it was waiting for the Dutch company to come back on the market at a lower price.That happened this week. European competition regulators barred the UPS bid because it would have given the combined company such a large market share and TNT continued to struggle, recording a €195m net loss for 2014. FedEx on Tuesday announced it had agreed a €4.4bn takeover of the company.Antony Burgmans, TNT’s chairman, attributed the lower price to the reduced synergies that the FedEx deal is expected to realise compared with the UPS deal. FedEx has only about 5 per cent of the cross-border intra-European express and economy parcels business, against 16 per cent for UPS and 12 per cent for TNT.The limited synergies mean that FedEx is far more likely to succeed in completing its deal than UPS was in its attempted takeover. The European Commission blocked the UPS deal because it would have substantially weakened the competition to DHL, the European market leader.For FedEx, meanwhile, the deal will bring significant economies of scale, allowing it to feed far greater volumes of transatlantic express parcels into its vast US network.The outstanding question is whether the company can manage the integration without plunging the combined network into the kind of chaos that has characterised some past logistics mergers.● Related Lex note: Deal is a bet on strong recoveryVivendi pays extra dividend to appease shareholderVivendi this week agreed to pay out an additional dividend as the price for making peace with a minority shareholder whic was demanding that the media and content group pay out €9bn to investors this year, writes Adam Thomson.The Paris-based group said that it would pay €2 per share — to be distributed in two separate payments at the end of this year and the beginning of next — in addition to the €1 per share dividend it had earmarked for each of the next three years.The decision, which brings promised payouts to €6.75bn, averted what was shaping up to be a head-on fight with US minority shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management (PSAM) at next week’s annual general meeting.As part of the agreement, PSAM said it would vote against another minority shareholder demanding that Vivendi exempt itself from a new French law that would give longer-term shareholders — such as Vivendi chairman Vincent Bolloré — twice as many votes as new investors.All of this relieves the pressure that was building on Mr Bolloré to present shareholders with a clear vision for the group following Vivendi’s sale of telecoms and other assets over the past two years for more than €35bn.Mr Bolloré, who on Thursday increased his stake in Vivendi for the fourth time in just over a month to 14.5 per cent from 5 per cent earlier, has said that he wants to turn Vivendi into a French-style Bertelsmann, the German media group.This week, he took one small step in that direction, announcing that Vivendi had entered into exclusive negotiations with French telecoms operator Orange to buy 80 per cent of its Dailymotion video-sharing platform for €217m.● Related news article: Vivendi eyes ‘transformational’ dealsAnd finally …the lighter side of the news● With great power comes great responsibility and, one would hope, a decent pay packet.

102;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-09T20:06:44Z;Smurfit Kappa: paper money;This commoditised industry does not attract high valuations, but the group’s stock has rallied 60%;"If it makes sense to buy a European package delivery service, why not buy the packaging, too? After FedEx bought TNT this week, anything seems possible. So perhaps the market has been anticipating that a weak euro, and a faint hope of an economic recovery in Europe, would make Smurfit Kappa, the Irish corrugated packaging company, an acquisition target for a US group. That would be a neat explanation for the furious rally in the shares, which have returned 60 per cent year to date.The ascent has pushed the valuation of the shares, at 15 times this year’s earnings, past pre-crisis highs (paper is a commoditised industry; it does not, and should not, attract high valuations). The US industry has consolidated, with the RockTenn/MeadWestvaco deal announced in January. Transatlantic consolidation could make sense for an industry that has struggled with overcapacity. And a quarter of Smurfit’s sales are in the Americas.There are a number of problems with the buyout scenario. First, Smurfit Kappa outperformed its European peers — which would, in theory, be targets too. Returns at Finland’s UPM and Stora Enso, for example, trail the Irish company by 20 percentage points or more this year. That may be down to the simple fact that Smurfit Kappa looks like a better target: the Finns have similar valuations, but lower top-line growth and returns on capital. The company’s efforts to cut costs over the past few years have borne fruit.Then there is the question of the natural buyer. The new RockTenn-Mead will be busy, presumably, leaving International Paper and privately held Georgia Pacific as the US players with the heft to pay for a company with €9bn enterprise value.Speculating on buyouts in an industry as economically sensitive as packaging is dangerous.

103;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-07T18:09:43Z;FedEx seeks global scale with TNT Express deal;Deal is far more likely to gain approval than UPS’s failed bid for TNT in 2012;It is a feature of contemporary urban life so ubiquitous that it is easy to take for granted. In New York, London, Brussels, Hong Kong and every other big city, the distinctively-coloured delivery vans of the international parcel-delivery companies pull up outside offices and homes, a driver jumps out and a package —— which often started its journey on the other side of the world — is handed over.Yet Tuesday’s announcement that FedEx of the US is planning a €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express highlights the delicate economics behind such operations. Both FedEx and UPS have struggled with the shift from focusing on serving mainly clusters of high-volume corporate customers to delivering ecommerce packages to widely dispersed consumers. These challenges pushed TNT Express, despite it controlling 12 per cent of the European economy and express parcel markets, to a €195m net loss for 2014.FedEx hopes by building scale in Europe to benefit from feeding extra parcel volume into facilities such as TNT’s air cargo hub in Liege, Belgium.“Undoubtedly, the biggest opportunity here is in Europe in a reduced pick-up and delivery cost that FedEx will enjoy as a result of TNT’s network,” Alan Graf, Fedex’s chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call. “I feel very comfortable that we are going to achieve cost benefits across the board.”The deal is also far more likely to gain approval than UPS’s failed €5.2bn bid for TNT, tabled in 2012. That deal foundered because the European Commission was concerned that it would have left only two or three significant competitors in many European delivery markets. FedEx currently holds a market share of only about 5 per cent in economy and air express deliveries in the EU, against 12 per cent for TNT, 16 per cent for UPS and 19 per cent for DHL, owned by Deutsche Post.Alan Braithwaite, a UK-based logistics consultant, said the difference between the barred UPS transaction and the planned FedEx deal is the ultimate purpose. UPS was seeking to increase its already substantial scale in the European market. FedEx will be aiming to use TNT Express’s scale to benefit its wider world market.“The geographic fit will be much better with FedEx than it would have been with UPS,” Mr Braithwaite said. “For this deal, it’s not driving scale within a market. It’s driving global scale and presence.”Many of the benefits of that increased global scale will be felt, if the deal goes through, at Liege airport, FedEx’s hub in Memphis, Tennessee, and other big sorting centres.The costs of building such facilities — filled with automated sorting equipment — are high. The costs of running them, however, vary relatively little according to whether they handle only a few packages or are operating at full capacity. They are far more profitable, consequently, when running nearly full.Package delivery operators refer to more fully-utilised networks as being “denser”.“This is not a redundancy play,” Mr Graf said, referring to the TNT deal. “This is productivity and density, and combining two powerful networks on a global basis.”The challenges of managing such networks — keeping them busy but not letting them become congested — are growing as couriers increasingly handle ecommerce deliveries to individual homes. In both the US and Europe, operators have struggled to gear their networks up to handle pre-Christmas peaks in ecommerce deliveries that have surprised many operators with their size and timing.In the US, UPS has struggled with the past two Christmases. Its network grew severely congested in 2013, while in 2014 it overcompensated and spent too much preparing for peak volumes that largely failed to materialise. It was a shift into business to consumer (B2C) deliveries, rather than traditional business to business (B2B) deliveries, that helped to push City Link, a UK courier, into insolvency on Christmas Eve last year.“If you try to build B2C on to a B2B network, that has been a real headache,” Mr Braithwaite said. “They don’t sit comfortably in the same operation unless you get to a particular scale and you charge a premium.”The challenge for FedEx will be to achieve that scale without causing the kind of disruption for customers that has often bedevilled previous logistics mergers. Tuesday’s 2.9 per cent rise in FedEx’s share price — to $171.49 — suggests investors are confident the company can avoid those pitfalls. TNT’s shares increased 28.1 per cent to €7.69.However, Mr Graf was careful to caution investors that there would be high costs and a long timeframe. “That will require more upfront cost than would normally be the case,” Mr Graf said of the company’s “aggressive” integration plan. “But having said that, I think the integration is going to take three or four years.”In 1946, an Australian second world war veteran called Ken Thomas bought a five-ton truck with his demobilisation money, writes Duncan Robinson.This decision by the 33-year-old from Harden in New South Wales marked the birth of K W Thomas — the forerunner of TNT Express — and the start of a corporate journey that is now set to end with the takeover of the Dutch company by FedEx of the US.During the years after the second world war, K W Thomas ballooned in size from a one truck company into a national road-and-rail freight operation. In 1961, the company — by now known as Thomas Nationwide Transport — listed on the Sydney stock exchange.A wave of acquisitions in the 1970s and 1980s turned the company into a global business, with operations in Europe and South America, as well as Australasia.TNT turned Dutch only in the 1996, when KPN — the former post-and-telecoms monopoly in the Netherlands — launched a takeover of the Australian company. TNT Post Group, the predecessor of TNT Express, was spun out two years later.UPS of the US launched a bid for TNT Express in 2012, but European regulators blocked the proposed takeover because competition concerns.The Dutch company was left an independent entity mired in a sector-wide price war involving larger rival DHL and former suitor UPS.Competition, coupled with rising costs, hit TNT Express hard. Tex Gunning, chief executive, warned investors last October of a long, tough road ahead following a profit warning — but on Tuesday, FedEx offered a short-cut.
104;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-07T17:48:32Z;FedEx agrees to buy TNT Express for €4.4bn;Acquisition of Dutch rival will ramp up US parcel delivery group’s presence in Europe;FedEx struck a €4.4bn deal for struggling competitor TNT Express in a bet that it can expand its presence in Europe and avoid the regulatory concerns that prevented rival UPS from pulling off the same transaction.The takeover would combine the number three and four delivery groups in Europe by market share, expanding FedEx’s foothold in a region where the US group has struggled to gain traction against leaders DHL and UPS.Fred Smith, FedEx’s chairman and chief executive, said the timing of the deal with the Netherlands-based company was influenced by the strength of the US dollar as well as signs that lower oil prices and the European Central Bank’s monetary stimulus were delivering a boost to Europe’s economy.An agreed combination came together in less than seven weeks, people familiar with the discussions said, with talks having kicked off just after TNT warned of further restructuring due to poor conditions in its core western European markets.FedEx will pay €8 a share for TNT under the terms of the all-cash deal, which values the Dutch company at €4.4bn. It represents a 33 per cent premium to TNT’s closing share price before the long Easter weekend.Both sides on Tuesday attempted to convince investors that the deal would overcome any regulatory scrutiny in Europe. UPS abandoned a €5.2bn takeover attempt of TNT in early 2013 as it faced stiff opposition from Europe’s then antitrust chief.“This is a much simpler deal than the UPS deal,” said Antony Burgmans, chairman of TNT. “The overlap [with UPS] was significant. This means the [cost-saving] synergies will be less, which is reflected in the price, but the strategic fit is better.”Christine Richards, general counsel at FedEx, said: “We are very confident that we will be able to obtain EU approval, but we will have to go through the process.”DHL, which is owned by Deutsche Post, had a 19 per cent market share in Europe, based on 2013 industry data, compared with UPS on 16 per cent, TNT on 12 per cent and FedEx on 5 per cent, according to Allan Smylie, an analyst at Davy.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said that the two companies should be able to complete the deal by the first half of 2016 as planned, given that they have prior knowledge of antitrust hurdles and the unlikely prospects of a counterbid.A break fee of €200m will be payable to TNT if FedEx does not receive regulatory clearance or walks away from the deal. TNT must pay €45m to FedEx in the event it receives and accepts a better offer.Shares in FedEx climbed 2.9 per cent to $171.55 by midday in New York, while TNT rose 28.1 per cent to €7.69 in Amsterdam trading.As part of the deal, the two companies would need to sell TNT’s airline operations. FedEx, which has more than 660 aircraft in its global fleet, said that TNT’s European road network — which connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs and over 550 delivery depots — would be “highly complementary”.The deal comes as international couriers struggle to adapt to the rise of ecommerce, which has put pressure on their delivery systems.TNT has struggled since European regulators blocked the proposed takeover by UPS. It reported a €137m net loss for the final quarter of 2014, which it blamed on mounting restructuring costs. Nearly 10 per cent of TNT’s shares were on loan to short sellers — investors betting against a rise in a company’s share price — according to data from Markit.FedEx delivers about 10.5m shipments globally every day, compared with TNT’s 1m. The US group has been expanding in Europe, opening about 100 delivery stations across 11 countries since 2011.FedEx was advised by JPMorgan Chase. TNT Express was advised by Goldman Sachs and Lazard.Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson and Christian Oliver
105;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-04-07T12:43:44Z;FedEx and TNT Express: colouring;The deal is a bet on a strong European recovery;"When purple and orange paint are mixed, the result is an unremarkable brown. FedEx, the US delivery company with a “purple promise” to customers, announced on Tuesday that it would like to blend with the “orange spirit” of Netherlands-based TNT Express. The new company would challenge US rival UPS, known for its brown vans and uniforms, for the number two position among European delivery companies. TNT Express shares jumped more than 30 per cent.FedEx has bid €8 per share in cash for a company worth a tenth of its own $47bn market value. That works out to an enterprise value of more than nine times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Though well above FedEx’s six times multiple, it sits in line with the average valuation for European logistic companies, and about the same as that of UPS. Given cheap financing, the deal will probably add to earnings per share immediately, even without accounting for cost cuts.FedEx has confidence that it can get the deal past European competition authorities; it has offered a €200m break-up fee to TNT. Why? It has promised it will sell off TNT Express’s air cargo unit. FedEx already has plenty of capacity in air freight, while TNT Express has top share in European road haulage. UPS’s attempt to buy TNT Express three years ago failed due to European regulators’ fears that the combination would have emerged as the number one delivery company, well ahead of DHL. The FedEx-TNT Express combination would mean the three largest couriers would have roughly half the European market, with none having more than a fifth.Given the euro’s weakness against the dollar, FedEx has decided the timing is right. But really it has bet on a strong European economic recovery pushing TNT’s ebitda back up towards its 2008 peak of €550m, about a third above this year’s estimates. Without an economic rebound, this deal might turn a dreary colour indeed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
106;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-03-26T19:04:46Z;Dow Transports puts shadow on US equities;Barometer of economy and overall sentiment lags broader market;Investors are shunning US transport stocks and this barometer of the economy and overall equity sentiment on Thursday continued lagging the broad market.Investors have turned cold on transport equities since the start of the year, discouraged by weakening economic reports that have forced economists to downgrade their forecasts for the world’s biggest economy.The shift by investors accompanies spotty performance for some of the sector’s biggest companies after bumper returns in 2013 and 2014. Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
107;FDX;Fedex Corp;2015-03-18T13:10:04Z;FedEx profits rise on falling fuel costs;Parcel delivery service is handling ecommerce challenge better than rival UPS;Strong growth in ground shipments and falling fuel prices helped FedEx, the parcel delivery service, lift net income by a better than expected 53 per cent to $580m for the December to February quarter.The figures suggest FedEx is continuing to handle the growth in ecommerce deliveries better than UPS, its rival. UPS reported a second successive trouble-hit Christmas peak in a profits warning in January.However, FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent by close of trading to $173.30 after it narrowed the band of its forecast for earnings per share to an $8.80 to $8.95 range for the year to May 31 rather than raising it. The company had previously forecast an $8.50 to $9.00 range.“We had a very successful peak season as volumes grew across all transportation segments, and our profit improvement programmes are moving ahead as scheduled,” Fred Smith, chief executive, said.The quarter’s strongest growth was in FedEx Ground, which has benefited most from strong growth in ecommerce shipments in recent years.Operating income grew 14 per cent to $558m, on revenue up 12 per cent to $3.39bn. Revenue grew faster than volumes — at only 7 per cent — because the company increased some rates and because of a higher proportion of larger packages.In the core FedEx Express air parcel business, meanwhile, operating income for the quarter more than doubled to $384m against $168m, on revenue down marginally to $6.66bn, from $6.67bn in the same quarter last year.US domestic package volumes and FedEx International Economy volumes both grew 4 per cent, while FedEx International Priority volumes were flat. The higher volumes failed to produce revenue growth because of the ending of previous fuel price surcharges and currency effects.Profitability improved because of a “significant” boost from lower fuel prices, less difficult winter weather in North America and the company’s profit improvement initiatives.Operating income at FedEx Freight grew to $68m, from $35m last time, on revenue up 6 per cent to $1.43bn.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the company expected its results for the March to May quarter and for the year to May would both be records. Earnings per share for the December to February quarter were up 63 per cent to $2.01, growing faster than net income thanks to share repurchases.“We expect continued revenue and earnings growth this year, driven by ongoing improvements in all of our transportation segments,” Mr Graf said.FedEx’s profitable growth during the pre-Christmas peak contrasts sharply with performance at UPS, which was forced to issue a profit warning in January after it overspent on preparations for the peak period.

While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time. The consistent buying of stock by US corporates reached $553.2bn in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones indices.Financials staved off losses recorded by much of the broader market after the Fed did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks. The approved programmes include double-digit dividend increases at Morgan Stanley, Discover Financial and Capital One.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
109;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-12-26T14:32:55Z;Ecommerce model proves difficult to drive;Delivery groups’ shares look low yield and expensive;“Well, in those days, one had to telephone a room inside a building and hope that, at the very same moment, the person with whom one wished to converse might be found therein.”As British comedian Eddie Izzard once observed — if not in those exact words — the concept of landline telephony must sound ridiculous to the youth of today.But, as many households will have discovered over the holiday season, the 21st century concept of ecommerce is barely any more intelligent. While it may be increasingly app driven on mobile devices, it still involves goods being driven in delivery vans — in the vague hope that, in an unknowable number of days, they will arrive at a building at the very moment when one may be found therein.Even some of the solutions to these challenges appear daft. Earlier this year, Volvo, the carmaker, announced an initiative to avoid the “first-time delivery failures” that cost companies “an estimated €1bn”: it will arrange for an operative to drive to where one’s Volvo is parked and place purchased goods therein. Anywhere. Even a shopping centre car park.However, with a global value of €172bn — according to the dubiously named Transport Intelligence — ecommerce delivery is not a business that investors can ignore.It offers revenue growth: analysts at Transport Intelligence forecast a rate of 9.8 per cent a year until 2017. It offers cash flows: Ofcom estimates that Britons pump £1,968 per person through ecommerce channels every year, followed by US consumers who spend £1,171 each. It offers more predictability: research group ComScore says online sales growth on Cyber Monday, after Thanksgiving, has slowed because consumers now spread out their purchases.Delivery companies, though, seem stuck at the wrong end of the value chain. In the UK, private equity-owned delivery business City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve, claiming it was unable to handle any more parcels because of the “continued substantial losses it would incur”. Earlier this year, the privatised Royal Mail reported a 21 per cent drop in first-half operating profits, from £353m to £279m, in the face of greater competition. In the same period, UK Mail’s margins were such that it made just £4.9m of pre-tax profit on revenues of £241.4m. In the US, FedEx and UPS have at times found the ecommerce model more costly than lucrative. UPS warned on profit in early 2014 after a failure to deliver thousands of parcels cut quarterly earnings by 14 per cent.Far from proving the telecoms-like income plays that their activities suggest, all these companies’ shares look low yield and expensive. FedEx offers a dividend yield of 0.5 per cent, and trades on 19.7 2015 earnings — well ahead of the S&P 500. UPS shares yield 2.39 per cent but trade on 19.9 times forward earnings. Not exactly a utility.Royal Mail currently yields more than 4 per cent but also trades on an earnings multiple closer to higher margin FTSE 100 companies.Where, then, is the value? Ironically, some of the most attractive yields in ecommerce now come from bricks and mortar. According to IPD, the European warehouses from whence all those vans set off yielded 8 per cent in the 12 months to end September. As one fund manager told the Financial Times last week: “It’s a very defensive asset class to invest in.” He believes ecommerce property is not just for Christmas — rather like those missing parcels you might receive in coming days.matthew.vincent@ft.com
110;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
111;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Ecommerce groups rush to deliver the goods;Making sure that orders reach the buyer on time is taking on increasing importance among online retailers;"Forget having your Amazon parcels delivered by low-flying drone. At least for a while. Right now, the revolutionary technology transforming the €172bn ecommerce delivery business is the bicycle. And the white van.This week, Amazon announced that it was trialling parcel delivery by bicycle in New York. More significantly, however, in both the US and UK, the ecommerce group has set up its own delivery van network, directly hiring vehicles and drivers.Although the vast majority of its parcels are still delivered by established postal operators — including FedEx, UPS, TNT and DPD — analysts say that Amazon’s decision to deliver some of its own packages will shake-up an overcrowded postal market and drive consolidation.Joel Ray, an analyst at Transport Intelligence, a consultancy, says the delivery market — which it expects to grow by 9.8 per cent a year until 2017 — is already being polarised between high-value, next-day guaranteed services and companies offering an economy option.“It’s this latter group that is likely to struggle,” he warns.Amazon says the rollout of its Amazon Logistics business since 2012 has created more than 170 jobs at its 11 delivery stations in the UK, as well as 2,000 jobs indirectly.“We needed more capacity to deliver on time and in excellent condition and to complement our existing carrier partners,” an Amazon spokeswoman explains. She declines to say what share of its packages it delivers itself, but the rollout has already hurt Royal Mail.Last month, Britain’s privatised mail operator blamed a 21 per cent drop in first-half operating profits, from £353m to £279m, in part on competition from Amazon’s van network. UK Mail also reported a sharp fall in group pre-tax profit for the six months to September 30, to £4.9m, as group revenue slipped from £243.4m to £241.4m.Royal Mail says Amazon’s decision to deliver its own packages could cut revenue growth in the parcels market— estimated at 4 per cent — by half over the next two years. But Mr Ray says it is “likely to lose even more [market share] as Amazon ramps up its delivery capabilities”. Royal Mail’s own parcel revenues fell 1 per cent in the six months to September 28, even though volumes grew slightly.Delivering its own packages gives Amazon greater control over costs and service quality, which can come under strain at third-party contractors in the pre-Christmas period.As retail sales in the UK continue to show growth, the FT keeps up with all the latest news and reports

Further readingThis month, Yodel, the UK postal operator, admitted to a three-day backlog and temporarily stopped collecting parcels. Similarly, presents ordered through Amazon piled up at United Parcel Service and FedEx in the US last year, when the two companies became overwhelmed by a surge in online shopping.UPS was forced to issue a profit warning in January after a failure to deliver thousands of parcels knocked nearly 14 per cent from UPS’s fourth-quarter 2013 earnings per share: cutting them to $1.25 from a previous forecast of $1.32 -$1.52.FedEx performed better than its rival but attributed the narrowing of margins in its $12bn a year Ground division to investment it had to make to cope with the pre-Christmas peak season.At a 9.8 per cent annual growth rate, these demand peaks are likely to become even more exaggerated, warns Alan Braithwaite, chairman of LCP Consulting, which advises a number of retailers.Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping promotions day now adopted by other countries, is already squeezing postal operators’ margins.“A lot of companies cut their prices to be in the game on Black Friday,” says Mr Braithwaite. “The couriers can burn money in the peaks to keep customers happy but it’s the retailers that are actually making the profits.”Some of these margins are already under pressure. In September, Dutch logistics group TNT Express warned that it would fall short of its forecast 8 per cent adjusted operating margin in Europe and the US.Postal operators also face competition from retailers’ “click and collect” services, which allow customers to order online but visit either a store or local locker to pick up their purchases. It is a market that is expected to grow, to the parcel companies’ detriment. According to Planet Retail, 35 per cent of online shoppers in the UK already use click and collect, and the figure will rise to 76 per cent in three years.Similarly, Amazon has launched a UK same-day delivery service in partnership with the newspaper distribution company Connect, which allows customers to collect from local newsagent shops. Britain’s Post Office network has also allowed Amazon to use its offices for Click and Collect. Mr Ray warns that this development may cut parcel volumes for Royal Mail and other delivery services.Andrew Hill: Could Amazon plus Uber be the click-and-collect dream combo?Where Amazon leads, other etailers have started to follow.Alibaba Group has already set up its own delivery network in China. Mr Braithwaite predicts that more will do the same. “Retailers are looking at how they can leverage their resources,” he says. “They are concerned that their own reputations are at risk. If Tesco is already delivering its own food, there’s no reason it couldn’t deliver other goods for a third party as well,” he says. “They already have the delivery network.”Mr Ray says it is inevitable that Amazon will transform the parcels market. “Some companies are starting to ask whether Amazon is now an eretailer or a logistics company,” he says."
112;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-12-17T18:15:54Z;The sharing economy must share the risks;We have 20th-century benefits and insurance that do not fit the 21st-century worker;This has been the year of Uber. “Everyone is starting to worry about being Ubered,” Maurice Lévy, chief executive of advertising group Publicis, told the Financial Times this week. The sharing economy in which online platforms co-ordinate hundreds of thousands of freelancers to drive cabs, rent rooms (Airbnb), clean laundry (Washio) and perform other services has arrived.As companies recognise the threat, governments and regulators are struggling to adjust and consumers are unsure whether to trust the new type of business. The greatest uncertainty, however, faces workers. As self-employment, start-ups and one-person “micro-businesses” comprise a larger share of the workforce, workers are becoming more free and more at risk.Instead of working nine-to-five on long-term contracts, with benefits such as training, pensions and healthcare, they employ themselves. Full-timers moonlight, part-timers drive cabs for cash on the side, managers leave jobs to become consultants, people juggle skills.Many enjoy the challenge but few are secure. Meanwhile, we are stuck with 20th-century arrangements for providing work benefits and insurance — one of the hallmarks of the advanced industrial society — that do not fit the 21st-century worker. We urgently need to find new methods that do not attach all of these perks to direct employment and leave people who want to work differently out in the cold.Some of this falls to governments and some to new kinds of mutual organisation, like 19th-century co-operatives. It also requires platforms such as Uber to take greater responsibility for the quasi-employees they keep at a distance in order to minimise their liabilities and costs. The alternative is a highly fragmented and insecure workforce that cannot support itself.“Steady incomes and a social safety net are characteristics of a healthy economy which has moved past simply getting people to work for a living to creating a higher quality of existence,” says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University’s Stern School. “I worry that this could slip away.”The sharing economy is not solely responsible. It is the latest of a series of changes in technology, regulation and economics that have created a new employment paradigm. They have been in progress for decades but are getting a boost from the internet.The Freelancers Union, a New York-based group, estimates that 53m people do at least some freelance work in the US — a third of the workforce. That includes 21m contractors, such as drivers and construction workers, and 14.3m who moonlight from full-time jobs. A third of the latter have considered going wholly self-employed.The trend is similar in the UK. Of the 1.1m rise in employment between 2008 and the second quarter of this year, 732,000 were self-employed. A study by the RSA Action and Research Centre, a think-tank based in London, found that 600,000 micro-businesses (of up to nine employees) were founded in that period and 95 per cent of those set up in the past decade are one-person outfits.This is often portrayed by unions as a triumph of capital over labour but it has benefits for workers. Many want to escape office drudgery and gain independence — the self-employed often report being happier than the directly employed. The sharpest recent growth in UK self-employment has emerged not among low-paid contract workers but senior managers and directors.But the growth of the freelance economy brings two challenges.First, some freelance jobs are really cheap forms of direct employment. Companies call workers “independent contractor” to avoid paying employment taxes and indirect benefits while treating them as employees — they must wear uniforms, obey rules and so on. Many are low-paid workers, such as delivery drivers or warehouse stackers.This is legally dubious, since many countries impose laws against sham self-employment. In August, the US Appeals Court ruled against FedEx for classifying delivery drivers in California as contractors when they were in effect direct employees. One judge quoted Abraham Lincoln’s quip that calling a dog’s tail a leg does not turn the animal into a five-legged dog.Many sharing-economy companies, including Uber, classify the providers of their services as contractors and insist on them, for example, driving their own cars. Some Uber drivers in the US have mounted a legal challenge but the sharing economy is too new for the principle to have been tested.Second, even if workers are self-employed, the company or platform that routes work and orders to them could choose to offer more than the minimum benefits. Employers traditionally provide health and pension plans, as well as training, to create a productive, reliable workforce. It is more expensive but, if it pays off in the standard of service they offer, then it will help them to beat lower-quality competitors.If companies abdicate the role, then society needs to devise other ways to offer long-term support and security to the self-employed, as the Freelancers Union and others have been attempting to do. Long-term changes are needed to support freelancers to work in the way they prefer, rather than forcing them into direct employment because it is the only way to feel safe.john.gapper@ft.com
113;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-12-17T16:39:47Z;FedEx breaks run of better results;Earnings fall short of expectations in November quarter;FedEx, the express parcel service, broke a run of better-than-expected results on Wednesday when it announced earnings per share for the August to November quarter short of analysts’ expectations.The company also revealed that its contractual arrangements meant it had not received the full benefit of recent months’ sharp decline in fuel prices.The announcements together sent the company’s shares down about 9 per cent, falling $8.60 to $165.60 by mid-morning in New York trading.FedEx outperformed analysts’ estimates both for the March to May quarter, the last quarter of FedEx’s financial year, as well as from June to August when strong ecommerce growth and cost cutting boosted revenue and margins.Net income for August to November was 23 per cent up on the same quarter last year to $616m, on revenue up 5 per cent to $11.9bn. Earnings per share were $2.14 — up 36 per cent against the same period last year, but short of analysts’ expectations of $2.18.Fred Smith, chief executive, told investors on a conference call that FedEx had posted “strong” results and that cost cutting in the core FedEx Express division, which moves express parcels by air, was “on track”.“We expect revenue and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of 2015 driven by ongoing improvements in the results of our transportation segments,” he said.Operating income at FedEx Express grew 36 per cent to $484m, on revenue up 3 per cent to $7.02bn. At FedEx Ground margins contracted, despite benefiting from strong growth in ecommerce deliveries to consumers. Net income increased 6 per cent to $465m, on revenue up 8 per cent to $3.06bn.The company attributed the narrowing of margins in ground to the company’s investment in the division to cope with the pre-Christmas peak season.FedEx last year coped far better with a stronger-than-expected pre-Christmas peak in the US than UPS, its main rival, which found its system overwhelmed.“Most of what you’re seeing in margin decline is the result of short-term investments we make for peak,” Henry Maier, chief executive of FedEx Ground, said.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said contractual arrangements meant the average price FedEx paid for jet fuel had declined only 10 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, despite a 30 per cent decline during the quarter in the spot price.The company reaffirmed its previously-announced forecast for earnings per share for the year to May of between $8.50 and $9.00, rather than raising it as might have been expected given the fuel price fall.“The outlook assumes continued moderate economic growth and a modest net benefit from fuel,” Mr Graf said.

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.● It has been a difficult few years for Carpetright, Europe’s leading carpet seller. As well as a string of profit warnings, it has been forced to endure the sudden departure of its chief executive last year and the continued fall of its share price, which is down 40 per cent this year alone.The carpet specialist’s interim results will be a chance to try and persuade investors that it can turn its fortunes around. The results are new chief executive Wilf Walsh’s first and with Carpetright’s founder, Lord Harris, having retired as chairman in October, analysts will be looking for him to stamp his authority on the struggling company’s strategy.More than half of the company’s 460 stores in the UK have been modernised and like-for-like sales are up, but with discounting helping to drive sales, margins are down.In Europe, where Carpetright has 142 stores in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, the company is expected to report a profit in the period after reducing the rate of sales decline and better cost control.

Sales are expected to be $12bn, up 9 per cent from last year’s $11bn.Both FedEx and United Parcel Service, its main rival in the critical US domestic market, are benefiting from growing ecommerce deliveries to consumers. However, FedEx has so far avoided the kind of significant problems that dogged UPS last Christmas, when its systems became overwhelmed and it delivered many packages after December 25. Robert Wright● Oracle’s announcement of quarterly earnings will provide the latest chance to assess how well the giants of the IT industry are managing the transition to cloud computing.Like its main rivals, the database software maker has sought to put a spotlight on its fast-growing cloud efforts by disclosing revenues separately this year, even though the numbers remain small overall.Only around 5 per cent of its $8.6bn in sales in its most recent quarter came from selling cloud services, though the business was up 32 per cent, compared to overall growth of only 3 per cent.While the cloud growth rate will get disproportionate attention from investors, it will be sales of Oracle’s traditional software, including the latest release of its 12C database, that will underpin its business in the latest period.Wall Street is expecting revenues to rise around 3 per cent for the second quarter running, to $9.52bn. Pro forma earnings per share are expected to be down slightly from a year ago, at 68 cents, in the middle of the company’s guidance range of 66-70 cents. Richard WatersThe City of London will be looking to Dixons Carphone for a take on Black Friday trading and the outlook for Christmas when it reports its half-year results.After a flurry of sales at British retailers at the end of November, investors and analysts will be looking to see if this delivered incremental business or just brought forward sales that would have happened anyway.Other key talking points will be the outlook for Christmas as retailers are in the midst of the crucial holiday trading period and the delivery disruptions that have beset some retailers including CurrysThe results will be the first since the £3.7bn merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in May, and the City will also be keen to know how the integration of the two businesses is progressing.

Time to test the waters.” That is how analysts at Wells Fargo characterise the state of play at BlackBerry, the pioneering smartphone maker that is in the throes of a difficult turnround.John Chen, installed as chief executive just over a year ago, has steadied the ship by cutting costs and dramatically slowing the rate at which the company burns cash. However, the bigger challenge — returning the group to growth — is as yet unmet. This week investors will see the first signs of whether Mr Chen’s plan to win back business customers is working.On Wednesday, the group will unveil its new BlackBerry Classic, the company’s fourth smartphone launch of the year, after the Passport, the Z10 and a Porsche-branded handset. Today it releases earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which are expected to show patchy progress.James Faucette, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, last month downgraded his forecasts due to his belief that the company will have made a larger chunk of its revenue from low-margin device sales rather than the more lucrative fees it charges customers to use its infrastructure.This “service revenue” has been steadily declining ever since Mr Chen joined the company, from $632m in the three months to the end of November 2013 to $424m in its most recent quarter. It now accounts for less than half of revenue.Mr Faucette estimates that BlackBerry has either been breaking even or losing money on sales of new handsets, prompting him to predict an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.That, according to data from Bloomberg, is in line with the majority of analysts, who are pencilling in revenues of $956m for the quarter.

No. Back up the truck on an airline (so to speak)? Why not. Nigerian naira forwards? Maybe next time.This week’s collapse in oil prices has blessed the ordinary investor with a target-rich environment. The nature of the collapse presages more volatility to come in crude – by not cutting production, Opec abandoned its cartel power and left it to the oil market to set prices. Winners might not be obvious, either. The price of iron ore will also be leaving 2014 far below where it entered. Then again, Rio Tinto’s mining trucks run on similar stuff to FedEx trucks and airliners. And fuel costs have room to fall further.All an investor needs is cash, and the flexibility to put it to work. Spare a thought for Opec producer nations themselves, then. They will have fewer petrodollars to rub together if prices stay low. Citi estimates that petrodollar assets earned on oil exports rose by roughly $500bn each year during the past half-decade, with crude near $100 a barrel.This pile has been invested to a great extent in safe assets such as Treasuries and bank deposits (the resting places, for example, of half of Saudi Arabia’s $750bn oil surplus).

It has already arrived.As far back as 1979, FedEx founder and chief executive officer Fred Smith expressed the idea that “the information about the package is as important as the package itself”.FedEx parcels, for example, are labelled so that, when scanned, they convey information about where they are from, where they are going and the route they will take.Delivery staff, meanwhile, are armed with handheld devices that capture the customer’s signature on the doorstep. All that information is stored digitally.“It’s important to put the maturity of the internet of things into perspective,” agrees Michael Burkett, an analyst at Gartner, the technology market research firm.He says some aspects are more mature, such as commercial telematics systems used in trucking fleets. These integrate computer programs with telecommunications.Others, such as smart fabrics that use sensors in clothing and industrial fabrics to monitor human health or manufacturing processes, are just emerging.Mr Burkett also believes that an imminent explosion in the number of intelligent devices available is set to make supply chains smarter than ever.The internet of things, he reckons, is forecast to reach 26bn installed units by 2020, up from 900m five years ago.That has significant implications, he says, for “the information available to supply chain leaders and how the supply chain operates”.Emile Naus, former head of logistics strategy at Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, and now partner and technical director at LCP Consulting, a specialist supply chain strategy firm, speaks of a big opportunity for companies “to create better supply chains and, in the process, build more certainty into those supply chains”.The kind of certainty created by sensors and live tracking, he says, could enable companies to offer guaranteed delivery times and run fewer trucks on less circuitous, fuel-intensive routes.It is not just information about the location of physical assets that will boost supply-chain visibility. Data about their condition and state will be important, too, says Mr Naus. “I see this particularly with food products, with perishable goods. If you can track the temperature they are kept at throughout the supply chain, you have a better chance of extending shelf-life and reducing waste.”Paul Clarke, chief technology officer at Ocado, a UK online grocery retailer, says the internet of things is about people too. Human intervention will always be necessary to deal with supply-chain deviations and exceptions, he says, which is where wearable technologies come in.Devices such as smart watches or Google Glass-style headsets could be valuable for Ocado’s warehouse and transport staff. “There is massive potential here for getting vital information to them regarding orders and deliveries in the most immediate, convenient and safest ways,” Mr Clarke says. The company’s technology staff are already experimenting to identify the best uses for such technology in its supply chain.“Supply chain leaders must design their processes to operate in a digital business world,” says Gartner’s Mr Burkett. “They must fulfil customers’ new expectations and the volatile demands digital marketing will create.”Supply chains must meet those expectations by converging people, business and things and “incorporating fast-emerging capabilities such as internet of things technology and smart machines into this design strategy”, he says.

All three groups warned investors in July that they faced potential losses as a result of the investigations. Other companies involved in the probe include La Poste of France, Deutsche Post DHL and SNCF.Royal Mail’s agreement to settle and provide compliance commitments now means that any fine imposed will be reduced, the London-listed company said on Thursday.J’accuse! The bankers accused of mispricing the Royal Mail float were admittedly never imprisoned on Devil’s Island like Alfred Dreyfus. But one year on, they do appear to have been bashed unfairly, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingThe probe is not yet over, with Royal Mail saying in a statement that the regulator was continuing its investigation into the alleged breaches. The amount of any fine is not expected to be determined until the second half of the 2015-16 financial year.Royal Mail, which listed a year ago, said it had set aside £18m in its financial statements for the six months ended September, including £12m based on its current estimate of any fine and £6m for its estimated legal bill.TNT said in September it would take a €50m provision in its third quarter in relation to its settlement. As with Royal Mail, any fine imposed will be reduced.In July, FedEx said that its French subsidiary was being investigated over potential “anti-competitive behaviour that is alleged to have occurred primarily in the framework of trade association meetings”. The probe is in relation to a period before FedEx’s 2012 acquisition of Tatex, which was later renamed FedEx Express France.Bloomberg estimated in July that the French competition authority had opened 228 investigations in the past decade, the most of an individual country in the EU, compared with 175 initiated by Germany and 237 by the European Commission.Royal Mail releases its half-year results on November 19.
118;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-09-29T16:44:32Z;FedEx climbs on market share gain hopes;Shipping company is expected to continue stealing market share from UPS, analysts said;US shipping behemoth FedEx climbed on Monday after brokerage Cowen & Company lifted its rating on the company on the view it will gain market share from rival UPS in the pivotal holiday sales season.Analysts with the bank raised their rating to ‘outperform’ from ‘market perform’ and increased their target price to $210 from $155 ahead of the holiday sales rush.“We expect a strong, albeit compressed, peak shipping season as FedEx is likely to continue stealing market share from UPS given that company’s network issues,” Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen, said.UPS warned earlier this year that its profits would be lower than it expected as it staffs up for the holiday season and deploys new software. The company’s capacities were swamped by a surge in demand in the US in the run-up to Christmas last year, forcing several retailers to apologise to customers after they failed to deliver packages on time as promised.Ms Becker said she expected margins to improve and for the company to surpass its announced fiscal 2015 forecast of earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.“We are encouraged by recent comments about a stronger year-on-year peak shipping season and improving International Priority volumes,” Ms Becker added. “We believe the current guidance range is conservative implying opportunity for upward revisions.”FedEx shares advanced 2 per cent to $162.18, taking its gain this year to 13 per cent, while UPS fell less than 1 per cent to $97.34.Shares of Athlon Energy rose 25 per cent to $58.35 after Canadian energy producer Encana, run by former BP executive Doug Suttles, agreed to buy the company for $7.1bn.Under the terms of the deal, Encana will take on $1.15bn of Athlon’s debt and pay the latter’s shareholders $58.50 a share in cash.The investment offers Encana access to about 140,000 acres in the Midland Basin, a sprawling area in Texas.Mr Suttles, who has been offloading assets as Encana tries to reshape its portfolio, said: “This transformative acquisition further accelerates our strategy and provides us with a prime position in what is widely acknowledged as one of North America’s top oil plays.”Encana shares trading in New York rose 2 per cent to $21.59.DreamWorks Animation shares climbed 26 per cent to $28.18 as reports surfaced the movie studio had entered talks with Japan’s SoftBank over a sale of the company.Shares of Tibco, a US maker of software that allows companies to keep real-time track of inventories, soared 21 per cent to $23.65 after the company announced it would be acquired by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3bn.The deal, which includes the assumption of Tibco’s debt, will hand the company’s investors $24 a share in cash.The sale comes less than two months after Praesidium Investment Management, the software maker’s sixth-largest shareholder, called for the sale of the company.Overall, US equity markets declined moderately, following bourses in Asia and Europe lower.The S&P 500 declined 0.3 per cent to 1,977.80 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,071.22.

119;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-09-17T14:29:33Z;FedEx boosted by ecommerce growth;;FedEx outperformed analysts’ expectations for the quarter ended August, as growing volumes in its core businesses and widening profit margins helped the express parcel service record an “outstanding start” to its financial year.Net income for the quarter was 24 per cent up on the same quarter last year, at $606m, on revenue up 6 per cent to $11.7bn. Earnings per share were 37 per cent higher at $2.10, exceeding the consensus forecast of $1.96. Share repurchases produced 15 cents of the gain.The results underlined how FedEx is benefiting from growing ecommerce volumes and profit improvement programmes launched two years ago to cut high costs in FedEx’s air and other operations. The company retired some of its older, less fuel-efficient aircraft and focused more heavily on its ground business.The profit improvement programme’s effects were marked in the core FedEx Express division, where operating income grew 35 per cent to $396m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $6.86bn. The segment enjoyed a 5 per cent increase in US domestic package volumes and increasing yields in international package movements, as well as the effects of the cost-cutting programme.Operating income at FedEx Ground – which has benefited from customers’ shift in recent years away from the highest-priced, fastest services towards cheaper, slower products – grew 13 per cent to $545m, on revenue up 8 per cent to $2.96bn. Average daily package volumes were 6 per cent up on the same period last year, mainly because of ecommerce.In FedEx Freight, the freight forwarding business, operating income grew 70 per cent to $168m, on revenue up 13 per cent to $1.61bn. The company attributed the gain to growth in demand for smaller, “less-than-truckload” shipments, increased average revenue from such shipments and “solid cost management”.The company reaffirmed its earnings per share projection for the full year at between $8.50 and $9.The figures marked FedEx’s second consecutive strong quarter, following a strong last three months in the financial year to May 31.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the new year was off to an “outstanding start”.“More customers are relying on FedEx because they appreciate the competitive advantages provided by our broad portfolio of solutions,” he said.FedEx’s shares, which are trading near their all-time high, were up 4 per cent in premarket trading to $161.
120;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-09-16T15:40:46Z;UPS to hire up to 95,000 temporary workers;;UPS plans to hire up to 40,000 more staff for this year’s end-of-year rush, in the latest indication of the express parcel service’s determination to avoid the severe congestion that last year delayed some holiday season deliveries .The company said on Tuesday that it planned to recruit between 90,000 and 95,000 workers for the seasonal rush, up from 55,000 last year, and that many of the temporary staff would have the opportunity to be employed full-time.The hiring surge comes after chaos in UPS’s delivery system last Christmas delayed many deliveries, particularly those from Amazon, the online retailer, and prompted a profit warning. The company cut its forecast results for the year again in July as a result of its increased capital spending designed to avoid a repeat of its Christmas problems.Ecommerce during the end-of-year holiday season has grown rapidly in many parts of the word.In the UK, Royal Mail has also started Christmas recruitment. The London-listed delivery group said is expected to announce next week plans to hire up to 20,000 people, in line or slightly down on last year.On last year’s so-called Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving and the US’s busiest online shopping day of the year, merchants that listed products for sale on Amazon experienced a 50 per cent jump in orders from the previous year. More than 13m orders that day were placed with merchants, who account for about 40 per cent of all goods sold on the site.UPS’s extra hiring is part of a package of measures, including closer collaboration with key customers on likely volumes, investment in new, more flexible processing capacity and better information technology.Ecommerce is transforming the business of UPS, FedEx, its main US rival, and other express delivery companies by increasing the share of deliveries to consumers at the expense of easier-to-manage deliveries to businesses.John McDevitt, UPS’s senior manager of human resources and labour relations, said the company had initial volume forecasts from its customers and was starting the hiring process for its temporary peak season jobs.“We have needs throughout the United States and anticipate more applicants this year than in 2013,” Mr McDevitt said. “Individuals who begin employment at UPS during the holiday season have the opportunity to pursue a permanent position.”The company gave no indication of how much extra traffic it expected to handle this year compared with last but said it was “gearing up” for a further increase in deliveries. Conditions were exacerbated in 2013 by the unusually short gap between US Thanksgiving – the traditional start of the end-of-year shopping season – and Christmas, as well as severe weather across much of the US.The extra staff would join UPS’s 333,000 permanent staff in the US.FedEx– which adopted advanced sorting technologies earlier than UPS in many of its hubs and configures its networks differently – suffered far fewer problems last year than UPS. It declined to comment in advance of its latest quarterly results on Wednesday.UPS expects to make its temporary staff more effective in future by equipping them with better technology for finding addresses, choosing routes and making other decisions that previously only permanent staff were well-placed to make.UPS’s shares were down 0.1 per cent to $97.52 in early New York trading.Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin and Gill Plimmer
121;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-08-12T13:26:30Z;UPS and FedEx invest in technology to meet soaring demand;;On the ground floor of United Parcel Service’s $2.2bn Worldport Hub, workers are stuffing into huge airfreight containers some of the roughly 1.1m packages that the centre in Louisville, Kentucky, handles every night.Most of the containers have sped through Worldport’s maze of whirring conveyor belts and been reloaded in less than four hours. At 2.30am, some of the 100 or so flights that will carry the packages around the US and the world are starting to leave.Amid the dazzling efficiency, however, is evidence of the significant challenge that UPS and FedEx, its main US rival, are facing. Many of the boxes bear the logo of Zappos.com, the internet footwear retailer. Another box contains frozen artificial skin for use in surgery, while one bears the simple legend, “Live Tropical Fish”.Online retailing and business-to-business ordering are driving up traffic volumes for both UPS and FedEx but also making flows harder to predict.The question for both companies is whether management changes and technology investments can help them to avoid a repeat of the chaos that engulfed UPS last Christmas, when demand surged more than anticipated. Volumes on its busiest day, December 23, were 13 per cent up on 2012’s peak and the network was clogged. Many packages were delivered after December 25.The problems reflect the behaviour of the individual consumers who increasingly drive big operators’ deliveries worldwide, according to Alan Braithwaite, a UK-based logistics consultant. They are more likely than logistics operators’ corporate customers to order at the last minute.“The peaks are getting even peakier,” he says.Fewer goods are being delivered in bulk via single stops on vehicles’ routes to retail outlets, according to Henry Maier, chief executive of FedEx Ground, the company’s road-delivery division.“Now those individual items get boxed up and sent to somebody’s house, so that creates a stop,” Mr Maier says. “The challenge across the industry is managing the stops.”Supply chain business is separate from the flagship express parcel operations of UPS, FedEx and other logistics operators but adds a vital extra dimension to the services they can offer companies.Read moreUPS is improving its management systems and investing $500m in extra capital spending this year to boost capacity, according to Kurt Kuehn, the group’s chief financial officer.“We’re very focused on expanding capabilities and capacity to meet the current growth, not to mention the peak season,” Mr Kuehn says. “We have what is in many ways an enviable problem.”One of UPS’s efficiency-boosting investments is on display at the Louisville Centennial Hub, a base for UPS’s ground operations near Worldport. Jerry Durham, a driver, each morning consults a bank of computers running Orion, a new computer system, to work out the most efficient route between his scheduled drop-offs.The technology has raised the average number of drop-offs per mile from 1.9 when drivers devised their own routes to 2.2 now, says Roger Hicks, UPS’s business manager for Louisville East.The system has overcome his initial scepticism, according to Mr Durham.“I’ve gotten to like it a lot more,” he says.Mr Maier praises new handheld scanners for boosting FedEx’s efficiency. The scanners know the GPS co-ordinates of every address in the US and will alert drivers if they appear to be delivering in the wrong place. Such technology helps to cut down worker errors, especially among temporary staff taken on for the peak season.“It makes our temporary resources much more effective,” Mr Maier says.An innovation at Centennial typifies UPS’s approach. In the past year, sorters have been given technology that scans package labels and tells them into which delivery bag they should post them. The technology has cut down on wasteful “mis-sorts”.We’re very focused on expanding capabilities and capacity to meet the current growth, not to mention the peak season. We have what is in many ways an enviable problemMr Kuehn says most investments are focused on such local hubs, rather than the efficient Worldport, and predominantly into computer systems.Yet, for UPS, last Christmas’s biggest failing may have been in communication rather than in technology. UPS failed to spot its customers’ higher than expected order volumes in time. Much of the short-term effort has focused on ensuring future volume forecasts and communications with customers are better than last year’s. FedEx says that such forecasting also plays a key role in its peak-season planning.“We’re working with some large customers to get enhanced visibility,” Mr Kuehn says.In the long run, meanwhile, both companies expect to overcome the challenges partly through making more of their facilities operate like Worldport.FedEx already operates all 33 of its ground network’s hubs in the US on Worldport’s highly automated model, with minimal handling by humans. Mr Maier says it expects to start introducing such advanced technology in still more, smaller facilities.For UPS, meanwhile, Worldport, the world’s biggest fully automated package-handling facility, remains noticeably more advanced than smaller hubs such as Centennial, where much sorting is still by hand.As the company adapts to the challenges of handling more shoes, medical supplies and fish, that will have to change, Mr Kuehn says.“[Worldport is] a highly automated, incredible asset, driven by technology,” he says. “There are several other generations of buildings around the country that we’re going to be renovating to look more like Louisville.”Catering to supply chain demandsIn the middle of a warehouse near the end of Louisville Airport’s runway stands a line of heavy-duty freezers, an electronic stopwatch sitting on the lid of one. The stopwatch is intended to protect the delicate sheets of artificially-grown skin inside the freezers, used to treat diabetics’ foot ulcers. Supervisors time how long each freezer is open when stocks are being retrieved, to ensure the temperature stays low enough.The business in the warehouse illustrates how thoroughly UPS and other logistics companies have involved themselves in some customers’ operations. Next to the skin freezers, workers are preparing to ship batches of influenza vaccine. In another section of the building, workers are putting together packages of mobile telephones for Sprint, the mobile telecoms company. They customise devices for customers with special requirements, including government departments that want employees’ phone cameras disabled.Such supply chain business is separate from the flagship express parcel operations of UPS, FedEx and other logistics operators but adds a vital extra dimension to the services they can offer companies. According to Rich Shaver, division manager for healthcare in UPS’s Americas Central District, the growing popularity of outsourcing reflects the increasing pressure on healthcare companies to save money and compete more effectively.“The customers have to have a competitive advantage,” he says. “The only way they can have a competitive advantage is if they have a very nimble, flexible supply chain that at the same time is looking for what regulations and changes are coming.”The healthcare business, unlike high technology, remains relatively conservative and goods are shipped mostly to retail outlets, hospitals and other corporate customers.However, the Louisville warehouse already employs pharmacists to handle prescriptions for some goods heading direct to customers. The company is receiving increasing numbers of requests to suggest ways that customers can deliver more healthcare products direct to consumers, according to Mr Shaver.“Most times, it’s going to be a progressive, step-by-step process,” he says.
122;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 4,442.70.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
123;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-07-16T10:08:24Z;Royal Mail, TNT Express and FedEx reveal French antitrust probe;;Royal Mail, TNT Express and FedEx have all warned that losses as a result of antitrust investigations by French authorities into the country’s parcel delivery services could have a material impact on their businesses.In separate statements, the companies said they had been informed of an investigation by the French Competition Authority, Autorité de la Concurrence. It is not clear if the warnings are linked but Royal Mail said the notice was “in connection with a broader investigation into alleged activities within the [parcel delivery] industry in France”.TNT and FedEx both received their statements of objections on the same day, June 30.TNT said the investigation involving TNT Express France started in 2010 and the company had been co-operating since then. The company said it would “provide a response within the timeline set by the French authorities”, but declined to say when that would be.FedEx said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that the French authorities were investigating FedEx Express France, formerly known as TATEX, regarding “anti-competitive behaviour that is alleged to have occurred primarily in the framework of trade association meetings”.It added that these meetings included the former general managers of TATEX before its acquisition by FedEx in July 2012, according to the statement of objections the company received on June 30.TNT added: “On the basis of preliminary analysis of the Statement of Objections, it cannot be excluded that TNT Express will be fined for a material amount as a result of this procedure.”The two other companies made similar disclosures.Royal Mail, which floated last October, said “certain group companies have received a notice from the French competition authority alleging breaches of antitrust laws by one of its subsidiaries, GLS France”.GLS France, part of the Amsterdam-based GLS Group, is a road-based parcel-delivery service.Royal Mail declined to give further details. Its shares were down more than 2 per cent, at 479p, in early trading. The share price is more than 22 per cent off its peak of 618p, which it hit in January.TNT’s share price was down 2.9 per cent at €6.29 in Amsterdam trading.In Paris, the competition authority confirmed the investigation was under way but declined to make further comment and said no announcement was anticipated in the coming days.Robin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said it was unlikely that the fines would be too severe. “What I’ve seen in the past is that given this is a small division it might be quite noisy but the fines will probably be quite minor,” he said.Additional reporting by Hugh Carnegy in Paris
124;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US share buybacks and dividends hit record;;US share buybacks and dividend payments climbed to a record level in the first quarter of 2014, as companies chose to boost shareholder returns in the absence of robust revenue growth.Members of the S&P 500 index – led by Apple, IBM, ExxonMobil and FedEx – spent $241bn to repurchase shares and pay cash dividends in the three months to March 31, surpassing the prior record of $233bn set in the third quarter of 2007, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.The moves came as many companies remained reluctant to spend their cash on expansion – leading to pressure from activist investors to return it to shareholders.“I expect this trend of greater shareholder return to continue throughout 2014, as activists remain strong, interest rates low and companies awash in cash,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.At times when revenue growth is lacklustre, share buybacks can help companies boost their earnings per share by reducing the number of shares in issue.“Companies bought a tailwind for EPS,” Mr Silverblatt said.After a pause in buyback activity amid the financial crisis, companies began buying back more of their shares about two years ago. Since then, they have increased their buying, as shareholder activism intensified. In the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&P 500 companies lifted their spending on buybacks by 29 per cent year on year, to $534.9bn.Apple, the technology company that has come under pressure from activist shareholders including Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, spent $18bn on buybacks in the first quarter – beating its previous record of $16bn in the second quarter of 2013.Partly as a result of this increased activity, cash on S&P 500 companies’ balance sheets declined after six consecutive quarters of record highs. Buybacks, combined with merger and acquisition activity, reduced companies’ cash holdings to $1.233tn, from $1.304tn in the fourth quarter. But, at this level, it still equates to 90 weeks of net income sitting on the companies’ books – both in the US and abroad – and earning a low return, given depressed interest rates.When buybacks exceed new shares issued, they have the effect of reducing a company’s overall share count, thereby lifting its EPS by having profits distributed across a smaller pool.However, critics argue that the practice can result in a misleading picture of corporate earnings growth. In the middle of the last decade, companies aggressively bought back their shares – which made earnings estimates appear artificially low, Mr Silverblatt said.In the first quarter, some 290 companies in the S&P 500 reduced their share count year over year – up from 276 in the previous quarter.
125;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Profit increase sends Adobe to record high;;"Adobe shares rose to a record high on Wednesday after results from the company eclipsed Wall Street forecasts, triggering price target increases from at least a dozen investment banks.The software maker said profits rose 16 per cent from a year earlier to $88.5m, or 17 cents a share, in the three months to May 30, as sales advanced 6 per cent to $1.07bn.Adjusting for certain items, Adobe said it earned 37 cents a share, ahead of Wall Street expectations.The number of subscribers to the company’s Creative Cloud service – which gives customers access to Photoshop and other programmes for a monthly fee – jumped 464,000 since the first quarter to 2.3m.At least a dozen investment banks increased their price targets following the results, which were released after the market closed on Tuesday.Analysts with Citi said they expected the quarter to be “transitional”, but instead were pleasantly surprised.“While Creative Cloud strength was again helped by the Photoshop/Lightroom promo, full suite adds accelerated in the second quarter, suggesting that it wasn’t all promo that drove results,” said analyst Walter Pritchard.Adobe shares rose 8.2 per cent to close at $73.08, leading the benchmark S&P 500.FedEx delivered guidance for its current fiscal year that was on target with analysts’ expectations.The US-based transportation and delivery service said its earnings projections for the 2015 financial year were for between $8.50 and $9 per diluted share.Analysts polled by Bloomberg expected EPS to be close to the midpoint of this guidance, at $8.76.FedEx’s fourth-quarter numbers came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. It reported earnings of $2.46 per diluted share on revenues of $11.8bn. Analysts expected EPS of $2.36 on revenues of $11.66bn.FedEx’s shares closed up 6.16 per cent at $148.95.Company executives raised their economic forecasts for 2015. They now project US GDP growth of 3.1 per cent in 2015, compared to 3 per cent previously, and global GDP to rise 3.1 per cent.Wall Street economists on average expect US GDP to climb 3 per cent in 2015 compared to a year earlier.On a call with analysts, executive vice-president T Michael Glenn said: “The global economy is recovering from the first-quarter setback in the US and slowdown in China and should steadily improve.”Shares in BlackBerry were just under 3 per cent higher to end at $8.29 after Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said BlackBerry’s new management would probably preserve asset value and balance sheet flexibility.Mr Faucette expects chief executive John Chen to scale back operations soon and quickly improve cash flow, adding that he believed the stock had a fair value of between $6 and $8.“The company’s business clearly continues to deteriorate and we expect that the company will be compelled to expand its expense cutting programmes as our forecasts don’t anticipate that new products will gain meaningful traction,” Mr Faucette said.Shares in Express Scripts fell 2.23 per cent to $68.29 following news that its chief executive, George Paz, had sold about 26 per cent of his holdings.The shares were sold on Friday for $48m and were part of an investment diversification strategy, the company said.Wall Street’s main indices closed slightly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58 per cent to 16,906.62; the S&P 500 was up 0.77 per cent to 1,956.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.59 per cent higher to end the day at 4,362.84."
126;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-06-18T14:26:32Z;Strong quarter boosts FedEx’s full-year income;;Shares in FedEx, the parcel delivery company, surged in early trading in New York after it published better than expected results for the year to May 31 and announced a bullish forecast for the current financial year.Full-year net income rose 35 per cent to $2.1bn, while earnings per share rose 37 per cent to $6.75. Excluding the effects of a $496m one-off business realignment charge last year and a $100m impairment charge for declining aircraft values, net income rose 6 per cent and earnings per share rose 8.3 per cent. Analysts had expected earnings of about $6.68.Fred Smith, chief executive, said an “outstanding” fourth quarter had helped the company to post “solid” results for the year.“We believe we are well positioned for a strong fiscal 2015,” he added.The company projected earnings per share for the year to May 31 next year of $8.50 to $9.00.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the company’s results in the current financial year should benefit from base performance improvement and the continuing profit improvement initiatives at the core FedEx Express business.“Fiscal 2014 was a good year for FedEx and we expect fiscal 2015 to be even better,” Mr Graf said.The shares rose 4.5 per cent after the New York market opened, to $146.61.Both FedEx and UPS, its main rival, have struggled over the past two years with a combination of slow trade growth and customers’ shift towards lower-cost deferred air and ground forms of transport, as well as global air freight overcapacity.Fourth-quarter operating income at FedEx Express rose 3 per cent to $475m compared with last year’s figure, excluding the one-off charges, while revenue rose slightly to $7bn from $6.98bn.FedEx attributed the improved profits to higher rates per package, increased volumes and lower pension expenses, which more than offset the effect of reduced fuel surcharges and lower revenue from carrying air freight.FedEx Ground enjoyed fourth-quarter operating income up 5 per cent from last year’s adjusted figure to $586m, on revenue up 8 per cent to $3.01bn.Compared with last year’s adjusted results, fourth-quarter operating income for FedEx Freight, the company’s freight forwarding business, increased 51 per cent to $122m, on revenue up 12 per cent to $1.55bn.FedEx has been under pressure from shareholders – including Dan Loeb, the activist investor– to improve results.Mr Graf said the company remained committed to improving “earnings, cash flows, returns on invested capital and returns to shareholders”.He pointed to an increase in the quarterly divided from 15 to 20 cents, announced on June 9, as the latest example of its efforts.
127;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;New UPS CEO looks overseas for growth;;"International expansion remains the “number one goal” for UPS, its incoming chief executive said on Friday as the express parcel service said his predecessor would become non-executive chairman.David Abney is due to step up from his current role as chief operating officer on September 1 to take over from Scott Davis, who has been chief executive since 2008.Mr Davis, 62, sought a significant international expansion in 2012 through a €5.2bn takeover of the Netherlands' TNT Express, which the European Commission subsequently blocked. The TNT deal would have increased UPS’s reach not only in Europe but also in China and Brazil, two countries where UPS is keen to expand.“Our number one goal is to grow our international business,” Mr Abney said. “We’re going to make investments, whether it be from an organic standpoint or an acquisition standpoint.”The acquisitions might not be on the same scale as the attempted TNT takeover, Mr Abney said, but he added: “We’ll certainly make the decisions that are appropriate to continue to grow our business.”UPS’s shares were flat at $103.59 in New York.Mr Abney will take office as UPS faces the challenge of increasing capacity in its core North American market to avoid a repetition of its problems last Christmas with an unexpected surge in traffic. The company delivered presents that many customers had ordered from Amazon, the internet retailer, after Christmas day.Mr Davis said the Christmas crisis had “absolutely not” played a part in his decision to stand down and that the move was part of a “smooth and flawless” transition.Mr Abney said the company was working in several areas to improve its handling of this year’s Thanksgiving to Christmas peak season for traffic. It was working with customers to improve their forecasts of likely traffic; investing in new capacity such as new sorting facilities and investing in systems to track shipments and communicate with customers better.“We began our peak season planning for 2014 on December 26 last year,” Mr Abney said. “We took a good look at the circumstances and then our focus ever since then became, ‘What do we need to do?’”However, Mr Abney played down the significance of some customers’ apparent shift from high-value, premium air express shipping to lower-value deferred products, sometimes via ground rather than air. The shift has hit some recent results from both UPS and FedEx, its arch-rival.Mr Abney attributed the recent shift to weak economic growth in the US and Europe.“I would not jump to the conclusion that [preference for] deferred modes of transportation is always going to be the case,” Mr Abney said."
128;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-04-24T16:29:18Z;UPS profits hit by harsh US winter;;UPS, the express parcel delivery service, has suffered a second consecutive quarter of operational problems after it was hit “awfully hard” by a harsh North American winter that reduced operating profits by $200m.The tough conditions depressed net income 12 per cent to $911m against last year’s first quarter, on revenue up 2.6 per cent to $13.8bn. The company also warned that the disruption meant its full-year earnings per share were likely to be at the low end of its projected $5.05 to $5.30 range.The year-on-year decline comes after the company reported results for the fourth quarter last year that was severely affected by the challenges of delivering unexpectedly high volumes of goods in the peak season around Christmas. UPS struggled to deliver some goods for Amazon, the online retailer, in time and had to take on extra staff to cope.“We were clearly hit awfully hard in the US by the weather,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said. “But we feel the US economy is moving. We also feel very good about the core underlying business.”Operating profits in the core US domestic package business declined 14.6 per cent to $927m, on revenues up 2.6 per cent to $8.5bn. In addition to the weather disruptions, operating margins suffered from online retailers’ increased use of slower, cheaper services to serve customers. Revenue per package was down 1.5 per cent from the same period last year.Mr Kuehn said it was not necessarily a “big problem” that margins on shipments were decreasing in the face of the “incredible growth” in business to consumer shipments the company was experiencing.“We’re offering products that are slower and, in some cases, use the US Post Office [rather than UPS’s dedicated delivery drivers],” Mr Kuehn said.The company was investing to avoid a repetition of the problems at the end of last year, Mr Kuehn added.“We’re adding some capacity,” he said. “In general, that will help us during peak season.”The company was also buying processing equipment that could be moved from place to place to cope with unexpected traffic surges.International package operating profits rose 24 per cent to $348m against last year’s first quarter, when profits were hit by a $39m charge for the abortive takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express.Excluding the charge’s effect, operating profits would have been up 12 per cent. Revenues increased 5 per cent to $3.13bn. Export shipments climbed 7.7 per cent, driven by 15 per cent growth in Europe and “modest gains” in Asia and the Americas.Operating profits for supply chain and freight rose 3.5 per cent to $148m, on revenue down 1 per cent to $2.16bn.The shares were down 19 cents at noon in New York, at $99.05.
129;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-03-19T18:25:36Z;Harsh winter hits FedEx profits;;FedEx, the express parcels delivery service, on Wednesday became the latest North American transport company to produce disappointing quarterly results and cut forecasts because of the continent’s severe winter weather.FedEx slashed its earnings forecast for the full year to a range of $6.55 to $6.80 per share, down from a previous forecast suggesting earnings of around $6.97, after announcing third-quarter net income of $378m, well short of analysts’ $471m forecasts.The company said “unusually severe winter storms” throughout the quarter had disrupted operations, reducing volumes and increasing costs. The quarter’s $641m operating income had been reduced by around $125m.A range of companies – including carmakers, who have said customers have been reluctant to buy cars from freezing, snow-covered dealers’ lots and transport operators – have blamed bad results on the harsh weather.CSX, the biggest railway in the eastern US, last week warned that the harsh winter would severely affect its first-quarter profits and hold back its profit growth for the full year. The Canadian government has ordered Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, the rail operators, to move grain faster after bad weather held up movements of last autumn’s record harvest.“Historically severe winter weather significantly affected our third-quarter earnings,” Fred Smith, chief executive, said.On days when the weather was closer to normal seasonal conditions, volumes had been solid and service levels high, Mr Smith added. The company’s distinctive strategy of maintaining separate ground and air express networks and running multiple hubs had proved an advantage in the difficult conditions, he went on.FedEx’s results come after UPS, its rival, produced disappointing figures for its September to December quarter after unexpectedly high volumes of pre-Christmas e-commerce overwhelmed its network.Both companies are widely seen as barometers of the health of the US and world economies.FedEx’s figures for the December to February quarter compared with figures for the same period last year that were hit by a $47m charge for voluntary redundancy for some senior executives.Net income for the quarter was up 5 per cent on last year, to $378m, on revenue up 3 per cent to $11.3bn. Diluted earnings per share – which benefited from FedEx’s share repurchase programme – rose 9 per cent to $1.23.The company’s operating results reflected the continuing shift from high-value premium air express services to lower-yielding products that has dogged the company over the past two years.Operating income in FedEx Express – the core parcels service – rose 14 per cent to $135m, on revenue down marginally from $6.7bn to $6.67bn. Average daily international priority package volumes declined 5 per cent, in line with the move downmarket, while international economy volumes grew 8 per cent.Operating income for FedEx Ground grew 2 per cent to $477m, on revenues up 10 per cent to $3.03bn.For FedEx Freight, the freight forwarder, operating income rose from $4m to $29m, on revenues up 9 per cent to $1.35bn.Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said the weather’s effect on the company’s performance had been “significantly more pronounced” this year than previous years. The company’s plan outlined in 2012 to improve FedEx Express’s profits remained on track, however, he insisted.In premarket trading, shares held steady at $138.50.
130;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-02-26T15:32:51Z;Bondholders pay price of share buybacks;;A surge in sales of corporate bonds to fund share buybacks is adding pressure to companies’ balance sheets and increasing risks for holders of corporate debt.Some of the country’s largest companies, including FedEx, Union Pacific and Cisco, have issued debt this year to help finance stock repurchases.Companies have raised at least $11bn worth of debt in 2014 for this purpose, according to data from Standard & Poor’s LCD, compared with $19bn raised by companies with similar investment grade ratings for the whole of 2013.The 2014 figure might be even higher, analysts say, since most companies are not required to say how they use proceeds from debt sales.Debt has become a cheap source of capital for many companies and a means to reward shareholders, particularly at times when revenue growth is lacklustre.But for bondholders, such shareholder-friendly practices come at a price.As companies add leverage to boost their stock prices, the higher debt load, combined with slower growth expectations may lead to credit downgrades and a potential decline in the price of their bonds.“The money a company uses to fund buybacks is money that simply goes out of the door and it never gets back,” said Jesse Fogarty, a portfolio manager at Cutwater Asset Management.“It doesn’t immediately raise the probability of default, but as a bondholder I would prefer to see a company sell bonds and use the same amount of money on activities that have the potential to generate cash one day, even with no guarantee of success.”The practice has increased in popularity among corporate borrowers in the past couple of years as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary stimulus policies brought borrowing costs down to record lows.Most of the issuance has come from large companies with investment grade ratings and very low borrowing costs. Still, sales by junk-rated companies has picked up and totalled $12bn in 2013.Analysts at Fitch Ratings said: “While most stock buybacks and dividends are done in a credit-neutral manner, shareholder-friendly actions continue to drive a steady flow of downgrades and negative outlook changes.”Fitch took six negative rating actions on US companies in 2013 due at least in part to share repurchases.“The heavy use of bond issuance to fund share buybacks is related to corporations’ reluctance to invest in plant and equipment, which is an increasingly controversial subject,” said Marty Fridson, chief executive of FridsonVision, a financial research company.“Worse than having bondholders subsidise shareholders is the fact that this strategy does not always work to lift the stock price.”In this year’s largest deal, Cisco sold $8bn in bonds, in which a portion of the proceeds was earmarked to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks.The sale follows the company’s warning that its fiscal third-quarter results may miss some analysts’ estimates. Cisco has already bought back $4bn of its own stock in the three months through to January 25, but its shares are still lagging behind gains in the S&P 500 Information Technology group.
131;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-01-24T17:50:10Z;Russia customs rules hit online retailers;;Western online retailers are hitting a fresh roadblock in their push into Russia, one of the world’s fastest-growing ecommerce markets, as new customs regulations hinder courier deliveries to private customers in the country.DHL and FedEx said they had suspended express deliveries from abroad to individuals in Russia because of stricter customs procedures that require lots of extra paperwork on all parcels for personal use except for documents, regardless of the shipment value.“This impacts mostly shipments for business-to-consumer ecommerce for customers such as Amazon and Net-A-Porter,” said Daniel McGrath, spokesman for DHL Express. “That is a minor part of our business, but it is a fast-growing market.”UPS has not suspended services yet but said: “We have told our customers that we’ve experienced significant delays in clearance and deliveries as a result of the change in customs procedures.”With close to 70m internet users, roughly half of its population, Russia is Europe’s largest internet market by users.Currently just 2 per cent of Russian retail sales are conducted online, but that is expected to rise to 5 per cent, more than tripling the size of the online retail market by 2015, according to Morgan Stanley.That has driven several foreign ecommerce companies to try to break domestic players’ near-total dominance of the market. Both Ebay and AliExpress, an arm of China’s Alibaba, set up Russian-language sites last year.Some boutique outlets such as the London-based online fashion retailer Net-A-Porter have also expanded in the country. Amazon offers shipping for some of its articles to Russia, but not books. Amazon, Ebay and Net-A-Porter were not available for comment.The foreign online retailers are up against Ozon, the market leader, whose business model resembles Amazon, as well as smaller and more specialised Russian companies. Shipping and payment are cited as the most common hurdles to market entry.DHL said it had suspended express delivery services to individual customers in Russia in 2010 when customs first introduced tighter restrictions, but later resumed services for some ecommerce customers. But the latest changes required the submission of some original documents and credit card payment records at customs. “Those services we just can’t provide,” Mr McGrath said.Investors frequently cite cumbersome customs clearance as one of the most serious hurdles to doing business in Russia, and the government has been focusing on simplifying procedures in its quest to improve the country’s ranking in international investment climate surveys.The latest changes are believed to be aimed at preventing consumers from dodging import tax by underreporting the value of goods for personal use.Ecommerce industry executives fear that this push could eventually lead to a lowering of the tax-free threshold, a move that would hurt foreign online retailers even more.Delivery services through the state-owned Russian Post continue unchanged. Russian Customs declined to comment.
132;FDX;Fedex Corp;2014-01-17T17:54:56Z;Amex hits all-time high on profit leap;Credit card provider boosted by improved credit quality;American Express raced to an all-time high, lifting its market capitalisation to almost $100bn, after reporting fourth-quarter profits had doubled from a year earlier.The credit card provider after-market on Thursday said profits rose 105 per cent to $1.3bn, or $1.21 a share, as card holders, particularly those in the US, increased spending during the final months of 2013. The company said earnings benefited from improved credit quality and lower write-offs.“Credit quality indicators are at historically strong levels and, while many consumers are still cautious about taking on additional debt, we again saw a modest increase in card member loans this quarter,” chief executive Kenneth Chenault said.Analysts at Susquehanna Financial and Buckingham Research upgraded the company’s rating to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ following its results. Shares climbed as much as 5 per cent to $92.41 on Friday before closing up 3 per cent.Bank of New York Mellon shares lost 3.6 per cent to $32.70 after the custody bank suffered an 18 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. The bank lost $115m on its investment in ConvergEx, the Wall Street broker that was accused by US regulators over its subsidiary “fleecing” clients through hidden fees.BNY Mellon has shed jobs and cut costs to deal with continued low interest rates which eat into the profits that custodian banks can earn from their bread-and-butter business of safeguarding billions of dollars-worth of customer assets. The bank has also suffered from an industry-wide spike in litigation costs.Morgan Stanley investors shrugged off a 78 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits, mainly on litigation costs, sending the investment bank’s shares almost 5 per cent higher to close at $33.40.Legal costs and weakness in the company’s fixed-income unit were a drag on Morgan Stanley’s profits, which at $192m, or 7 cents a share, missed analyst expectations. The company set aside $1.2bn in additional legal reserves for litigation related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis.Shares in video game maker Electronic Arts led the S&P 500 higher, rising 12 per cent to $24.10, after analysts at CRT Capital initiated research coverage of the company with a ‘buy’ rating.The broker said it expected rising digital sales and a strong video game catalogue to lift the company’s results.“Video game stocks trade on game slates, and we believe that EA has one of the most highly anticipated games coming out at the end of March,” analyst Neil Doshi says. “And with 2014 being a World Cup year, we expect this to be a strong year for EA’s Fifa franchise.”General Electric shares fell at the fastest pace in nearly seven months after its profit margins missed goals set by chief executive Jeff Immelt.GE fell 3 per cent to $26.58. Fourth-quarter profits grew 5 per cent to $4.2bn on a 3 per cent rise in revenues to $40.4bn. Infrastructure orders in the period rose 8 per cent to $30.7bn.Mr Immelt has targeted a 70 basis point improvement in the company’s manufacturing unit’s profit margins. Margins increased 66 basis points from a year earlier.A profit warning from UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, sent the company’s stock as much as 4 per cent lower before recovering to close down 0.6 per cent at $99.91.UPS said it expected fourth-quarter and full-year earnings to be below previous expectations as it struggled to cope with a surge of last minute orders and a shortened holiday shopping season.The shipping giant said it hired 30,000 more temporary employees than planned in an effort to process the rise in shipments, weighing on profitability. Several retailers in the US were forced to apologise to customers after UPS and FedEx failed to deliver packages on time for Christmas as promised.Intel also weighed on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 2.6 per cent to $25.85 after reporting quarterly results short of Wall Street expectations.The Silicon Valley company said that sales at its PC division were $8.6bn, flat compared to the same quarter in 2012 but 2 per cent higher than the third. Investors have been awaiting stronger revenue growth as the company moves further away from computers. On Friday it also announced job cuts of 5 per cent of staff, affecting about 5,000 employees.The S&P 500 was marginally higher for the week, after falling 0.4 per cent to 1,838.70 on Friday. The index, which had earlier this week erased some of its losses, remains lower since the year began.The index struggled for direction on Friday, after a preliminary reading of consumer confidence in the US showed a decline. The report, by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters, showed a divergence in economic expectations between middle- and high-income households.Economists at Barclays noted the expiration of unemployment benefits may have been responsible for the drop in sentiment.“Opinions of government economic policy soured, though, as only 9 per cent of respondents thought the government was doing a good job,” economist Cooper Howes said. “This matches the level seen during the government shutdown in October.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 16,458.56 while the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent at 4197.58 on Friday.
133;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Companies ride global wave of bond issuance;;Global corporations are rushing to raise the first batch of funds in 2014, in a wave of new bond issuance that may push total sales in the US this week over the $30bn mark.Global investment grade borrowers including FedEx, electric utility Commonwealth Edison Company, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group led the pack of large companies that began the year with new debt offerings.Financial companies in both sides of the Atlantic are among the most aggressive borrowers. At least eight deals were announced in Europe alone in the past two days, with Italy’s Generali and UniCredit raising close to €3bn.Sales of junk bonds are also picking up, with companies with ratings below investment grade, such as China’s large-scale real estate developer R&F Properties, and Icahn Enterprises, also announcing sales.The deluge is coming after a slowdown in debt capital markets activity in the past couple of weeks in spite of a broad rally in risk assets.Many companies are trying to squeeze in as many sales as possible ahead of a key report on US monthly payrolls on Friday. A weaker than expected reading could spark a rebound in volatility after a drop in the past couple of weeks, analysts said.In addition, some borrowers may also be rushing to markets before the start of the so-called quiet period, which precedes the release of their quarterly earnings reports later this month.“We should see pretty robust debt issuance in January,” said Ed Marrinan, head of macro-credit strategy at RBS Securities.“The Treasury market has responded well to taper news by the Fed, and conditions remain very supportive. I wouldn’t be surprised to see new bond sales reaching $100bn by the end of the month.”The first weeks of January tend to set the tone for global debt capital markets activity throughout the first months of a new year.In recent years companies have benefited from a combination of rock-bottom borrowing costs and investor willingness to buy bonds at higher prices, in exchange for potentially higher returns. That sweet spot helped push corporate bond sales in the US alone to the $1tn mark in 2012, and to a fresh high of $1.1tn in 2013.Sales of junk bonds were also strong last year, with global issuance rising to a record $463bn.In 2014, however, debt capital markets activity looks set to slow on fears of higher borrowing costs. Treasury yields have been increasing since the Federal Reserve first hinted last year that it would start tapering its monthly purchases of bonds.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at 2.95 per cent on Tuesday, up from 1.9 per cent one year ago.“It will be hard for the new supply to keep pace with the record levels of bond sales that we’ve seen in 2013,” said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income. “We would need a big M&A wave or a jump in leverage-buyout activity to boost these sales.”
134;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-12-18T23:53:52Z;FedEx earnings disappoint as customers seek cheaper options;;Earnings for FedEx, the express parcels delivery service, improved less than expected in the three months to the end of November as the late US shopping season squeezed margins in its ground operations.Net income grew 14 per cent to $500m, on revenues up 3 per cent to $11.4bn, compared with the same quarter last year, when Superstorm Sandy affected the company’s results. Earnings per diluted share rose 13 per cent to $1.57.However, analysts had been expecting results around $1.63 per share and, although the company increased its forecast earnings per share forecast for the year to May 31 marginally, it attributed the growth to share buybacks, rather than net income growth. It lifted its EPS growth forecast to 8 to 14 per cent above last year’s adjusted results, compared with 7-13 per cent previously.The shares were up 0.5 per cent in New York on Wednesday, at $139.72.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the earnings – for the second quarter of FedEx’s financial year – had been “solid” and said the profit improvement plan for the key FedEx Express parcel service continued to “gain momentum”.“Overall, we believe our strategy is working well and we’ll achieve our goals,” Mr Smith said.Both FedEx and UPS, its main rival, have been struggling to counteract a shift by customers away from their premium time-guaranteed delivery services and from air shipments to ground.In October last year, FedEx announced plans to cut costs in its air operations and expand ground capacity to adjust to the shift. However, it was still forced in March to cut its forecasts for the year to May 31 and ground some aircraft because of a “radically changed” international trading situation.Operating income at FedEx Express, the air parcel delivery segment, grew 42 per cent to $326m, although revenues declined marginally from $6.86bn to $6.84bn. The decline resulted from falling fuel surcharge rates and express freight volumes – international priority package volumes fell 5 per cent – but were mostly offset by increased yields per package.Operating income at FedEx ground grew 3 per cent to $424m, on revenue up 10 per cent to $2.85bn. The company attributed the decline in operating margin to a later-than-normal start to the US holiday shopping season, which began in December after the quarter ended.Operating income at FedEx freight grew 1 per cent to $77m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $1.43bn.Last month Dan Loeb, the activist investor, disclosed that his Third Point fund had taken a stake in FedEx– whose size he did not disclose – and that he had met Mr Smith to discuss ways to improve the company’s performance.
135;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-11-12T22:20:22Z;Loeb’s Third Point takes stake in FedEx;;Dan Loeb, the activist hedge fund manager known for his coruscating attacks on company managers, has taken a stake in FedEx, the $42bn US parcel delivery group.Mr Loeb – whose recent targets have included Sotheby’s, Sony and Nokia – disclosed on Tuesday that he had met FedEx’s chief executive, Fred Smith, to discuss ways to improve the company’s performance.While Mr Loeb heaped praise on Mr Smith personally, FedEx shares rose 1.6 per cent to close at $134.63 in New York, on anticipation that the fund manager will press for strategic changes at the company, where growth has been sluggish this year.The two men met at FedEx’s headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee, Mr Loeb revealed at the DealBook conference in New York on Tuesday.“We had a very constructive discussion about the company. We had some ideas, we shared them, and he disabused us of some of our notions,” he said. “We like the company.”Third Point, Mr Loeb’s fund, has not formally disclosed its holding in FedEx, which suggests it has been acquired since the end of June. Mr Loeb did not reveal the size of the stake, and his spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Mr Smith founded Federal Express in 1971, and he will turn 70 next year, but Mr Loeb said he does not intend to try to push him out.He is “one of the great American CEOs, entrepreneurs and company founders”, Mr Loeb said – striking a contrast to some of his recent interventions at other companies in which he has invested.Last month, Third Point published an open letter demanding the immediate resignation of William Ruprecht, chief executive of Sotheby’s, and accusing managers at the auction house of indulging in lavish expenditure.Sotheby’s called the comments “incendiary and baseless” and has adopted a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan to complicate takeover attempts and prevent Third Point increasing its stake.FedEx confirmed the recent meeting at its headquarters, when Mr Loeb and other Third Point executives met several members of the company’s leadership team.The group’s most recent quarterly results confirmed continuing weakness at its core FedEx Express air delivery business, due to the lacklustre economy and as customers favour cheaper ground shipping.FedEx shares have risen this year, helped by rumours of interest from activist shareholders. Last month, the company said it would buy back $32bn of its shares to try to boost shareholder value. Mr Smith has promised to increase annual operating profit at FedEx Express by $1.6bn by 2016.The investment in FedEx sits in Third Point’s portfolio of US stocks that, at the end of June, included Walt Disney, Coca-Cola and Yahoo, among others.
136;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-10-25T13:59:55Z;UPS sticks to full-year results forecast;;UPS, the express parcel delivery service, announced that third-quarter earnings more than doubled and reiterated its forecast for full-year results well above last year’s, betting that growing ecommerce volumes would outweigh economic concerns.The company – which is closely watched for signs of the health of US and global business – announced net income rose to $1.1bn from $469m, on revenue up 3.4 per cent to $13.5bn. Profit would have been 6.7 per cent up from last year excluding the net effect on 2012’s figures of a $559m one-off charge to restructure some US employees’ pension liabilities.Diluted earnings per share rose from 48 cents to $1.17. Excluding the pensions charge, they would have grown 9.4 per cent.The US domestic package business performed particularly strongly, benefiting from the continuing growth of ground services, which are winning out as customers switch from more expensive air delivery. Domestic ground revenue increased 6.6 per cent to $5.87bn, while US domestic package revenue overall grew 5 per cent to $8.25bn. Operating profits for the business, excluding the pension write-off, rose 16 per cent to $1.19bn.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the third-quarter results had been strong and in line with the company’s expectations. While some retailers were expressing caution about the holidays, he added, they still expected robust sales online – which increases package volume for UPS.“There has been this continual trend of more and more shopping done online,” Mr Kuehn said. “What we’ve seen is that UPS gets a significant amount of that during the holidays. So even a modest overall spend in the retail sector can be magnified into a stronger peak season for us.”The late timing of this year’s Thanksgiving in the US meant the peak holiday shipping season would be “compressed”, which presented some “operating challenges”, he added.“Nonetheless, we are confident in UPS’s ability to successfully deliver the holidays,” he said.Mr Kuehn reiterated the company’s guidance for the full year of diluted earnings per share adjusted for items like the one-off pension write-off of $4.65 to $4.85, between 3 and 7 per cent up on last year.The company had cut its forecasts in July, citing economic worries.Both UPS and FedEx, its main rival, have been grappling with a drift by customers away from high-margin guaranteed next-day delivery air express parcels towards lower-cost services, including truck, rail and sea shipping.In international packages, the company provided further evidence that Europe is starting to recover, saying daily export shipments from Europe were 10 per cent up on the same period last year, while shipments from Asia were flat. Operating profits for the business, however, fell 7.1 per cent because of currency and fuel price movements to $417m, on revenue up 2.5 per cent to $3.02bn.Supply chain and freight operating profits grew 6.9 per cent to $201m, on revenue down 0.7 per cent to $2.25bn.The shares rose 1.2 per cent to close at $95.61.
137;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx buyback unable to boost Wall Street;;FedEx was among the strongest US stocks during mixed Tuesday trading as indices were lower on continued political tension over the debt ceiling in Washington.The global parcel transportation company’s shares rose 4.3 per cent to $120.35 after it announced a plan to buy back as many as 32m shares. That programme would add on to a continuing programme to purchase 7.4m shares.Seen as a bellwether for the international economy, FedEx has endured sluggish economic growth by improving margins in its FedEx Express business. Shares in the company are up 31.6 per cent on the year to date.The move by FedEx did little to distract investors from the impasse in Washington, as negotiations continued with only two days left before the US reached its debt ceiling.The S&P500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,698.06, with the utilities and industrials sectors off 1.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to 15,168.01, and the Nasdaq Composite index retreated 0.6 per cent to 3,794.01.Earnings reports helped to provide investors with a respite from watching the news from Washington.Online brokerage Charles Schwab beat third-quarter estimates as it reported that net income rose 19 per cent. The earnings news sent shares in the company 4.6 per cent higher to $23.03.Citigroup lost 1.5 per cent to $48.86 after reporting earnings that missed expectations because of a drop-off in fixed income trading and mortgage banking.The world’s largest soft drink company, Coca-Cola, declined 0.7 per cent to $37.66 after reporting a fall in revenue. However, the company’s third-quarter profits rose to meet expectations.Johnson & Johnson shares rose 0.1 per cent to $89.93 after the company beat earnings per share expectations. However, the company was downgraded by analysts at Thomson Reuters/Verus to “sell” from “hold”.Shares in data analytics company Teradata fell 18.4 per cent to $42.91 after the company warned on Monday after the bell that it expected its third-quarter revenue to come in below consensus. The company also revised its full-year revenue outlook, adding that it expected sharp declines in revenue from Asia and the Middle East.Domino’s Pizza fell 5.7 per cent to $64.90 after the pizza chain reported sales that missed estimates. However, the company did report same-store sales growth of 5.4 per cent in the third quarter.As headlines from Washington have dominated the news cycle, there has been an expectation that significant volatility and downward movement could help spur a deal on the debt ceiling. No such move has come. The S&P sits 1 per cent higher in October, and volatility is little changed, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, in a note.“Thus far in October, I observed little variation in the average trading volume or per cent change in high/low prices when compared with the first 10 trading days of October since 2000,” he said.“What’s more, there has been an absence of abnormal spikes in daily trading volume since the beginning of the year, except possibly for the low level of volume recorded [on Monday] as investors awaited a press conference announcing a possible solution from the Senate.”His views were echoed by John Sawyer, chief investment officer at BBVA Compass, who said investors still had not reached the point of believing that a default was possible.“I don’t think we’ve seen any movements that you would say were significant enough to draw immediate concern that the market is taking this too seriously,” he said. “I think everybody is watching it and paying attention to it, but I do not think anyone can believe that Congress as a whole would breach the public trust.”
138;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Royal Mail finances rated better than rivals;;Royal Mail has been given a cleaner bill of financial health than any of the world’s post or parcels companies, giving a boost to the government’s hopes for a successful flotation in the next few weeks.Rapid Ratings, an independent US-based rating company, said Royal Mail had “changed dramatically” in the past two years and ranked it above even its most successful peers such as Deutsche Post DHL and Austria Post on a range of indicators.The government is due shortly to publish the sale prospectus, having announced its intention to dispose of a majority of the company, including a 10 per cent stake to be given to its 150,000 workers.That means at least 41 per cent of Royal Mail will be floated on the London Stock Exchange, though the figure could be higher. The company is thought to be worth up to £3bn. It is the most ambitious privatisation since the railways were sold off in the 1990s.Royal Mail faces a wave of rolling strikes by the main union, the Communication Workers Union, which is due to ballot members on pay, pensions and job security. The result is due on October 16, with strikes possible from October 23.Rapid Ratings assessed Royal Mail’s financial health as better than its peer group on five out of six broad criteria: sales performance, working capital efficiency, cost structure efficiency, debt service management and overall profitability.It is an endorsement of the improvement since Moya Greene, its Canadian chief executive, joined in 2010. Pre-tax profit rose 60 per cent to £324m in the past year, whereas two years ago it was losing money in its UK post and parcels operation.Under Rapid Ratings’ system, Royal Mail gets an overall rating of 86 out of 100, ahead of Austria Post on 85, Deutsche Post DHL and Singapore Post on 79 and FedEx on 74.Royal Mail’s rating has risen from just 36 two years ago. “This is a company that has changed dramatically in the past two to three years,” said James Gellert, the ratings company’s chief executive.Despite the findings, Royal Mail executives acknowledge that the company remains years behind Deutsche Post in operating efficiency and needs to invest in technology as it reshapes itself to focus on parcels, to take advantage of online shopping.Mr Gellert said a strong financial health rating meant Royal Mail was “better placed to withstand a shock or bump in the road” as it stepped up investment.Rapid Ratings is paid by subscribers rather than by the companies rated. It calculates its ratings using 60 ratios drawn from financial statements.
139;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-09-18T14:18:08Z;Lower costs boost FedEx margins;;FedEx reaffirmed its targets for profit growth, despite sluggish global conditions, after improved margins in its core FedEx Express business resulted in better-than-expected quarterly figures.The results for the June to August quarter came after a series of gloomy announcements from the express parcel delivery service over the past year, as it has wrestled with slow demand growth and customers drifting towards cheaper options, such as its ground services.The results drove up shares in the company, which is considered a bellwether for the state of the world economy, by 2.6 per cent to $113.51.The company forecasts earnings per share will grow 7-13 per cent for the year to May 31 compared with last year’s adjusted figures.“We remain confident in our full-year earnings outlook despite tepid global economic growth,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer.FedEx Express continued to pursue profit improvement initiatives during the quarter and the company remained committed to achieving its target of improving annual operating profits by $1.6bn by the end of its 2016 financial year, Mr Graf added.Net income grew 7 per cent compared with the same quarter last year to $489m, on revenue up 2 per cent to $11bn. Cost reductions by its FedEx Express division – including lower aircraft maintenance bills, as a result of the introduction of new aircraft– produced a 14 per cent increase in operating income to $236m, despite a marginal decline in revenue from $6.63bn for the same period last year to $6.61bn.Domestic US package volumes for FedEx Express grew 1 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, while international export volumes grew 4 per cent, with international economy volumes growing 15 per cent and priority demand slightly declining.The profit improvement by Express would have been stronger had it not been for a lag between fuel price increases during the quarter and extra income from fuel surcharges, the company said.Operating income at FedEx Ground improved 5 per cent to $468m, on revenue up 11 per cent to $2.73bn, boosted by increased demand for home delivery services, and growing commercial demand.Operating income at FedEx Freight grew 1 per cent to $91m, on revenue up 2 per cent to $1.42bn.Fred Smith, chief executive, attributed the improved results to growing overall demand for the company’s services.“FedEx Express remains focused on reducing costs while facing challenging global economic conditions,” he said. “Meanwhile, FedEx Ground continues to generate strong profitability on growing customer demand for its services.”
140;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-09-10T08:25:51Z;China airspace: military might puts squeeze on flights;;"In China, military license plates are even better than diplomatic ones. In addition to bestowing blanket immunity from all manner of traffic violations, they also inspire fear in the hearts of other drivers.A similar sense of entitlement has long been enjoyed by Chinese military pilots. The People’s Liberation Army air force controls 80 per cent of the country’s not so friendly skies, leaving just 20 per cent of the ether for the fast-growing civil aviation sector. In the US, the airspace split is the other way round: 20 per cent military, 80 per cent civilian.A simple statistical comparison shows how untenable this military dominance has become. According to Xia Xinghua, deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, 10,000 flights take off every day from 200 airports in China, compared to 60,000 daily flights from 10,000 airports in the US. As China’s aviation market inevitably catches up with and surpasses America’s, it is clear that its future growth cannot possibly be crammed into just 20 per cent of the country’s air corridors.At the biennial US-China Aviation Symposium, hosted by the US and Chinese governments in Beijing on Tuesday, Daniel Allen, senior air traffic operations manager at FedEx, noted the absurdity of having limited international entry and exit corridors in such busy regions as Shanghai and the Pearl River delta between Shenzhen and Guangzhou, where his company operates a major hub.Chinese civilian officials were also remarkably candid about this dilemma. Any fear they previously had in confronting China’s powerful military is quickly ebbing.“Our skies are becoming very busy,” Xia said. “Because of severe weather and the lack of [civilian] air space, delays have become even worse. We have been working with the military to implement more reasonable measures.”Such measures include the use of “temporary” routes through PLA-controlled airspace when they are not needed for training exercises and other military prerogatives.Another civilian air traffic control official, Du Qiang, was even more blunt. “Military aviation should not be granted priority over civilian flights,” he told the conference. “We should have more flexible use of the airspace.”The ultimate goal, Du added, was “shared administration of civil and military aviation”. If achieved, that would mark a major breakthrough in the management of China’s airspace.Related reading:

141;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-08-20T16:29:58Z;Getting luggage delivered;A good way to save time and money if quantity merits it;Having your luggage picked up from your home or office and delivered to your hotel or vice versa saves the time and hassle of check-in and baggage collection. What is available and when should you use luggage services?What’s out there?Services such as Carry My Luggage, Virtual Bellhop and First Luggage will pick up and deliver your bags for you. Fees depend on the size and weight of the luggage and the delivery time. Similar services are offered by airlines, such as American and United, and train companies, including First Great Western and Deutsche Bahn.How do the bags get there?Luggage delivery companies normally send the bags through services such as FedEx or DHL. Although it is possible to ship with these companies yourself, luggage delivery groups provide a more user-friendly front end and time guarantees.What are the main benefits?Luggage and travel expert Anne McAlpin says: “You’re paying for peace of mind – you know the items will be there when you arrive and, if you’re in a rush, you may be paying to avoid time spent at baggage reclaim.”The services are prized mainly by travellers who have particularly bulky or plentiful baggage, whether it is because of equipment needed on the journey or the trip is being combined with a holiday. “If you have a month-long business trip or you’re going to two places with different climates it could work well,” Ms McAlpin says.What else do I need to consider?Luggage delivery is not such good value for very short trips, when carry-on baggage will almost always be the better option.You also need to be a bit organised, as most of the companies involved need at least a few days’ notice.Finally, make sure you tell your hotel that your luggage will be arriving before you do.
142;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-07-12T13:25:43Z;UPS cuts result forecasts on economic worries;Package delivery group blames US backdrop and freight overcapacity;The slowing of the US economy and worldwide air freight overcapacity prompted UPS, the express parcel delivery service, to cut its full-year earnings forecast and warn on the outlook for second-quarter profits and revenues.The warning from UPS – which said second-quarter diluted earnings per share would be $1.13 against $1.15 for the same period in 2012 – follows similar warnings in recent months by FedEx, the company’s main rival.UPS cut forecast full-year 2013 profits from the previous $4.80-$5.06 range to $4.65-$4.85, or about 4 per cent.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the anticipated full-year figure would still represent a 3-7 per cent increase over 2012’s profits and that the company still anticipated “solid profit growth” in the second half.He added: “We expect the second-quarter market trends to persist and UPS is adapting to meet these conditions.”The company had not previously given a forecast for the second-quarter results.Both UPS and FedEx are often seen as bellwethers for the world economy, given their important role connecting businesses.FedEx warned as long ago as September that it was suffering from customers’ growing preference for its cheaper FedEx Ground services over its more expensive air offerings and for slower delivery of air packages. FedEx said on June 19, when it announced its results for the year to May 31, that it was planning further capacity cuts on top of a series of accelerated retirements of aircraft announced in early June. UPS’s statement on Friday was strikingly similar.“Overcapacity in the global air freight market, increasing customer preference for lower-yielding shipping solutions, and a slowing US industrial economy drove revenue and operating profit below expectations,” it said. “In addition, UPS experienced some slowing in package volume growth as a result of labour negotiations.”While express parcel and logistics operators such as UPS and FedEx are vulnerable to swings in world economic demand, they are also exposed to changes in air cargo capacity. Air cargo rates have been depressed by significant deliveries of pure air cargo aircraft such as the new Boeing 747-8F freighter, as well as the expansion of capacity in the cargo holds of new, long-haul twin aisle jets such as Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A380.UPS gave no indication how it planned to cut capacity to reflect the slower-than-expected demand growth.UPS shares lost about 5 per cent of their value on opening in New York, trading at around $87 each.
143;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-07-11T18:28:24Z;Negotiators pin hopes on early customs deal;;US and EU trade negotiators are grappling with ways to smooth customs procedures across the Atlantic, with an early agreement on such measures potentially spurring multilateral negotiations on border clearance at the World Trade Organisation.“Trade facilitation” – code for an array of provisions designed to reduce the bottlenecks of packages at customs – was one of several items on Thursday’s agenda at the first round of transatlantic trade talks in Washington.Some see this as one area where US and EU officials could find common ground within a few rounds of negotiations since it is less controversial than agriculture, privacy, procurement, and financial regulation, where there are deeper divisions.“On trade facilitation there is strong interest on both sides – and among the stakeholders – and you do not have the sensitivities that you have on other issues. There could be tangible benefits and not insurmountable differences in terms of approach,” said one EU official involved in the talks.Companies cheering on a deal on customs streamlining include some of the big logistics groups – such as DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS – which are optimistic that a compromise can be forged between the US and the EU relatively quickly. While the EU and US trade talks are not expected to strike a final deal before the end of 2014, some chapters of the discussions may be completed sooner.“I think the signs we have received from people is that they are all very gung-ho on trade facilitation. They think it is an area of great promise,” says Penelope Naas, a senior UPS executive in Brussels, noting that she would expect it to “close pretty early”.Some people observing the EU-US talks caution that trade facilitation may not necessarily proceed on a swifter timeline than other areas, but early progress could help energise multilateral trade negotiations ahead of a crucial summit of ministers in Bali in December. Easing the cost and red tape at borders is a core element of what is left from the near-defunct decade-old Doha round of multilateral trade talks, and even on that WTO members have been struggling to reach an agreement.“Because US and EU negotiators are working so closely together over the next five months before Bali it is a great opportunity to co-ordinate and push common objectives in the WTO,” says Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank.To be sure, the EU and the US are looking to go deeper on trade facilitation in their bilateral deal than they will in a Bali package, which has been clouded by divisions over food security measures pushed by some developing countries such as India. But a unified position forged bilaterally could help set a standard for the rest of the world – which is a goal for the EU and the US in other areas as well.Business groups say that an EU-US deal on trade facilitation should include a “single window” for customs clearance in both the US and the EU, arguing it would be more efficient and lower costs. They are also demanding more co-ordinated inspection activities among US government agencies and EU member states, a higher minimum threshold for taxes and duties set at $800, the payment of customs taxes in arrears, rather than in advance, and the harmonisation of air cargo security measures across the Atlantic.“We are pushing it because we think it is an area where every company benefits but in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, we think it is a very important issue,” Ms Naas of UPS says.Also on the agenda of the US and EU talks on Thursday were agricultural market access and sanitary issues, investment and dispute settlement, the environment, financial services, competition, labour and state-owned enterprises. The top negotiators for both sides are expected to hold a closing press conference today.
144;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-06-19T13:04:20Z;FedEx plans more capacity cuts;;FedEx, the express parcel and logistics operator, said it would make further capacity cuts and would see only modest profitability gains in the coming year as it continued to suffer from a sluggish global economy.The company made the projections as it published figures for the fourth quarter of its financial year, to May 31.Overall net income for the fourth quarter – which included a $100m charge for aircraft retirements – declined 45 per cent to $303m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $11.4bn. Earnings per share fell 45 per cent to 95 cents.In the core FedEx Express business, the company reported quarterly operating income of zero against $281m for the same period last year, on revenue up 3 per cent to $6.98bn.Fred Smith, chief executive, said FedEx’s ground business – where net income grew 1 per cent to $1.79bn, on revenue up 10 per cent to $10.6bn – had a strong year and e-commerce traffic had boosted volumes. However, those “positive developments” had not fully offset sluggish economic growth and customers’ growing preference for cheaper services in the quarter.FedEx has said over the past year that it is suffering from customers’ growing preference for slower, lower-margin ground transport instead of its premium air express services. It is also suffering from excess capacity in air cargo worldwide.The company said it would further cut capacity between Asia and the US in July. It announced on June 3 that it was immediately retiring 10 aircraft and speeding up the withdrawal of another 76 as it sought to save costs.“We are taking actions to better align our global networks with demand,” Mr Smith said. “We’re confident our business strategy is correct and we believe we’re positioning FedEx for profitable long-term growth.”The company projected growth in adjusted earnings per share – which excludes various one-off charges – of between 7 and 13 per cent for the coming year, assuming US gross domestic product growth of 2.3 per cent and world GDP growth of 2.7 per cent.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the pace of profitability improvement would be “moderate” in the coming year and would then accelerate the following year.“Our profit improvement programme is progressing, but we continue to see the effects of customers selecting lower-rate international services,” Mr Graf said.For the full year, group-wide net income fell 23 per cent to $1.56bn on revenues up 4 per cent to $44.3bn. Full-year earnings per share fell 23 per cent to $4.91.Adjusted earnings per share– the company’s preferred measure, which excludes reorganisation costs and aircraft impairment charges – were $6.23, just above the $6 to $6.20 range that the company had projected.FedEx’s shares had risen 2.92 per cent by lunchtime to $102.39.

Berkeley confirmed in April that it was on track to return £568m in cash to investors by no later than the end of September 2015. It has also secured eight further planning consents, with forward sales worth more than £1.4bn.And this is all before the government launched its controversial Help to Buy scheme two months ago, aimed at shoring up the housing market.Given that housebuilders are not required to contribute any equity, there is no reason why Berkeley would not take part in the Help to Buy bonanza.

It said in March that it expected full-year earnings per share to fall in a range of $6 to $6.20, against previous expectations of a $6.20 to $6.60 range, equivalent to net income of about $1.93bn.That compares with $6.41 EPS and $2.03bn net income for the year to May 31 last year. The company had originally forecast a $6.90 to $7.40 EPS range for the just-finished financial year.Figures will be further depressed by the $100m charge that FedEx announced on June 4 that it would take for immediately withdrawing 10 older aircraft from service and speeding up the withdrawal of a further 76.Fred Smith, chief executive, has said the previous relationship between global economic growth and still faster growth in package deliveries has broken down in recent years.● Hennes & Mauritz has been in the shadow of Spain’s Inditex for several years and that could well continue when the Swedish purveyor of cheap chic reports second-quarter results, writesRichard Milne.H&M already revealed last week that like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new stores, fell by 4 per cent in the three months until the end of May.Analysts revised down their profit and share price forecasts after a spell of unseasonably cold weather delayed the launch of summer fashion collections.The Swedish retailer was also hurt by the strength of the krona with H&M saying its SKr36.9bn of sales in the second quarter would have been SKr1.8bn higher with last year’s exchange rate.Citi analysts, who downgraded their share price target from SKr230 to SKr220 after the sales numbers, are forecasting a 7 per cent fall in H&M’s second-quarter pre-tax profit to SKr6.54bn with the closely watched gross margin falling by 0.4 percentage points due to discounting.Inditex, owner of the Zara brand, last week announced one of its weakest quarters for profitability in several years with its first-quarter pre-tax earnings flat at €571m.EarningsDarty FY €0.03 (€0.06)FedEx Q4 $1.97 ($1.99)H&M Hennes & Mauritz Q2 n/a (n/a)Imagination Technologies FY 10.22p (11.00p)The Berkeley Group Holdings 143.87p (90.68p)Trading and sales updateSpirit Pub CompanyShareholder meetingsHonda MotorInternational Consolidated Airlines● Dixons is expected to report underlying pre-tax profits of nearly £85m in its full-year results, writes Duncan Robinson.While Dixons’ UK division benefited from the demise of its main rival Comet, the electronics retailer’s southern Europe business continues to struggle in line with the region’s economy. Dixon’s performance in this region, with like-for-like sales down 5 per cent over the year, has been respectable in the circumstances.Investors will, however, want to hear what progress has been made on the restructuring at Pixmania, the group’s ecommerce website.

146;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-04-08T17:14:22Z;Investors brace for downbeat US earnings;;After pushing US stocks to record highs over the past five months, investors are set to focus on the message from companies as they start reporting first-quarter results.The country’s largest companies are expected to report lacklustre quarterly results, so Wall Street has rallied sharply since January on the basis that a stronger economy later this year will accelerate profit expansion.But a disappointing jobs report last week and lower forecasts from bellwethers of economic activity such Delta Air Lines and FedEx are raising the stakes.“Stock markets have had a nice run, but expectations have been for consistently lower earnings,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “Unless we see some improvement in companies’ forward guidance, earnings by themselves are not likely to become a catalyst for further gains.”Aluminium producer Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in the US after the market closed on Monday, following a multi-month rally marked by the S&P 500 eclipsing its all-time high last week.Analysts forecast earnings for America’s 500 largest public companies will grow 0.7 per cent for the first quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. That is a sharp drop from the 7.7 per cent expansion posted during the final quarter of last year, according to S&P Capital IQ. Only six out of the 10 major sector groups in the S&P 500 are expected to show earnings’ growth.For this quarter, telecoms companies, consumer discretionary and consumer staples are expected to post the strongest gains, according to S&P Capital IQ. In contrast, sharp declines are seen in energy and information technology.The Dow Jones Transportation Index, often considered a barometer for the economy and the trend of the broader market, has dropped 3.4 per cent since the start of the month.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, said last month that the package delivery company had experienced “very challenging” conditions in the quarter to February 28 as customers continued to select cheaper and slower services.But some investors see silver linings, with a few bright spots including a rebound in car sales, improvement in the housing market, share buybacks and a rebound in M&A activity.“The biggest beats should be in industrials and financials, especially those with capital goods and capital markets exposure,” said David Bianco, US strategist at Deutsche Bank. “Capital markets activity has been picking up, as has capital expenditure.”Analysts also say growth in certain overseas markets, such as Latin America, the low rate environment and a continued improvement in the overall US economy should also contribute to companies’ bottom line.
147;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Earnings cloud for surging US stocks;;Company profits are a cornerstone of equity market performance but the record run for US stocks is set to be crowned by a distinctly poor earnings season this month.It is a disconnect that suggests earnings and the recent spate of profit warnings from companies led by FedEx, Oracle and Delta are being overshadowed by the Federal Reserve’s massive bond buying.The Fed’s policy suppresses bond yields, making equities look far more compelling for investors than debt securities.Based on forecast earnings the equity market has an implied yield of 7 per cent, well above the return on bonds. Earnings need to come in above forecast to meet those expectations.But heightened profit expectations for the rest of 2013, notably the final three months, look very lofty.Based on recent history, they are set to slide as summer beckons, particularly should the economy repeat its recent pattern of a spring slowdown.The unexpectedly weak March jobs report released on Friday has only heightened concerns that another spring slump is under way.The creation of only 88,000 jobs last month – well below the consensus forecast of 190,000 – weighed on the S&P 500 index, with the market backing further away from its record close of 1,570.25 set on Tuesday.“Analysts tend to overestimate corporate earnings by about 4 per cent to 5 per cent on average and they tend to assume that the back half of the year is always when the good news comes,” says Jonathan Golub, US equity strategist at UBS. “But as the year progresses, the earnings estimates inevitably come down.”Since 2010, earnings expectations for the fourth quarter at this stage of the year have been far too bullish with actual results ultimately arriving much lower, according to FactSet.Analysts currently expect full-year earnings for the S&P will hit a record $112 per share in 2013, up from $104 last year. But, some say that forecast looks too rich.“We believe 2013 earnings estimates will weaken further and forecast full-year earnings of $103 per share,” says Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.“The good news is that we ultimately see earnings growing later this year and into next. The bad news is that the consensus estimates are too high,” he adds.The lofty aspirations for earnings looks particularly fragile given the recent weakness in US economic data and a pick-up in company profit warnings.But a notable feature of this year’s equity rally has been its defensive nature, suggesting that many investors fear a slower economy or simply view the rise in equity prices since January as a function of the Fed’s liquidity.“Investors have to shrug off earnings and focus on the huge valuation difference between equities and bonds,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Economically sensitive areas such as industrials, technology and materials – sectors that are seen as barometers for global growth and usually provide the fuel that powers bull markets – have lagged behind the overall S&P 500.The best sectors have been healthcare, consumer staples and utilities – areas of the market that consist of high dividend-paying and defensive stocks.Defensive-oriented stocks within the large-cap Russell 1000 index have outperformed more dynamic members not just this year so far but for the past year, three- and five-year periods.This defensive posture also reflects the disappointing guidance from companies with the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements rising close to the peak seen during the first quarter of 2009.Moreover, companies in the S&P that are dependent on international sales may start indicating tough going from the eurozone and slowing momentum in many emerging markets.Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citi, says the July reporting season looms as being the time when companies address the improbability of a European economic rebound in the second half of the year.“A hiccup in markets is quite likely this summer, just not yet,” he says, adding: “We would expect new record highs to be achieved first.”While the recent weakness in data and pullback in equities suggest the Fed will keep pumping money into the financial system, renewed strength in the S&P 500 requires defensive-oriented investors to rotate into cyclical sectors.This underlines the importance of company guidance about the coming quarters when they start releasing first-quarter results in the coming weeks.Ultimately, earnings will matter for the equity markets and their slow growth rate means the S&P 500 may struggle to achieve new highs.“The important takeaway is that the last year came in at $104 for the S&P and this year it’s projected to come in about three to four per cent better,” says UBS’s Mr Golub. “That means we are stuck in a really uninspiring and unsatisfactory earnings environment.”Mr Ablin adds: “Earnings do matter and, relative to profits, revenues and the economy, the stock market in my view is a little overvalued.”
148;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-03-25T17:01:59Z;TNT Express unveils post-UPS strategy;;TNT Express said the sale of its Chinese business is expected “imminently” and reiterated its intent to sell its Brazilian arm in a strategy update two months after the collapse of a planned takeover by UPS.The Dutch express delivery group fleshed out plans announced with its results last month to divest its global operations and refocus on its core European market. Investors had been awaiting the company’s strategy as a standalone company after UPS’s takeover bid was blocked by European competition authorities.TNT Express said it expected to cut 4,000 jobs over the next three years and reduce annual costs by €220m by 2015. It said it was exploring options for further reducing its fleet of aircraft, which it expanded in an attempt to compete globally with FedEx, DHL and UPS.Bernard Bot, interim chief executive, declined to give any details of the prospective buyer of the company’s Chinese business but said “an announcement is expected imminently”. It was unclear how much the sale might fetch, as the Chinese arm recorded a net loss of €13m on €260m revenue in 2012.TNT Express’s Brazilian business is also unprofitable but Mr Bot said the first two months of 2013 showed a substantial reduction in losses.Mr Bot will return to his previous position as chief financial officer when Tex Gunning takes over as chief executive in June.In a statement, Mr Bot said TNT Express “faces difficult market conditions and strategic challenges” but cited the company’s “unrivalled European network”. TNT Express and DHL vie for the largest share of the European delivery market, with the leading company varying depending on how the market is measured. But TNT Express’s truck fleet and road hub network is larger than DHL’s, allowing it to offer express delivery by road, including delivery of heavier freight than is possible by air.“Our air network in Europe is [comparable to DHL’s] but then we have the combination with road, which nobody else can offer,” Mr Bot said.The company said it targeted an operating margin in Europe, the Middle East and Africa of 8 per cent by 2015, up from 6.3 per cent last year, assuming a return to 2 per cent gross domestic product growth in Europe.The 4,000 job cuts will involve attrition and a reduction in the numbers of outside consultants as well as terminations, Mr Bot said. The company expects to spend €150m on redundancy and other payments.In a note, Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro said the new strategy “likely fails to inspire investors” as it mainly reiterated earlier statements.Shares closed down 4.5 per cent at €5.64 in Amsterdam on Monday.
149;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-03-22T20:24:29Z;Wall Street higher on robust earnings;;Robust earnings from Nike and Tiffany and a stellar listing from Marin Software boosted Wall Street on Friday, but the gains failed to prevent major benchmarks from registering their first weekly losses this month.Shares in Nike surged 11.1 per cent to $59.53 after it reported net income rose 16 per cent to $662m in the quarter to February 28 compared with expectations of $610m.Revenues were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn, in line with Wall Street forecasts.Tiffany & Co reported that fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose to $179.6m, or $1.40 per diluted share, beating a forecast $1.36 and up from $178.4m, or $1.39 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.Shares in the luxury retailer rose 1.9 per cent to $69.23.Solid earnings propelled shares in Micron Technology 10.7 per cent higher to $10.04 with sentiment buoyed by analyst upgrades.Shares in Darden Restaurants rose 1.4 per cent to $49.62 after an 18 per cent drop in its fiscal third-quarter net income still beat expectations.The company said combined sales for its Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants that have been open at least a year declined 4.6 per cent.The listing of Marin Software on Friday saw its shares climb 16.1 per cent to $16.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.The ad tracking company listed at $14 a share and surged to a peak of $19.95.The S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,556.89 with the session’s earnings reports helping to offset gloomy results from FedEx and Oracle earlier this week. For the week, the S&P registered a decline of 0.2 per cent, breaking a run of three consecutive weekly gains.FedEx incurred a weekly loss of 9.7 per cent to $98.48 after the package delivery company cut its full-year forecast in the wake of third-quarter net income dropping 31 per cent.That weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday.Transports slipped 1.5 per cent this week, trimming their 2013 gain to 16.4 per cent, still handily beating the major US indices.Oracle dropped 12 per cent to $31.98 for the week after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts.The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.Among the major S&P sectors this week, consumer staples led with a gain of 2.1 per cent while financials lost 1.5 per cent while materials dropped 2 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.6 per cent higher at 14,512.03, having touched a new intraday record high of 14,546.82 earlier this week. That left the blue-chip barometer a fraction lower on the week, its first such loss in five weeks.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 3,244.99, for a loss of 0.1 per cent since Monday.The first-quarter earnings season kicks into gear next month and could determine whether the S&P 500 can break its 2007 closing high of 1,565.15.The estimated earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies during the first quarter is minus 0.7 per cent, according to FactSet.“While analysts expect little if any earnings growth for the first quarter of 2013, they do predict earnings growth will rebound to double-digit levels in the second half of 2013,” said John Butters, analyst at FactSet.James Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel, said the S&P remains on track to break its 2007 high, citing the momentum of money coming into the market for dividend paying and value stocks.“People that need income are looking for stocks that provide them with an actual cash flow yield,” he said.But with uncertainty swirling in the eurozone over Cyprus and with fiscal policy in the US, equities could struggle for momentum in March.“These increased risks are likely to cause stock markets to struggle in the near term and prompt profit taking after the strong gains thus far in 2013,” said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investment Advisors.Among other shares in the earnings spotlight this week, weaker guidance from Guess saw its shares drop 7.5 per cent to $25.09.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.7 per cent to $49.83.Adobe booked a weekly rise of 3.8 per cent to $42.97 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rallied 4.1 per cent to $48.15 on the week after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.
150;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall St rises as Fed reaffirms policies;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday, and touched its highs for the session after the US Federal Reserve affirmed its supportive policies, while investors also saw containment of any fallout from the banking crisis in Cyprus.Among shares in the spotlight, FedEx slid 6.9 per cent to $99.13 after the package delivery company cut its full-year forecast in the wake of third-quarter net income dropping 31 per cent to $361m, or $1.13 per share. Excluding items, FedEx earned $1.23 per share, while analysts had expected earnings of $1.39 per share.The company said results were hit by customers switching to cheaper modes of shipping from air express, but that they were focused on strategic cost reductions.“International airfreight trends remain weak,” said analysts at Baird Equity Research, who added that the company’s “multiyear profit improvement initiative remains on track, an important catalyst for the stock”.While shares in FedEx remain higher by 8 per cent this year, the pressure on the stock on Wednesday weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday. Transports slipped 0.4 per cent, trimming their 2013 gain to slightly more than 17 per cent. So far this year, transports are handily beating the major US indices.In New York, the S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent at 1,558.71, less than seven points from its all-time closing peak of 1,565.15 set in 2007.Among the main sectors, consumer discretionary, staples and healthcare shares led gains. While the S&P loiters just below its all-time peak, defensive sectors remain standout performers this year, led by healthcare and consumer staples stocks.Equity volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index was subdued, settling at a reading of 12.7, down sharply from its recent spike to a peak of 15.4 on Tuesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.4 per cent higher at 14,511.73, after touching a new intra-day record high of 14,546.82.The price-weighted blue-chip barometer slightly lagged its rival benchmarks in part because of a 1.5 per cent fall in shares of Caterpillar, which settled at $86.94. The heavy machinery maker reported its rolling three-month sales fell 14 per cent in February, after a drop of 4 per cent in January.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent firmer at 3,254.19.After the closing bell, Oracle reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that just missed estimates. The stock slumped 6.8 per cent to $33.31 in after-hours trading.Shares in JC Penney rose 1.2 per cent in extended trading hours as the retailer said that bondholders, who last month claimed the company had breached a covenant on a bond indenture withdrew and rescinded their note of default, according to a regulatory filing.In other earnings news, shares in Lennar rose 4.8 per cent to $43.40 after the homebuilder posted better-than-forecast earnings of 26 cents a share versus a forecast of 15 cents. Shares in Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder rose 5.9 per cent to $36.53.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.3 per cent to $49.85. The upmarket kitchen appliance retailer earned $133.7m, or $1.34 per share, surpassing analyst forecasts of $1.29 per share.Adobe jumped 4.2 per cent to $42.46 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rose 2.6 per cent to $47.61 after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.Amgen gained 1.8 per cent to $94.05 after the company reported positive data from a study of a treatment for melanoma. S&P Capital IQ affirmed its “buy” rating on the drugmaker with a price target of $104. “We see early results as promising but think they will need to show survival benefit in order to become a viable regimen for melanoma, given the approval of several new drugs in recent years,” said Steven Silver, analyst at S&P Capital IQ.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues
151;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx cuts forecasts and Asia capacity;;FedEx plans to cut trans-Pacific capacity and push traffic towards lower-cost transport modes after a “radically changed” international trading situation prompted the package delivery operator to cut its full-year forecasts.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the company had experienced “very challenging” conditions in the quarter to February 28, with net income down 31 per cent down on last year.He blamed continuing poor air freight markets, overcapacity in package delivery and customers’ continued shift towards lower-cost transport modes.Net income for the quarter was $361m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $11bn. Earnings per share fell 32 per cent to $1.13.The earnings per share forecast for the year to May 31 – which had stood at a range of $6.20 to $6.60 per share excluding the cost of a voluntary buyout programme for employees – fell to $6.00 to $6.20 on the same basis.Mr Smith said the company would decrease flights between North America and Asia starting on April 1. It would also “aggressively manage” traffic flows to place lower-yielding business in lower-cost networks. The company was assessing how those moves might allow FedEx to retire some older, less efficient aircraft.“Policy decisions and the cost of fuel have radically changed the international trading situation,” Mr Smith told investors on a conference call.Significant new capacity had also come into the international air freight market, Mr Smith added – capacity has grown both because of the introduction of new wide-body passenger aircraft and dedicated freighters.The company planned to cut back on capacity to focus on moving the highest-value international packages, Mr Smith said.“The bottom line is we got a little bit ahead of our skis and we had more capacity out there into the heavier, more cost-sensitive air freight market,” he said.Investors often view FedEx and UPS, its main rival in the express package delivery business, as barometers of the state of the US and wider world economy, because of their role in facilitating business-to-business transactions.FedEx has been warning since September that shippers have been increasingly opting for lower-cost options such as truck or ship movements of goods over higher-cost air services. It had previously expressed more concern about domestic US demand than the international position.The company in October announced a restructuring to cut some air services and strengthen its ground operations.Net income in FedEx’s previous quarter– to November 30 – was 12 per cent down on the same quarter the previous year, although the company attributed part of that drop to the impact of superstorm Sandy in the US northeast.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said international revenues had fallen $100m short of expectations. Aircraft groundings could result in future impairment charges, he warned.The shift towards lower-cost transport modes pushed operating income at the core FedEx Express segment down 66 per cent to $118m, on revenue up 2 per cent to $6.7bn. Operating income at FedEx Ground grew from $465m to $467m, on revenue up 11 per cent to $2.75bn. FedEx Freight reported a $4m operating profit, against a $1m loss, on revenue up from $1.23bn to $1.24bn.The company said it expected its voluntary buyout programme for employees, whose costs were excluded from its forecasts, to total between $450m and $550m in the year to May, depending on acceptance levels. That will reduce earnings per share by between $0.89 and $1.09.
152;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-02-18T16:51:48Z;TNT Express: delivery failure;Dutch express delivery group acutely in need of a go-it-alone strategy;"Do jilted brides go on to have happy independent lives? Sometimes – but rarely without a bit of suffering. TNT Express is a case in point. Marriage to UPS has been frustrated; its shares have dived 40 per cent below UPS’s cash terms and its chief executive has departed. There is a small plus in the €200m break fee paid over by UPS last week, which adds to TNT’s end-2012 net cash of €140m. But that pales alongside the acute need for a go-it-alone strategy.Which, of course, is what TNT had just unveiled a year ago, when UPS’s offer arrived. Now the current acting management appears to be reverting to that plan – focus on Europe and exit domestic operations in the likes of Brazil and China. More details are expected next month. But the intervening 12 months have not improved the operating backdrop, and time has been lost in terms of cost-cutting plans. As Monday’s 2012 results showed, TNT faces pricing pressures in Europe (which accounts for two-thirds of group sales): underlying operating margins there fell from 8.4 per cent in 2011 to just above 6 per cent last year. Elsewhere, TNT is making little money overall.In short, the company’s board needs to act fast. First job, provide management certainty, if only by confirming acting executives in their positions. Next, decide on how broad and speedy divestments should be. China is well under way, but Brazil’s losses are declining and there is also a profitable Australasian business to be considered. Costs in Europe still need attacking. Strong partnership arrangements would help elsewhere. TNT had previously targeted a 10 per cent-plus operating margin, but in current market conditions, that could be stretch. The shares now trade on an enterprise value to 2013 earnings multiple of under 6 times – compared with 9 at UPS and 6 at FedEx. Given the task ahead – and barring a new suitor – that seems high enough.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
153;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-30T22:04:09Z;Brussels blocks UPS takeover of TNT;;Brussels formally blocked UPS’s aborted takeover of TNT Express on Wednesday, while expressing “surprise” that the US delivery group abandoned efforts to win approval before its negotiating time was up.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner, s aid the €5.2bn proposed tie-up with the Dutch delivery group would have “drastically reduced choice” and probably raised prices in express delivery services in 15 European countries, even after taking account of efficiency gains.UPS offered to sell TNT assets covering 17 member states to France’s DPD, but could not convince the commission either that the measures were sufficient to address the competition concerns or that they were achievable before the regulatory deadline.Mr Almunia said he told UPS at a relatively early stage that he would likely require an “upfront buyer” for the package of TNT assets – meaning he would only give EU merger clearance once a binding agreement was reached with DPD.UPS found this condition to be unacceptable and two weeks ago announced that it saw no realistic prospect of the deal being cleared, triggering sharp falls in TNT shares.Mr Almnuia said he was “a little bit surprised” by the decision to effectively pull out given “we still had time to continue negotiations”. He said UPS “clearly was not ready or was not in favour or was not prepared to explore” agreeing a deal with a buyer until it was “much too late for it to materialise”.UPS said that it “proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the [European Commission’s] concerns”, adding that the deal would have “been transformative for the logistics industry”.The Commission identified FedEx as the lone so-called “global integrator” – combining air and land transport – that could have purchased the TNT assets without causing competition problems.But Mr Almunia said FedEx, the arch-rival of UPS, showed “no interest” in buying the assets. The collapse of the UPS deal though has renewed speculation over a FedEx attempt to buy TNT.It concluded that France’s DPD, an interested buyer that did not own an airline, would lack the incentive, capacity or the will to maintain an expand express operations across Europe. Other perceived shortcomings included concerns about its long-term access to air transport.
154;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US presses ahead with global trade talks;;The Obama administration took a crucial step towards pressing ahead with talks towards a trade deal on international services, notifying Congress of its intention to pursue negotiations in a move that was cheered by US business groups.The negotiations over a so-called International Services Agreement are expected to be launched this year in Geneva, with 21 nations pursuing a deal to liberalise trade in sectors ranging from financial services to telecommunications and technology.Though it is far from clear that a deal can be reached, the push for a deal marks one of the few areas of potential progress in global trade talks as broader multilateral efforts to revive the Doha round have stalled.Ron Kirk, US trade representative, said an agreement on services could boost jobs in America. “If business services achieved the same export potential as manufactured goods globally, US exports could increase by as much as $800bn,” Mr Kirk said. He added: “To begin to realise this potential, we need to surmount a range of barriers that lock out, constrain, or disrupt the international supply of services.”Groups representing corporate America – including the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable – welcomed the move. “We strongly support USTR negotiating to liberalise trade in services. International services markets remain heavily restricted and US service suppliers face a wide range of barriers to doing business in overseas markets,” said Michael Ducker, chief operating officer of FedEx, the logistics group. “A new agreement to liberalise services trade would be a much-needed boost to our economic recovery, particularly at a time when growth opportunities are scarce.”In addition, both Republicans and Democrats on the key congressional committees responsible for trade said they supported the ISA talks, suggesting the Obama administration will not have its hands tied by sceptical lawmakers as it tries to reach a deal. “The US leads the world in exporting services – and to stay competitive, we need to keep it that way,” said Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee.“The ISA is a critical trade priority for me because it holds great promise for job creation in all sectors of the US economy, including manufacturing and agriculture, as well as services, and can help rebuild momentum for a global agenda of trade liberalisation,” added Dave Camp, Republican chairman of the ways and means committee.
155;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-14T20:42:33Z;UPS’s Europe strategy upended by EU;;"When UPS bid to take over TNT Express last February, following years of on-off courtship, it represented a bold bet to bolster the US delivery group’s position in Europe and outflank its arch-rival FedEx. UPS expected regulators to pose no hurdle to the €5.2bn ($6.9bn) deal.Brussels, in the event, proved the deal-breaker. Far from giving its early blessing, the European Commission raised deep-set antitrust concerns over the express delivery market, concerns UPS was struggling to overcome. On Monday morning, the world’s biggest delivery group gave up trying.The announcement – which puts paid to hopes of the deal going through even before Brussels formally vetoed the takeover – stunned not just the gaggle of hedge funds betting on every twist and turn of this deal. Even the commission was surprised to see UPS in effect pull out. TNT shares almost halved in value.But the warning signs were flashing for some time, arguably as far back as when the takeover was being plotted. A few weeks before UPS launched its first TNT bid, Brussels flexed its muscles and halted the Deutsche Börse-NYSE exchanges tie-up in its tracks. It was perhaps an inauspicious moment for another US corporate champion to gamble at winning over Europe’s top competition authority.The collapse of the deal has clear implications for the world’s four big delivery companies – the so-called integrators – not least in upending UPS’s strategy in Europe, forcing TNT into another commercial struggle to survive and leaving FedEx with new incentives to expand.But it may have wider resonance, giving another regulatory check to the ambitions of US dealmakers in Europe. Given that the takeover was hatched during the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis – as investor confidence in Europe plumbed new lows – there was naturally some bafflement from the UPS-TNT side.As one participant put it as the deal began to hit trouble: “It is hard to understand why they wouldn’t want our money.”Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, was blunt about his concerns: that the elimination of TNT would leave just two or three so-called integrators – combining land and air transport – in many European national markets, which risked hurting consumers through higher prices and less choice.UPS attempted to address this by offering France’s DPD a host of assets and space on its aircraft to allow it to fill the commercial gap. But shortcomings in DPD’s capabilities – most notably in having to rely on buying space on the UPS airline – were a serious worry for Brussels. Mr Almunia memorably said global delivery companies could not rely on “horses”.The final straw came on Friday when UPS was told there was unlikely to be an extension for it to find agreement with DPD, an agreement that would be a condition of closing the TNT merger.UPS was warned months ago that finding a solution to the competition issues would be difficult, according to people involved in the talks. At first the strategy was to broaden the commission’s relatively narrow view of the express delivery market; then it moved to selling assets to create a new competitor in DPD.“There wasn’t really anything else that they could easily offer,” said one person close to the talks. Others question whether UPS adapted early enough to the reality in Brussels; its concessions were submitted at the last possible point in the process, squeezing the amount of time it had to find a buyer.Failing to win approval to purchase the prized assets of TNT means UPS has been robbed of an opportunity to expand rapidly in the world’s second-biggest delivery market. David Vernon of Bernstein Research said that while the acquisition was a “unique opportunity”, it will represent only a “modest negative” for UPS.While UPS will be forced to trim its ambitions and lose its aggressive growth options in Europe, shareholders may see the upside. Some had worried about the integration risks of melding together the UPS and TNT networks. The decision also frees up cash. “That would now be available for shareholders, one would think,” said Mr Vernon.As ever, there will be concern in UPS’s Atlanta headquarters over its nemesis FedEx benefiting from the decision and swooping in to seize TNT assets for a song. Indeed, FedEx’s strong objections over the harm to competition from the UPS-TNT deal was a factor in UPS’s Brussels woes.But while FedEx has long eyed TNT, there are some indications that it may not be interested; FedEx never offered a counterbid for TNT, its financial position is not as strong as UPS’s and it turned down opportunities to pick up TNT assets during the merger clearance process.As well as FedEx, some speculate that DPD could also return as a potential buyer. But TNT is not holding its breath. “FedEx has not expressed an interest” in an acquisition, said Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive. “We are focusing on executing our standalone strategy.”Hedge fund managers who backed a clearance will also be licking their wounds. Many piled into the Dutch logistics company over the past year, underestimating the level of resistance in Brussels. One described the result as a “disaster”.Another person close to the deal said that with no other big deals to arbitrage besides Glencore-Xstrata in Europe, the hedge funds “went nuts for” TNT-UPS, hiring many law firms and even one that went as far as “posting a lot of packages to achieve …I don't know what.”Additional reporting by Chris Bryant in Frankfurt"
156;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-14T15:14:38Z;TNT Express begins rebuilding broken image;Express delivery group’s future unclear after talks collapse;TNT Express was created as takeover bait in 2011, when activist shareholders forced the former TNT to split its regular and express delivery arms in the belief that the express business would be attractive to larger rivals UPS and Federal Express.Now, with the European commission set to block UPS’s takeover offer, TNT Express’s original raison d’être appears to have collapsed, and its future prospects are unclear.Management’s attention has been focused on the merger since last March. The company’s latest strategic plan, unveiled just before the approach from UPS, is widely viewed as a flimsy placeholder.“We are going to take the time to work on updating our strategy and come back in due course,” said Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive.The failed merger means UPS must pay TNT Express a €200m break fee but leaves the company uncertain of its direction. However, many analysts say TNT Express’s chaotic image belies a fundamentally sound business.While the company fell short of its ambition to become a global rival to the “big three” of UPS, FedEx and DHL, it has a strong and profitable presence throughout Europe, where it is the second-largest delivery company by sales after DHL.“They have a strong position in Europe, there’s nothing wrong with that in itself,” said Philip Scholte of Rabobank. “Just the fact that the EU is blocking the merger shows that TNT Express has something that’s difficult to copy.”TNT Express’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operations brought in nearly two-thirds of the company’s total €7.2bn revenues for 2011, with the company holding 17 per cent of the internal European express market.But the company’s major emerging-market operations in China and Brazil are in a different situation. TNT Express has already indicated it would like to trim its global ambitions to focus on Europe.“In China they are just a drop in the ocean, they lack the size and position to defend themselves,” said Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro. “It’s better for them to say goodbye to China.”In Brazil, Mr Bakker said, TNT Express is better positioned, with a market share comparable to that in Europe. The division remains lossmaking due to botching the integration of a couple of takeovers in 2010 but the company has said it should reach break-even in the last quarter of 2012.In the meantime, the company hardest hit by the failure of the merger with UPS may not be TNT Express but its sister company PostNL, the regular-mail company that emerged from the demerger of TNT.With the value of its 30 per cent stake in TNT Express collapsing, PostNL will likely be stuck with negative equity for years to come, according to an ABN Amro report.
157;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
158;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-14T12:55:48Z;UPS and TNT: delivery failure;Few silver linings for postal companies after €5.2bn deal is abandoned;Ouch, that hurts. TNT Express shares fell 42 per cent on Monday after UPS’s proposed €5.2bn deal to buy the company collapsed in the face of opposition from EU competition authorities. At €4.74, TNT’s shares are 25 per cent below the undisturbed price before the deal was announced last March. At least investors can stop arguing about what sort of a bid premium was in the price before the deal. TNT’s enterprise value is now six times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, in line with FedEx but a discount to UPS, on nine times.It is tempting to see the collapse as a masterstroke by FedEx. Lacking the firepower to compete with UPS (its enterprise value is a little more than a third of UPS’s), it declined to enter a bidding war last year. But FedEx also refused to buy the parts of TNT the EU wanted UPS to sell and, in doing so, contributed to the deal’s collapse. With its biggest competitor for the assets out of the way, FedEx can consider making an approach of its own.But TNT shareholders should not hold their breath. True, its 18 per cent market share in Europe is attractive to FedEx, with only 4 per cent. But that lack of overlap also means it would not be able to squeeze out anything like the €400m to €550m of cost savings that UPS promised, so it would not be able to offer as much. Even if FedEx decides it wants TNT, there is no reason to rush into things.So TNT shareholders (including, no doubt, some furious merger arbs) will have to nurse their wounds for a while. They can console themselves with a €200m break fee and decent earnings growth for the next couple of years, but also have to cope with strategic uncertainty, especially over its businesses in China and Brazil. FedEx, on the same rating but with a clearer plan of action, looks better placed to deliver for investors.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
159;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-14T12:31:19Z;UPS abandons €5.2bn TNT Express takeover;;UPS has abandoned its €5.2bn bid for Dutch delivery group TNT Express in the face of stiff opposition from Europe’s antitrust chief, who is preparing to block the second big tie-up involving a US company in just a year.The decision to give up on attempts to win clearance from Brussels sent shares in TNT tumbling by as much as 49 per cent and marked a grim start to the year for M&A bankers and for hedge funds who were betting on the deal being completed.However people close to the deal are already speculating about the prospects of a separate bid for TNT from FedEx, the main rival to UPS. It would need to pay less than UPS and would face fewer competition obstacles.Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, believed the takeover left many European markets with just two or three “integrators” – companies that combine air and road delivery capacities – leading to a poor choice for customers and the threat of higher prices.UPS had been scrambling to put in place a last-minute package of remedies to win approval, which involved selling a portfolio of assets across Europe to France’s DPD and giving it rights to buy space on the UPS airline.However, the remedy was extremely complex and involved many uncertainties, such as whether DPD had the ability or inclination to challenge the likes of DHL and UPS in express delivery over the long term.The European Commission’s decision to block UPS’s €5bn acquisition of Dutch rival TNT Express is a timely reminder of how the fate of dealmaking can often lie with regulators, writes Lina Saigol.Few can forget the spate of large mergers which were blocked by the EU antitrust regulator during the technology, media and telecoms boom of 2000.It was then that the EU commission prevented the $45bn blockbuster deal between US companies General Electric and Honeywell in 2001 from going ahead on competition concerns.Although US competition authorities had given their stamp of approval to the deal, the EU argued that the integration of Honeywell’s avionics division and GE’s strength in jet engines could lead to dominance of the market.The move prompted US regulators to accuse their European counterparts of protectionist and anti-business behaviour.In 2001, the commission also stopped the €5.4bn merger between French electrical equipment makers Schneider Electric and Legrand.But a year later, a court found that the commission’s economic reasoning for blocking that deal was flawed – and annulled the ruling, causing huge embarrassment for the then-commission head Mario Monti and led to it paying compensation to Schneider.The lesson was particularly bitter for the Brussels bureaucrats who had been more accustomed to cashing in on the hefty fines imposed on companies breaching competition rules rather than the reverse.Commission officials told UPS that they were preparing a prohibition decision on those grounds and – crucially – declined to extend the deadline to give it more time to agree terms with DPD. Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, said he was “extremely disappointed”.EU officials dismissed any suggestion that the tough line, which comes less than a year after Mr Almunia blocked the merger of Deutsche Börse with the New York Stock Exchange, will cause a rift with the US.But one shareholder in UPS questioned the “heavy hand” of Brussels “meddling” with a successful US company’s ambitions. “It is problematic. It sounds to me like TNT is impaired on its own. So how is competition going to be improved in Europe?” said Richard Platte, a portfolio manager for Ave Maria mutual funds.Although UPS sees no “realistic prospect” of the deal being cleared, a formal termination of its agreement with TNT will occur once Brussels has officially blocked the deal. A commission spokesperson said: “The commission will take its decision by February 5.”Brussels has only blocked 22 mergers and acquisitions deals since the introduction of merger control rules in 1989. Almunia requires the approval of the college of EU commissioners to block the UPS-TNT deal, but it is extremely rare for a draft prohibition decision to be overturned.The failure of the deal is a blow to UPS’s ambitions to gain a stronger foothold in the European market. It agreed to pay TNT a €200m break-fee if the deal fell through on competition grounds.It leaves TNT Express, the world’s fourth-largest parcel group, without a clear strategy. The company was demerged from its former parent company TNT in 2011 with ta view to making a merger with UPS or FedEx attractive.Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive, said the company would “focus on executing our existing strategy” and that the company would release a new strategic review “in due course”.The collapse is yet another blow for dealmakers. According to data provider Thomson Reuters, the advisers would have been on track to earn around $55m, with an estimated $25.4m for the target advisers and $29.6m for the acquirer advisers. Goldman Sachs advised TNT and Lazard advised its advisory board, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS advised UPS.With the deal failing, the financial advisers typically will only take home around 10 per cent of that. Globally investment banking fees in 2012 fell 3 per cent to $74.8bn, the slowest period since the 2009, while in Europe bankers fees fell to an eight-year low.
160;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UPS move on TNT poses concern;;UPS’s attempted takeover of TNT Express poses serious competition problems that are “not easy” to resolve, the EU competition chief has said, while leaving open the door to an 11th-hour solution to save the deal from being blocked.The US delivery group is trying to sell France’s DPD a swath of TNT assets that are sufficient in quality and scope to convince Brussels that competition in the express delivery market is maintained.The proposed remedies are still being reviewed by the European Commission. But Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, made plain the difficulties of compensating for the takeover of one of Europe’s four integrators, which combine ground and air transport.“The elimination of competitors such as TNT, that is an integrator, requires . . . an alternative integrator or someone who will play the same role from the competition point of view with equivalent competitive pressure,” Mr Almunia said in an interview with the Financial Times.He added that finding such a remedy was “not easy”, particularly given DPD has no air transport of its own. However by noting that the creation of an “equivalent competitive pressure” – rather than a full-blown global integrator – could be sufficient, Mr Almunia appears to be keeping his counsel on a DPD option.“What I have told UPS, what you have to present is an equivalent. Everybody who knows this market is convinced today DPD is not an equivalent,” he said. “It depends how this situation can be changed but it will not change just for saying I want to change. We need to receive assurances.”“To be express delivery you cannot go with horses, you need also to have not only capacity in the point of delivery of the sender of the parcel but delivery close to the receiver,” he added, with reference to air capability.The commission sees a potential sale to FedEx as a simpler option, because the US group has its own airline and a more developed network in Europe. But UPS has told the commission FedEx are unwilling to discuss buying the assets it is willing to sell.Mr Almunia is shortly to pass judgment on the terms of the provisional deal with DPD. His decision remains in the balance and it is possible that the UPS-TNT deal will be blocked.DPD is being asked to provide assurances to the commission on how it plans to use the TNT assets and on its long-term plans to challenge the likes of UPS and DHL in express delivery.UPS has offered to sell TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 countries, as well as providing DPD with space on its aircraft at competitive rates for five years. Mr Almunia’s comments indicate potential commission concerns about whether this would leave gaps in the DPD network that would undermine its ability to compete.An option under consideration is to “stop the clock” for a few weeks to give more time to UPS to agree terms with DPD, before the commission gives its official approval.But some people involved in the talks say that the risk of the DPD transaction not being completed after approval make this option unlikely. The commission could instead withhold full regulatory approval – and stop UPS closing its deal – until a binding agreement is signed with a buyer.
161;FDX;Fedex Corp;2013-01-07T18:39:13Z;FedEx rebuffs UPS over TNT Express assets;;FedEx has rebuffed informal approaches from its arch-rival UPS to buy a package of TNT Express assets, further complicating UPS’s last-ditch efforts to win EU approval for its takeover of the Dutch delivery group.The cold shoulder from FedEx, which would not engage in serious talks without it covering a bigger slice of the TNT business, has raised the stakes for UPS as it enters a potentially decisive fortnight in the Brussels merger clearance process.According to several people involved in the clearance talks, France’s DPD is currently the lone contender to buy the assets, which were recently sweetened by UPS to cover entire TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 EU countries, including Spain and Portugal.But the European Commission, which has serious concerns about the harmful competitive effects of the UPS-TNT tie-up, is demanding clear assurances that DPD will be a strong rival with a long-term commitment to the express parcel delivery business.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, is cautious about a sale to the French group because it does not have an air network and would rely on buying space in aircraft from its rivals – a shortcoming that has raised doubts about its long-term commitment to challenging the likes of DHL and UPS.The commission decision remains in the balance and time is running short. The February 5 deadline means that the commission will soon need to prepare a draft decision on whether to block the deal or clear it with conditions.One option being considered – if DPD is seen as a viable competitor and can give Brussels some assurances on its long-term business plan – is to extend the effective deadline to the end of February on the condition that the sale of assets is agreed. Yet even this rare extension may force DPD to scramble to complete the deal.The simplest solution for the commission would be a sale to FedEx, which already owns an airline. But UPS has told the commission FedEx is not engaging in talks. It made fruitless informal approaches to FedEx, including in December, to test its interest in a smaller bundle of assets than that offered to the less established DPD.UPS fear that identifying FedEx as the only viable buyer would trigger a fire-sale, especially given FedEx’s hard-bargaining. But UPS critics question whether it is willing to make a serious offer to its main commercial rival. In its package of concessions, UPS stipulated that TNT assets in certain countries could not be sold to FedEx or DHL.The takeover reduces the number of global “integrators” – combining ground and air transport – from four to three in the express delivery field: UPS, DHL and FedEx.The commission’s investigation, however, found FedEx’s network to be patchy, meaning that the merger would leave a harmful duopoly in many markets.DPD does not own an airline but UPS has offered space in its aircraft at competitive rates for a period of five years. DPD is submitting to the commission a plan of how it intends to use the TNT assets and whether it has any prospect of buying or leasing an airline.FedEx and the European Commission declined to comment. UPS said it was working hard to address the commission’s concerns.
162;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-12-27T18:16:07Z;Customer experience governance;;The business imperative to improve customer experience puts new demands on company chief information officers. Increasingly, the technology projects that get backing cluster around digital interactions with customers through web and mobile channels, engagement that requires deep links into content and transaction systems of record.Going forward, this trend will intensify as businesses demand a single view of customers to help guide sales and service interactions across all channels – online, on-mobile, over the phone, and in person.These developments place a spotlight on IT leadership to help define the systems of engagement and execute business strategy, not just to perform maintenance and support. And that makes CIOs and their teams critical partners to marketing, sales, and support organizations when it comes to improving customer experience.How can a CIO manage something as potentially soft and vague as customer experience improvement projects? The answer is to adopt the same governance practices followed by companies that treat customer experience as a business discipline.As we describe in Forrester’s new book, Outside In’, these practices help organizations manage customer experience in a proactive and disciplined way by assigning specific responsibility and management tasks to specific people across the organization.The rise of customer experience steering committeesGovernance bodies are as varied as the organisations they support. FedEx has a customer experience steering committee that meets monthly, chaired by Fred Smith, FedEx founder, chairman, president, and CEO,. The committee reviews customer experience improvement projects and, in a process that’s described as “very disciplined,” makes decisions about where to move forward.Similarly, Adobe has a customer advocacy council that includes senior leaders from product development, customer support, finance, marketing, business process management, and its two largest business units. The council meets regularly to review the latest customer insights and metrics. This lets them size, scope, and prioritise issues that they believe will make the biggest improvement to the customer experience and have the biggest financial impact for the firm.Adobe’s customer advocacy council doesn’t work on its own. It partners with another cross-functional group at Adobe - the business process improvement council, which sponsors customer experience improvement initiatives and allocates people to work on them.Technology and the CIO are at the core of process improvement if those processes touch databases and back-end systems. It also assigns an executive sponsor to each project, who’s then responsible for plowing through the roadblocks and making sure that people from individual silos are working together as they should be.Through this governance model, Adobe has completed a number of short-term projects, is managing several long-term initiatives, and has an ongoing pipeline of additional projects. When fully completed, the company estimates that these efforts will have a combined business impact of tens of millions of dollars.The move towards embedded customer experience processCustomer experience governance isn’t just about oversight. It also establishes processes that force customer experience concerns into the mix when making day-to-day business decisions. For example, Canada Post requires all funding requests from any department to answer ten customer-focused questions in the business case. This ensures that all leaders think not just about how their projects will affect the bottom line but also about how they‘ll impact the customer experience.Similarly, when Bank of Montreal acquired Milwaukee-based M&I Bank, it required anyone proposing an integration project to complete a customer experience assessment as part of the stage-gating process for funding. Based on the proven success of these assessments in the M&I integration, BMO ’s next step is to embed them into its broader technology funding process.Governance doesn’t stop once projects launch, either. To ensure delivery of the right experience every time, some firms provide tools that guide daily operations. For example, service design firm live|work created a conversation guide for claims agents at Gjensidige, Norway’s largest non-life insurance company. Its goal is to help agents keep conversations in line with the target experience despite the wide range of customer scenarios they encounter on a daily basis.The company knows the guides are successful because overall satisfaction with agent calls is up dramatically, and the number of dissatisfied callers is down dramatically. In the future, agent desktop systems that don’t embed this kind of guidance will fail basic audits for compliance with sound customer experience governance practices.At every step of the way - steering committee, project governance process, execution, and operations - the customer experience is linked directly to and dependent on the technology systems of engagement. CIOs are a critical resource to define what’s possible, adapt the core systems to serve customer experience goals, instrument and analyse the operations to continuously assess and improve the experience, and, of course, operate the new technology required for mobile and digital engagement.Harley Manning is the co-author of Outside In: The Power of Putting Your Customers at the Center of Your Business. He launched the customer experience practice at Forrester Research and has led it for 14 years. He is currently a vice president and research director.Ted Schadler is a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, where he serves CIOs. He is the co-author of Empowered, which guides companies on how to leverage disruptive technologies in the workforce.

But he warned that a shift in customers away from its lucrative express shipping services was expected to continue.Fedex shares have risen 11.6 per cent so far this year, slightly underperforming US equities over the same period.The S&P 500 was largely muted for much of the day before decliing sharply in the session’s final minutes. The benchmark fell 0.8 per cent to 1,435.81 as politicians wrangled over details on a deal to avert the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes. The losses marked the end of a two-day rally for stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 13,251.97 while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.3 per cent to 3,044.36.All 10 industry groups on the S&P 500 closed in negative territory, with the utility and telecoms sector indices experiencing the biggest declines on the day.Shares in homebuilders, some of the top performing stocks this year amid a modest US housing recovery, declined as fresh housing data showed new home starts for November came in below consensus forecasts.Lennar Corp was 1.1 per cent lower to $39.27, KB Home fell 2 per cent to $16.66 and DR Horton declined 0.7 per cent to $19.95.Shares in Herbalife, the nutritional supplement direct seller, dropped 12.1 per cent to $37.34 as reports said Bill Ackman, the activist investor, is expected to deliver his thesis behind a short position in the company at an event in New York on Thursday.US-listed shares of UBS, the Swiss bank, lost 1.2 per cent to $16.56 as it agreed to pay $1.5bn to regulators in the US and Europe to settle allegations related to manipulations of Libor interest rates.Oracle rose 3.7 per cent to $34.09 as the company that sells software, hardware and services beat analysts’ expectations for sales growth in its latest quarter.“Oracle is unusual in that it has had four prior quarters of modest to no growth on an organic cost and currency basis, so with very easy comparisons, the bar has been set pretty low,” said Rick Sherlund, analyst at Nomura.Knight Capital, the electronic trading and market-making company, gained 5.4 per cent to $3.51 as its board approved a takeover by Getco, a high-frequency trading firm.The deal, which will create one of the biggest trading companies in the US, values Knight at $1.8bn and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, said: “We view this as a positive for Knight’s shareholders based on the deterioration in Knight’s business and share price following a catastrophic trading glitch.”JC Penney, the troubled US retailer, rose 3.5 per cent to $20.88 as it hired a former executive from Abercrombie & Fitch, another US retailer geared at teenage customers, as it attempts to transform the layout of its stores.The company’s shares have lost 40.6 per cent from the start of the year. Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch fell 2.4 per cent to $47.83 on the day.
164;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-12-19T18:33:35Z;FedEx hit by Sandy disruption;;FedEx, the package delivery and logistics company, suffered a 12 per cent fall in net income in the quarter to November 30 after being hit by a combination of continued worldwide economic weakness and the impact of superstorm Sandy.FedEx said the storm, which severely disrupted package movements to and from the north-eastern United States, was responsible for 11 cents of an 11 per cent fall in earnings per share, from $1.57 to $1.39. Net income for the quarter was $438m, on revenue up 5 per cent to $11.1bn.The company also warned that continuing uncertainty in the US over the potential fiscal cliff package of spending cuts and tax rises was a concern.The core FedEx Express business suffered from a shift in away from higher-yielding US domestic packages towards lower-yielding international services, as well as the weak worldwide economy, according to Fred Smith, chief executive. Operating income for the segment fell 33 per cent to $230m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $6.86bn.FedEx said in September that shippers were shifting from using its premium express options towards its slower but cheaper freight and ground services. In October, it announced a restructuring, including slimming-down of some express operations, to reflect the change.Operating income at FedEx Ground rose 4 per cent to $412m, on revenue up 11 per cent to $2.59bn, while operating income at FedEx Freight rose 90 per cent to $76m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $1.38bn.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said FedEx was “steadfastly committed” to providing the $1.7bn in annual profit it promised in October. The company expected to start to see the benefits of its refocusing in 2014, with a “significant portion” of the profit improvement achieved by the end of its 2015 financial year in May 2015.But he went on: “Meanwhile, the mounting uncertainty in the US related to fiscal policies and (the) potential to impact earnings by further restraining economic growth is a concern.”The company stood by its previous earnings per share forecast of $6.20 to $6.60 for the year to May 2013 but said that was before the impact of its voluntary buyout programme of redundancies. It expected the programme to cost between $550m and $650m – $1.09 and $1.29 per share – during the year but the precise level would depend on employee acceptance rates.
165;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-12-18T14:43:31Z;UPS submits new TNT Express concessions;;UPS, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies by revenues, has sent a new offer to the European Commission to try to win EU regulatory approval for its planned €5.2bn acquisition of TNT Express, people close to the matter said.The US company has offered fresh concessions as part of a planned sale of its European assets and has guaranteed competitors access to the air transport market in its latest bid to overcome the commission’s objection to its take over of its Dutch rival.“We made our offer over the weekend and we are hopeful that it will provide the remedies necessary to move the deal forward,” said a person close to the matter.People familiar with the negotiations said that UPS was ready to dispose of substantially more assets – predominantly in eastern Europe – than the 12 previously offered.However, despite the new concessions, UPS will have to convince Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s antitrust chief, that enough safeguards have been put in place to maintain an acceptable level of competition throughout Europe.“It still remains to be seen whether appropriate solutions will ultimately address our concerns for express-parcel deliveries in Europe,” Mr Almunia said earlier this month.Brussels is concerned that UPS’s takeover of TNT would reduce the number of key players capable of the full range of parcel delivery services across the continent to only three, making Deutsche Post’s DHL and the US’s FedEx the main competitors in the Europe to US route.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, and UPS declined to comment.TNT shares rose as much as 4.3 per cent to €8.27, trading below the €9.50 per share offer made by UPS.

167;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Emails released in FedEx charges case;;FedEx, the express parcel service company, “systematically overcharged” business and government customers for years for parcel deliveries, according to an email that has become public during a legal action by customers.The legal action, filed in Tennessee, alleges that FedEx levied its surcharge for deliveries to residential addresses for tens of thousands of deliveries to offices such as the US immigration service, bank mortgage services and other businesses.It claims the company levied residential surcharges – currently running at $3 per package – on at least 500,000 occasions, including 70 times for deliveries to its own headquarters building in Memphis.The class action was brought by the law firm of Manjunath Gokare, a Georgia-based immigration attorney, and Goldstein Demchak Baller Borgen & Dardarian, a California-based legal firm specialising in civil rights and public interest cases. Both say they were overcharged for sending time-sensitive documents to government and other offices that were clearly not residential.They are seeking to bring a class action on behalf of scores of other customers who claim to have been overcharged, who are not named in the legal papers. They are seeking damages of three times the excess charges.FedEx said it would continue to defend the case and encouraged customers to contact the company if they had a billing concern. “These 11 documents do not tell the entire story of this case,” it said of the released emails.FedEx has consistently resisted efforts to turn the case into a class action, arguing that the sums of money involved were too insignificant to merit it.The confidential internal emails were made public on Monday after John Fowlkes, the judge handling the case in a Tennessee district, overturned an order keeping them confidential.They include an email written by Alan Elam, a sales executive in Scottsdale, Arizona, in August 2011 alleging that FedEx had processes that showed deliveries as being to residential addresses when it knew them not to be residential.“As a result, we are systematically overcharging our customers for residential delivery fees,” he wrote. “I have brought this to the attention of multiple people over the past five years and am confident that many MDs and VPs are aware of the issue. To date, no one has taken it up and recognised it to be a problem.”The practice made customers question FedEx’s integrity and created significant exposure to legal action, Mr Elam warned.Chris Suhoza, the company’s vice-president for solutions, replied to Mr Elam that the company was “working this customer experience issue through”.Mr Elam had previously written to other senior managers saying that he believed FedEx had “a methodology” for resolving the problem.But he went on: “My belief is that we are choosing not to fix this problem because it is worth so much money to FedEx.”

Under his leadership, Amgen’s annual sales grew from $3bn when he took the helm in 2000 to $16bn when he step­ped down, with profits multiplying and its focus widening from drugs that fight anaemia to the treatment of osteoporosis and soon, potentially, obesity.● Born: 1948 in Clinton, Iowa

● Family: Married, two children
● Interests: Cycling, skiing, golfFounded in 1980, the California up­start that made a business out of the new science of recombinant DNA now rivals many “Big Pharma” companies in terms of its resources and reach. By harnessing molecular biology and gene splicing technology, Amgen helped to define the biotech sector.It was the breadth of Mr Sharer’s corporate experience and his background that appealed to Harvard, which often draws on former executives. His new job is the capstone to a career that has been a classic climb to the top of corporate America.Mr Sharer attributes his successes to good luck, taking risks and an ability to change course if needed. “Seizing the opportunity always involves risk. You’ve got to have courage,” he says.He learnt about courage during his training at the US Naval Academy. After graduating in 1971 with a degree in engineering, Mr Sharer served on a nuclear attack submarine as the cold war intensified.Although he enjoyed the discipline and adventure, Mr Sharer wanted new challenges and different kinds of pressures, so he changed tack in the early 1980s to immerse himself in management consultancy at McKinsey. Two years later he moved to General Electric, learning the nuts and bolts of corporate operations by running business units under Jack Welch, its long-serving chief executive.Looking back, Mr Sharer says, he was plagued with impatience to rise quickly in his career. In 1989, he left GE to run sales and marketing at MCI, the telecommunications company. But he clashed with the culture and felt his career languished after he gave the CEO un­solicited advice on how to structure the business units.“Their culture was a culture that I couldn’t really learn how to manoeuvre in,” says Mr Sharer. “I was young, I was arrogant and so things didn’t go well for me there.”But in 1992, Amgen came calling with the offer of a job to run sales, marketing and government relations. This turned out to be a corporate home where Mr Sharer, now 64, would remain for 20 years.After eight years, he took over as chief executive – the third person in the company’s 12-year history to hold the position.Mr Sharer quickly shook things up, recruiting a new leadership team and moving much of the company’s manufacturing operations to Puerto Rico. “That was a big risk,” he says. “A good way to lose a biotech company is to have manufacturing [fail].”Within two years, he had led Am­gen’s 2002 acquisition of Seattle-based Immunex, which manufactured Enbrel, the strong-selling arthritis drug, for $16bn. He also led the development of Denosumab, the blockbuster osteoporosis drug.However, as Amgen grew in size, critics contended that it had lost sight of its roots as a nimble, fast-growing biotech company and became more like any lumbering pharmaceutical group with a stagnant stock price. It was an issue that he acknowledged in 2006, as he noted Amgen’s need to stay “small and hungry in feel and behaviour as we grow larger”.In some ways, Mr Sharer says, Amgen transcends easy definitions. “We are – I think – an example of the potential of a biotech company,” he says. “We are what other people in many ways would want to be – a big, successful company.”But Amgen has also had its struggles with drug safety concerns and investor frustration. Mr Sharer has been criticised by shareholders for being overpaid – before the recent trend for decrying excessive pay – and for investing heavily in research that failed to yield commensurate results.“We certainly had our crises, we had our surprises, I had nights when I couldn’t go to sleep,” says Mr Sharer. “But I was not a guy who spent a lot of time on what I would call unproductive, unconstructive worry.”Mr Sharer has handed the reins to Robert Bradway, whom he recruited from Morgan Stanley to be chief operating officer, and the company continues to ramp up its res­earch spending in hopes of developing drugs to lower cholesterol levels and combat obesity.As Mr Sharer starts his new professorial role at Harvard, the challenge is not unlike when he started at Amgen and plunged into biology after a lifetime as an engineer and businessman.It was critical for him as a non-scientist CEO to make sure he learnt enough about the science of the biotech industry to be credible, while also maintaining the mindset of a manager. It required tutors, textbooks and years of perseverance to learn to think differently so that he could make decisions about in­vestment and research and earn the respect of the company’s scientists.“One of the things that you have to do to be certified as a chief engineer in the American Submarine Force is have comprehensive knowledge of the reactor plant – everything from theory of every dimension and chemical, electrical, nuclear, metallurgy,” he explains. “I’d had to master taking apart in [my] head a very complex system and I thought biology’s kind of like that.”The experience helped Mr Sharer leave behind much of his earlier impatience and arrogance and develop as a leader, he says, as he learnt to trust colleagues with deeper experience in drug development. Finally at the top, he became a better listener and ceased trying to be the smartest person in a room.“I realised that being in the moment meant giving the person you were with your full attention and that’s the best way to convey respect, and listen for comprehension,” he says. “As I became more comfortable as chief executive, I didn’t have to worry that I was going to impress.”The same skills are helping him now, as he wrestles with complex case studies across a range of industries and prepares for life as a professor. The challenge could be as tough as learning biology.“You can’t wing it by power of position or authority or presumed competence,” he says. “When you’re the CEO, if you say something, prob­ably people are going to believe you. This is a completely different environment.”The pace will be different too. Gone is the focus on quarterly earnings and the constant travel. Mr Sharer’s cadre of assistants has been replaced with one and instead of meetings with bankers and investors, Prof Shar­er sees students seeking advice.“Probably the biggest transition I’ve made here is the move from the CEO emergency room doctor-triage mindset to one of a more thoughtful, reflective, penetrating mindset.”"
169;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-12-06T19:22:16Z;Hurdles remain for UPS on TNT deal;;UPS is making progress in its quest to win EU approval for its €5.2bn takeover of TNT Express but still faces a big challenge in convincing Brussels that it has a credible buyer for a swath of assets across eastern Europe.The US delivery group recently made headway in narrowing the European Commission’s strong antitrust concerns and reduced the number of problem countries from 29 to about 15, said people involved with the process.But even after reluctantly offering to sell some or all TNT assets in these problematic countries, it faces a fight to convince the commission that the buyer will be strong enough to maintain competition levels.These potential hitches threaten to leave the US delivery group with a short timeframe to sell-up and a narrow field of buyers – raising the prospect for UPS of having to offer the assets at fire sale prices to FedEx, its arch US rival.UPS is actively courting other delivery groups, such as France’s DPD. In its submission it proposed to start the formal sale process only after it wins a regulatory green light from Brussels, said people familiar with the offer.But the commission is indicating to UPS that the purchaser’s capabilities will be critical to its decision. This would depend on the buyer taking over a viable business with ownership or access to an air network, which the commission sees as essential for the express delivery market.The takeover reduces the number of global “integrators” – combining ground and air transport – from four to three in the express delivery field.The commission’s investigation, however, found FedEx’s network to be patchy, meaning that the merger would leave a harmful duopoly in many markets. DPD does not own an airline.On Tuesday, Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition chief, said he would not allow a deal leaving some European markets “only with two integrators”. “We want to give way for another integrator,” he said. “It still remains to be seen whether appropriate solutions will ultimately address our concerns for express-parcel deliveries in Europe,” he added.UPS offered to sell entire TNT subsidiaries in 12 countries and promised some asset sales in three other states. Rivals have recently been providing feedback on the package. Most of the assets are in eastern Europe and the package excludes businesses in France, Italy, the UK, and Spain.The commission dropped its initial objections to the deal in some markets after taking account of UPS arguments on the strength of FedEx and potential efficiency benefits from the deal.UPS is promising the buyer space in its aircraft at competitive prices for the next three years. However, as a rule, the commission is cautious about such so-called “access remedies”, which can be complex and hard to enforce.The simplest solution for Brussels would be a sale to FedEx, which owns its own airline. But Mr Almunia has not ruled out the option of a deal to create a new integrator if UPS can show it would not be undermined by relying on another group’s air network.
170;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-11-29T16:57:29Z;Tips on the simple life don’t quite add up;Andrew Hill on ‘The Laws of Subtraction’ by Matthew E. May;"The Laws of Subtraction: 6 Simple Rules for Winning in the Age of Excess Everything
By Matthew E. May, McGraw Hill, $24/£16.99Matthew May has hit upon an attractive theme. Who does not yearn for a guide to simplifying, synthesising and subtracting some of the clutter, overload and demands of the “Age of Excess Everything”, as his subtitle has it? He has also cleverly subtracted from his own workload by inviting others, mostly authors and consultants like him, to contribute about a third of the material for his six laws for doing more with less in the form of summaries of their views.Mind you, it took fellow author Daniel Pink to point out the ap­peal of the subject. “Subtraction is your meme. It’s out there; it’s growing,” he told May just before he took the stage at a corporate conference, urging him to “own” it. “Best. Advice. Ever,” writes May.This exchange is itself a little guide to what the book is like. Not only is it full of people talking in a slightly artificial, visionary way about commonsense ob­jectives, it is also filled with contradictions. “Subtraction is growing” is only the first.The book does contain good examples of the less-is-more theme, some well-known, some less so. May’s opener (illustrating Law Number One: “What isn’t there can often trump what is”) is the FedEx logo, featuring an arrow created by the blank space between the E and X. Lindon Leader, its designer, explains how he “didn’t overplay it, didn’t mention it” when pitching the idea. (He makes up for that here.)May also provides a potted history of how Lockheed Martin located a team of design engineers in a circus tent next to a foul-smelling plastics factory to design a jet fighter: the secret Skunk Works became a byword for how to foster innovation (Law Five: “Break is the important part of breakthrough”). He cites J.K. Rowling, who was inspired for the idea for Harry Potter on a long, boring train journey, in support of Law Six (“Doing something isn’t always better than doing nothing”).My favourite came from contributor Bob Harrison, a retired police chief, who introd­uced an “unplan” to withdraw of­fic­ers directing traffic after a July 4 fireworks display and discovered everyone got home more quickly (Law Two: “The simplest rules create the most effective experience”).But I find every subtractive success story has an additive counterweight, some of which are explicit in May’s examples. It is true that “creativity thrives under intelligent constraints” (Law Four), but Michelangelo – order­ed to work on a fresco for the Sistine Chapel, not a sculpture, his preferred medium – then “expanded the job’s scope”, covering the walls as well as the ceiling. Steve Jobs was a great simplifier, who “handed control to us”, as users of Apple devices. But he was also a control freak when it came to des­igning the same artefacts, supervising fine detail, adding features and forcing his team to work all hours, rather than giving them time for “purposeful daydreaming”, as May ad­vocates elsewhere in his book. The Artist, the silent, black-and-white film that provides May with the book’s “coda”, was a worthy Oscar-winner, but so was 2008’s Slumdog Millionaire, with its cast of thousands and Bollywood-style excess.May does not avoid these contradictions, but he does not really address them, either. He prefers to list examples of his six laws than explore how em­ployers or their staff could reconcile the daily conflict between constraints and freedom, perspiration and inspiration. In the interests of “owning” his Zen-inspired meme, May subtracts these complexities. Instead he offers tips, such as his invitation to take “long, languid showers” – number eight on a list of ways to relax the mind. This point “needs no explanation”, May writes, “which is good, because I could find no research on the subject”.For most people at most companies, where the pressure to add customers, add revenues and add value is intense, it is as difficult to “subtract” as it is for most grown-ups to follow the advice of one of the book’s contributors and live out of a suitcase in a near-empty apartment. It is a pity, given the need to simplify many business processes, that May adds so little to the sum of knowledge about how to do it.Andrew Hill@ft.comThe writer is the FT’s management editor"
171;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-11-14T13:40:54Z;Emirates: next stop, Warsaw;;"By Nicholas Watson of bneEmirates, the Gulf carrier, is preparing a new route from its Dubai hub to Poland and upgrading its connection to Russia by putting Moscow on its Airbus 380 superjumbo flight list.While such an expansion by the world’s largest airline is a vote of confidence in emerging Europe, it’s less good news for the region’s struggling flag carriers that are desperately looking to be rescued by such global airlines.According to Richard Jewsbury, senior vice-president commercial operations for Europe and Russia, Emirates will begin from February a new daily route to the Polish capital of Warsaw, and is now hiring local staff and setting up a call centre.The Emirates number-crunchers regard Poland as a growth market for both passenger and cargo traffic (Emirates is also the world’s second biggest cargo airline after Fedex) given its relatively strong economic performance since the 2008 crisis.“Poland never went into recession following the crisis and while the recession in Europe is having and will have a broader impact on Poland, we still see it very much as a growth market,” Jewsbury says. “There’s a lot of investment going into Poland, so there’s good cargo potential both inbound and out, as well as strong passenger demand inbound and outbound from business and tourism.”Jewsbury adds that Emirates can also take advantage of the fact there’s currently little eastbound long-haul competition out of Poland. “Most of traffic travels over the European hubs, so we bring in a fresh new offering in that it is non-stop to Dubai and then another leg to the long-haul networks of Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, Africa and Australia/New Zealand,” he says.The airline’s other CEE routes, to Prague and Moscow, have already been paying dividends. Emirates’ began a daily passenger/cargo route to Prague in 2010 and has upgraded the daily flight from an Airbus 330 to a Boeing 777, which has an extra 86 seats to take the total to 364.Moscow from December 1 will have one of its two daily flights to Moscow upgraded to an A380 – the double-decker, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner that along with the 777 is becoming the backbone of Emirates’ fleet.But Emirates’ expansion in central and eastern Europe is little comfort for the region’s struggling flag carriers.Emirates’ profits in the six months to September 30 soared 68 per cent and helped boost its cash pile to $4.1bn. But it has no intention of using any of that to rescue any of the region’s struggling airlines. Czech Airlines (CSA), LOT Polish Airlines, Serbia’s JAT Airways, Romania’s Tarom, Latvia’s airBaltic and others are all trying to secure their financial futures and avoid a similar fate to Hungary’s Malev, which collapsed earlier this year.“The short answer is that in my view, for the foreseeable future, I don’t think you will see us doing any M&A because we have to focus all our efforts on our organic growth, whether that be new routes or aircraft upgrades, and that takes all our time and energy,” says Jewsbury.This view appears to be shared by other global airlines. In June, Turkish Airlines halted its interest in buying into LOT, while Emirates’ close competitor Etihad in neighbouring Abu Dhabi appears to be in no rush to take up Serbia’s offer of control of JAT.CSA, which the Czech government said on November 9 it was going to make another stab at selling, looks equally forlorn, with the CEO of Cesky Aeroholding, the parent of CSA, saying bluntly on television in November that the risk of not being able to find a strategic investor at the moment “is higher than 70″.Related reading

172;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-11-04T15:28:24Z;Miners digging hole on mega-projects;Industry makes return on capital employed its lodestar;"Listening to senior mining executives talking about delaying their mega-projects, cutting costs and making return on capital employed their lodestar, one cannot but have a sense of déjà vu.It feels as if all of a sudden the mining industry has boarded a time machine and landed exactly where the oil and gas industry was in the mid-1990s.Big Oil also embraced return on capital employed, or ROCE, as its main – and often sole – metric during the 1990s as crude oil prices fell well below $20 a barrel to a 30-year low of roughly $8 a barrel in 1998. The pressure from Wall Street to deliver returns resulted in a sharp contraction in capital expenditure, which led to a multitude of project cancellations.Over time, less spending translated into lower production growth. Oil supply growth outside the Opec cartel slowed down from roughly 800,000 barrels a day in the early 1990s to less than 300,000 b/d by the end of the decade. Shareholders celebrated as lower supply boosted prices and profits; consumers, from drivers at the pump to fuel-intensive companies such as FedEx, felt the pain.The mining industry is now taking the same route as the oil industry nearly two decades ago – and the results will be similar. “The real problem of capital discipline is that it will increase the cost [of commodities] to consumers by bringing less supply to the market,” says Mark Cutifani, chief executive of precious metals miner AngloGold Ashanti.The message from many executives at the recent LME Week, the largest gathering of the mining and metals sector, was simple: yes, we are cutting spending, and yes, we will produce less in the future; we agree that this is bad for consumers but we are here to deliver for our shareholders.The industry, thus, is slowly dumping its traditional metrics of production growth and number of high-profile projects, in favour of Wall Street’s success indicators, free cash flow and ROCE.Gone are the days when mining companies proudly showed investors the so-called “bubble chart” in their presentations packages, a graphical representation of the size of their new mega-projects. The “bubble chart” first moved to the appendix of the presentations, only to be showed if an investor asked for it. Nowadays, it has all but disappeared completely.The change comes as metals and minerals prices weaken. Yet the industry is far from suffering the ultra-low prices that Big Oil weathered in the late 1990s.The new focus will have important consequences for the mining industry and the commodities market, particularly in the second part of this decade. The natural resources industry is like a big vessel: it takes a long time to brake or change direction. As such, most projects already in the works will be unaffected, and supply growth for commodities such as copper, zinc and iron ore is, more or less, guaranteed for the next three years. But beyond 2015-16, the outlook for supply growth looks under threat.Over the past few weeks, miners have announced cancellations and delays of mega-projects from BHP Billiton’s copper and uranium mine of Olympic Dam in Australia to Vale’s projected Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea. In turn, mining groups are increasingly focusing on expanding their existing assets – known in the industry’s jargon as brownfield projects – instead of developing large new mines from scratch.Brownfield projects are generally much cheaper, but they also add far less supply growth. Greenfield projects, on the other hand, are expensive, difficult to manage and often take much longer than expected to develop. But their upside is a much bigger production increase.Not all miners are fully convinced about the wisdom of dumping greenfield developments, as a closed-door debate among some of the most senior executives of the sector during the LME Week showed. At the debate, hosted by US fund manager BlackRock, executives like Ivan Glasenberg, head of Glencore, knocked heads with others, including Mike Henry, a senior executive at BHP Billiton, and Donald Lindsay, chief executive of Teck Resources of Canada, about what is the best way to spend capital.Nonetheless, the message from shareholders about a focus on ROCE at the cost of supply growth is filtering through. The recent resignation of Cynthia Carroll as chief executive of Anglo American, in part because of overspending and delays in greenfield projects, could convince other executives to stick to their easier, cheaper and smaller brownfield projects. Just as Big Oil did in the mid 1990s, shareholders will get their way, consumers will pay the price.Javier Blas is the Financial Times’ Commodities Editorjavier.blas@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"
173;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-10-25T22:49:52Z;Apple: bucking the China doom and gloom;;"There wasn’t much in Apple’s Q4 results about China. But what few snippets there were to be found were revealing.In an earnings season that has already seen a number US companies, including Dow Chemical, DuPont, 3M, FedEx, Caterpillar and Alcoa, blame faltering demand in China for their weak earnings, Apple has managed to buck the trend.Full-year country revenue totalled $23.8bn, a 79 per cent increase from the $13.3bn earned in 2011. China now accounts for 15 per cent of Apple’s total sales, making it the iPhone maker’s second biggest market after the US.As Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said:“We continue to see [China] as an extremely exciting market.”No kidding.True – Apple on Thursday issued a warning on its earnings in the next quarter. But that is due to: 1) a shorter December quarter compared to 2011 and 2) the fact that the company has launched a large number of new products, many of which are being sold on thinner margins than the company’s average, rather than any weaknesses in underlying sales in China.That said, those Q4 figures, while mighty impressive in light of China’s ongoing economic slowdown, do raise questions over how sustainable this blistering pace of growth is.Revenue from China for the three months to end of September was $5.7bn, unchanged from Q3 and still down from the massive $7.9bn recorded in Q2. But as beyondbrics pointed out at the time, those Q2 numbers were given a serious boost by Apple’s iPhone 4S launch on China Unicom and China Telecom.During the Q3 earnings call back in July, Cook said the quarterly numbers were adversely affected by the delay in the launch of the latest iPad, which came too late to be included in the Q3 results.So it is curious that we did not see an uplift from those iPad sales in the Q4 numbers.Q1 should offer more insight on how well the cult of Apple (and general Chinese consumer spending) is holding up. Apple said it planned to launch the iPhone 5 in China sometime in December. If there is one that the earnings season in the US has shown us so far, it is that construction activities are down and out in China. We will have to wait another quarter before we see whether high-end consumer goods will suffer as well.Related reading:

174;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-10-23T21:57:27Z;UPS reaffirms guidance in tough market;;"United Parcel Service, the express package operator, stuck with its guidance for fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday in what it said was a mark of confidence in its ability to operate successfully amid the worldwide economic slowdown.The company narrowed the range of its guidance for diluted earnings per share for 2012 to $4.55 to $4.65 from $4.50 to $4.70 previously. Kurt Kuehn, finance director, said the narrowing was a sign that the company had more confidence and clarity about where it was heading. Most Wall Street analysts had pitched their forecasts towards the lower end of the old range, he said.“It’s perceived, I think, as a sign of confidence that will manifest itself in full-year results somewhere between 5 and 7 per cent above 2011,” Mr Kuehn said.The revised guidance numbers announced alongside UPS’s third-quarter figures sent the company’s shares up 3 per cent to $73.73.Net earnings for the quarter were down 56 per cent to $469m, on revenue up 1.2 per cent to $7.86bn. Net income would have been down only 4 per cent to $1.03bn excluding a $559m non-cash, after-tax charge for restructuring of its US pension liabilities.FedEx, UPS’s main rival in the US express parcel market, cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 31 in September when it announced its earnings for the quarter to August 31.Scott Davis, chief executive, said UPS’s strong results had been achieved in an environment of slowing global trade and changing market dynamics.“This not only highlights the flexibility of our business model; it illustrates the breadth of the UPS product portfolio in meeting the needs of customers,” he said.FedEx had said when it announced its figures that, as world economic growth slowed, customers were switching from moving goods by fast but expensive modes such as Fedex’s express parcel business to slower modes such as truck and sea. FedEx has since announced a shift to focus more on those modes.Mr Kuehn said UPS had seen some customers make similar switches to slower modes. But a more important shift for UPS was away from movements of large quantities of packages moving between businesses towards handling movements of one or two packages at a time between businesses and consumers.“It puts greater pressure on our routing, our optimisation and our networks,” Mr Kuehn said. “It’s an area that creates new constraints [on the business’ operations].”US domestic package revenue rose 1.4 per cent to $7.86bn on package volumes up 4 per cent to 13.2m. Operating profits fell to $129m from $1.05bn in last year’s third quarter but would have been $1.02bn without the $896m effect of the pension restructuring before tax rebates.International package revenues fell 3.7 per cent to $2.94bn, on flat volumes of 2.3m. Operating profits rose 7.7 per cent to $449m."
175;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-10-22T23:05:08Z;Caterpillar: what about China?;;"Is Caterpillar being overly optimistic about its China operations?Even as one US company after another – ranging from Alcoa to FedEx and McDonald’s – sounded the alarm over the impact of China’s slowing growth on demand for their products, Caterpillar appeared relatively sanguine.The earthmoving equipment manufacturer, which on Monday cut its full-year profits forecast sharply, had this to say about China in its Q3 results statement (emphasis ours):From an economic standpoint, we are expecting slightly better world growth in 2013 with modest improvement in the United States, China and most of the developing world, but continuing difficulty in Europe…This despite admitting in a call with analysts that:…China has continued to be pretty weak. In fact, I would say that’s one of the reasons why our finished inventory hasn’t come down. Maybe a little bit faster. You know, we were thinking we would start seeing at least a little bit of a pick up here in the fourth quarter. Within the economy there, they are going to accelerate some infrastructure spend. Now they have taken monetary policy easing, sentiment on the ground from the dealers is a bit better but in terms of translating it into sales, I would say that hasn’t happened yet.Little surprise then that, Stephen Weiss of Short Hills Capital took Caterpillar to task for its forecast that 2013 sales and revenues would be roughly the same as 2012 plus or minus 5 per cent.Weiss thinks China could be a bigger challenge than the company might realise.“They are getting killed in price-cutting in China,” he told CNBC. You can buy an excavator for $4,700 and ship it here. It’s about half of what Cat is charging.”Having previously forecast growth of 5 to 10 per cent earlier this year, Caterpillar now expects sales for construction equipment in China to decline this year. It didn’t provide a breakout on China sales except that they “remained weak” and “below the third quarter of 2011.”China matters. Although sales from the country accounted for just 3 per cent of the $60.1bn in sales made by Caterpillar last year, the company has betted big on the future of the world’s second largest economy. It has spent heavily to build up manufacturing capacity there in recent years. It has 16 manufacturing facilities in the country – the most recent of which opened only last month – with nine more under construction. Only last November, it splashed out $886m to buy ERA Mining Machinery, a Chinese manufacturer of underground coal-mining equipment.So Monday’s statements from Caterpillar on its China operations leave a lot to be desired in terms of clarity.On the one hand, the group says:…we are encouraged by recent actions that the Chinese government has taken to improve growth. They have lowered bank reserve requirements, increased infrastructure investment and have cut interest rates. We expect they will continue to ease policy to help improve growth in their economy. Those actions will likely lead to better growth in the construction industry in 2013.Yet at the same time it concedes that:While we have reduced production in China substantially, we have not seen an improvement in sales yet, and, as a result, the inventory reduction in China is slower than we had expected.Our plans for the remainder of 2012 reflect a continued orderly ramp down of production that considers our entire supply chain in China. Given the current low rate of sales and the production ramp down, it will likely take the rest of 2012 and continuing into 2013 to reduce inventory to levels more in line with sales.So which is it? Is the construction industry in China bouncing back? If that is the case, why the need to continue to “ramp down” production? Beyondbrics suspects Caterpillar itself doesn’t really know.Related reading:

176;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx shifts focus to ground transport;;Fred Smith, founder and chief executive of FedEx, has outlined plans to boost the ground services of the second-largest express package operator by revenues and refocus the company’s core air express business to improve profitability.Mr Smith told the company’s investors’ and lenders’ meeting in Memphis on Tuesday that the company had to strike a balance between growing volumes and achieving the best possible yield for each package. In a significant change of tack, he told them that cost reductions were now key to achieving the company’s financial goals.FedEx warned on September 18 when announcing its quarterly results that it expected its earnings for the year to May 31 2013 to be $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share, down from $6.90 to $7.40 previously. It blamed customers’ tendency, amid weak global trade growth, to divert goods from expensive means of transport– such as FedEx’s express package air services – to cheaper forms, such as global container shipping services.The company’s overall strategy was closely tied to “effective yield management”, Mr Smith planned to say.“We want FedEx Express to focus on high-yield, long-distance shipping, particularly international, while FedEx Ground and Freight provide best-in-class service for items that can meet customer requirements via surface transport,” his prepared speech said.The company plans through the greater focus on ground transport and cutbacks in express, combined with more effective information technology systems, to achieve $1.7bn in profitability improvements by 2015. The savings should improve Fedex’s operating profit margins – 7.5 per cent in the year to May 31 2012 – to 10 per cent annually.“With slow economic growth, the cost-reduction programmes . . . are essential to achieve our financial goals,” he planned to say.Under the new strategy, FedEx is likely in the US to cut back on the number of flights it operates and to focus more heavily on moving goods by truck and, in some cases, by rail. Since FedEx earns higher margins for its ground movements than the core express business, the shift is not expected to harm margins.The company said Tuesday that David Rebholz, chief executive of FedEx Ground, would be retiring next May.Mr Smith said that door-to-door express air freight services such as FedEx’s were gaining market share from traditional airport-to-airport air cargo services. The air cargo market was not growing overall, however.The cost of fuel, the lower value-per-pound of electronic products and improving sea container services were also shifting some international freight to container shipping, he said.Fedex's plans mark the latest effort by the international logistics industry to adjust to significant market changes in the wake of the international financial crisis. Companies are typically carrying lower inventories, making demand for transport services volatile as demand swings. There are also signs that companies are bringing some production back to low-cost countries near big consumer markets such as Turkey or Mexico, or to significant consumer markets such as the United States.
177;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-10-08T21:41:33Z;Global expansion plan lifts UnitedHealth;;UnitedHealth Group’s shares rose after the US health insurer said it would expand its international business by acquiring a 90 per cent stake in Amil Participacoes, a leading Brazilian health insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9bn.The planned takeover, announced on Monday, comes as companies in the US health industry have looked to consolidate or to expand their business outside the country as new regulations from President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law take hold.UnitedHealth, the largest US insurer by revenues, already operates in Portugal, India and the Middle East through joint ventures. Amil provided health coverage to 5.8m customers in Brazil and had sales of $9.81bn in 2011.Shares in UnitedHealth rose as much as 2 per cent in the morning session before paring early gains to close 0.8 per cent higher at $57.60.Last month, the company replaced Kraft on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to become the only health insurer on the Big Board.Aetna, a rival health insurer, purchased Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn in August, uniting the US providers. Aetna shares gained 1 per cent to $42.08.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 14 per cent to $92.30 in after-market trading as the maker of cardiovascular equipment said sales for the third quarter would fall short of market expectations.During market hours, the S&P 500 healthcare sector dropped 0.1 per cent as Wall Street braced for the start of what is expected to be the poorest US quarterly earnings period since late 2009.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.35 per cent to 1,455.88, coming off a week that saw equities rise to their best intraday level for the year.Alcoa shares closed 0.3 per cent higher to $9.12 as the economic bellwether prepared to start the third-quarter reporting season with its results on Tuesday. Its results will be followed by two of the nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, later in the week.Wells Fargo lost 0.1 per cent to $35.81, while JPMorgan Chase fell 0.1 per cent to $41.66. The S&P 500 financial sector declined 0.1 per cent.Analysts have forecast that company earnings for the three-month period to September will register their first negative result in 11 quarters. On Monday, some investors wondered whether the situation could worsen after the third-quarter results have been reported.Sam Stovall, equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said: “The primary focus of participants on company conference calls, in our opinion, will be finding out if third-quarter results will indeed be the trough in this earnings cycle and if forward quarters will exhibit a gradual acceleration in growth.”He added: “The strong performances of the S&P 500 and its sectors since June, in which the [index] gained more than 11 per cent in price, led by the cyclical sectors at the expense of the defensive ones, may be a preamble to the coming turn in the earnings tide.”Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 0.2 per cent to 5,057.055. Two of its constituents, FedEx and UPS, have already warned that their results for the full year will be worse than initially expected. FedEx shares dropped 0.1 per cent to $86.37, while UPS rose 0.9 per cent to $73.76.In what many consider a sign of the macroeconomic difficulties challenging many US companies, the Dow Transports have gained just 0.7 per cent since the start of the year. That compares with a 15.8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 in the same period.The S&P 500’s gains have been bolstered by constituents such as Apple, which is up more than 58 per cent since the start of the year.Apple shares, however, were 2.2 per cent lower at $638.16 as information technology stocks were among the day’s worst performing sector groups and lost 1.1 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.8 per cent to 3,112.35, but Netflix shares continued to gain momentum. It rose 10.5 per cent to $73.52 as analysts at Morgan Stanley said that its shares were undervalued.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,583.65.American Express shares rose 0.4 per cent to $58.82. The payment services company said on Monday it would team with Walmart to provide lower-income customers who may not have a bank account with a prepaid debit card. Walmart shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $75.25.
178;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-10-07T16:03:55Z;Slowdown set to take toll on US earnings;;The slowdown in the global economy and anaemic US recovery is expected to result in one of the worst US quarterly earnings seasons since late 2009.Analysts expect earnings for the period ended September to decline, the first negative result after 11 consecutive quarters of gains.Energy and materials companies are tipped to lead the downturn with the financial sector set to be one of the few bright spots.Wall Street analysts expect third-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will fall 2.7 per cent versus the same quarter a year ago, according to FactSet. Just three months ago analysts had forecast growth of 1.9 per cent.In the past three months, warnings from large companies about reduced full-year profits due to global economic weakness fuelled this pessimistic view.FedEx and UPS, often seen as barometers for world economic health, cut their full-year guidance during their last earnings releases, citing the slowdown in global trade.In August, talking to the Financial Times, the chief executive of Caterpillar, bellwether of the industrial economy, warned of the greater uncertainty about global growth, predicting it could take another five years before Europe’s economy begins to grow.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said: “We expect corporate profits will be negative and revenues soft, as the global slowdown and below average economic growth in the US has affected companies.”The earnings season starts with Alcoa reporting on Tuesday, followed by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday.However, downbeat earnings expectations are yet to weigh on the broad market with the S&P 500 up more than 16 per cent so far this year. Stock prices are being supported by the Federal Reserve buying large amounts of bonds, which lowers interest rates and boosts the attractiveness of riskier assets such as equities.“If we see that the markets do not correct even after earnings disappoint and guidance gets worse, then it will be clear that fundamentals have given way to the Fed,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.Equity investors are also looking beyond the most recent quarter toward the final quarter of the year given the expectation that profits will rebound. S&P 500 companies are on course for record cash profits for 2012.That outlook may suffer from downward revisions should companies express caution about their future earnings in their results in the coming weeks.“Even with lowered expectations, earnings could disappoint and place stocks under pressure,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “It’s worrying to see the warnings from Fed Ex and other weakness from the transport sector that suggests this will not be a good quarter.”Financials are expected to be one of the few bright spots with analysts expecting earnings growth for the quarter of 10 per cent according to FactSet.Ahead of earnings season, companies tend to downplay expectations and look to surprise the market with better results.“We expect more upside surprises in the third quarter, primarily because consumer health is in a good shape and with 80 per cent of companies tied to consumers their earnings will be better than the consensus estimate,” said Phil Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated.
179;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-09-23T18:18:12Z;Romney and the big global economic risk;;Mitt Romney’s excoriation of the “47 per cent” of the US population who pay no federal income tax is alarming. It is a symptom of perhaps the greatest risk now facing the world economy.US politics always have a profound impact on business throughout the world. This year, however, the effects are not quite as might be expected. Even if, individually, many powerful investors loathe President Barack Obama, the collective result of their investment decisions suggests that his policies have not troubled them. Neither does the prospect of his re-election.The US stock market has doubled since it hit bottom only weeks into the Obama presidency. That rally has proceeded this year – even as the odds on an Obama victory have risen, recently topping 70 per cent, according to prediction markets.Looking at the most politically sensitive stocks, the bet has been on for a while that the president will get another term. According to S&P 500 sub-indices, healthcare facilities (a sector with much to gain from an Obama victory) has beaten coal and consumable resources (a prime beneficiary of his defeat) by 136 per cent since December last year.So Mr Romney’s offensive comments need not in themselves worry investors. The critical question is the so-called “fiscal cliff”– the package of tax rises and spending cuts that will come into force in January, unless a “lame duck” Congress can thrash out a deal with the White House between the election and Christmas.If everyone plays brinkmanship and loses, those measures would probably provoke a recession. Business’ concern is that some deal is struck. Ideology is secondary.Brokers’ research departments are producing research on the game theory of different electoral combinations – and tending to hold that the status quo, with the Democrats holding the Senate and Republicans the House, would make it relatively hard to thrash out a deal.But this now seems the likely outcome. Having once been confident that the Democrats would lose, the Intrade prediction market puts their chance of victory in the Senate at about 80 per cent – much the same as the GOP’s chance of holding the House.And, even if this has not dented asset prices, the uncertainty caused by the cliff is having an effect.Companies are talking down their prospects ahead of the next quarterly corporate reporting season at a rate not seen since 2001. Bellwether logistics groups such as Norfolk Southern and FedEx this week announced gloomy profit outlooks. Uncertainty is affecting activity.This is why Mr Romney’s now notorious gaffe is concerning. The philosophy he espoused is symptomatic of an intolerant strain that has taken over US politics in the last two decades – and could vitiate any chance of a sensible deal on the “cliff”.Mr Romney’s statistic was roughly correct. About 47 per cent of Americans do not pay federal income tax, although most of them do pay other taxes – on payrolls or on sales, for example – which tend to be more regressive. What is startling is his implication that this is unhealthy.That so many Americans do not need to trouble the Internal Revenue Service is down in part to victories by previous generations of Republican tax-cutters. The Earned Income Tax Credit– which helps many poorer working Americans to avoid paying any income tax – was introduced in 1975 under Gerald Ford. It was widened in 1986, as a central element in the “grand bargain” on simplifying the tax code that President Reagan thrashed out with Democrats in Congress.Reagan called it “the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.”It was not just good politics. It satisfied demands for both equity and economic efficiency, by creating greater incentives to work for the poorest. As the poor are more likely to spend extra income than the wealthy, it also provided more of a Keynesian-style boost to the US economy.Using allowances to lift more people out of tax altogether is good economics and politics, and is not unique to the US. The UK’s Conservative governments of the last two decades have also followed this policy.Ultimately, the “47 per cent” statistic is testament to a sensible compromise that emerged from tough bipartisan negotiations – in which principled taxcutters took a leading role. Such negotiations are needed again in the next months to avert falling over the fiscal cliff.But Mr Romney’s comments suggest that this will be difficult. A dominant faction within the Republican party, it appears, believes that lifting the working poor out of income tax cultivates dependency.This dogmatic tendency is strong. While such ideas persist, it will be hard for the US to reach a sensible “grand bargain” on tax like the one that President Reagan oversaw in 1986.How sad. And how alarming.john.authers@ft.com
180;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US transport stocks signal deeper slowdown;;A downturn in US transportation stocks is indicating a deeper slowdown in the global economy and suggesting that the broader market rally has more to do with central bank action than fundamental strength from corporate America.While the S&P 500 is up 16.4 per cent so far this year, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, whose constituents are viewed as a harbinger for the health of the economy, just suffered its steepest weekly decline for the year and is now down 2.2 per cent since the start of January.Historically, investors have closely watched divergences between the broad market and Dow Transports, but that relationship for now appears overshadowed by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to lower bond yields and indirectly boost equity prices.“The Dow Transports is a critical gauge,” said Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services. “While it is not the only one, it is a very important measure because of its deep connection with economic activity, and it is telling us is that there are plenty of reasons to be concerned.”Concerns are growing that share prices are vulnerable to a pullback given the backdrop of a weakening global economy and uncertainty associated with the US election and the “fiscal cliff”.“It’s a strange moment in the market,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Usually after a run in the S&P 500 like this, more people would be saying there’s room for stocks to move higher, instead investors are wondering when the pullback will come.”Not helping matters are downgrades of corporate profit forecasts, with analysts predicting that the upcoming third quarter reporting season will be the weakest since the height of the financial crisis.These worries have been exacerbated by a deterioration in expectations from companies in the Dow Transports, which are highly sensitive to developments in the global economy.A profit warning last week from Norfolk Southern, the second-largest railroad company in the eastern US, cemented those concerns and reverberated across the sector. The company said falling coal demand and decreased shipments of completed merchandise hurt its business in the third quarter.The statement echoed worries expressed by FedEx, the global delivery company, which lowered its full-year outlook last week and said demand for its premium shipment service has slipped as macroeconomic conditions have hit its customers.Even a fall in oil prices, which touched their lowest levels in six weeks last Thursday, failed to boost the Dow Transports, which includes several major US airlines.“If people aren’t moving stuff globally, it’s going to show up in their results,” Michael Gapen, senior US economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays.Still, some analysts say that even when weak earnings are factored, US stock valuations remain attractive to investors. In addition, they said the Fed’s measures may push interest rates even lower, further limiting the appeal of other asset classes that have been popular with investors this year, such as corporate bonds.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

But shares in the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues recorded gains on Tuesday, edging 0.3 per cent higher to $23.37. The shares have fallen just 3.6 per cent since the start of the year.Apple shares, meanwhile, continued their rise and crossed the $700 mark for the first time during market hours.Customers are expecting to receive the company’s latest smartphone, the iPhone5, this week. Shares in Apple, which rose as high as $702.33, closed up 0.3 per cent to $701.91.Overall, energy and financial sector stocks were the day’s leading decliners as US equities finished with their second consecutive session of losses.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.1 per cent to 1,459.32 as the energy index lost 0.9 per cent and financials declined 0.7 per cent.A recent fall in commodity prices appeared to hit natural resource-based companies as Marathon Petroleum dropped 2.9 per cent to $52.07.Natural gas and oil refiner Phillips 66 lost 1.3 per cent to $45.52.Etrade, the retail broker, lost 1.4 per cent to $9.39 while some of the country’s largest banks saw more limited losses. Citigroup shares declined 0.4 per cent to $33.94 and Morgan Stanley fell 1 per cent to $17.63.The S&P 500 appeared to have lost some of the momentum that helped it reach multiyear highs last week after the Federal Reserve said it would extend its market intervention to stimulate the US economy.The benchmark index has fallen 0.4 per cent for the week.FedEx shares dropped in spite of reporting better than expected quarterly results as the package delivery company warned that a global slowdown would hurt its business.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $86.55 as the company said it was cutting its full-year outlook after beating analyst expectations for net income in the first quarter.FedEx blamed global economic weakness for a shift in customer preferences to cheaper sources for shipments of goods.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 13,564.64.Boeing rose 0.8 per cent to $70.45 as analysts at Credit Suisse said they believed the consensus forecasts for its 2013 sales were too high.“We think orders will slow as [year-on-year] comparables are tough, most airlines are already in the book and we will not see a new product soon enough to spur activity,” they said.Dole Food Company rose as much as 6.6 per cent as the fruit producer and distributor said it would sell part of its business to Japan’s Itochu.But the announcement of the sale, with funds expected to be used to help the company reduce its debt and lower its costs, failed to keep its share price higher for much longer than the morning session.Dole shares had retreated from their earlier highs, finishing 0.7 per cent higher at $13.80.Walgreen shares declined 0.1 per cent to $35.66, in spite of the pharmacy chain’s announcement that it expected to realise about $1bn in synergies by 2016 from its recently acquired stake in Alliance Boots.Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond dropped 3.4 per cent to $68.39 as it was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Oppenheimer.DirecTV, the satellite television operator, declined 1.4 per cent to $53.44 as a Bloomberg report said it was among several companies considering a bid for GVT, a Brazilian phone operator.
183;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-09-18T14:03:50Z;FedEx warns on slowing global trade;;FedEx, the express parcel and logistics operator, cut its guidance for the full financial year on Tuesday, warning that economic weakness was reducing world trade and pushing customers to send goods by cheaper transport modes.The reduction in its earnings estimate– to $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share, from $6.90 to $7.40 previously – came as the company announced net income for the three months to August 31 fell 1 per cent from $459m last year. Revenue increased 3 per cent to $10.8bnFedEx also cut its second-quarter forecast to $1.30 to $1.45 per diluted share, against $1.57 in last year’s second quarter.However, earnings for the quarter were slightly better than expected in the wake of the company’s September 4 warning that earnings per diluted share for the quarter would be between $1.37 and $1.43 per diluted share, against $1.45 to $1.60 previously. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.45, against $1.46 in last year’s first quarter.Fred Smith, chief executive, said that over the last 25 years global trade had generally grown faster than the world economy but that during the past few months that process had broken down.He said: “That’s what is really going on – that exports and trade have gone down at a faster rate than GDP.”In response to a question about whether the launches of high-profile consumer products such as the iPhone 5 – which tend to move by air – would help the company, Mr Smith said FedEx was handling a “huge amount” of that traffic.But he added that prices for many electronic products were falling while fuel prices were rising.“You have products that are getting lower in value per pound, which is the key correlation for goods being moved by air,” Mr Smith said. “So they’re going by water on the improved container liner system that’s been developed over the last few years.”FedEx shares fell 2.4 per cent to $87.12 on Tuesday morning in New York.In the key FedEx Express business, the shift towards lower-value transport modes and falling demand reduced operating income 28 per cent to $207m on revenue up 1 per cent to $6.63bn.The move to cheaper services pushed operating income at FedEx Ground up 9 per cent to $445m on revenue, up 8 per cent to $2.46bn. Operating income for FedEx Freight, the company’s logistics operation, rose to $90m from $42m, on revenue up 5 per cent to $1.4bn.Mr Smith said that, despite the weak demand, FedEx Express’s door-to-door services were capturing volumes from traditional airport-to-airport air cargo operators, which have suffered heavily during the economic downturn.
184;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-09-17T19:51:55Z;Earnings roll over – pessimists abound;Still plenty of room for further downward revision;"Equity investors would like to buy when revenue growth is accelerating. Failing that, expanding margins are good. If that’s too much to ask, they will accept low valuations. Right now they are settling for none of the above.Analysts are projecting earnings growth for the S&P 500 to decline in the third quarter, the first negative reading in three years, according to S&P Capital IQ. Companies across sectors have cut sales guidance in recent months; Intel and FedEx are two of the most prominent pessimists on the list. We won’t be seeing sales growth above 11 per cent on the index, as we did last year, any time soon.Margins on the S&P, which hit an all-time high in the third quarter of last year, are falling, but remain near the peak – leaving plenty of room to revert to historical means. While the market’s trailing price/earnings ratio, at 14, is not historically high, the cyclically adjusted P/E is at 23, putting it below its level of the 2000 and 1929 manias, but high against almost any other point of comparison.Despite analysts’ pessimism about the current quarter, there is still plenty of room for further downward revision. The expectation is for earnings to come bouncing right back. Wall Street is looking for 10 per cent growth on index earnings in the fourth quarter and 12 per cent for 2013. A look at historical data on earnings growth makes this seem unlikely: quarters with negative earnings usually appear in bunches.Perhaps the most horrifying thing about the current combination of sales deceleration, margin contraction and high valuations is that it might not even be a sell signal. The central banks of the US and Europe may well keep investors trapped in risky assets indefinitely.

During the latest reporting season S&P 500 groups were three times more likely to say they would miss analysts’ expectations of third-quarter earnings than beat them. That was the worst guidance ratio since the final quarter of 2008, immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Historically, we have only seen numbers like this during times of recession,” said Christine Short, who tracks earnings at S&P Capital IQ. “It tells you something about how American executives see the world.”Several leading US companies have been warning of their vulnerability to a global economic slowdown with the eurozone on the edge of recession and deteriorating data in China.Manufacturer Honeywell saw a contraction of growth in its short-cycle businesses of orders for immediate delivery in Europe and China in the second quarter.Chief executive David Cote bemoaned a “challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe” as he issued a third-quarter forecast that only just met analysts’ expectations.Twenty-four technology companies have guided expectations below analysts’ previous forecasts for the third quarter, including Apple, whose chief executive Tim Cook said flat performance in Europe had “really hampered our total results”.Other blue-chip US companies have been scaling back guidance issued to investors just a few months ago.On Friday, chipmaker Intel lowered its forecast for third-quarter revenue by almost 8 per cent from its July estimate, blaming “weaker than expected demand”.Three days earlier FedEx, the express delivery company, cut earnings guidance for its recently completed quarter by 8 per cent from its June forecast, pointing to “weakness in the global economy”.Sales outside the US account for almost a third of revenues of S&P 500 companies, while in the technology sector the figure is over 50 per cent, according to FactSet.Since the financial crisis, US companies have prospered despite patchy global growth, with those on the S&P 500 reporting eight consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth from the end of 2009, largely as a result of cost-cutting.But with margins now near record levels but showing little sign of further growth, US companies need increased sales to drive further profit increases.“Flat margins mean that earnings will be driven by revenue growth,” David Kostin, chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs told clients last week. “[But] macro headwinds should persist, constraining revenues through 2013.”Consensus estimates are for S&P 500 earnings growth to rebound in the fourth quarter and into 2013, although some analysts are now reassessing those forecasts too.According to S&P Capital IQ, 72 companies in the S&P 500 said third-quarter earnings will miss consensus analyst expectations, the most since the third quarter of 2009. Just 22 S&P 500 companies said they expect to beat analyst forecasts this year, the fewest since the company started collecting data in 2006.Nearly 400 companies did not offer any guidance at all, suggesting uncertainty about future growth prospects, the most since the third quarter of 2009.

This piece has been modified since first publication to reflect the fact that the top end of Honeywell’s guidance of $1.10 to $1.15 in third-quarter earnings per share met the consensus analyst forecast of $1.15."

David Brown, the chief market strategist at Sabrient Systems, said continuing deterioration in the eurozone would not just weigh on global demand for the goods and services of US companies, but could also lead to the dollar strengthening against the euro, hurting exporters.Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index in the second quarter has been almost flat compared with the same period last year.With a significant majority of second-quarter results now in, analysts are forecasting year-on-year earnings growth of just 0.85 per cent, which would be the lowest growth rate since the third quarter of 2009.In a further sign of the vulnerability of US companies to weak global growth, shares in FedEx fell 2 per cent lower to $85.80 after the package delivery company sharply lowered quarterly earnings estimates on Tuesday, citing “weakness in the global economy”.Credit Suisse analysts lowered their price target and suggested clients should not buy the stock, even though FedEx has said it is planning a restructuring programme to boost profitability.“Restructuring efforts generally signal that the underlying business is deteriorating; thus, we prefer to wait on the sidelines for now,” Christopher Ceraso told Credit Suisse clients.FedEx is considered a bellwether for the global economy because of its role in shipping goods for companies, and other freight and delivery companies also lost ground.United Parcel Service, one of FedEx’s main rivals, lost 2.4 per cent to $71.94.Safeway shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $16.50 after the supermarket group said it would sell a minority stake in its Blackhawk Network Holding business via an initial public offering of shares.The pre-payment card business generates at least $100m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Safeway.Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Janney, said the Blackhawk business could be worth almost $1bn and would likely trade at a premium to industry peers because of its “niche” position in the industry.Shares in the education company DeVry climbed 5.2 per cent to $20.20 after it announced it would buy back up to $100m of shares.Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $3.51 after UBS analysts lowered their price target on the stock, arguing that the growth of tablets and ultrabook computers will hit sales of personal computers, which AMD supplies with processor chips.Goldman Sachs rose 3.3 per cent to $109.94, outperforming as financials in the S&P 500 index were generally flat.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.2 per cent to 3,069.27. Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, declined 0.7 per cent as investors awaited the iPhone makers latest iterations of its popular mobile device.Shares in Facebook bounced 4.8 per cent to $18.58, having hit a fresh low of $17.55 on Tuesday. Investment bank Jefferies initiated coverage on the social network with a bullish outlook."
187;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-09-04T23:04:34Z;FedEx earnings outlook cut sharply;;FedEx shares fell nearly 3 per cent in after-market trading after the world’s largest express parcel service by revenues sharply cut its guidance on earnings for its just-completed first quarter, citing global economic weakness.FedEx and UPS, its rival express package delivery company, are often seen as barometers for world economic health because of their role in facilitating goods movements worldwide.The company downgraded its guidance for earnings during the quarter to August 31 to $1.37 to $1.43 per diluted share, against its previous guidance of $1.45 to $1.60. Last year’s first-quarter earnings were $1.46.“Earnings during the quarter were lower than originally forecast, as weakness in the global economy constrained revenue growth at FedEx Express more than expected in the earlier guidance,” the company said.The announcement – made after the New York market close on Tuesday – sent the shares down to $84.80 or 3.1 per cent. Shares in UPS also fell by 2 per cent to $72.21.FedEx in June had already sounded pessimistic when announcing its fourth-quarter results– for the three months to May 31. It said then that it was seeking to cut costs after it announced a 1.4 per cent year-on-year fall in quarterly profits and a fall in volumes. It warned that global economic uncertainty – including the eurozone crisis and slowing growth in Asia – could hit its results for the present year.FedEx gave no details as to which area’s weakness had depressed the first-quarter results but most international companies have reported much the biggest slow-down in demand in Europe as a result of the euro crisis. FedEx has around 10 per cent of the European express parcel market, behind DHL, the market leader, and TNT Express, which UPS is in the course of acquiring. FedEx is number two in the Asian express parcel market, behind DHL.FedEx and UPS together are some of the most important forces in the US domestic parcel market.Express parcel operators can be particularly sensitive to any market downturn because of their important role in replenishing the stocks of companies that find inventories suddenly lower. When inventories start to grow during a slowdown, demand for express services to replenish them can fall sharply.FedEx said it had not yet closed its books for the quarter and that it would make further information available on September 18, when it published its quarterly results. In June, FedEx announced net income for the year to May 31 of $2.03bn on $42.7bn revenue.

Banks on the eurozone’s periphery and in France led declines, just as they led the index higher in the wake of the ECB president’s comments last week.Crédit Agricole was off 8.0 per cent to €3.28 in Paris, UniCredit was down 7.3 per cent to €2.57 in Milan and Banco Popular lost 7.9 per cent to €1.41 in Madrid. Commerzbank fell 6.2 per cent to €1.20 in Berlin for the biggest fall on the Dax.The statement sent markets lower because “it signals that it will take some time for the ECB’s action to materialise. In effect the fastest institution in the eurozone has tied itself to one of the slowest,” wrote Nick Kounis of ABN Amro.The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,055.34, erasing gains of as much as 1 per cent following Mr Draghi’s comments. Spain’s Ibex was off 5.2 per cent at 6,373.4 and Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 4.6 per cent to 13,282.55.Veolia Environnement was the heaviest faller on the Eurofirst 300 after the French utility missed expectations.The shares fell 11.7 per cent to €8.15 after the French provider of waste, water and energy services said it would be cutting more investment and costs to deal with a worsening economy in Italy and France. The company’s waste and recycling businesses were hit by a slowdown in industrial production.Bank of America downgraded the shares to “neutral”, citing weak trends in underlying earnings and uncertainty over possible writedowns.In Paris the CAC 40 lost 2.7 per cent to 3,232.46 and all its constituents fell. Germany’s Xetra Dax index slid 2.2 per cent to 6,606.09.Rising demand in Asia led Deutsche Post to lift its target for 2012 profit by about €100m.The upbeat note from the provider of DHL services contrasted with more gloomy statements recently from UPS and FedEx. Volume for its most expensive and profitable service, international guaranteed-time delivery, rose 9.1 per cent. The shares gained 2.3 per cent to €15.02.Emerging market demand also lifted Beiersdorf, the German maker of Nivea beauty products. The rise helped mitigate a 4 per cent fall in demand in its main consumer products division from western Europe, a trend seen at rivals Henkel and Unilever. The shares gained 7.6 per cent to €57.17.
189;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-07-20T20:14:03Z;Brussels investigates UPS-TNT deal;;The European Commission has launched an in-depth investigation into UPS’s €5.2bn takeover bid for TNT Express, citing concern about a “very high combined market share” for parcel services.The US package delivery company last week admitted that a deal with its European rival would require a full review from Brussels, which could stretch the clearance process until the end of this year.But the relatively strong Commission statement following its preliminary assessment is a potential setback, raising the spectre of a difficult ride in Brussels to win a regulatory green light.The initial review highlighted that the deal may harm competition in the small parcel delivery service in “numerous member states”, especially in international express services.“The small package delivery sector is of strategic importance for various other industries in Europe,” said Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner. “The proposed acquisition could in particular reduce competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery services, to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of European consumers.”UPS and TNT are two out of four so-called “integrators” identified by the commission in Europe, which boast an air and road network that enables them to offer a broad range of services.Competition officials see small package delivery services as a “highly differentiated market” that can be broken into distinct parts, such as delivery times. After the merger, the commission is concerned that competition in some markets will only come from two other integrators: DHL, which is owned by Deutsche Post, and FedEx, the US group.“It appears that other integrators would be the only significant competitive constraint on the merged entity for most express services, especially for the fastest time-commitment deliveries,” the commission found.“As the proposed transaction would reduce the number of integrators competing in [Europe] from four to three, the competitive constraint on the merged entity would be significantly reduced. This would lead in many member states to a highly concentrated market for domestic and, even more so, international express delivery services.”The market definition will be pivotal for approval for a deal in such a networked industry, as strong concerns about a particular segment may be difficult to remedy by selling parts of the business. UPS has expressed confidence that it will win a green light.The Commission said it had until November 28 to decide whether to approve, block or clear the deal with concessions. This date can be extended if concessions are submitted.
190;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-07-11T14:07:15Z;Deutsche Post;German mail and parcel company is a group of two halves;Deutsche Post shares have been moving faster than an overnight express package. The stock, which merely tracked the Euro Stoxx index for much of the past five years, began to fly last autumn. Today, the shares are up almost 60 per cent on early-October levels. Solid results have helped, with the German-based mail arm holding steady as internet shopping drives parcel business and the DHL express and logistics division delivering double-digit growth rates. Company forecasts have also been robust: group earnings before tax and interest are expected to reach €2.5bn-€2.6bn in 2012, and €3.4bn-€3.6bn by 2015. Last year, they were €2.4bn.The question for investors is how much of this optimism is now in the price – and what the downside risks may be. Essentially, Deutsche Post is a group of two halves. The German mail division still accounts for a quarter of revenues and has been a weak spot in the past. Europe’s malaise could cast a cloud over volume estimates. But, that said, ebit here has stabilised at over €1bn and the company believes that with more automation – and investment – this level can at least be maintained.The DHL business is more exciting, posting ebit of €1.7bn last year, which is projected to reach €2.7bn-€2.9bn by 2015. On the plus side, DHL is more exposed to Asia-Pacific than rivals such as UPS and FedEx. With new hubs in Shanghai and Hong Kong opening within days, it suggests that a third of revenues could come from this region by 2017 compared with a fifth today. On the minus, DHL’s volumes tend to mirror trends in global trade – so weakness there could hurt. The shares – 30 per cent of which are held by the German government – are now on a forward multiple of 11.5 times, still cheaper than peers’ but pricier than last autumn. They look solid enough medium-term, but perhaps more vulnerable to any disappointments.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
191;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Francisco returns to fight for Kewill;;The bidding war for Kewill intensified on Tuesday as Francisco Partners, the US private equity group, stepped in for the second time and raised its offer for the struggling logistics software group to £102.7m.Francisco Partners’s investment vehicle, Kinetic, is bidding 110p in cash for Kewill, trumping a rival offer of 106p cash made last week by rival US buyout firm, Symphony.Symphony’s bid, which valued Kewill at £99.6m last week, was made at the 11th hour as Kewill was about to set the seal in court on Francisco Partner’s first bid of £89.5m made last month.Francisco’s latest bid of 110p has been recommended by the board of Kewill and backed by shareholders holding 24.9 per cent of Kewill’s shares. The shareholders – SVG Investment Managers, RGM Capital, Centaurus Capital and Pendragon Capital – said that they would not accept another offer unless it were 118.25p or higher and came in the next 10 days.The race to buy Kewill marks a dramatic change in fortunes for the company which was founded in 1972 and specialises in software used to track inventory in transit and in warehouses. It has issued two profit warnings in the past year and, like a number of small technology groups, had come under pressure from increasingly active investors to improve returns.The Guildford-based company has offices in eight countries and lists DHL, FedEx, Ford and Unilever among its clients. However it remains lossmaking, despite a cash balance of £17.6m. Kewill reported a pre-tax loss of £740,000 in the six months to the end of September, on revenues of £27.2m. In May it said adjusted operating profits for the year to the end of March were expected to be £9.3m.Tuesday’s bid, said Francisco, was its final offer and would not be increased. It added that it expected it would be able to deliver cash to shareholders within 28 days.Francisco, which was founded in 1999 and manages $7bn in technology investments, has identified Kewill’s logistics software as a reason for the buyout. It hopes to win court approval for its final bid in early July and fund the deal within two weeks after that.Paul Nichols, chief executive for a decade who joined when the group’s shares were 7.5p, is expected to step down once a successor is foundKewill’s shares, which are up nearly 50 per cent since January, closed up 3.46 per cent to 112p on the news.
192;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-06-19T18:09:10Z;FedEx seeks cost cuts as growth slows;;FedEx said it plans to cut costs in the face of weaker global growth as it reported a 1.4 per cent fall in quarterly profit and lower ­volumes.The US package delivery company, considered an economic bellwether because of the wide range of product it ships and sectors it serves, said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter fell to $550m, or $1.73 a share, from $558m, or $1.75 a share, in the same three months in 2011.The results included a $134m impairment charge related to the retirement of several aircraft and engines from its fleet, which subtracted 26 cents a share.FedEx announced earlier this month that it would accelerate plans to replace ageing equipment. Excluding the charge, adjusted profit rose to $1.99 a share, slightly more than analysts’ forecasts.However, FedEx also issued an outlook that was dimmer than expected by Wall Street analysts. Uncertainty in the global economy, notably the European debt crisis and slowing growth in Asia, may hamper demand for FedEx’s services, it said, hitting its profits over the next year.As a consequence, FedEx forecast first-quarter earnings of $1.45 to $1.60 a share, below analysts’ forecasts of $1.70.Full-year earnings are expected to range from $6.90 to $7.40 a share, compared with analysts’ expectations of $7.38 a share.The company’s outlook assumes US gross domestic product growth of 2.2 per cent and global growth of 2.6 per cent this year.“A very small improvement in GDP percentage-point growth would come to the bottom line very quickly,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer, on a call with analysts.FedEx said it would face higher expenses in the next year, including higher pension and depreciation costs.“We expect to mitigate these challenges by reducing costs and improving efficiencies and are continuing to evaluate additional actions to substantially improve FedEx Express margins,” Mr Graf said.FedEx said its forecast does not include the impact of cost-cutting plans under review that the company expected to announce in a few months’ time.Revenue rose 4 per cent to $11bn in the quarter, in line with forecasts.For the year ending May 31, profit rose 40 per cent to $2.03bn, or $6.41 a share, from $1.45bn, or $4.57 a share, the previous year.Revenue for the full year rose 8.7 per cent to $42.7bn from $39.3bn in 2011.In express shipping, FedEx’s largest business, revenue rose 2.6 per cent from a year ago to $6.8bn. However, operating profit slipped 34.5 per cent to $281m, hit by the impairment charge and lower package volumes in the US and Asia. The operating margin narrowed to 4.1 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year ago.Revenue from ground shipping rose 9 per cent to $2.48bn, with operating profit up 18 per cent to $494m and operating margin widening to 20 per cent on higher volumes and prices.In freight, revenue rose 7 per cent to $1.4bn and operating income nearly doubled to $81m. FedEx said it would increase freight shipping rates by 6.9 per cent next month.“FedEx delivered strong earnings results for fiscal 2012 due to the outstanding performance by FedEx Ground, our new value proposition at FedEx Freight, and improved yields across all trans­portation segments,” said Fred Smith, chief executive.FedEx shares rose 2.82 per cent to close at $91.01 in New York.
193;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-06-14T20:30:21Z;FedEx: going places;The group looks to be in a weak position but has carved out profitable niches;No wonder UPS’s latest advertising campaign slogan is “We love logistics”. Its pending $6.8bn tie-up with TNT Express will enhance the company at a time when global economic growth appears to be faltering – bad news for the cyclical logistics sector. UPS’s move also asks some awkward questions of rival FedEx, which faces being boxed out of parts of the European market.FedEx looks to be in a weak position. The company reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 results on Tuesday lacks the scale of its rivals in Europe. FedEx has about a 5 per cent share of the intra-European express market, compared with 18 per cent for TNTE, 14 per cent for UPS, and 16 per cent for DHL.But FedEx has built profitable niches focused on express air networks and intercontinental routes connecting Europe with Asia and the US. And FedEx is growing, opening dozens of pick-up and delivery stations in the region in recent months, and topping up organic growth with two small purchases in Poland and France.Moreover, the focus on Europe distracts investors from opportunities closer to home. The biggest medium-term boost for FedEx may come from restructuring the US portion of its $25bn express package operations, where volumes have declined slowly but steadily as customers have switched to cheaper FedEx services.FedEx has made some progress already. This month, it decided to accelerate the retirement of certain aircraft and analysts expect more detailed announcements, possibly involving headcount reductions and facility closures, in the autumn.The rewards could be substantial. In 2003, restructuring helped FedEx to double express margins as the economy picked up. Today, a revamp could produce about $400m of annual cost savings, or a 10 per cent boost in forecast 2013 earnings per share, according to JPMorgan.

194;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-05-24T15:52:29Z;DHL sees opportunity in TNT-UPS merger;;The €5.16bn takeover of TNT Express by UPS creates an opportunity for DHL, the European express parcel leader, to pick up disaffected customers, DHL’s chief executive has said in one of his first responses to the deal.Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL, also insisted that DHL’s position was so strong in most markets – including fast-growing Asian economies – that it had no need to seek a major acquisition like UPS’s, announced in March.Mr Appel was speaking to the Financial Times during a visit to London where he outlined to investors plans to boost the group’s annual earnings before interest and tax (ebit) by €1bn by 2015.Mr Appel said DHL expected UPS to lose some focus during the complex process of integrating TNT Express.“If a company is integrating another company, that distracts from the service and the customers,” he said. “The people are nervous. We see an opportunity to capture market share – therefore, we’re relaxed overall.”Mr Appel nevertheless urged the European Commission to examine the takeover’s implications carefully. He pointed out in particular that DHL had been forced under international airline ownership rules to sell its US airline. He demanded that similarly strict rules be applied to UPS in Europe.“I don’t know how they want to take over the airline because the airline situation is very clear,” Mr Appel said. “I can only expect that the European Commission looks into that very closely.”Mr Appel insisted, meanwhile, that DHL’s position in most markets was so strong that it had no need to match UPS by undertaking a significant strategic purchase.“We’re not only the strongest player in Europe,” he said. “We’re also by far the strongest player in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and also in a strong position in Latin America.”After a series of acquisitions in the past two to three years, it would now buy only companies that added to its “footprint of skills”, Mr Appel said. DHL was, he went on, far larger than any rival in the global contract logistics business – providing outsourced logistics services for companies. In express freight, TNT Express had been the last readily available major acquisition.“We have no intention and probably only limited possibility to make acquisitions,” Mr Appel said. “So we will focus entirely on organic growth.”The most important gap in DHL’s global portfolio remains in express parcels in the US, where its inability to control its air operations directly and fierce competition from UPS and FedEx forced it to withdraw in 2008. Mr Appel insisted, nevertheless, that UPS’s air express business to and from the US continued to grow strongly – and that other parts of the world were now more important.“Relatively speaking, the importance of the US market is different from 15 years ago, when we started our journey in the US market,” he said. “Asia is much more important than it was at that time.”The projected €1bn growth in annual ebit would take group annual ebit, €2.44bn last year, to between €3.35bn and €3.55bn by 2015. The company is targeting 13 to 15 per cent annual revenue growth in DHL and stabilisation of ebit – currently running at about €1bn annually – at the Deutsche Post mail division.
195;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-05-02T16:41:54Z;Kewill agrees to US private equity buyout;;Kewill, the ailing logistics software company, has succumbed to shareholder pressure and agreed to be bought by a US private equity firm.The lossmaking company, which has issued several profit warnings over the past year, on Wednesday approved the approach from Francisco Partners that valued the supply chain management software developer’s equity at £89.5m.The 96p-a-share cash offer from Bidco, a subsidiary of Francisco, is a 26.3 per cent premium to the closing price of Kewill’s shares on the day before the bid was announced. Kewill has net cash of £17.6m.The takeover is an example of the quiet revolution affecting the boardrooms of many smaller UK technology companies, as disgruntled investors flex their muscles by pushing for management change or a sale.The acquisition of the Guildford company, whose logistics software is used by companies such as DHL, FedEx, Ford and Unilever, will result in the replacement of Paul Nichols as chief executive after a decade at the helm, when a successor is found.George Elliott, chairman, said: “Given the challenges faced by the business …we believe that this transaction is in the best interests of all Kewill stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, customers and partners.“The financial and operational flexibility afforded by Francisco and their extensive experience in the software sector will, we believe, enable Kewill to execute its long-term strategy.”Francisco has not decided the fate of Kewill’s 600 employees, but said that it would initiate a strategic review that “may or may not result in changes to the employee base, locations and operations”.Deep Shah, a partner at Francisco, identified Kewill’s logistics software as a reason for the buyout. “We believe that Kewill has an attractive future that we plan to invest in using our experience of supporting software companies.”Francisco, which has previously invested a total of $2.5bn in 30 software and services companies, said that Kewill shareholders representing about 30 per cent of the group’s stock had signalled approval of the acquisition.Paul Morland, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said the 96p-a-share offer appeared to be good value for shareholders.“Given that the core business appears to have weakened significantly and Kewill has failed to deliver much in the way of organic growth over the past five years, we would advise holders to accept the offer,” he said. Kewill reported a pre-tax loss of £740,000 in the six months to the end of September, on revenues of £27.2m.Kewill shares, which lost a quarter of their value in the 12 months preceding the takeover, rose on Wednesday by 19.75p, or 26 per cent, to 95.75p.
196;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-05-02T13:01:33Z;N Korea jams signals on Seoul flights;;Electronic jamming signals emanating from North Korea have affected hundreds of civilian flights in and out of South Korea, officials in Seoul said on Wednesday, raising fears about further provocations by the communist state following last month’s failed rocket launch.A total of 252 planes flying in and out of Incheon International Airport, Seoul’s main hub, and Gimpo airports have had their global positioning system (GPS) signals jammed since last Saturday, Seoul’s transport ministry said.Flights by nine foreign airlines including Japan Airlines, Thai Airways International and Garuda International have been affected by the signal jamming, in addition to nine domestic airlines.“The GPS jamming signals are coming from North Korea so we believe the North may be related to this,” said Lee Kyung-oh, an official at the Korea Communications Commission, a state agency in charge of telecommunications.International delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS were also affected by the jamming.Pilots and airlines were alerted by the Korean traffic authorities, but the transport ministry said all flights were operating normally.“There is no serious threat to the safety of flights because planes are using other navigation systems,” said Kim Choon-oh, a ministry director.The jamming incidents come amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea sharpening its rhetoric against the South after the country’s latest long-range rocket disintegrated shortly after blast-off. The North has warned of imminent “special actions” that would reduce Seoul to ashes within minutes, following South Korea’s suggestion that Pyongyang should stop wasting money on weapons.North Korea is also widely believed to be readying another nuclear test to make amends for the failed rocket launch. South Korean officials say that North Korea is fully prepared for the third nuclear test and is only waiting for a political decision to go ahead with it.Mr Kim at the transport ministry said GPS disruptions were usually made during the Korea-US joint military exercises, for example, in August 2010 and March 2011, but the latest disruptions were more large-scale than before. Seoul’s defence ministry said military equipment had not been affected by the signal jamming.“These low-phase provocations cost little, but [are] highly-efficient . . . because it is hard to prove who did it,” said Ahn Cheol-hyun, a former agent at Seoul’s National Intelligence Service who runs the Institute of Crisis Management.“Like a boxer, they will keep giving little jabs at their opponent. Then, they will find a way to deal a bigger blow. Seoul should be prepared for this.”Seoul’s defence ministry has warned that North Korea is capable of disrupting guided weapons, posing a fresh threat to security. Former defence minister Kim Tae-young told parliament that Pyongyang imported Russian equipment, which may have been the cause of intermittent failure of GPS receivers on naval and civilian craft along the west coast in August 2010.
197;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-04-09T18:27:56Z;Transport and logistics set for M&A boom;;The transport and logistics sector should enjoy a boom year for deals, given the cash piles companies built up during the recession and eurozone crisis, and the large number of midsized targets in Europe, according to KPMG.UPS’s purchase of TNT Express has already made the value of deals announced in the first quarter steeply higher than in the same period last year, and possible transactions ahead include the UK government’s privatisation of Royal Mail. It is hoping to sell or float the business by autumn 2013.But smaller acquisitions, particularly in Europe, are also set to boost the value of global deals. In logistics, private equity is eyeing niche companies that do not fit into larger networks, including groups that transport time-sensitive material such as fruit, medicines or hazardous products. Meanwhile, trade buyers are looking to take part in consolidation of mainstream package delivery.“After the UPS-TNT Express deal, FedEx needs to do something,” said Steffen Wagner, European head of transport transactions at KPMG. The US company last week announced a deal to buy Opek, a Polish shipping company with about $70m in annual sales.“The European market is mature. There are a large number of midsized players, many of them family owned,” Mr Wagner said. “The availability of targets is very good.”He sees different drivers for deals elsewhere in transport, with shipping groups responding to overcapacity in the sector with distressed sales. In infrastructure, a growing demand from pension funds for steady, inflation-protected investments means privatised assets should be snapped up quickly.Edinburgh airport is being auctioned by its owner, BAA, this month, and Stansted could follow late this year or early next. Meanwhile, many investors hope the Spanish government will move towards privatising airports there.Royal Mail, whose value has been estimated at between £3bn and £4bn, could prove a difficult prospect to sell or float so long as its GLS European parcels arm remains tied to the postal service, said Mr Wagner. The €5bn ($6.6bn) TNT Express deal was made possible when TNT split into a postal company for the Netherlands, PostNL, and the more dynamic TNT Express.That acquisition contributed to $19.7bn in transport and logistics deals announced globally in the first quarter of 2012, according to Thomson Financial data, compared with about $50bn for the whole of last year, when the eurozone crisis curbed dealmaking.The value of completed deals and those announced in the first three months of the year is higher – at $27.9bn – than any quarter in 2011.Still, this year’s prognosis could change if financing remains difficult, said Mr Wagner. “It’s still an issue, particularly for private equity.” Moreover, pricing has not yet fully recovered to pre-credit crisis levels, meaning that if owners are not forced to sell, they may yet wait.
198;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-25T17:14:27Z;UK-Europe high-speed rail freight plan;;A group aiming to substitute 300kph rail services for some short-haul European air freight flights hopes to launch its first services between the Continent and the UK later this decade, it has announced after bringing a freight-carrying French high-speed train to the UK.François Coart, strategy director of Europorte, an arm of France’s Groupe Eurotunnel that is participating in the Euro Carex project, said the group had identified sites at four mainland European airports and in south-east England as terminals for the service, which it hopes to launch in 2017 or 2018.The impetus for the project had come from increasing airport congestion and restrictions on night flights, as well as concerns about the rising cost of fuel and restrictions on carbon emissions, Mr Coart said. The project would mark one of the first efforts anywhere in the world to move high-value, fast-moving air cargo from the current mixture of air and truck to rail.The project has backing from several express parcel delivery services – including the US’s UPS and FedEx and the Netherlands’ TNT Express – as well as the four airports that could be served – Amsterdam Schipol, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Liège Airport and Lyons Airport. Euro Carex aims to shift to rail both some of the feeder flights that bring parcels and air freight to the express package providers’ main hubs, as well as some of the truck and van movements to and from the aiports.It was “quite easy” to identify a potential market for the service, Mr Coart said. “You have express parcels and that will be supported by auto parts, urgent medicals and courier network deliveries,” he said.The group had identified sites for terminals at all the airports involved, as well as a site by the High Speed 1 line from the Channel tunnel to London as a potential UK terminal, Mr Coart added. He declined to identify the exact site, beyond saying it was on the M20 Folkestone to London motorway and near the M25 London orbital motorway. It is currently impossible to reach London’s Heathrow Airport, a main air freight hub, with a continental-sized high-speed train.It was “not rocket science” to build the relatively simple rail terminals required, Mr Coart said. Each would cost between €30m and €50m to build.Mr Coart was speaking after Euro Carex for the first time brought a French TGV train to London to demonstrate how loading and unloading would work. The train is one of the handful of the 30-year-old first wave of French high-speed trains that has been converted to carry mail for La Poste, France’s post office. The train had called at both Lyons and Charles de Gaulle airports before heading through the Channel tunnel to London.Yanick Paternotte, a deputy in the French national assembly who chairs Euro Carex, said the company had asked both France’s Alstom and Germany’s Siemens – Europe’s two leading high-speed train builders – to draw up designs for a potential express freight high-speed train. Unlike the existing postal service TGVs, these would have doors large enough to accept air cargo containers from aircraft.The train would be able to carry around 120 tonnes of packages, around the same as seven Boeing 737 aircraft or seven articulated trucks.
199;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-23T19:12:43Z;CFOs should partner with IT leaders in this post digital world;;Chief financial officers face a strategic choice today that could affect their career and their company. Digital technologies are rapidly evolving, converging and becoming C-suite friendly. Will CFOs view them as IT costs to manage or tools requiring a steep learning curve that’s best attempted in close partnership with their chief information officer?Two companies, FedEx and American Airlines, have benefitted because their CEOs famously learned that lesson. Fred Smith, FedEx chief executive, recognising that continuously improving logistics was essential, forged strategic partnerships with a series of IT leaders in his company, keeping digital innovation central to his business model.Robert Crandall, his counterpart at American Airlines, worked closely with his IT guru, Max Hooper, supporting him in the creation of their revolutionary reservation system, Sabre. The fact that reservations-only digital forms continue to try to challenge Sabre’s competitive edge is an early lesson in the importance of understanding the speed of digital disruption to an enterprise.“More IT organisations report to the CFO than to any other executive function or role,” noted Sara Peters, Enterprise Efficiency editor in chief, citing the 2011 Gartner FEI Technology Study. That’s unfortunate for many CIOs because, as Ms Peters reports, “Gartner found that CEOs generally have a higher opinion of the IT organisation than do CFOs, and top executives see IT as potentially having a bigger strategic impact on the business than do CFOs.”Worse yet: according to the Gartner study, “only 32 per cent of CFOs see the CIO as a strategic partner.”Yet CFOs who choose to work strategically with their IT leadership can secure faster adoption of four key post-digital tools that can make measurable business improvement. They are enhanced social collaboration ecosystems, analytics, mobility and the cloud.Core Logic, an early adopter of an enhanced social collaboration ecosystem, has already achieved greater efficiencies. Historically, when finance closed the books,the process involved sequential review and coordination between accounting, tax, business finance and other departments. Communication was traditionally by email and nobody had all the information at one time.CoreLogic implemented and adopted an enhanced collaboration site where involved parties could see and respond, in real time, to the same information. What used to take two to three days can now be completed in hours. Similarly, exception-based incidents and processes such as those arising out of an accounts payable or receivable issue can be resolved sooner and often better. Again, that’s because all internal departments can work simultaneously rather than giving input in a linear chain of events where no one can see all the relevant factors at once.To achieve an effective design of such collaborative systems, it is importantfor the CFO and the CIO to collaborate on creating it, rather than the CFO viewing them simply as expenditures to approve or deny. Such an approach requires deep learning and listening, yet the performance improvements can be significant. They include the capacity for collaborative forecasting, swifter issue resolution, more rapid and customer-centered innovation, and advance fraud tracking.A close alliance between the CFO and the CIO can also sidestep a main reason for many of the failures experienced by some of the early adopters of social tools for enterprise. That’s the lack of clear goals. Having the big picture of the firm’s needs, the CFO can set the objectives that become the criteria for the CIO to design the post-digital systems. In this way, each partner iteratively learns more about the constraints and opportunities they face as they co-create a strategic path of adoption.In addition to the enhanced collaboration capacity of the ecosystem we described earlier, other complementary, post-digital technologies are emerging. They, too, can generate performance improvements for the enterprise. They are location-based services, listening and signal capturing, and mobile content creation and delivery.For example, companies can now automatically tag and track people, products and even activities to create location-based efficiencies and innovation. Such tracking can lift much of the burden off globe trotting employees for recording taxes on travel expenditures. Location-based tracking can also support streamlining many operational, finance and promotional processes. It can also support real time analytics to predict how much to make and to deliver how, when and where.The CFO can be in the coveted place to make strategic recommendations that transcend “finance” when he or she can couple that location-based capacity with the ability to sense and respond to what customers, suppliers and employers are doing. Complex as the creation of such post-digital systems can be, the upside competitive opportunity makes it alluring to attempt to design, in partnership with an equally savvy IT leader.And we haven’t even suggested the further benefits of overlaying a mobile capacity to location-based listening and responding. With that full mobile capacity in place, firms could capture and share relevant data between customers, employers, suppliers and other participants in its post-digital ecosystem, optimally making that information available anywhere, any time, and on any device.The risk of not understanding the capacity of these digital tools is at least as great as the opportunities of knowing enough, in partnership with a strong CIO, to make smarter decisions for their best use.That leads to two key questions. Will it be the CEO or the CFO in your firm that takes the lead in closely planning digital tool usage with the CIO? Or, will someone on the top leadership team of a competing firm figure out first that a key to achieving their objectives is cultivating a close, mutual learning and planning relationship with the IT leader?Eric Openshaw is the vice chairman and US Technology, Media & Telecommunications leader at Deloitte.Rich Rorem is a principal with Deloitte Consulting and the US Finance Transformation leader.
200;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-23T19:02:29Z;UPS reaches deal to buy TNT Express for €5.2bn;;This week, United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, reached an agreement to buy TNT Express, its smaller Dutch rival, for about €5.2bn, wrapping up a deal that has been more than 10 years in the making.The purchase is the biggest in UPS’s 105-year history, and to win out, the company was forced to up its offer and fork out a sizeable sum. The purchase price represents a 54 per cent premium relative to the unaffected share price of TNTE.Still, executives at the Atlanta-based company argue the acquisition is worth every cent, giving it access to an extensive road freight network in Europe, as well as a bigger footprint in countries such as Australia, Brazil and China.In total, UPS expects to achieve between €400m and €550m of annual cost synergies, although achieving them will require €1bn of investment and plenty of time. UPS expects the complex integration process to take four years.Other potential hurdles remain. Earlier this week, FedEx, UPS’s main US competitor, said that it was focused on profitable organic growth within Europe, appearing to scupper the chance of a rival offer, but a counterbid is still possible.And the deal will face scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Europe where the enlarged UPS will end up with a 30 per cent share of the express parcel market. To win approval, the company could be forced to dispose of some assets.However, UPS says it is confident it will succeed. The company expects the offer period to close in the third quarter of the year and has agreed to pay TNTE a termination fee of €200m if the proposal falls foul of regulators.
201;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-22T15:08:03Z;FedEx damps talk of TNTE bid;;FedEx, the package delivery company, on Thursday appeared to rule out a move to spoil a proposed tie-up between rivals UPS and TNT Express, insisting that its focus remains on profitable organic growth within Europe.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, declined to comment directly on the company’s acquisition plans but said that FedEx was happy with its profitable express business in Europe, which was “growing strongly.”“I’m extremely pleased with our operations there and we’re confident in our plans to continue expansion primarily through organic growth,” Mr Smith said. “We believe these plans will continue to improve our competitiveness in Europe.”Earlier this week, UPS, the US logistics group, and TNT Express, the Dutch parcel company, agreed a deal after UPS raised its offer. Combining the two companies will give UPS about a 30 per cent share of the intra-European express parcel market, far ahead of its nearest rival.Analysts worry that the move may box FedEx out of Europe. The company has a strong position delivering express packages between Asia and Europe, and Europe and the US, but operates a smaller intra-European ground network than its peers.FedEx insists that it has ample room to grow in the fragmented European space that is split between specific domestic markets, cross-border air and surface markets and intercontinental markets.Executives said FedEx had been adding intercontinental flights for several years and in the last five months had opened 23 new stations in countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands.“We’ve been expanding at flank speed over the recent past and are going to continue for the foreseeable future to broaden the portfolio that we offer in Europe,” Mr Smith told analysts on a conference call.Mr Smith also questioned the broader economic prospects for Europe, arguing that growth rates in the region are low and will remain low if current policies are sustained, implicitly suggesting that investing in other regions, such as Asia, made more sense.In any event, a successful counterbid could be difficult to achieve. FedEx is already spending heavily on new aircraft and, as part of the UPS deal terms, TNTE can only break the merger protocol if it receives an offer that is 8 per cent higher than UPS’s €9.50 bid.The comments came as FedEx reported a surge in quarterly revenues and profits thanks to higher prices and strong demand during the holiday season and predicted a solid finish to its fiscal year in spite of modest global economic growth and a recession in Europe.In the three months to the end of February, FedEx said net income jumped 126 per cent to $521m, or $1.65 per share, as sales rose 9 per cent to hit $10.6bn. A reversal of a legal reserve and a lower tax rate also boosted earnings.The results blew past both Wall Street expectations and the company’s own estimates. Analysts had forecast that in the third quarter of its 2012 fiscal year the company would earn net income of $427.7m, or $1.35 a share, on sales of $10.6bn.They were also flattered by FedEx’s 2011 performance. During the same quarter a year ago, FedEx undershot expectations and blamed the poor results on a mix of severe winter storms and sharply higher fuel prices that raised costs and hurt sales.FedEx said the momentum would continue and the company forecast earnings of between $1.75 and $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with analyst estimates, and between $6.43 and $6.68 per share for fiscal 2012.“I think the fourth quarter is still [going to be] very good but what we’re seeing at the moment …is that we just don’t have as strong an economy as we hoped it would be a year ago,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer at FedEx, adding that high fuel prices were also taking a toll.FedEx shares slipped about 3 per cent to $93.05 in early morning trading in New York on Thursday. Over the year to date the shares have risen by about 12 per cent.
202;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-19T23:43:40Z;TNT is vital piece in UPS jigsaw puzzle;;Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, portrayed himself as having completed a tricky jigsaw puzzle on Monday after announcing the takeover of TNT Express.The logistics company would be a vital missing piece for UPS: road freight operations in Europe. TNT Express’s operations in Australia and Brazil would fill in the edges and merging two air freight networks would make everything more efficient.The question is whether Mr Davis can put it all together smoothly, as he has suggested, or whether an unexpected jolt will scatter the pieces.Such jolts could include greater than expected demands from the competition authorities to clear the deal, problems with merging the two operations, or union unhappiness over job losses.There is also the financial impact on UPS of paying the €5.16bn it is offering for TNT’s shares.The extra risks UPS will be assuming were underlined on Monday evening when Moody’s, the rating agency, announced it was putting the Aa3 rating for its senior unsecured debt on review. Moody’s said the $370m debt the company would assume from TNT Express and the extra borrowing to pay for the deal could “result in credit metrics at levels no longer supportive of the Aa3 rating”.One jolt could come if competition authorities in Europe conclude that the deal will substantially reduce competition in a rapidly consolidating sector.Mr Davis rejected as “too simplistic” the idea that he was redrawing the competitive landscape in European logistics, where the big four operators are Germany’s DHL, TNT Express, UPS and the US’s FedEx.“There are a lot of competitors in Europe,” he said. “The [post offices] are major competitors in their own right. There’s a lot more than DHL and FedEx.”UPS was at pains on Monday to portray the deal as the merging of two matching networks, which would enhance organic growth. “We have complimentary products,” Mr Davis said.The merged company would seek to present customers with new products, Mr Davis said. It would also ask if there were opportunities to increase revenue.“Can we expand the business with the same structure and not have to add too much to the structure?” Mr Davis asked.UPS said an important reason for the transaction was the opportunity to make €400m to €550m of pre-tax cost savings annually by the fourth year after completion.The biggest saving would come from an aligning of the two companies’ air operations, said Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer. Other areas – including back office – would follow, he added.Air competition rules will mean UPS has to sell control of TNT Express’s air operations, although it could seek to lease back some of the capacity from the new owner.Daniel Brutto, head of UPS’s international division, hinted that TNT Express’s air hub at Liège in Belgium was likely to see some business shifted to UPS’s existing hub at Cologne, even though Liège’s strategic position was an advantage. “Cologne is the future for our airline business,” he said.Previous logistics mergers – particularly AP Møller-Maersk’s takeover in 2005 of P&O Nedlloyd, the world’s third-largest container shipping line – have shown the potential for integration between logistics operators to fall foul of integration problems. The merged Maersk Line operation after the P&O Nedlloyd takeover suffered severe problems when a new, merged information technology system malfunctioned.Mr Davis insisted that the merger process would be “very deliberate”, and it would take four years and €1bn to ensure that customers continued to receive good service.“This is a customer-first integration,” Mr Davis said.“The challenges of completing the merger – and the current weakness of the European economy – would all, however, pale by comparison with the strategic advantages the new, merged company would enjoy, according to Mr Scott.“We’re not looking at the next just two, three, four years. We’re a company that invests for the next 20 or 30 years.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer in New York
203;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-18T22:07:52Z;FedEx/TNT: prudent absence;Staying away from a bidding war with UPS was a good idea;“Aren’t you supposed to be fighting against us?” Kermit the Frog once asked. FedEx could well be on the other end of the question. The US mail group decided not to join the battle for TNT Express with which rival UPS has finalised details for an acquisition probably at €9.50 a share. The only real obstacle in the way now is convincing competition regulators to approve the deal. To many people, Fedex’s lack of interest will have appeared strange. It has only 4 per cent of the European express delivery market and acquiring TNT, which has almost a fifth, would have been an easy way to compete with UPS’s 14 per cent share. FedEx also has basically no net debt, so it could have made a bid of €10.50 a share and retained an investment grade credit rating, reckons JPMorgan.But in spite of there being greater strategic value for FedEx, staying away from a bidding war with UPS was probably a good idea. It has less balance sheet power than larger UPS for starters. The latter’s bigger European profile (it has about three times as many employees on the continent) means that it can find $400m a year in synergies, twice as much as FedEx could generate, estimates JPMorgan. What is more, TNT needs work. Its profits fell by a third last year (excluding one-offs). At a time when FedEx is focused on building its lead over UPS in Asia (its market share of 11 per cent is about half as much again as UPS), justifying an expansion into economically ravaged Europe would have been tough.But there may be one final twist. As much of UPS’s operations overlap with those of TNT, there are some complex competition hurdles still to be jumped. If these prove too high, and the deal is called off, TNT’s share price will probably collapse below its €6.34 undisturbed level allowing FedEx to swoop in for a reasonable price. This may take a year or more, but if FedEx is lucky, it will make UPS, with its current offer at about a 50 per cent premium, look like a muppet.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
204;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-03-18T22:00:09Z;UPS agrees to buy TNT Express for €5bn;;UPS, the US package delivery company, has agreed a deal to buy its European rival TNT Express in a takeover that is likely to value the Dutch delivery company at about €5bn, people familiar with the talks said.The agreement, which was reached on Sunday, could be announced as soon as Monday, with UPS likely to be offering about €9.50 a share for TNT Express, the people said.The deal would bring to an end years of speculation about a tie-up between the two delivery companies. FedEx had also pursued TNT in 2008. A combination with TNT Express would increase UPS’s presence in Europe but would also give the US company a domestic network in China, where it has been keen to expand.A bid of about €9.5 a share would represent a second increase on UPS’s first offer to TNT Express of €8.25 a share, which it made in November last year. The US logistics company, which had started work on the potential bid at the start of last year, increased its offer to €9 on February 11.However the Dutch delivery company rejected that offer. The two have been in talks since. UPS and TNT Express declined to comment.Following UPS’s approach to TNT last month, the Dutch company’s shares soared to more than €10. However, since then they have fallen, trading at €9.35 on Friday.The takeover talks follow pressure on the Dutch deliver company from activist shareholders, led by the US hedge fund Jana Partners.Jana Partners was among the shareholders that pushed for the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and the Dutch postal company PostNL in May. PostNL holds a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT Express.The takeover, if finalised, would be the largest in UPS’s history. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005.The Dutch and Belgian unions representing TNT Express workers have demanded that the companies guarantee there will be no forced redundancies in Belgium due to any merger, and that TNT Express retain its headquarters in the Netherlands.TNT Express last month said it suffered a net loss of €173m in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was planning to refocus on its core European operations.Additional reporting by Matthew Steinglass in Amsterdam
205;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;A mixed blessing for parcel companies;;Walk through an apartment block in the US and chances are you will find a series of small yellowing notices stuck on the front door or dotted around the mail room – tell tale signs that UPS or Fedex delivery men have been and gone, having failed to deliver long-awaited packages.For individuals missed deliveries are just one of the many annoyances of modern life but for express parcel companies they are a symptom of a deeper challenge: the rise of e-commerce and with it, pesky residential deliveries.The trend has been a mixed blessing for parcel companies, pushing retail sales that used to go through brick and mortar stores into the mail but also squeezing margins and creating huge operational challenges.Still, after adopting ‘defensive’ measures to offload low-value parcels onto third parties in the early 2000s, leading industry executives in the US and beyond argue that they are finally getting to grips with the phenomenon.In the fourth quarter of 2011, e-commerce drove a surge in volumes at UPS and despite a drop in parcel weights, US revenues rose 7.3 per cent to $8.7bn and adjusted operating profit rose 30 per cent to $1.3bn.“We saw all of these pieces of the puzzle coming together,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said of the results at an investor conference last month , pointing to new products and new technology aimed at growing e-commerce demand.“We invested a lot in service in the past few years and the pick up in e-commerce is really falling on fertile ground with us,” Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL, the German post and package group, told the Financial Times last year.Success has been hard won. At the heart of the problem lies the nature of e-commerce parcels. While traditional orders usually involve large volumes travelling regular routes to densely packed business customers, online orders revolve around deliveries to individual homes.Such deliveries seem almost designed to cause grief. Addresses are spread out, orders are highly seasonal and customers are often not at home. Moreover, lightweight parcels of books and CDs command low prices and competition further depresses yields.In response, logistics companies focused on reducing so called ‘last mile’ delivery costs, which can make up three quarters of overall supply chain costs, by re-aggregating demand at central drop off and pick up points.In the US, Nate Brochmann, of William Blair investment bank, says FedEx was an early mover. In 2004 it acquired a business that dropped off low-weight packages with the US Postal Service for final delivery. In the last quarter, average daily SmartPost volumes grew 17 per cent to 1.7m.Crucially, the deal reduces expenses for FedEx because it can deposit multiple packages at a single post office location. Last year UPS rolled out a comparable US product and in Europe other package delivery groups have tie-ups with their local postal services.Over time logistics companies have developed other responses. UPS My Choice is one example. Launched in October the service sends subscribers an alert before their packages arrive, reducing the number of missed deliveries, increasing driver productivity and improving customer satisfaction.FedEx offers similar options, as well as evening and Saturday deliveries, through its Home Delivery service launched early in the last decade specifically to address the needs of residential deliveries and e-commerce.“Any time we can avoid a re-delivery attempt, that saves Fedex money and also improves the customer experience so it is a win-win for both parties,” says Michael Glenn, executive vice president of market development for FedEx and head of FedEx Services.At UPS, residential deliveries, a rough proxy for e-commerce sales, have jumped from about 20 per cent of US volumes in 2000 to almost 40 per cent in 2011. UPS generates about $32bn of its $53bn revenues from the US each year.Alan Gershenhorn, chief sales, marketing and strategy officer for UPS, says: “Ultimately, our shippers are looking to create a superior experience for their customers and if we can help with that, and we believe UPS My Choice is doing that for them, then that starts to create a preference for UPS.”Jeff Ward, a partner at AT Kearney, argues that the industry is just at the beginning of a broader transformation as companies amass data on consumer preferences and use it as the basis for new tools, such as mobile applications that help better tailor deliveries to individual schedules.“[The impact of e-commerce] is probably one of the most exciting issues in transportation and logistics today,” he says. “There is a lot of innovation and a lot of growth there and it is a cool thing to see develop.”Still, there are many issues to overcome. For one thing, piggybacking on the USPS may not be entirely sustainable. The institution is already considering reducing service to cope with its well-publicised financial problems. Parcel companies say they are closely monitoring the situation.Then too, not all retailers want third parties, however well respected, to manage their interactions with customers. Last year a video of a FedEx delivery man tipping a computer monitor over a fence went viral, highlighting the brand risks involved in outsourcing delivery. FedEx says it strives for “outstanding” customer service and that the incident was an exception.But Mr Kuehn argues that UPS is just hitting its stride. “[With earlier products] we were just trying to find a way to offer lightweight, low value products a lower cost way,” he said in February. “We’ve really changed that philosophy in the last couple of years and instead have embraced [e-commerce] …not as an issue that we have to defend against but as an opportunity.”
206;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-21T23:07:47Z;Stepping up UPS’s TNT Express offer;;UPS’s first offer to TNT Express was €8.25 a share, when it first approached the Dutch delivery company about a takeover in November last year, said people familiar with the negotiations between the companies.That offer was rejected in December by TNT Express, the people said. At the time of that offer, the TNT shares were trading at less than €5.The US logistics company, which had started work on the potential bid at the start of 2011, the people said, then increased its offer to €9 on February 11.The US logistics company on Friday described its bid as “revised, increased and comprehensive”.TNT Express on Friday said that it had rejected the offer but was continuing discussions.While the market is pricing in an increase to UPS’s offer, any revision would be final, said one person familiar with the plans.UPS and TNT declined to comment.Typically in large takeovers, initial offers are increased by 10-15 per cent. However, TNT Express shares were trading as high as €10.08 on Tuesday, closing at about €9.89, indicating that shareholders believe a higher than €9 bid will be made.Several analysts, such as those at Credit Suisse and HSBC, lifted their target price for TNT Express to about €10. “We expect a further bid from UPS,” said analysts at Credit Suisse.“The supervisory and executive boards would be compelled to accept a bid of €9.5-€10 per share, representing a premium of 1-6 per cent per cent to the stock’s demerger price.”It demerged at a share price of €9.45.UPS could bid as high as €15 without seeing higher borrowing costs, and US rival FedEx as high as €13, without requiring an issuance of equity, wrote analysts at Wolfe Trahan.If it were successful in its bid, UPS is likely to hold talks with potential buyers, such as FedEx and PostNL, about buying assets it would need to divest to avoid the deal being blocked by the European Commission, two of the people said.“UPS would likely have to divest some assets – to avoid European Commission antitrust issues – in countries like the UK, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, assets which FedEx could acquire, but FedEx would still be boxed out from much of Europe,” said the Wolfe Trahan analysts.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer and Matthew Steinglass
207;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-21T17:12:46Z;UPS’s acquisition rationale comes into play;;When United Parcel Service, the logistics company, went public in 1999, top executives gave one overarching rationale for the wrenching change to its conservative, operations-focused corporate culture – large-scale acquisitions.More than a decade later UPS is finally making its move, taking advantage of its greater scale, financial strength and access to capital markets with a €4.9bn offer for TNT Express, the recently spun-off Dutch package delivery company.The bid comes as the leading express parcel groups are enjoying moderate if uneven growth amid the patchy economic recovery and have moved to tap into international trade flows and build out their global networks through a combination of capital investments and acquisitions.In 2005, for example DHL of Germany took over the UK’s Exel in a deal worth about €5.9bn, but for the most part deals have been smaller in size as logistics companies have filled in specific service and geographical gaps.For UPS the move has been a long time coming. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck to date was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005.In part the step by step approach of UPS reflects a deep strand of circumspection that runs through the corporate culture of the Atlanta-based business. In its entire 105 year history the company has had just 10 chief executives.Caution is warranted. Large scale deals in the package delivery sector have a mixed record. Deutsche Post DHL’s acquisition of US based Airborne Express in 2003 went poorly. IT problems led to late shipments, billing errors and customer defections. DHL eventually pulled back from the US.At the same time, until the spinoff last year, the combination of TNT’s express business and Dutch mail business was a significant stumbling block, tying an attractive parcel delivery business to a shrinking national mail service.TNT has long been seen as the most likely target for the company. “UPS went public in 1999 with one deal in mind,” says one person familiar with the company’s thinking. “That was TNT’s express business.”In the first place TNT Express has a substantial presence in Europe that compliments, and in some cases overlaps, UPS’s network. A deal would make UPS the biggest express carrier in Europe and could generate about $450m in synergies.Doug Caldwell, with AFMS Logistics Management Group, says that the company has a strong relationship with European multinationals, a valuable long haul road network and an outsourced operating model that gives it a very flexible cost base.By the numbers, TNT boasts a presence in 62 countries, including 16 road hubs in Europe, employs 83,000 people and has a ﬂeet of more than 30,000 road vehicles and about 60 aircraft. It is the smallest of the big four global package delivery companies.Another attraction for UPS is that TNT has a sizeable, albeit underperforming, presence in Brazil and China. UPS has ambitions in Latin America, has moved to develop a domestic Chinese footprint and has a reputation for buying struggling companies and fixing them up.Whether UPS will succeed in its bid is another matter. While some leading shareholders are backing the proposals, last week TNT’s board rejected the offer after careful consideration, although discussions are ongoing.Another wild card is FedEx. While UPS has a sizeable ground operation in Europe, FedEx has long been considered sub-scale in the region after closing its Brussels hub in the early 1990s following a long and unsuccessful battle to reach profitability.In public FedEx has insisted that its position, focused on moving high-value packages between Europe and Asia and Europe and the US, is solid, but analysts argue FedEx has an even more powerful incentive to purchase TNT than UPS and predict a bidding war could break out.Indeed, fending off a move by FedEx is another powerful reason for UPS to act. UPS generates about 14 per cent of its revenues from intra-European express packages while FedEx produces only about 2 per cent of its sales from that segment.In a tussle, UPS’s scale could make the difference. The company’s market capitalisation is more than double that of FedEx and it has substantial free cash flows, while its rival is committed to a heavy round of capital spending on new aircraft and might find it more difficult to pay for a deal.At the very least investors expect UPS to have to pay more to clinch a deal. Since the offer was revealed, TNT’s share price has jumped more than 50 per cent and is now well above UPS’s €9 a share offer price.
208;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-17T16:42:47Z;TNT Express rejects €4.9bn UPS offer;;US logistics company UPS is in talks with TNT Express about a possible takeover, after the Dutch delivery company rejected an approach valuing it at about €4.88bn.After many years of speculation about a tie-up between the two, TNT Express said on Friday that UPS had submitted an unsolicited non-binding and conditional offer for the Dutch delivery worth €9 a share, valuing it at €4.88bn.The talks have been going on for months and the all-cash offer had been increased to €9 a share, people familiar with the situation said.In reaction to TNT’s statement, UPS said it made “a revised, increased and comprehensive proposal to acquire the entire issued share capital”.TNT Express, which faces pressure from shareholders after a drop in its share price, said it had rejected the offer but it continued to be in discussions about a possible takeover for the whole of the company.TNT Express shares were up 2.9 per cent before the announcement at €6.36 on Friday afternoon in Amsterdam.The deal, if successful, would highlight interest by global companies in taking advantage of the fall in European share prices in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, which has depressed valuations of coveted targets.The combination would increase UPS’s presence in Europe but would also give the US company a domestic network in China, where it has been keen to expand.FedEx pursued TNT in 2008 and it declined to comment Friday on whether it would enter the bidding.“The market will hope that FedEx (is) also tempted in but very hard for FedEx to compete with UPS, who are the bigboy here,” said Mark Kelly, analyst at Olivetree Securities.In recent days, TNT Express has been caught up in an open feud with a group of activist shareholders, led by US hedge fund Jana Partners, rejecting their request to appoint three new directors.Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners owns 5 per cent of TNT Express, was the driving force behind a shareholder revolt that led to the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and Dutch postal company PostNL last May.With other shareholders, it is now pressing for TNT Express to be groomed for a takeover by a larger rival, such as UPS or FedEx.When TNT Express was spun off last year, its shares were trading at about €9. PostNL holds a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT.Several large shareholders surveyed by the Financial Times have said an offer of €9 would be acceptable to them.Analysts at Wall Street research boutique Wolfe Trahan & Co recently called UPS and FedEx the most logical buyers of TNT Express.“We believe the separation of Express from Mail earlier this year could finally entice a strategic buyer to emerge,” they noted in a report. “We now estimate a €9 to €10 takeout price in our buy-out analysis, down from our prior expectations of €10 to €11.”TNT in recent months warned on profits, citing low demand on Europe-Asia routes, cost-conscious customers in Europe and continued losses in the Americas.Earlier this week, UPS announced its planned takeover of Kiala, the Belgian ecommerce company, which was estimated to be worth about $100m.Additional reporting Matt Steinglass and Jeremy Lemer
209;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-16T21:06:45Z;UPS acquires Belgian delivery group;;The consolidation of the European logistics sector gathered pace on Thursday with UPS, the US group, buying Kiala, a Belgian company specialising in deliveries of internet orders.UPS gave no details of how much it was paying for Kiala, which delivers internet-ordered goods to a convenient retail location. However, Kiala, which started in 2001, had forecast its 2011 revenue at €54.3m. The service operates in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Spain as well as Belgium.The three main worldwide logistics and express parcel companies – UPS and FedEx of the US and DHL of Germany – have all been eager to exploit the potential of internet shopping to bring extra business to their parcel delivery networks.There has also been steady consolidation around the biggest players in the industry in recent years. In 2005, DHL took over the UK’s Exel, while in 2009 DHL pulled out of services in the US, leaving the market there to UPS and FedEx.Kiala is owned by a group of private equity and venture capital companies, including AGF Private Equity, Arts Alliance and HarbourVest Partners.
210;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-09T03:39:39Z;Remember that most jobs in the services sector pay poorly;;"From Mr Stuart Skalka.Sir, While I completely agree with Jagdish Bhagwati that Barack Obama is pandering on trade, I totally disagree with the part of his article that begins: “But if Mr Obama is wet behind the ears on outsourcing, his surrender to the ‘manufactures fetish’ is a disaster.”First, Prof Bhagwati writes that “over time, manufacturing yields to services”. There is no theoretical or empirical basis for this statement. Theoretically, as long as worker productivity increases faster than workers’ wages thanks to more and/or better capital equipment, highly paid workers are more cost-effective than those who are paid little. Empirically, if the shift from manufacturing to services is inevitable as economies develop, why are such high-wage countries as Germany and Japan at the forefront of manufacturing? How does Prof Bhagwati explain why German, Japanese and Korean car companies are investing in factories in the US?His second point, that retail is the most productive sector, confuses an industry with its workers. Retail is a notoriously poorly paid sector – its workers do not earn anywhere near what a highly productive worker in manufacturing does. (I presume this is one reason that the retail sector is so productive.) More generally, jobs in services are highly bifurcated – those with advanced degrees can earn millions in, yes, the financial sector, among others. But the majority of services jobs pay poorly; would Prof Bhagwati care to toil for FedEx, whose workers are contractors, not even employees? What is inevitable is that if a nation stays committed to research and development and advanced manufacturing, millions of highly paid service jobs needed by that sector, as well as manufacturing ones, will be generated.Stuart Skalka, Henderson, NV, US"
211;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-02-06T11:09:39Z;TNT Express feud with shareholders widens;;Dutch express mail company TNT Express is engaging in an open feud with a group of activist shareholders, rejecting their request to appoint three new directors on the grounds they had been paid directly by the shareholders.In a blistering letter of response, the leader of the shareholder group said TNT Express’s “lack of good faith and reasonableness” was “stunning”.The rejection marked a new level of acrimony in a long-running battle between TNT Express management and a shareholder group led by American hedge fund Jana Partners.Jana asked TNT Express in December to appoint three new members to the board of directors, including Alan Jones, who headed the express delivery service from 1999-2003 when it was a division of the former TNT postal group.TNT Express not only rejected the proposed candidates, but announced its board of directors had appointed two new members, both drawn from the Dutch corporate world.In a letter rejecting the proposal, TNT Express said the current board “has rejected the nomination of these candidates as they do not meet the requirements of independence as laid down in the company’s legal and governance rules”.TNT Express contends that the €20,000 Jana paid Mr Jones and the other two candidates, former Avis executive David Siegel and former UPS mergers and acquisitions head Thomas Delbrook, would render them unable to act impartially as board members.Barry Rosenstein, managing director of Jana, accused TNT Express of “attempting to hide behind a technical argument”, and said the payment had been intended to defray costs and inconvenience from the nomination. Mr Rosenstein said the candidates have agreed to refund the payments should they be elected.Despite management’s opposition, Jana will put its candidates for the board forward at the general meeting of shareholders in April, though it may reduce the slate from three to two.Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, was the driving force behind a shareholder revolt that led to the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and Dutch postal company PostNL last May. With other shareholders, it is now pressing for TNT Express to be groomed for a takeover by a larger sector-mate, such as UPS or FedEx.Jana and its allies are unhappy with the performance of Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive. Shares in TNT Express have fallen by a third since the demerger as sales have been hit by the downturn in Europe, declines in volume on Asia-Europe routes, and problems at the company’s Brazilian division.But PostNL, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company, has been ambivalent. Piet Klaver, chairman of PostNL’s board, has said Ms Lombard needs to be given the time to execute her strategic plans. PostNL’s chief executive, Harry Koorstra, is widely believed to be more sympathetic to Jana’s proposals.A source close to PostNL said the company was highly displeased with TNT Express’s new candidates, Marcel Smits, chief executive of Sara Lee Corporation, and Sjoerd van Keulen, chairman of the Holland Financial Centre. The source called them “more old boys’ network”, noting that neither had experience in the transport industry.The source also observed that, like current board chairman Antony Burgmans, Mr Smits formerly worked at Unilever. That would bring the number of Unilever alumni on TNT Express’s board to three.TNT shares were up 0.93 per cent to €6.28 on the Amsterdam exchange, against a drop of 0.33 per cent in the AEX index of shares.
212;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-01-24T14:40:20Z;Case study: ‘We want users to feel they are appreciated’;Jane Bird finds out how DHL upgrades its service centres;One of the pleasures of shopping locally is being recognised and valued for your custom. DHL is trying to emulate this experience in the world of international parcel delivery.It sees customer service as the key to differentiating itself from competitors FedEx and UPS.“We want customers to feel we know and appreciate them because that is how we win their loyalty,” says David Richards, commercial systems director.“It may be a truism, but it really is easier to keep an existing customer than to go out and win a new one.”This is the goal of DHL’s global customer centre upgrade programme, launched last April, and being rolled out across 20 countries by 2013.Swift response is another aim. The company answers 90 per cent of calls in three rings on average, it says.This statistic masks the fact that response times are often quick in the morning, but can be up to three minutes by the end of the day, says Adam Faulkner, founding director of Sabio, the systems integration company implementing the DHL system.“Typically, when delays occur, call-centre staff start shouting for help answering the phones, by which time queues have already developed,” says Mr Faulkner.The new system predicts call volumes based on historical information so staff can be drafted in from other activities in advance of being needed.“This makes life better for agents too, because they are not talking to an irate customer who has been holding on for ages,” Mr Faulkner says.A priority is to route callers to agents they have previously spoken to, and new callers to someone who speaks their language, based on where the call originates. The goal is to increase the proportion of calls that are resolved first time and without transfers.Customers who have indicated a preference not to speak to a person will be automatically routed to interactive voice response. “We want to give them the choice,” says Mr Richards.Those who choose to contact DHL by email should also notice improved responsiveness thanks to prioritisation of emails, rather than simply answering them in turn.Customers who have queries when using DHL’s website will be able to click a “web chat” option, on trial in the US. The company is keeping a close eye on Facebook and Twitter in case customers want to be in touch that way.“Integration with social media would help agents know more about callers and respond in a more personalised way,” says Mr Richards. At present, callers are only identified by name.This year the company also plans to evaluate real time speech analytics. Software will identify key words and phrases used by customers during their conversations with agents, to understand their concerns.The idea is to escalate problems to managers while customers are talking to agents, says Mr Faulkner, “so we can respond immediately rather than agents or managers having to call people back”.Another plan is to reduce the number of screens agents need to consult when answering unrelated queries, for example on invoicing, shipment and bookings.“Getting everything on one screen might be a challenge, but we hope to minimise the number, so agents are able to deal with a broader range of queries more quickly,” says Mr Richards.
213;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-01-16T14:02:17Z;Debate grows over future of TNT Express;;When Netherlands-based postal company TNT split in two in May, separating its international express-mail arm from its Dutch regular mail arm, it represented a triumph of shareholder activism.A group of investors led by the American hedge fund Jana Partners had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that the spun-off international delivery company TNT Express would be worth more alone and would draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx.But seven months later, TNT Express is struggling, its share price is down 37 per cent and those activist shareholders have grown restless again. Critics say the company has stumbled in executing its ambitious plans to grow out of its European home market and expand into emerging markets.Now Jana, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, is demanding that the company add to its board of directors three executives it has recruited to streamline the firm and groom it for a takeover.The slate of proposed directors is led by Alan Jones, who headed TNT’s express mail division from 1999 to 2003. At the time, he was the superior of the current chief executive, Marie-Christine Lombard, and his return would be widely seen as a rebuke to her leadership.On Monday, TNT Express told Jana it did not object to the proposal in principle. But the company stopped short of endorsing the move, saying only it was “considering” approval. If the company declines to install the new board members, Jana says it will take the proposal directly to the annual shareholders’ meeting in April.That could trigger a sharp conflict between a management team that says it needs time to turn the company around and a group of shareholders whose main desire is to see it sold.It is not clear which side shareholders will come down on. Fund manager MacKenzie Cundill, which owns 4.5 per cent of TNT Express’s shares, and Franklin Mutual, which owns 1.9 per cent, both back Jana’s move to install the new directors.MacKenzie Cundill vice-president David Tiley said TNT Express’s private response to Jana did not go far enough.“In terms of full disclosure, it behoves the board of TNT Express to make those comments public to all shareholders,” Mr Tiley told the Financial Times.But the key lies with PostNL, the Dutch mail company formed out of TNT after the demerger, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company.PostNL officially says it has confidence in TNT Express’s current board. But those with knowledge of its internal discussions say there is ongoing debate, and that chief executive Harry Koorstra might end up backing the move.TNT Express’s troubles are partly due to the slowdown in the European economy that began this summer. Delivery companies are bellwethers of the industrial economy, and as the leader in the European market (and fourth-largest delivery company globally) TNT is especially vulnerable to the downturn.But other problems are of the company’s own making. The worst have come in Brazil, where TNT acquired two local firms in 2010 as part of its global expansion into emerging markets.The company botched the integration of the firms, on-time delivery fell as low as 50 per cent, and clients switched to rival providers. TNT Express took a €132m impairment on its American operations in August.Mrs Lombard has personally taken supervision of the Brazil operations and promises to make them profitable by the second half of this year.Meanwhile, problems appeared this fall in another linchpin of the company’s emerging-markets strategy, China. TNT Express had acquired four 747s to serve its Europe-Asia routes and boasted of being the first international express company with direct flights to the new industrial hub of Chongqing.But those aircraft became a liability when China-Europe volumes plunged this autumn. The company’s high-fixed operating costs have cut into margins and it is now seeking to lease out two of its aircraft.Both in Europe and on international routes, customers have shifted from high-priced same- or next-day delivery to cheaper three-day deliveries. That cuts revenues by 30 per cent per package, and the shift is expected to continue with European countries implementing austerity measures this yearThe worsening outlook has strengthened analysts’ case that TNT Express’s most promising future lies in a takeover by FedEx or UPS. Both US-based companies would see substantial synergies from TNT Express’s strength in the European market.A Morgan Stanley report in November put the target price for TNT Express at €6.25 per share. Meanwhile, the report found the company’s value to a suitor such as FedEx could justify a takeover price of up to €9.65 per share.Jana hopes the move to add the new board members will serve as a signal to potential buyers that the company is serious about a sale. Besides Mr Jones, they include David Siegel, known for aggressive cost-cutting in the aviation industry and at Avis, and Thomas Delbrook, former head of mergers and acquisitions at UPS.But there have been no reports of concrete inquiries from either FedEx or UPS in years. Dutch analysts have wondered, if TNT Express is not attractive to its American sector-mates at its current depressed valuations, why it would be attractive if the stewardship of Mr Jones and other directors manages to raise share prices.Regardless of shareholders’ wishes, there may be no shortcut to putting TNT Express on a sounder footing.“They’ve got a couple of strategic problems that may or may not have been caused by the current management team,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “That doesn’t necessarily mean these can be solved overnight by putting a couple of extra people on the board.”But Mr Tiley said the problem was that management had not adjusted its vision to address shareholder desires for a takeover.“We are bemused by the absence of any public discussion or openness to the prospect of consolidation,” Mr Tiley said. “The entire point of the demerger was for there to be an unlocking of value in both companies.”
214;FDX;Fedex Corp;2012-01-16T14:02:17Z;Debate grows over future of TNT Express;;TNT Express, the Dutch express delivery company, has indicated it wants to avoid a direct conflict with activist shareholders and may accept their proposal to nominate three additional members to its board of directors.TNT has told Jana Partners it does not object in principle to the nomination of the new board members, which the hedge fund hopes will push the struggling company to move faster to streamline costs and open itself up for takeover bids.In a letter sent on Tuesday by TNT Express to Jana Partners, the company said it was still considering the proposal, but stopped short of endorsing it, a source who had seen the letter said.The proposed board members include Alan Jones, who was current chief executive Marie-Christine Lombard’s superior when he headed the express-mail division of the company (then known as TNT) from 1999-2003.If TNT Express eventually declines to endorse the new board members, Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns some 5 per cent of the company’s shares, says it will put them forward at the annual shareholder meeting in April. In that case approval will hinge on the votes of sister company PostNL, the Dutch mail deliverer, which retained a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT Express after the two companies demerged in May.That demerger was itself a triumph of Jana Partners’ activist philosophy. The hedge fund had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that a spun-off express-mail division would be worth more and draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx.TNT Express’s share price has fallen 38 per cent since the demerger on disappointing profit margins, and shareholders say management has been slow to shift gears. The new board members, who besides Mr Jones include former airline cost-cutter David Siegel and ex-UPS mergers and acquisitions chief Thomas Delbrook, are expected to groom the company for a takeover.There is active debate within PostNL over what position to take. Officially, the company says it wants to allow Mrs Lombard to execute her strategy and sees no need for new directors. Piet Klaver, chairman of PostNL’s board of directors, told the Dutch press last week that he had “full confidence in the current board of directors”.But those with knowledge of PostNL’s internal discussions said Mr Klaver had jumped the gun by committing the company to oppose the new directors. They said PostNL’s chief executive, Harry Koorstra, might yet end up backing the move.TNT Express is wrestling with the botched integration of two Brazilian delivery companies it acquired in 2010, and more recently with a collapse of demand on its China-Europe routes due to the economic downturn. Customers in Europe, where it is the sector leader, are switching from priority delivery to slower, cheaper products.
215;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-12-21T18:14:22Z;Cargo carriers escape new US pilot rules;;Cargo airlines run by companies such as United Parcel Service and FedEx will be exempt from new Federal Aviation Administration rules designed to reduce accidents due to pilot fatigue.The rules, which require pilots to rest more and work shorter stints and are the most extensive overhaul of pilot fatigue regulations in decades, were prompted in part by the Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York, in 2009 that killed 50 people.Since 2010, the prospect of new fatigue rules has caused consternation among airlines and air cargo operators who have argued that while well-intentioned, initial proposals were not based on scientific evidence and would impose considerable financial burdens.Airlines for America, the main lobby group for the US airline industry, forecast that the original proposal could have cost airlines as much as $20bn to implement over ten years, more than 15 times the FAA’s early estimate.Ray LaHood, secretary for transportation, described the new regulations on Wednesday as “a major safety achievement” that “raises the safety bar to prevent fatigue”. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about 53,000 pilots in the US and Canada, also broadly welcomed the new rules.But some unions reacted strongly to the cargo airline exemption. Captain Robert Travis, president of the Independent Pilots Association, which represents UPS pilots, criticised the FAA for succumbing to “intense industry lobbying”.“Giving air cargo carriers the choice to opt-in to new pilot rest rules makes as much sense as allowing truckers to ‘opt-out’ of drunk driving laws,” Mr Travis said.Steve Alterman, president of the Cargo Airline Association, which represents companies such as FedEx Express and UPS, rejected those assertions, stating that “the US aviation industry is not a unified whole and one size does not fit all”.In response to some 8,000 comments, the FAA scaled back its final regulations, substantially reducing new training requirements and exempting all-cargo operators from the rules entirely despite an earlier commitment to imposing a uniform industry standard.“Covering cargo operators under the new rule would be too costly compared to the benefits generated in this portion of the industry,” the FAA said, adding that it would encourage “cargo operators to opt into the new rule voluntarily”.The new rules will impose considerable change on the passenger airline industry. Pilots’ maximum duty hours will be reduced, rest time will be increased and they will also have to certify their “fitness for duty” before each flight segment.As a result of the changes, the FAA estimates the rules will cost the industry about $390m to implement over the next ten years but will bring as much as $470m in benefits due to a reduction in fatigue-related accidents.
216;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-12-16T21:47:28Z;First Solar eclipsed in bad week for energy stocks;S&P 500 falls to December lows;A disastrous week for First Solar piled pressure on to US solar energy stocks.The world’s largest solar panel manufacturer by market capitalisation saw its share price fall by a third after it warned of “indefinite” pressure on margins, as a glut of solar panel supply puts downward pressure on prices. Analysts were unimpressed by a new strategy to sell completed solar farms to electricity utilities, rather than sell individual panels.“The new strategy does not look much different from the old one,” said Theodore O’Neill, renewables analyst at Wunderlich Securities. “First Solar has no competitive advantage in building for utilities, it has no choice but to cut the cost of panels.” First Solar ended the week off 30.1 per cent to $31.91, a price not seen since 2007.Yingli Green Energy fell 19.1 per cent to $3.60, SunPower Corp was down 22.7 per cent to $5.13 and MEMC Electronics Materials, which manufactures wafers for use in solar panels, fell 13.3 per cent to $3.83.Elsewhere the week started with a sharp sell-off as investors reassessed last Friday’s eurozone deal, and markets headed further south on Tuesday as the Federal Open Market Committee left monetary policy unchanged.Analysts said investment decisions were increasingly dependent on political events.“No one wants to be short going in to major summits or policy meetings in case they come up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Once they pass investors are more willing to exit.”The S&P 500 closed the week down 2.8 per cent to 1,219.65, now off more than 2 per cent in December, historically a strong month for the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.6 per cent to 11,866.24, but at least remained in positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.5 per cent to 2,555.33, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, fell 3.2 per cent to $381.02.The iPad manufacturer was knocked by Intel’s plans to expand into hard disk drive-free ultrabooks, which could claim market share from Apple’s MacBook Air, and reduce demand for tablets.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 3.8 per cent over the week, led down by investment banks. Goldman Sachs fell 11.2 per cent to $90.10, a bad week made worse when Fitch Ratings downgraded its debt on Friday, along with bonds of Bank of America and Citigroup. Banks with large deposit taking retail franchises fared better, with JPMorgan Chase down just 3.9 per cent to $31.89 and Wells Fargo off only 3.5 per cent to $25.98.Energy stocks sold off heavily as the price of crude oil fell sharply.Independent oil explorers were hit hardest, with Range Resources falling 11.6 per cent to $60.20 and Cabot Oil and Gas down 8.6 per cent to $74.17.“The independents are the most exposed to changes in the oil price because unlike the integrated oil companies and majors, they don’t have any diversification into refining activities,” said Amir Arif at Stifel Nicolaus.Evidence of a shift to online sales boosted delivery firms, but led to fears of margin compression at physical retailers.Shares in FedEx climbed 2 per cent to $84.89 after the package delivery service reported earnings for the three months ended November 30 that were 76 per cent higher than last year.“It’s good news for the domestic economy, and especially good news for anyone tied to eCommerce,” said Donald Broughton at Avondale Partners.Shares in Best Buy fell 17.5 per cent to $23.19 after the electronics retailer missed earnings expectations, as it absorbed the cost of free shipping to online shoppers.In the three months to November 26, gross margin declined 76 basis points to 24.3 per cent.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend in both consumer electronics and across retail as the cost of sales increases, as the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Research In Motion slumped 18.3 per cent to $13.44, with most of the damage done on Friday, after the BlackBerry handset maker said its new range of smartphones will not be available until the “latter part” of 2012.Zynga pulled off the biggest internet IPO since Google in 2004, raising $1bn by issuing 100m shares, which valued the company at $7bn overall.

217;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Chiquita to stop use of tar sands oil;;Chiquita Brands, the fruit producer, has become the latest company to move to stop using oil from Canada’s tar sands in its fuel supplies, after a campaign by an environmental group.The decision marks the latest success for protesters against tar sands production, who say it creates more damaging pollution both locally and in terms of carbon dioxide emissions than conventional oil.The move provoked an angry response in Canada, and one business group called for a retaliatory boycott of Chiquita bananas.Chiquita has committed to identifying all the fuel suppliers for its own trucking fleet and dedicated fleets provided by contractors, so it can stop buying from any that it believes sell diesel made from tar sands oil.ForestEthics, an environmental group based in Washington state, had run a targeted campaign against Chiquita and Dole, another fruit company, using press advertisements, protests at stores and consumer petitions.It also encouraged activists to bombard the companies’ Facebook pages with criticism of their oil use, forcing Chiquita to close comments on its page for a time.Aaron Sanger, US campaigns director of ForestEthics, said the group had first written to Chiquita in November 2010 and then in the spring of this year set a deadline for a response, after which it launched its campaign.In a letter to ForestEthics announcing the commitment, Manuel Rodriguez, a senior vice-president of Chiquita, said the company had “a long record of protecting the environment and working to reduce its carbon footprint globally”.Having had a controversial history, particularly during its previous incarnation as the United Fruit Company, Chiquita has been working since 1992 with the Rainforest Alliance, another conservation group, and all of its owned farms meet that organisation’s social and environmental standards.Chiquita’s move brings to 15 the number of companies that have announced policies expected to cut or end their use of tar sands oil, including Avon, Walgreen and Trader Joe’s, Mr Sanger said.The policies are of varying strength. Federal Express, for example, has a general commitment to “evaluation of environmental impacts of FedEx packaging products, operations and facilities with a commitment to minimise impacts”.Mr Sanger said the trend against the use of tar sands oil was accelerating.“For any company, the comparison between any odd pennies per gallon extra they may have to pay for their fuel and the potential damage to their brand weighs strongly in favour of avoiding the damage to the brand,” he said.Identifying the original sources of road fuel is difficult because of the complexity of the distribution system. However, ForestEthics is working to identify refineries that source crude oil from the tar sands, so it can advise companies not to use fuel from those suppliers.ForestEthics is now highlighting Walmart and Safeway in its campaign.Tim Shipton, president of the Alberta Enterprise Group, which represents employers in the province, said Chiquita’s move showed it had failed to understand the strength of the industry’s environmental safeguards and the social and economic benefits of its activities.“What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” he said. “Apparently strong measures are needed, which is why we are pushing back and saying Canadians should boycott Chiquita bananas.”Chiquita’s move follows success for anti-tar sands campaigners last month, when the US administration decided to delay a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline intended to carry oil from Canada to refineries in Texas.Much of the opposition to tar sands production, including the campaign against Keystone XL, has focused on the carbon dioxide emissions generated when the oil is extracted and processed.Studies have suggested there are some other forms of oil sold in the US, such as Nigerian crude, that are associated with higher carbon dioxide emissions than some forms of tar sands oil.However, Mr Sanger said deforestation and local pollution in Alberta in western Canada were also reasons to oppose tar sands production.
218;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-12-15T21:47:19Z;FedEx results boost Wall Street;FedEx boosted by strong earnings;Shares in FedEx climbed 8 per cent to $83.47 after the package delivery service reported earnings for the three months ended November 30 that were 76 per cent higher than last year.“It’s good news for the domestic economy, and especially good news for anyone tied to eCommerce,” said Donald Broughton at Avondale Partners. “Management were clear that the incremental volume increase in ground shipping was due to a surge in eCommerce orders.”But sales rose much less than earnings, just 10 per cent year-on-year, and some analysts said there was little read across from the FedEx results to the wider economy.“A lot of investors look at FedEx as primarily a macro-driven stock that’s sensitive to volumes, but since DHL exited the US, the delivery market is effectively a duopoly. What we are seeing is FedEx and UPS pricing rationally to maintain earnings even if volumes are soft,” said Peter Nesvold at Jefferies.FedEx’s performance boosted shares in Amazon, which climbed 0.6 per cent to $181.26, but not Ebay, which fell 2.6 per cent to $29.60, on market chatter that December volumes on the auction site have been disappointing so far.Elsewhere, US stocks snapped three days of selling to eke out gains after new jobless claims fell to a three-year low.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,215.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,870.02. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed just 0.1 per cent to 2,541.01 as tech stocks had a poor day.Apple slipped 0.3 per cent to $378.94 as investors continued to fret that Intel’s move into hard drive-free ultrabook computers could impact sales of Apple products. “We think competitors’ ultrabooks need to fall below $800 before they start taking market share from Apple’s MacBook air, or offering an alternative to tablets such as the iPad,” said Ashok Kumar, tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw.Solar shares continued to bleed on Thursday after Wednesday’s profit warning by First Solar added to fears of over supply and cost competition in the global solar panel industry.First Solar shares were down another 6 per cent to $31.45, after falling more than 20 per cent on Wednesday. Stephen Chin at UBS was unconvinced by the company’s plans to cut factory utilisation to 80 per cent and concentrate on developing large solar farms for sale to electricity utilities.“We believe First Solar may need to consider shutting down more capacity if it is unable to win more big projects,” he told clients.MEMC Electronic Materials, which manufactures wafers for use in solar panels, fell 5.2 per cent to $3.71. That left the tech sector of the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent, along with energy stocks, the only sector of the benchmark index to close in the red.Novellus Systems popped 16.3 per cent to $40.37 after Lam Research agreed to purchase the company for about $3.3bn in stock. The combination of two of the biggest companies in the semiconductor space is a challenge to market leader Applied Materials, which slipped 1.4 per cent to $10.19. Shares in Lam fell 8.4 per cent to $36.17.Morgan Stanley shares ticked down fractionally to $15.02 after the investment bank announced it will slash 1,600 jobs, or about 2.6 per cent of its global workforce, in the first quarter of 2012.Goldman Sachs was off 1.4 per cent to $91.97, as Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, predicted another downbeat quarter for investment banking revenues with markets volatile.“Overall, we think [the fourth quarter] will be another quarter that banks will prefer to forget,” Mr Staite told clients.Banks with strong retail franchises outperformed the market, with Bank of America climbing 0.7 per cent to $5.27 and JPMorgan Chase up 0.8 per cent to $31.77.Capital One slipped 2.9 per cent to $43.05 after the credit card company said net charge offs of bad debt rose to 4.29 per cent in November from 3.96 per cent in October.Shares in Michael Kors, an upmarket fashion and accessories brand, jumped 21 per cent to $24.20 on their first day of trading after the biggest ever US fashion IPO. The IPO, which was heavily subscribed, valued the company at nearly $4bn.

219;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-12-15T18:28:48Z;Resilient freight demand boosts FedEx;Parcel carrier surprises with freighter order;FedEx provided the latest evidence of resilient freight demand in the face of the world economic slowdown, reporting a 76 per cent rise in net income to $497m for the three months to November 30, on growing volumes in both its core express parcel and air freight divisions.The international parcels and air freight company on Thursday also indicated confidence in the continuing health of European demand in spite of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. It shares rose 7.1 per cent to trade at $81.81 by lunchtime in New York trading after release of the results.FedEx also announced a surprise order for 27 767-300 freighter aircraft from Boeing, worth around $4.6bn at list prices, from which it will have received a substantial discount. It will defer receipt of 11 already ordered Boeing 777 aircraft until later this decade under the deal and will exercise options to receive a further two aircraft.The company also said it had reconfigured its FedEx Express network, particularly in Asia, after a rundown in the inventories of its clients had reduced demand in parts of the network.Michael Glenn, executive vice-president for market development, said destocking had delivered a “headwind” for FedEx in recent months. “Continued growth in demand should lead to restocking in coming months, which should benefit our company,” he said.FedEx’s figures and its prognosis for the rest of its financial year, which runs to the end of May, were both markedly more buoyant than when it last announced figures in September. Its shares fell sharply then after it cut its full-year earnings forecast, blaming falling US and European consumer confidence.In November, both Denmark’s Maersk Line, operator of the world’s largest container ship fleet, and Deutsche Post’s DHL logistics operation announced continued strong growth in demand for the July to October quarter. Maersk’s container volumes were up 16 per cent year-on-year, while DHL’s express parcels volumes rose 11 per cent.FedEx’s average daily packages delivered rose 2 per cent to 3.69m from the same quarter the previous year, after a rise of 49 per cent to 529,000 in the number of domestic packages carried in foreign markets. The company has bought domestic package services in India and Mexico this year. Average daily freight weight also grew 2 per cent, to 12.3m pounds.In the troubled European market the company was improving services and customers had responded by giving the company more traffic to carry, said David Bronczek, chief executive of Fedex Express.“For the next six months, we see pretty much business as usual for us,” he said.The net income figure was struck on revenue up 10 per cent to $10.6bn. Earnings per share rose 76 per cent to $1.57 compared with the same quarter last year, when figures were depressed by 27 cents in one-off costs.
220;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-12-04T17:39:17Z;Deutsche Post pins hopes on e-commerce;;Email may be killing the traditional paper-and-ink letter but Deutsche Post DHL, Germany’s privatised post office, now believes the internet will bring it more joy than sorrow, especially around Christmas. While a wire can carry words, it cannot – at least just yet – deliver presents, food or drink.Deutsche Post says letter volumes will decline by an annual 2-3 per cent in coming years, but expects its domestic parcels business to thrive as big investments in sorting machines and services persuade more people to buy on the internet – and online vendors to use Deutsche Post for shipping.“E-commerce is interesting, because we currently seem to buy only the things we can easily pocket – books and CDs,” says Frank Appel, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times on the 40th floor of Deutsche Post DHL’s vertiginous glazed headquarters in Bonn. “But why not buy bottles over the web? Why buy clothes but not toothpaste on the internet? Things will really change.”Deutsche Post handles 2.7m domestic parcels a day – 5.4m in the run-up to Christmas – and is struggling to keep up. With e-commerce expected to boost domestic volumes 5 per cent annually over the next few years, the company plans to invest €750m by 2014 to more than double its automated parcel sorting capacity to an hourly 50,000 units. “We expect to hit our limits soon,” says Mr Appel.Deutsche Post DHL emerged from the cocoon of state ownership 11 years ago, on 20 November 2000. With European postal markets being opened only slowly, Deutsche Post had time to use monopoly profits to prepare for life after the end of its special status on 1 January 2008.“The Germans allowed Post to keep its monopoly long enough to produce the money it needed to restructure,” Mr Appel says of a plan which drew criticism from commercial rivals like UPS and FedEx.Apart from restructuring its domestic postal operation, Deutsche Post took a leap into international waters in 2002 when it bought logistics group DHL. Although DHL spectacularly failed to build a US domestic express network, it has shored up its position as a fast-growing cross-border specialist.While the number of employees in Germany has fallen from 227,000 to 203,000 over the past decade, Post’s overseas workforce has grown from 97,000 to 267,000. “We’re well on the road to having a stable profit contribution from the domestic mail services and steady growth in international logistics,” Mr Appel says, praising successive German governments for not interfering when jobs or branches were axed.“There’s luck involved,” Mr Appel says, particularly in reference to Post’s performance at home. “But maybe fortune does favour the bold.” In his view, the company profited from Germany’s e-commerce surge as it had invested in infrastructure and services. “If you’re service isn’t good, you can’t do B2C [business-to-consumer].”Despite the gloom settling on the global economy, Mr Appel is also ebullient about the prospects for DHL, which has in past years focused on its strengths as an international logistics group by shedding domestic operations. Express mail should grow up to twice as fast as the global economy, he says.While the company’s biggest rivals, UPS and FedEx of the US, were betraying the first signs of dizziness at the prospect of global recession, Mr Appel a few weeks ago raised slightly Deutsche Post’s 2010 forecast for its international DHL franchise, as well as for its domestic letters and parcels operation.“Express is our fastest growing business. We’re strong in the fastest-growing markets – Asia and the Middle East – which means we can profit over-proportionally,” Mr Appel says. As the costs of building a network are high, big new rivals alongside the US duo and Dutch TNT are unlikely, he adds. “It’s not like manufacturing, where a Chinese company can decide to compete with you tomorrow.”Mr Appel insists he does not see a recession looming – although he also does not completely dismiss the danger given economic uncertainties. One result of this is that companies are manufacturing on demand and not filling inventories. “This suggests that if a downturn comes, the landing will be soft,” he says.If consumers keep spending, he says, “we could even see air cargo and express shipments rise as companies, who have kept inventories cautiously low, try to get products to clients before Christmas”.Mr Appel is clearly looking forward to Deutsche Post’s busiest time of the year. “Germany had tonnes of snow last year – and loads of first-time internet shoppers,” he said. “If it’s a white Christmas, do your shopping on the web and we’ll deliver. I like a white Christmas. Who would want a grey one?”
221;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-11-11T13:40:59Z;Kenya to India: exporting the mobile money model;;"At a leafy Nairobi private members club that so delights in a bygone era it bans telephones, Michael Joseph, former chief executive of Safaricom, is telling his well-to-do audience they don’t understand mobile money.“Our target market was actually the guy standing outside there waiting to serve you dinner or drinks…we didn’t aim for you,” says the current strategy advisor to the World Bank and Vodafone. The UK company owns 40 per cent of Safaricom, the telephone company that launched a mobile money transfer service so successful it speedily took over Kenya’s economy and business school syllabuses worldwide.Kenyans pay school fees, collect their salaries, shop for groceries, buy everything from drinks in beer shacks to airline tickets thanks to mobile money, sending transfers at the push of a few buttons on a mobile telephone. Some of the audience pays its workers by M-PESA, named after the Swahili for money (pesa). If Joseph has his way, Kenyans will also soon insure themselves on a grand scale against ill-health, for funeral costs, make savings and take out loans.Since it launched in 2007, the service has garnered 15.1m customers. At peak times, there are 200 transactions every second and the equivalent to 20 per cent of the country’s GDP washes through the system.“This thing grew like topsy, it’s an incredible growth curve,” says Joseph.The company is so dominant, with about 80 per cent of the mobile market, that as Joseph points out, even those who rely on rival schemes still deploy “M-PESA” as a verb akin to Xerox or Fedex.But replicating Safaricom’s success has long proved beyond reach. Since the UK’s aid agency gave a £1m grant in 2006 to try to facilitate microfinance payments, which led to the birth of the service, none of the other 120 or so copycat mobile money platforms has performed as well. Only the Philippines comes close, with about 3m customers, while Tanzania may yet overcome a sluggish start.When it started, Joseph says M-PESA was never intended to make a profit, only to increase customer loyalty, but within two years it was profitable and today it provides 16 per cent of Safaricom revenues, saving this week’s deeply disappointing half-year results from an even worse performance.No longer Safaricom CEO, Joseph’s new day job is convincing regulators across the world to open up to mobile money.While he has no truck with South Africa for its tardy take-up, Joseph thinks India will take off. “India will probably be the next big place,” he says, after the regulator visited Kenya and altered its policies. “It will dwarf anything, if they get it right, that we have in Kenya.”In a variant on the Kenyan model, the Indian mobile money will have to partner with a bank, meaning customers might even make interest from the money they store. In Kenya, 12-15bn shillings are stored on M-PESA systems at any one time, but Safaricom is not allowed to make a profit on the interest and neither is the customer. Instead, interest earnings go into a charitable M-PESA foundation. Any attempt to change this is likely to spook banks, which have in the past attempted to close down M-PESA.Central banks outside Kenya have been wary of giving way to mobile money, fearful that too much money will circulate outside their control, of the negative impact it might have on the banking system and of the risk of fraud. Safaricom has already sacked 2 per cent of its workforce for fraud this year, and last month Kenyan prisons agreed to jam prison network coverage because inmates have proved all too cunning at innovating mobile money scams along the lines of “whoops I just sent you $2,000 by mistake, please send it back to me soonest”. Even so, Joseph says fraud within M-PESA is a twentieth of that within the banking system.In Kenya, he says success is down to two crucial factors: his own determination to push it through when he was Safaricom chief and a distribution network of 32,000 agents nationwide.“My role was to make it happen. I just said you have to do it, and if you don’t do it I’ll fire you,” he says, adding not entirely convincingly that he didn’t mean it. M-PESA agents were also branded, trained and uniformed. “You can’t just have some scummy little store…we have to pretend to be like banks. Banks pretend that they’re very rich by having this very super nice hall with marble and columns and all this stuff, so you think they’re rich, so they won’t steal your money; as you know it’s an illusion,” he jibes. “Unless you put the agent out there it doesn’t happen.”Even South Africa, which took umbrage at the thought of doing business with agents who often doubled as illegal immigrants who don’t pay taxes, seems to be softening. Where once it produced a 21-page document of regulations keeping mobile money in check, today’s rules fill only six pages. Joseph says they are beginning to understand that mobile money can usefully knit together formal and informal economies – linking legal money transfer and listed company’s bottom lines to an informal network of agents.“This is a new way of banking – it’s not an extension of traditional banking,” he says, before heading off to the airport to take up his cause with regulators worldwide.Related reading:

222;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-11-09T17:33:11Z;Deutsche Post;The mail and express delivery group is beating expectations, with room for outperformance;It would be difficult to find a better bellwether for the state of Europe’s economy than Deutsche Post. Since the start of 2010, its shares have almost exactly tracked the Euro Stoxx 50 index, falling by 21 per cent. But with a second European credit crunch descending, and a recession looming, Europe’s biggest mail and express delivery group was even beating expectations, raising its full-year profit forecast and sounding fairly relaxed about 2012 on Wednesday. Time for a little stock market outperformance, perhaps?There are two good reasons for the company’s optimism. The first is the strong showing of the DHL express division in Asia-Pacific, where a long-established presence gives it a market share that outstrips peers such as UPS or FedEx. Underlying express sales – which account for almost a quarter of Deutsche Post’s total – were up 13 per cent in the third quarter, driven by business within Asia and from the US into that region. The second is more surprising: a stellar performance by the German-based parcel business as online shopping expands. Third-quarter parcel volumes were up 11.4 per cent from a year ago, helping to lift overall mail division revenues by 2.6 per cent to €3.37bn. That was enough for Deutsche Post to nudge up its full-year guidance for earnings before interest and tax to more than €2.4bn, from €2.3-€2.4bn.It insists that its business should outpace global economic output and that underlying revenues will continue to grow. Investors will want to weigh such optimism against signs of weakness in the global forwarding and freight division, which reported “significant cooling-off” in air freight and a dip in ocean freight revenues. But Deutsche Post shares, trading on less than 10 times full-year earnings, are not expensive relative to UPS (over 16 times) and FedEx (almost 13). Plenty of room there for some outperformance.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
223;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-11-09T07:42:29Z;Deutsche Post receives fillip from DHL growth;;German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post on Wednesday raised its full-year business forecast amid profits from efficiency gains, internet-driven growth in its domestic parcel business, and fast-growing delivery volumes in Asia.The Bonn company said it now expected 2011 earnings before interest and taxes to exceed €2.4bn ($3.3bn) compared with a previous forecast of €2.3bn, with both domestic mail and DHL logistics contributing to the rise.Frank Appel, chief executive, said Deutsche Post would continue to profit from recent drives to increase efficiency and customer service at home and abroad and “would raise margins even as the recent economic momentum declines”.With this year’s operating earnings expected to rise at least 9 per cent from 2010, Mr Appel also said he was “cautiously optimistic” about growth in 2012 – even if economic and market uncertainty made a more precise forecast impossible.With that Mr Appel sounded more optimistic than Dutch rival TNT Express, which recently issued a profit warning, and US rivals UPS and FedEx. The latter recently warned about the “challenging economic environment” ahead.Group sales rose 2.5 per cent to €13.1bn in the third quarter, while ebit climbed 18.5 per cent to €646m. Net profit jumped 70.4 per cent to €385m in part because of the completion of the sale of Postbank to Deutsche Bank.Deutsche Post has worked hard to build DHL into a global provider of supply chain, shipping, and express-parcel services in order to cushion the end of much of its German mail monopoly in the course of European Union liberalisation.Mr Appel said Deutsche Post’s domestic letter and parcel service would profit this and next year from a deal with its union allowing it to hire new recruits for less pay, and from an unbroken trend towards more web-based shopping in Germany.Deutsche Post delivered 205m parcels in Germany in the third quarter, an increase of 11.4 per cent. This helped raise the domestic mail unit’s quarterly ebit 17.5 per cent to €257m, with annual ebit now expected to stabilise at €1bn.Only 8 per cent of German retail sales are made online, but Mr Appel said he expected web sales to grow to reach the low double-digit range and Deutsche Post planned to double its parcel-sorting capacity over the medium-term to handle this.After pulling out of the US domestic delivery market, DHL has focused on its international footprint, connecting the US, Europe and Asia, but also pan-European and, increasingly, pan-Asian services for boxes big and small.“You’ll find us where growth is also strongest,” Mr Appel said in a statement. “That means in emerging markets in Asia, in the Middle East, and in Latin America, as well as in the fast-growing parcel market in Germany.”According to Deutsche Post, DHL is Asian market leader for international express-delivery items, taking some 36 per cent of the Asia-Pacific market, ahead of FedEx with 21 per cent and UPS with 10 per cent – with scope to continue growing.DHL’s express service carried 526,000 parcels a day in the quarter, up 11 per cent on the year. DHL’s three units saw operating profit grow 15.2 per cent to €382m in the quarter, with Deutsche Poste expecting them to reach €1.7bn for the year.
224;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-10-28T15:39:54Z;Overview: Industry searches for clean break from past;Innovation thrives and the business case is clear but official support is critical, writes Sarah Murray;With $243bn poured into the sector globally, 2010 was a record year for clean technology investment – up 30 per cent on the previous year, according to Bloom­berg New Energy Finance.And while entrepreneurs are developing new ideas in everything from renewable energy to waste recycling, large companies have also seen the potential for clean technologies to generate new revenue streams and reduce their environmental footprints.Yet despite the business benefits, a number of obstacles lie in the way of speedy uptake of clean technologies, particularly in mature economies.First, the presence of existing infrastructure, vested interests and legacy systems makes it hard for new technologies to take hold, regardless of how much cheaper and more efficient they might be.In this respect, developing countries have an advantage – a relatively clean slate. When it comes to renewable energy, for example, it is easier to bring clean technologies and systems to populations that lack any access to power.As a result, populations in countries such as India and China are benefiting from ideas that range from rechargeable solar lamps to low-cost water filters and solar-powered water pumps that can be paid for using a mobile phone.In many cases, the innovations being deployed in emerging markets are less about the technology itself and more about new business models.Leasing models help make solar equipment affordable for low-income consumers and the ability to pay for renewable energy services through mobile phones increases accessibility, particularly for remote rural communities.These kinds of solutions are harder to introduce in mature markets, where replacing complex infrastructure is a long-term and costly business.For this reason, government support remains critical, whether in terms of new legislation or tax credits for renewable energy technologies.Yet with rising national debt prompting budget cuts in many countries, governments are questioning whether they can continue to fund the clean technology programmes and subsidies that have helped foster innovation in this field.As well as offering carrots, policymakers can wield sticks. In Europe, for example, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive requiring producers and retailers to retrieve and recycle their products is prompting the development of products that use fewer materials and are easier to unpick at the end of their lives.However, austerity means policymakers also need to become more creative in the way they support clean-tech industries. Evidence of this is emerging, with some governments fostering innovation through incubators or centres of excellence, rather than through tax credits.Meanwhile, market forces are driving innovation. Rising prices for materials such as metals and plastics have led to the growth of some parts of the recycling industry, prompting the development of cutting-edge technologies that can retrieve these materials from products ranging from mobile phones to vehicles.Recognition of the cost benefits of energy efficiency is also prompting development of green technologies.These include smart meters, which use information technology to monitor the power supply, and systems that combine LED lighting with sensors detecting motion or the amount of natural light present and adjusting lighting systems accordingly.Clean technology is often associated with nimble entrepreneurs or scientists. And some of their ideas take clean-tech innovation into another realm.Take San Francisco-based Climos. To tackle climate change, the company is developing ocean iron fertilisation, a form of carbon sequestration whereby iron powder added into the oceans would encourage the growth of plankton, which store carbon.Funding the development of these and other ideas is a growing number of venture capital firms, some of which specialise in clean technologies and others that have expanded their portfolios to include start-ups in areas such as advanced biofuels, renewable energy generation, electric vehicles, smart grids, energy efficiency, battery technology and grid storage.For investors, there are winners and losers. In the Cleantech Group’s 2011 Global Greentech report – which identifies the top 100 clean-tech companies around the world – some 42 of those in last year’s list have dropped out, reflecting the high casualty rate in this relatively immature market.The list suggests that energy efficiency remains a sector with great potential.In the 2011 Global Greentech report, 19 of the top 100 companies are developing energy efficiency technologies and solutions, up from 15 in last year’s list.Meanwhile, growing concern for conserving natural resources is reflected in a rise in the number of companies on the list focusing on water or materials.But venture capital companies and the clean-tech start-ups they invest in are not alone in wanting to capitalise on what some have called “the next industrial revolution”. Large corporations, too, are busy identifying and developing what they hope will be tomorrow’s most marketable clean technologies.One only has to look at General Electric’s strategy to see how the company is using environmental opportunities to bolster its revenues. Last year, the company added 22 products and solutions to its “ecomagination” portfolio and generated $18bn in related revenues.For some companies, internal research and development resources are the means of pursuing these opportunities. However, companies are increasingly taking a broader approach to identifying and commercialising new ideas.Some have funded or formed partnerships with start-ups or academics. Tata, for example, has invested in an affordable alternative solar energy system being developed by Daniel Nocera, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.Others companies work with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to develop their ideas. When developing the first fleet of commercially viable hybrid trucks, FedEx worked in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund, a US-based environmental group.In the US, the Nature Conservancy is working with farmers to reduce agricultural water consumption. On the Flint River, in south-west Georgia, the organisation is helping develop technologies that cut water use in the cultivation of crops such as cotton, pecans and corn by up to 30 per cent.The technologies being developed range from simple devices, such as more efficient irrigation nozzles, to high-tech solutions such as variable rate irrigation systems that use GPS-based software to identify non-crop areas and prevent irrigation water being wasted on them.Meanwhile, IT is becoming more important, as organisations see the value in monitoring and reducing resource consumption.Remote sensors combined with flow meters can detect water leaks while advanced geospatial analytics aggregates data on water consumption, allowing companies to assess their exposure to global stress. Using smart meters, organisations can collect and analyse data on energy use in order to reduce their consumption and cut industrial carbon emissions.Businesspeople from all sectors often like to repeat the adage: “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.”But nowhere is this phrase more appropriate than in discussions about how to develop clean technologies that can sustain human activities while reducing their impact on the planet.
225;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-10-25T12:48:43Z;UPS profits rise on higher prices;;United Parcel Service warned there were signs of slowing global growth due to decelerating technology exports from Asia as the global package delivery company reported strong third-quarter results and said the US economy had stabilised.In recent months, executives at UPS and also at FedEx, its main US rival, have trimmed their expectations for economic growth, blaming political gridlock in Washington and Brussels for undermining business confidence and in turn hurting the economic recovery.On Tuesday, Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, offered investors a mixed outlook. “There is increasing uncertainty in the global economic environment. Most notably exports from Asia which slowed significantly during the quarter,” he said.“On the other hand, it appears that the US economy has stabilised and continues to show modest growth,” Mr Davis said. “In general, we are probably a little more optimistic than we were one or two months ago.”UPS executives pointed to a series of recent economic reports showing better retail sales, lower unemployment claims and an increase in bank loans for the company’s slightly more positive view on the US economy.At the same time, Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said the company could see a boost over the holiday season. Retailers have reduced their inventories, he said, so if sales improve they might have to use express air services to get hold of the goods they need.Indeed, despite being cautious about the outlook, in September UPS laid out an ambitious five-year growth plan, telling investors that the company would achieve an annual compounded earnings growth rate of 10 to 15 per cent until 2016.Investors watch UPS closely for insights into the health of the global economy. The company delivers packages to tens of thousands of companies and individuals around the world and at any moment moves about 2 per cent of global gross domestic product in its networks.For the three months to the end of September, net income at UPS rose about 5 per cent to $1bn compared with the same period in 2010, giving earnings per share of about $1.06. Excluding the gain from a property sale in the third quarter of 2010, earnings per share rose 14 per cent.Sales climbed 8 per cent to about $13.2bn compared with the same period in 2010. The results came in slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had forecast that earnings per share of $1.04 on sales of about $13.1bn.During the quarter, UPS was able to push up prices for delivery packages in the US and benefited from demand for its logistics services as companies looked to cut costs by outsourcing more of their supply chain operations.The group’s international operations, however, hit some turbulence during the quarter. Companies in Asia exported fewer smartphones and other electronic devices to the US, leaving UPS with too much capacity, denting operating margins. UPS said it expected exports to “firm up” in the fourth quarter.UPS shares, which are down about 4 per cent over the year to date, fell almost 2 per cent to $69.56 in early trading.
226;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-09-22T20:44:31Z;US stocks close near August lows;;Morgan Stanley shares hit their lowest level since 2008 amid concern that a freeze in interbank lending could leave the investment bank starved of funds.Shares fell 5.5 per cent to $13.06, at one point trading at $12.76, last seen in December 2008. The stock has almost halved in value since July 21 when markets began to slide on renewed concerns about European debt.Unlike universal banks such as Bank of America and Citigroup, which have substantial retail deposits, investment banks such as Morgan Stanley are dependent on wholesale markets for funding.Five-year credit default swaps on Morgan Stanley were at 410 basis points, which means the cost of insuring $10m of Morgan debt is $410,000. That is the highest level since April 2009.“You’d always expect investment banks to have higher beta [move more than the broad market] because their revenue is tied to health of the markets,” said Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities. “But Morgan Stanley has been especially volatile because investors have less confidence that it would come through a second financial crisis.”Credit default swaps on Goldman Sachs, the biggest US investment bank, are also at their highest since April 2009, at 295bp. Goldman shares fell 4 per cent to $93.98.Universal banks also suffered with BofA down 5 per cent to $6.06 and Citi down 6.1 per cent to $23.96.The wider mood on Wall Street was grim. A day after the Federal Reserve talked of “downside risks” to the economy, results from bellwether delivery company FedEx did little to calm investors.FedEx fell more than 8.2 per cent to $66.58 after reducing its full-year earnings per share guidance by 10 cents to between $6.25 and $6.75.The firm’s US deliveries declined 3 per cent in the last quarter and packages sent between countries fell 4 per cent, although Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Ross said, “the results could have been a lot worse given the macro conditions” and urged clients to buy the stock.The S&P 500 fell 3.2 per cent, its worst day since August 18. Its closing price of 1,129.56 was a low for September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.5 per cent to 10,733.83 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 3.3 per cent lower at 2,455.65. Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Vix measure of volatility in the S&P 500, moved above 40 for only the third time this month. The Vix jumped 13 per cent to 42.22.The volume traded on US markets was the highest in a month, as traders sold heavily, before a strong rally before the close.The benchmark S&P has now fallen 7 per cent since the Federal Reserve announced “Operation Twist,” to lower longer-term yields on Wednesday.But new record low yields on 10 year Treasuries did appear to be forcing some investors back into equities. Channing Smith, manager of the Growth Fund at Capital Advisors, said he was beginning to deploy cash into the market, buying “quality blue-chips with international exposure”.Phil Orlando at Federated Investors said he would hold back his cash until the market tested 1,100, as it did on August 19.Benjy Schwartz, chief market strategist at retail brokerage Lightspeed Financial, said individual investors were not yet pulling funds out of the market.“Retail investors have got used to volatility over the past month,” he said, although, “a single day move of 4 to 5 per cent,” might trigger selling.Shares in Goodrich Corp rose 10.2 per cent to $120.60 after industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation said it would buy the aircraft manufacturer for $16.5bn, or $127.50 a share.Shares in UTC fell 8.8 per cent to $68.31 on news of the deal, which will increase the company’s debt to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation.Every sector of the S&P 500 was down with material, energy and industrial stocks hit hard on fears of a global slowdown.The metallurgical coal miner Alpha Natural Resources, fell 11.2 per cent to $19.80. The stock is now down 33.5 per cent for the week, and at its lowest level since early 2009. The company had warned of falling Asian demand for met coal on Wednesday.Metals producer Allegheny was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 13 per cent to $36.87. Global mining group Cliffs Natural Resources fell 10.3 per cent to $55.19
227;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-09-22T12:44:43Z;FedEx warns of ‘challenging’ economic environment;;Shares in FedEx tumbled by up to 10 per cent on Thursday after the international package delivery company trimmed its full-year profit expectations, blaming a slump in consumer confidence that it said was damaging the US economy.“We expect sluggish economic growth will continue largely due to a lack of confidence that US and European policymakers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, told investors.Mr Smith said FedEx was not forecasting another recession in the US, but his comments will reinforce investor concerns about the health of the global economy. FedEx is a closely watched economic barometer because it delivers freight and packages to companies and individuals around the world.Michael Glenn, executive vice-president of market development and corporate communications, said the company had cut its forecasts for US gross domestic product to reflect recent downward adjustments to historical GDP numbers but also a sharp fall in consumer confidence during the debate on the US’s debt ceiling.“Make no mistake about it. A lot of what we’re dealing with today is sentiment based. There’s some sound, underlying economic issues …but we’ve got to turn around this sentiment in order to see some growth beyond what we are expecting right now,” he said.FedEx executives admitted that they had been caught out by slower-than-expected demand for express deliveries, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of the fiscal 2012 year. “Simply stated, we put capacity out anticipating traffic that did not materialise,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said.FedEx cut its full-year profit forecast from between$6.35 and $6.85 a share to between $6.25 and $6.75, but Ed Wolfe, at Wolfe Trahan, wrote in a note to clients that those numbers were likely to be still too optimistic, potentially setting FedEx up to miss earnings expectations later in the year.Mr Smith and his team insisted that they had taken action to cut costs and trim capacity. Those moves, combined with price increases, will help FedEx to “improve earnings, margins and cash flows this fiscal year”, Mr Smith said.During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, revenues at FedEx climbed 11 per cent to $10.5bn compared with the same period a year earlier helped by a jump in sales and operating profits at its ground transportation unit that offset weaker performance in the express segment.For the three months to the end of August, net income rose 22 per cent to $464m, or $1.46 a share, up from $1.20 a share in the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting FedEx to earn $1.45 a share on sales of about $10.3bn.In morning trading, FedEx shares, which have fallen more than 25 per cent since the start of the year as the global economic outlook has weakened, were down about 8.5 per cent at $66.36.
228;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
229;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cargo operators: Hopeful despite downturn;;"When an Icelandic volcanic eruption closed large swaths of northern European air space in April last year, there were dire predictions of the effects on the wider economy: supermarkets would run out of imported food; consumer goods from Asia would quickly run low.In the event, the consequences underlined air freight’s role as a niche mover of a small number of key products – it accounts for 0.5 per cent of the UK’s trade by weight but 25 per cent by value. The most seriously affected customers were some Japanese car manufacturers, which had to halt production after supplies of a tiny but vital sensor made in Ireland dried up. Everyday supplies – which continued to move by sea – were largely unaffected.The role of handling the most urgent, high-value goods has made air freight one of the most financially volatile segments of a world logistics industry that has been flying through severe turbulence ever since the start of the world financial crisis. As in container shipping, its problems look set to grow still more severe as the arrival of new capacity, ordered during the pre-2008 boom, is delivered in the face of a new downturn in demand.The hopes of the sector – made up of logistics companies such as the US’s UPS and FedEx, the cargo operations of passenger airlines such as Dubai’s Emirates and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, and cargo specialists such as Taiwan’s Eva Air and Luxembourg’s Cargolux – lie with the western world’s continued demand for high-fashion electronic products, such as Apple’s iPad. They are routinely flown from Asian manufacturing centres to Europe and North America. The industry must also trust that the gradual shift of manufacturing in China westwards, away from the country’s coasts, will encourage air cargo demand.Bruno Sidler, chief operating officer of Netherlands-based Ceva Logistics, says the industry has experienced an “absolute rollercoaster” since the start of the downturn. The 2008 fall – traffic in December 2008 was 22.6 per cent down on the previous year– was followed by a sharp rebound, then a steady decline which began in the third quarter of 2010.“I’ve been in this industry for almost three decades,” Mr Sidler says. “We have always had our ups and downs – but nowhere near what we’ve seen since 2008.”The key risk for air freight operators is that they will be unable to cover the high costs of operating their aircraft from the relatively small pool of cargo expensive or urgent enough to have to fly. Some logistics industry figures have even suggested that the economic downturn has prompted the shifting of some airborne goods to sea, although the slowing down of many containerships to save on fuel costs in the same period may have put a brake on the process.Professor Alan Braithwaite, an experienced logistics consultant, says companies are constantly struggling to reduce air freight use.“With a few exceptions, like iPads and pharmaceuticals, it’s a distressed purchase,” he says. “Their goods have been left behind again by the ship and have to catch up. For whatever reason, air freight is the only solution to save 15 days or whatever.”Mr Sidler agrees that volumes are currently dropping – “the situation is quite dramatic”, he says.However, he says that many companies’ recent reduction of their stock levels has encouraged some of them to turn to air freight more in emergencies.Prof Braithwaite insists there is, nevertheless, growing interest in one alternative to flying goods all the way from Asia to Europe. Some importers now send them by sea to Dubai, where the new, freight-only Jebel Ali airport neighbours the emirate’s vast port. The goods are transferred from the ship to aircraft waiting to fly them all over Europe. Mr Sidler suspects that this option is likely to become seriously popular only when rates to send cargo on aircraft rise from their current miserable levels.Rates, Mr Sidler adds, are unlikely to rise soon because deliveries of three new models of cargo aircraft – Boeing’s 777F, launched in 2009, Airbus’s A330-200F, launched last year, and Boeing’s 747-8F, whose first much-delayed models should be handed on September 19 to Luxembourg’s Cargolux – create further capacity.“It remains a real struggle for various players to sustain business,” Mr Sidler says. “Unfortunately, it’s really compounded by the fact that a lot of new capacity is coming in.”Yet, while Mr Sidler expects at least the next six to eight months to be “extremely difficult” for air cargo operators, one long-term trend could provide at least some of the demand needed to soak up the vast excess supply now being delivered.After years of discussion about the possibility that Chinese manufacturing would move away from the highly-developed coasts into the country’s under-developed west, contract electronics manufacturers are starting to make the move. The shift poses enormous challenges for the logistics industry because the new factories will be as much as 1,500km from established coastal logistics systems.But, Mr Sidler says, customers’ reluctance to wait the extra time it will take to deliver such goods by road and sea should mean the move is a rare piece of good news in the current environment for struggling air cargo operators.“People are not prepared to make any compromises,” Mr Sidler says. “All the factories that moved got the message, “Whatever you do, we’re not prepared to wait any longer’.”"
230;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-09-14T19:35:25Z;America’s economy: An uncertain outlook for Main Street, USA;Putting struggling small businesses back to work has been placed at the heart of the quest for growth – and for a president under pressure, the political stakes are as high as the economic ones, writes Hal Weitzman;"If Lee Muns does not secure a contract in the next two weeks he will be forced to close the business he started in 1989, putting himself and six employees out of work. His company, based in Beech Island, South Carolina, manufactures and installs industrial pipes. It completed its last project in November and has had no work since then.To try to keep Muns Welding alive, he sacked 19 workers. As the months dragged on, he sold off inventory; auctioned personal items; took out a $100,000 loan from his bank, which will lend him no more; and racked up $22,000 in credit card debt. Now he fears he may no longer be able to delay the inevitable.The fortunes of companies such as this hold the key to understanding the sluggish US economy. Headline-grabbing corporations have been growing, hiring and racking up profits in the past year – but in the US, as in other countries, it is small and medium-sized enterprises that employ most of the workers.“The small-business sector makes or breaks the US economy,” says Bill Dunkelberg of the National Federation of Independent Business, the main industry association.The sector, however, is in little mood to invest and hire. Like Muns Welding, many small companies are just holding on, battered by fragile demand and weak order books. They say they are swamped by burdensome federal government regulation. Many complain of a lack of credit and skilled labour.Nonetheless, they are now at the heart of the struggle to revive the economy. Launching the American Jobs Act in a speech to a joint session of Congress last week, President Barack Obama tied recovery to the health of small companies, proposing payroll-tax relief aimed at them and promising to speed payments to those working for the federal government.The political stakes are as high as the economic ones. Next year’s general election seems certain to hinge on Mr Obama’s ability to get to grips with economic problems. In that sense, restoring confidence to beleaguered small businesses could be an increasingly unpopular president’s sternest test.When President Barack Obama travelled to Fort Hayes High School in Columbus, Ohio, this week to sell his $447bn economic stimulus plan to the American people, the plight of small business was at the top of his mind.“It’s all well and good that big corporations have seen their profits roaring back. We want them to be able to hire people as well. But smaller companies haven’t come back,” he said. “So let’s tell Congress, instead of just talking about helping America’s job creators, let’s actually do something to help America’s job creators.”The White House plan, announced a week ago, includes measures that are specifically designed to aid struggling small businesses in 2012, cutting payroll taxes – which fund the social security retirement scheme – in half and adding additional incentives for companies that hire new employees or lift wages for current workers.But it is far from clear whether these proposals will see the light of day, despite the pressure Mr Obama and administration officials are expected to put on lawmakers – especially sceptical Republicans who control the House of Representatives – to adopt them.Immediately after Mr Obama presented his new plan to Congress, Republicans were careful not to dismiss it, even though conservatives believe a different recipe of lower taxes combined with lighter regulations would be better for small businesses.This more conciliatory position was a stark departure from the hardline stance taken by Republicans on aspects of fiscal and economic policy this year. But hopes of a political consensus in favour of the American Jobs Act appeared to wither away after the White House this week unveiled its suggestions for how to pay for the additional stimulus in order not to add to America’s debt.Mr Obama wants to cover the cost of the plan by reducing the ability of the wealthiest Americans – households earning more than $250,000 a year – to take tax deductions on items such as mortgage interest and charitable giving over the next 10 years. In addition, he wants to curb other tax provisions that benefit oil companies, hedge fund and private equity managers. The White House has made clear that if Congress chose to use different ways to pay for the stimulus, it would be acceptable.But Republicans fiercely attacked
the provisions put forth by the administration, arguing it was no good cutting taxes on a temporary basis if they were paid for with permanent tax increases that would ultimately stifle job creation and increase the size of government. James PolitiMr Obama played up the dichotomy between corporations that have returned to profitability and still-struggling smaller businesses. “Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies?” he said. “Or should we use that money to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers? Because we can’t afford to do both. I’m pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose.”This reflects frustration in Washington that big businesses are hoarding profits and not investing. “There is a significant differentiation between the largest companies, which are sitting on significant cash, and many of the smaller companies, which have faced a perfect storm in terms of more difficulty getting working capital,” according to a senior administration official.Casting small businesses as Davids against corporate Goliaths is a gamble, particularly as many owners of small companies see their interests as more aligned with big business than with the government. Dan Danner, NFIB president, says Mr Obama’s plan “does not address the fundamental problems facing small business today” such as regulation the sector sees as excessive.The president is right to acknowledge that the recovery is in their hands, however. Small companies – defined by the US Small Business Association, a federal agency, as those employing up to 500 workers – account for 99 per cent of all American businesses, two-thirds of private-sector em­ployment and half of economic output.The divergence in the health of these businesses and larger companies helps to explain why the world’s biggest economy created on balance no new jobs in August. More small business are cutting jobs than hiring, according to the NFIB, although the situation has been slowly improving. Rather than hiring or firing, however, three-quarters of small companies have adopted a “wait and see” approach.The main problem is lack of demand. The case of Muns Welding demonstrates the weakness afflicting some order books, fuelling a pessimism aggravated by general uncertainty and a diminishing faith in Washington’s ability to craft policies to get the economy back on track.That has made many reluctant to invest. “Small and medium-sized companies were bigger risk-takers in many ways,” says Jeff Joerres, chief executive of ManpowerGroup, a global staffing agency. “In today’s environment, they’re not taking risks to the same extent – like anticipatory hiring – and it’s stifling growth.”Weak consumer spending has hit sectors such as retailing particularly hard. Rose Corona, owner of Big Horse Feed and Mercantile store in Temecula, southern California, says that, among her middle and upper middle-class customers, “it’s now almost chic to be frugal”. The company employs 25 workers, down from 34 two years ago.The leading concern of small and medium-sized industrial suppliers is that the big manufacturers that are their customers will cut back or go out of business altogether, according to a survey of 3,400 companies released in July by ThomasNet, a website for those researching industrial suppliers.A second problem is the difficulty of obtaining credit. On one hand, two-thirds of NFIB members say demand is so weak they have no need of loans, while only 8 per cent cannot obtain credit. However, those that want to borrow complain of a divide in availability between companies big enough to issue public bonds, which can ext­ract better terms from banks; and others that are reliant on their bankers’ goodwill.The Federal Reserve’s latest survey of bank loan officers, indicates that 22 per cent of lenders are loosening credit standards for companies with sales greater than $50m and none is tightening them. For companies with sales below $50m, that figure is 8 per cent.“I hear every day from medium- to small-sized customers about problems in securing credit,” says Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment. “In many cases, their balance sheets are still wounded, or their credit profile has changed as standards have tightened.”Moreover, the availability of credit to new entrepreneurs is more important for job creation than its availability to existing small businesses, says Diane Swonk of Mesirow Financial, a Chicago-based financial services company. Young businesses tend to grow faster, she notes – but in their early stages, they are often funded through the founder taking on personal debt. Because credit card companies have tightened lending standards and other sources of debt – such as home equity lines of credit – have largely dried up, she says, entrepreneurship has been stifled.While high-technology start-ups are still able to gain access to funding, most new businesses are in more traditional sectors where financing has become tighter. “We had to deleverage, but the pendulum has swung in the other direction,” Ms Swonk says. “That has hampered the spontaneous innovation that we had in the economy, with Americans starting businesses in their garages and spare bedrooms using personal credit.”…Would-be entrepreneurs seeking to buy existing small companies are also finding it hard to secure loans. Almost half of business brokers say a lack of available financing is the crucial factor preventing such transactions, according to a survey released last month by BizBuySell, an online business brokerage. “It’s virtually impossible for a first-time business owner to get a loan from the bank,” says Mike Handelsman of BizBuySell.Many owners who would be selling up in normal times are waiting because of low valuations, says Mr Handelsman. Owners who want to sell say potential buyers cannot secure credit. In both cases, companies remain in defensive mode, while entrepreneurs who might breathe new energy into them do not have the money to make the purchase.Even though the SBA has made $30bn of loans available for small businesses, some start-ups have complained that banks refuse to lend to those that lack a two-year tax record.The difficulty in gaining access to credit helps to explain a great puzzle of this economic crisis – why more people have not set up in business for themselves. A recession is often seen as the furnace for a recovery. Small companies go under but many new ones are born, as workers who lose their jobs create their own.A string of great US companies have come out of such adversity. Procter & Gamble, IBM, General Electric, General Motors, United Technologies, Hewlett-Packard and FedEx are all the children of hard times.That has not happened this time. In August 2008, 5.8m Americans worked for their own companies, and another 10.3m were self-employed but did not incorporate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By August 2009, that had fallen to 5.4m and 10.1m respectively. Last month the numbers had worsened to 5.2m and 9.5m.The NFIB’s monthly survey of business sentiment regularly shows considerable anxiety about the burden of regulation. Companies griping about taxes and red tape is nothing new, but smaller business owners say their regulatory burden is growing.Heading the list of worries are the “Obamacare” health reforms, which from 2014 will impose financial penalties on small businesses with 50 workers or more that do not offer health coverage. Also of concern are increasing regulation from the National Labor Relations Board, including a rule issued last month requiring businesses to post notices informing workers of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act, widely seen as an example of unnecessary government meddling.Supporters of health reform say it will extend affordable insurance coverage to small business employees. Currently, only about one-third of the smallest – with fewer than 10 employees – have a healthcare plan. They also note that employers with fewer than 50 workers are likely to save on health costs from subsidies for the smallest businesses, for example. The Urban Institute, a Washington think-tank that backs health reform, says on balance small businesses would save 8.7 per cent of today’s premium costs.Critics counter that the subsidies are available only to very small, low-wage companies. Small businesses with more than 80 workers that do not offer health plans will pay $2bn in penalties, while medium-sized businesses (100-1,00 workers) would face a bill of $11.8bn, according to the Urban Institute.Ms Corona is particularly upset about the Environmental Protection Agency – one of small businesses’ least favourite regulators – which, she says, has imposed regulations in California that forced up the price of water to prohibitive levels, hurting the fruit and nut farmers in her part of the state. “This administration is just anti-small business,” she says.…The president has acknowledged this gripe. “There are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it,” he admitted last week, saying his administration was reviewing all regulations.He will need to be quick. The next election is a little over a year away – and Mr Obama will need to restore confidence among small business before he can start to turn the US economy around.Back in Beech Island, Mr Muns is considering running for US Congress if he is forced to close shop. His local seat has recently opened up and the Tea Party Republican reckons he can put his experience as a small-business owner to good use in Washington.“Not only does our federal government have a spending problem, it has a waste problem – it wastes a lot of what it spends,” he says. “If they’d taken the stimulus money and given $100,000 of it to every small business owner, they’d have a lot more jobs today than they do.”Additional reporting by Robin Harding"

The reports of an Anglo American bid for Walter follow a confirmed bid last week from US coal miner Peabody for MacArthur, the Australian coal producer.“Reports of M&A in the coke and coal space are driving up shares across the sector,” said Jeremy Sussman, at Brean Murray Carret. “Anglo American is one of the biggest mining companies in the world so the possibility of activity by them will move stocks.”Alpha Natural Resources and Cliff Natural Resources, both companies which have coal and coke in their mining mix, were among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500. Alpha rose 10.6 per cent to $33.44 and Cliff was up 8.3 per cent to $81.46. Peabody also rose 6.9 per cent to $48.72.The S&P 500 energy sector advanced 3.7 per cent. Financials rallied 4.8 per cent, up 3 per cent for the week. Regional banks propelled gains.Regions Financial rose 12.3 per cent to $4.37, its largest single-day rally since March 2010.The stock had fallen heavily on Tuesday despite a note from Credit Suisse advising clients to buy regional banks.Credit Suisse argued regional bank business models already price in low interest rates because most loans are made to businesses at floating rates.That note seemed to be having an impact on Wednesday. Midwest lender Fifth Third Bancorp recorded a second straight day of strong gains, up 7.2 per cent to $10.45. Synovus, which has branches across the southern states, rose 10.7 per cent to $1.45. Bank of America rose 7 per cent to $7.48 after a reshuffle of senior management at the much scrutinised bank.The S&P 500 rose 2.9 per cent to 1,198.62, within touching distance of the 1,200 level, which it butted up against for much of August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5 per cent to 11,414.86 and the Nasdaq Composite index put on 3 per cent to 2,548.94.Yahoo gained 5.4 per cent as investors greeted the dismissal ofCarol Bartz, chief executive. At $13.61, shares are trading near the level they were at when Ms Bartz was appointed in late 2008.“Yahoo’s board has generally been viewed as slow-moving and more passive; any kind of shake-up here will suggest greater interest in value creation,” said Doug Anmuth, internet analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to explain the share price move.Apart from M&A hopes, the rally appeared to be driven by positive sentiment about global growth with highly cyclical semiconductor stocks performing strongly.Nvidia rose 8.1 per cent to $14.25 after the company forecast positive quarterly earnings .Micron Technology was also up 6.9 per cent to $6.06.Sentiment also drove steel shares. Materials rose 2.7 per cent with US Steel leading the way, up 9.2 per cent to $29.92, and AK Steel, up 10.2 per cent at $8.90, despite a fall in weekly steel production.“It’s a mixture of bargain-hunters coming in to the market, because steel stocks have been beat up so much, and also the talk that President Obama’s stimulus plan might divert idle construction workers to infrastructure projects, which are a source of demand for steel,” Charles Bradford at Bradford Research, said. “But I would not be moving back into steel stocks until there is a clear sign of a turnround,” he added.JPMorgan lowered its earnings per share forecast for FedEx Corporation. JPMorgan said the business-driven package delivery service would suffer from weak demand. FedEx shares rose 3.6 per cent to $76.27.Citigroup upgraded DR Horton to buy, citing the low share price and an expected seasonal upturn in construction for the homebuilder. DR Horton shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.17, while homebuilder Pulte Group rose 8.8 per cent to $4.58.C&J Energy Services rose 2.3 per cent to $25.53 after JPMorgan initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy recommendation and a $41 target price. Citigroup also initiated coverage with a buy-high risk rating and a $33 price target.Exchange shares were higher after Deutsche Bank upgraded Nasdaq OMX to buy.

232;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-08-22T21:08:59Z;Wall Street buoyed by QE3 speculation;;US stocks ended the day almost flat after falling bank stocks put paid to an early rally, which had been driven by hopes of a further round of monetary stimulus.Bank of America suffered its fourth largest single-day loss of the year, at one point coming within touching distance of its year low of $6.31, as it struggled to manage bad news.Layla Peruzzi, equity derivatives head at Jefferies, said that “the market is forcing [Bank of America] into a capital raise” and predicted that the Charlotte-based lender would have to raise up to $50 billion through disposals or by issuing new shares.Separately the bank’s card unit agreed to pay $5 million and suspend arbitrations of consumer debt collections in California for two years, to settle a lawsuit brought by the state.The company’s plan to raise capital through disposals took a blow when Zhang Jianguo, president of China Construction Bank, said Bank of America had agreed to retain at least half its 10 per cent holding in CCB.Bank of America was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, its shares closing down 7.9 per cent at $6.42, as financials in the S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, more than any other sector.On Monday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said residential mortgage delinquencies during the second quarter rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 12.9 per cent, after falling at the beginning of the year from last year.The KBW index of bank stocks hit a year low of 35.04 before closing down 1.1 per cent at 35.10.But regional banks rallied slightly. Regions Financial was up 0.5 per cent at $3.88, and bank stocks appeared to be trading on news rather than economics.Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 per cent in late trading to close at $106.51, after Reuters reported chief executive Lloyd Blankfein had hired high profile corporate defence lawyer Reid Weingarten, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank.“Mr Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the [senate permanent subcommittee on investigations] report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs told the Financial Times.The S&P 500 had been up as much as 2 per cent in early trade as investors looked to the Fed to signal another round of quantitative easing after four weeks of sustained losses.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will speak on Friday in Jackson Hole. “The market is expecting another round of asset purchases and it will come,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG.But the S&P 500 again closed near its year low of 1,101.54, up just 0.02 per cent on the day at 1,123.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 1,084.50.Hewlett-Packard gained 3.6 per cent to close at $24.45, reversing some of Friday’s big losses, helping the Nasdaq close up 0.2 per cent at 2,345.38.Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, warned investors against relying on Mr Bernanke to prop up stock prices.“The higher markets rise this week on QE3 anticipation, the more vulnerable they may become should the street not get what it wants,” he said.With Brent crude easing, after rebel forces entered Tripoli, the SIG Oil Exploration and Production index fell 2.4 per cent to 400.79.“A lower oil price pressures the economics of upstream oil development,” said Hsulin Peng, senior analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. But if cheaper oil stimulates the global economy, “increased demand could offset price declines”.While Brent fell, West Texas Intermediate rose. That hurt refiners with strong access to WTI crude on fears that the rising price of inputs, coupled with weak demand for finished oil products, would erode margins.Marathon Petroleum was down 6.9 per cent to $32.58 as the stock’s newness and its dependence on WTI crude weighed on the share price.But Mark Gilman, refineries analyst at Benchmark, said: “The prices of finished oil products are quite properly tracking the price of Brent crude. US investors shouldn’t fixate on the price of WTI.”While investors were trading on sentiment, there was more bad news from the real economy.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July registered -0.06, the fourth successive month that the index has been negative.JPMorgan reduced its target price for FedEx 10 per cent to $105 and cut its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company from $6.60 to $6.Performance at the business mail delivery service is watched as a gauge of overall economic strength. FedEx was down 0.2 per cent at $73.00.
233;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-08-01T21:50:49Z;TNT Express: bump in the road;The traditional corporate antidote to slow growth has its limits;Penicillin was once a wonderdrug but lost effectiveness because it was applied too broadly. The experience of TNT Express shows there is a similar problem with the simple three-step process widely considered a corporate antidote to slow old-world economic growth. The recipe: first buy up local operations in a favourite emerging market, then apply fancy developed-world management techniques to said emerging market and finally, watch the cash roll in. That technique, however, led the Dutch express postal service, which in May demerged from its snail mail unit, to a €103m first-half loss, compared with a €51m net profit last year. The pain came from a €132m impairment charge at a Brazilian operation which, until recently, appeared to have a good rationale.Last year, TNT bought two domestic delivery companies and assumed it could merge them – a classic developed world tactic – to cut costs and boost the combined company’s scale. However, it underestimated the importance of local managers and their relationships with business customers. As too many of these managers left the newly combined delivery company, so did corporate clients. In the second quarter, volumes across TNT’s Americas division fell 18 per cent.This experience helped push TNT’s share price down a quarter since the demerger – only slightly better than its slower-growth former brother, PostNL.True, the shares rebounded 3 per cent on Monday, but that owed much to investors attempting to establish a baseline for the stock after its first set of demerged results.TNT’s teething problems might yet encourage larger rivals FedEx or UPS to make an offer. There would be clear synergies, especially in the established courier business. But at least now that TNT has learnt from its emerging market blunder, the worst should be behind it.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
234;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-08-01T10:24:59Z;Emerging markets woes hit TNT Express profits;;Dutch international deliveries company TNT Express reported second-quarter net profit fell to €45m ($65m), down 23 per cent year on year, as the newly independent company struggles to make its growth businesses in China and Brazil profitable.Overall revenue rose slightly, mainly driven by strong growth in Asia. But higher fuel prices and volatile volumes on intercontinental shipping between Asia and Europe pushed the company’s Asian operations down from an €8m profit a year ago to an €8m loss this year.In Brazil, TNT Express is still trying to repair the poorly executed merger of two subsidiaries last year, which led to mix-ups in deliveries and lost customers. The troubles in Brazil meant TNT Express lost €45m on its American operations in the quarter, down from a €15m loss for the same period last year.Profits in Europe, where the company draws most of its revenue, were stronger than expected, and the company announced it will pay an interim dividend of €0.04. But analysts said they were waiting to see whether the company could make good on its challenges in Brazil and China.“We know in the past we made mistakes in managing Brazil. Now our priority is to make good progress,” Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive, told reporters. She said management had been replaced, and reiterated the company’s target of returning Brazilian operations to profitability by the second half of 2012.TNT Express said it will implement €50m in cost savings by the end of the year, and is on track to meet its targeted underlying operating margin of 9 per cent.The quarterly results were the first since TNT Express spun off in May from its European regular-mail business, now known as PostNL. Investors had pushed for the separation for years, arguing it would free TNT Express to compete with larger express-mail rivals such as FedEx, UPS and DHL.Some investors moved into TNT Express stock hoping the split would lead to a takeover bid by one of its rivals, but none has materialised.“The takeover story has been a great story for 10 years, and it will continue to be a great story for another 10 years,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “UPS or FedEx might be desperate to buy TNT Brazil, but they would also be buying TNT China and TNT Europe, and do they want that?”
235;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-07-26T19:21:08Z;UPS warns debt crisis is hurting world trade;;Dithering over the debt ceiling in Washington, weak consumer confidence and slowing growth in Asia are restraining the global economy, according to top executives at United Parcel Service, the package delivery company.Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, said on Tuesday that while fuel prices had declined slightly and Japan appeared to be recovering after this year’s tsunami, a number of factors were creating “uncertainty” and undermining confidence, particularly at small and midsized companies.“Clearly we have seen the last year and a half, small business has not participated in the recovery like multinational big business,” he said. “Once they feel more comfortable and see us going forward we will see them invest more money and hire more people.”Mr Davis singled out the political gridlock over debt issues in Washington and continuing high unemployment as creating a weak US economy that was slowing demand for domestic services and also imports from places such as China.UPS shares fell nearly 6 per cent before recovering to $71.59, down 3.3 per cent. Shares in FedEx, which competes with UPS in the global package delivery business, fell almost 3 per cent before regaining ground to $91, down 1 per cent.Investors watch UPS closely for insights into the health of the global economy. The company delivers packages to tens of thousands of companies and individuals around the world and at any moment about 2 per cent of gross domestic product is passing through its networks.As the peak ocean shipping season gets under way – a key leading indicator of demand in the second half of the year – Mr Davis said that customer interest from areas such as Asia had been muted so far.“I wouldn’t say we’re pessimistic about the future. We’re just a lot more uncertain about how much the economy will grow,” Mr Davis told investors, as the company reported strong second-quarter results but painted a cautious outlook given the “uneven economic environment”.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said UPS had seen “very strong growth” but was being cautious in order to be “credible and prudent on this and make sure that people understand the risks to the global economic environment”.“If congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily over the next week, the mood of the country could change quickly and we could see demand picking up,” Mr Davis said, while Mr Kuehn added that the company was still on track for a record year.For the three months to the end of June, revenues climbed more than 8 per cent to $13.2bn, compared to the same period last year, generating net income of $1.1bn, or about $1.07 per share, up from $845m, or $0.84 per share, in 2010.The results were boosted by $20m from two real estate deals. Excluding those one-off gains, UPS earned $1.05 a share, in line with Wall Street expectations. Analysts predicted sales of about $13.1bn.Beneath the top line numbers, UPS reported strong performances across its business lines. The US domestic package delivery unit reported a 6.4 per cent rise in sales to $7.7bn and a 29 per cent increase in operating profit to $966m.The best performer was the supply chain and freight unit, which manages warehouses and delivers larger items. Revenues rose 7 per cent to $2.3bn and operating profits surged 76 per cent to $235m compared with the year-ago period.Over the past decade, the company has invested heavily in its supply chain and freight business through a series of acquisitions, but tough price competition in trucking and other factors have produced a mixed performance at the unit until now.At UPS’s international package operation, revenues climbed 13 per cent to $3.1bn, but operating profits fell 5 per cent to $497m, as negative currency trends offset growth in Europe and China.Noting the weakness in the US economy, Mr Davis urged congress to take action. “Gridlock in our nation’s capital clearly is not helping this cause. We need leadership in Washington to step up and solve the debt ceiling stalemate.”
236;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-06-30T11:13:19Z;Picket lines deploy in Newcastle and Manchester;;At the Benton Park View base in Longbenton, Newcastle of HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions – reputedly the biggest office complex in the world apart from the Pentagon – pickets were on duty from soon after dawn.The Public and Commercial Services union, whose members were picketing with banners emblazoned On Strike for the Alternative. Stop the Cuts, estimated the vast majority of its 7,000 members at the vast site, which stretches for a mile, obeyed the strike call.“We reckon well over 85 per cent of staff are taking strike action,” said Kevin McHugh, branch secretary of HMRC Longbenton, who was on the picket line. “That car park is 90 per cent empty”, he said, gesturing to the staff parking area beside the office complex. “Normally it’s full.”He said the strong turnout was “not surprising” given the changes to pension contributions which the government were trying to drive through. “The government are trying to cut our pay by 3 per cent.”The complex employs about 10,000 people and handles national functions including child benefit, tax credits, income tax and VAT. It has back office processing functions and call centre operations, including employer and national insurance help lines.Mr McHugh said the negotiations between the government and the unions had been “a sham.”“Hopefully 750,000 workers out on strike today will persuade the government to talk seriously.” He said: “Civil servants, dinner ladies, bin men didn’t cause the crisis. It was the financial institutions. But the government want us to pay for it.”As he talked, the 30-strong picket line cheered when a large Fedex van, coming to the site with office deliveries, saw the line and drove away.Some employees did drive past the picket line into the complex and some, who declined to be interviewed, arrived on foot. The 3,000 on site who are not in the PCS include members for the First Division Association, Prospect and employees of private contractors who are not unionised.One of the pickets, Ringo Gebbie, a branch organisers for CPS who is a clerical officer, had a printed sheet calculating what the government’s proposals would mean for him.His current pay is £19,699 a year. The proposed pension increase would mean a rise in monthly payments of £49.25 and, as he is 51, he would have to work six years longer. He estimates that the combination of pension increases and the move from RPI to CPI as a means of calculation would result in his losing £8,000 over 20 years.“On my wage I don’t have a social life,” said Mr Gebbie, who lives in Newcastle. “Everything else is going up, the mortgage, the cost of living, and my wages have been frozen.”Mr McHugh said the strike was bound to cause disruption to benefits but added: “We are out here to defend our pensions. Civil servants don’t strike very often. Our general secretary last week described the talks as a farce.”Whether there will be more strikes in the coming months will, he said, “depend on the government”.Picket lines and striking workers were also out in force in Manchester as teachers and civil servants showed their support for the 24-hour shut-down.School playing fields were eerily empty and roads around locals schools free from buses and cars dropping pupils off as thousands of youngsters had a day off.Hundreds of schools across the North West have closed for the day, and outside Crown, Magistrates' and civil courts in Manchester city centre picket lines were formed by members of the PCS union, with placards defiantly blaming bankers for the financial crisis – not workers. Job Centres, prisons and immigration services were also facing disruption.In Manchester's busy Oxford Road, passing motorists blew their horns in support as hundreds of teachers, civil servants and protesters mustered for a march and rally in the city centre.The strike has had limited impact in Scotland because none of the Scottish teaching unions is involved.BAA said its airports at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen were all operating with little or no disruption, in spite of some UK Border Agency staff taking action. They only check the passports of incoming international passengers and the rest of the airports’ employees, including security staff, were not involved.John Swinney, Scotland’s finance secretary, has urged the UK government to reconsider its policy of increasing pension contribution rates at a time when union members were facing financial pressures, but also urged both sides to continue negotiations.

The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
238;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;TNT: if you can’t beat ‘em ...;TNT Express should consider a tie up with one of its much larger rivals;Breaking up is tough, but shareholders in Dutch postal services operator TNT were right to approve the split of the business on Wednesday. No one has a clue how to stop the rot at its mail business – the UK’s Royal Mail faces the same dilemma. Volumes at TNT fell over 9 per cent in 2010 and will fall by only a little less this year. Now that the newly named PostNL has been separated from the express delivery division, executives can focus on managing decline: generating as much cash as possible while jostling with unions over inevitable job losses.In contrast, TNT Express is now free to grow. The company already runs the largest private mail network in China – which generates one-fifth of it revenues – and its Brazilian business has plenty of room for improvement.The split also neatly positions TNT Express to be acquired by one of its much larger rivals, FedEx and UPS. TNT’s North American business contributes only about 3 per cent of revenues, meaning competition concerns with its US-heavy peers should be minimal. But the company would not come cheap. TNT Express’ shares trade at about 20 times next year’s earnings, a 30 per cent premium to FedEx and UPS. Some takeover speculation may be priced in, but the emerging markets growth story will still command a meaty premium.While its current takeover negotiating position is strong, the challenges of being a relatively small player are formidable. TNT could struggle to deal with a larger rival starting a price war in brand-agnostic emerging markets. Rather than wait to see how well it does, management should consider a tie up with FedEx or UPS. After all, investors are still fairly optimistic, and delay could lead to a lower price.

239;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-05-26T01:35:02Z;Shareholders back TNT demerger plan;;Shareholders of Dutch post and shipping company TNT approved a demerger plan presented by management at their annual meeting on Wednesday, splitting the company into a Netherlands-only postal company and an international express-mail company.Management says the move, first announced last December, will create added value for both new companies, while some shareholders hope that the express-mail company might be an attractive target for a take­over.Shares in the new express-mail company, TNT Express, and the postal company, PostNL, will begin trading on Thursday morning on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam exchange. Each current shareholder in TNT will retain a share in the postal business as well as receiving a share in TNT Express.The postal company will retain a 29.9 per cent interest in TNT Express, as it would otherwise have been left with negative equity, the company explained.The split comes in response to more than a year of pressure from shareholders who said the company was being poorly managed. TNT’s Dutch postal operations face a steady long-term decline in revenue, though revenues from parcel deliveries are rising.TNT’s results for the first quarter of 2011 offered little respite from criticism, showing a 14 per cent drop in net profits on year to €123m ($174m). That was despite a rise in gross revenues year on year to €1.11bn from €1.01bn.The poor performance led some analysts to discount the prospects of a takeover offer for the new express-mail company.“It’s the smallest [of the major express-mail companies], and has the lowest margins,” said Andre Mulder of Kepler Capital Markets. TNT had an underlying operating margin of 9 per cent in 2010, while margins at Deutsche Post’s DHL and FedEx were in the double digits.In Brazil, one of its most promising operations, TNT’s efforts to integrate the express-mail companies it acquired in 2010 have not gone smoothly. The company took a €120m impairment charge in its first-quarter 2011 results, saying equipment mismatches and poor management at local operations had led to the loss of clients.Marie Christine Lombard, the incoming chief executive at TNT Express, promised at the shareholder’s meeting to personally take charge of Brazilian operations and return them to profitability by the second half of 2012.Analysts said the attractiveness of TNT Express to takeover bidders would depend on the prices set in Thursday’s trading. Consensus has the new shares splitting the current TNT share price of €16.50, with most analysts expecting TNT Express to trade near €9 and PostNL about €7.50.
240;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-05-22T17:01:36Z;UPS backs carbon tax, with conditions;;United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, would throw its weight behind a carbon tax to help tackle global warming – but only if the proceeds were tied to infrastructure improvement projects.In an interview with the Financial Times, Scott Davis, chief executive officer of UPS, said his company would back a federal tax on carbon as part of a broad sweep of measures to restore America’s creaking infrastructure.“We are paying attention to it but if you watch what China and other competitors are doing they are investing much more in infrastructure so we have to do that or we will feel the pain when the economy gets strong again,” Mr Davis said. His comments added an influential voice to efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide that have been linked to a rise in global temperatures. Other advocates of a carbon tax include Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, UPS’s main competitor.A tax on carbon would effectively raise the price of using energy for businesses and individuals, encouraging them to reduce their consumption, but as a result it has been heavily opposed by some politicians and interest groups.Still, Mr Davis’s suggestion adds a twist to the debate, tying environmental issues to infrastructure – a topic that has received considerable attention in Congress. Earlier this month, two influential senators proposed legislation to fund an infrastructure bank. The measure could be costly for UPS. The company runs a fleet of about 100,000 cars and trucks and about 230 aircraft. In 2010 UPS spent almost $3bn on fuel, although much of the cost was passed on to customers through surcharges.But any improvement in infrastructure would benefit the company. Mr Davis estimates that if UPS’s US truck and package car fleet spends just five minutes a day stuck idling in traffic it costs the company $100m a year. One area that needs especial investment, Mr Davis said, was upgrading the air traffic control system in the US. Federal regulators have a plan, called NextGen, to do just that, but progress has been slow.Experts regularly criticise the US for its failure to invest adequately in its waterworks and transport systems. Since the early 1960s, US infrastructure spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen steadily even though the population has grown by a third.In a 2009 “report card”, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US a “D” for its infrastructure and estimated that it would cost more than $2,000bn over five years to get the country’s existing roads, bridges and tunnels into a serviceable state.

242;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-05-09T15:31:13Z;We must electrify the transport sector;The US needs to promote energy diversity to shed its oil dependency, says Frederick Smith;"It is tempting to say that the headlines about rising fuel prices, Libya and other events in the Middle East will be a wake-up call to the dangers of oil dependence. But such calls have been repeated for almost 40 years, and yet the vulnerability – both in the US and across the globe – remains.Our mobile economy remains defenceless against oil-price shocks and supply interruptions. In the US, transport accounts for 70 per cent of petroleum consumed. 97 per cent of transport fuel in the US is derived from oil, and there are no plausible substitutes. When prices go up, there are only two choices: drive less or pay more. If supplies are disrupted for any reason, the choices are even worse. This must change.Every American recession over the past 35 years has been preceded by – or occurred concurrently with – an oil-price spike. The last time this happened, just a few years ago, the average retail price of gasoline in the US increased from $1.46 to $3.27, costing typical households $2,115 a year in increased fuel expenses. That price spike contributed greatly to the recession and financial crisis which the world is still struggling to recover from.This addiction has also led the US to commit its young men and women in uniform to protecting the world’s oil infrastructure. And it means that western diplomacy is handicapped by the need to placate oil-producing nations, including those that do not share America’s views or values.So what can be done? First the US should produce more oil at home. Increased safety and environmental standards must come hand-in-hand with this increased production, but such standards – along with stalled permit processes and endless litigation – must not stop the US from exploiting its domestic resources.Drilling is not the sole answer to this problem, far from it; but considering that last year the US sent more than $260bn overseas to pay for oil, and it is highly likely it will surpass that number in 2011, the wisdom of producing more domestically becomes clear.Second, America must continue on the path started by George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama to make cars, light trucks and commercial vehicles more fuel-efficient. The less oil used to drive the transport system, the less effect a price spike will have.But these are interim measures. The only way to truly end the threat is to move toward millions of vehicles that are powered not by oil, but by a vast diversity of domestic power sources. And the best way to do that is with a large electrified transport sector.Only electricity can give the transport sector the flexibility to switch fuels when one or more become too expensive. Electricity from homegrown sources – wind or solar, coal or hydro, natural gas or nuclear – would free America’s mobile economy from dependence on a single source. And unlike some alternatives, the infrastructure backbone for “refuelling” electric vehicles already exists in the US national grid, which offers significant spare generating capacity at night, when it is needed for this purpose.I am not someone who tends to advocate for increased government involvement in the private sector. Free-market solutions to these economic threats would be ideal. But there is no free market for oil. To the contrary, today more than 90 per cent of proved conventional global oil reserves are held by national oil companies that are either fully or partially controlled by foreign governments, whose interests often have as much or more to do with geopolitical considerations than free-market principles.Every time we make an investment decision at FedEx, we ask ourselves: “What is the return on this investment?” That is the question we must ask here. The Electrification Coalition, an organisation of which I am a member, has put forward a plan to deploy electric vehicles at scale throughout the US. These policies would cost far less over all of the years of their implementation than the hundreds of billions of dollars America sends overseas to pay for oil in a single year. In almost every conceivable area, the coalition’s plan represents a positive return on investment, from a $127bn improvement in the US balance of trade to millions of new jobs.We cannot fix today’s gasoline price spike. But we can finally put ourselves on the path to a future in which we are in much stronger control of the fuel supply that drives our vehicles – and our economy. Little has been done to address this problem for the past 40 years. The time to do so without truly calamitous consequences is rapidly running out.The writer is chairman, president and chief executive officer of FedEx Corporation"
243;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-04-26T14:04:34Z;UPS delivers strong results despite fuel costs;;United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, shrugged off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter of 2011.The logistics company also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast, helping its shares add 1.4 per cent to $74.67 by mid-session on Wall Street.But the Atlanta-based shipping company also struck a cautionary note regarding the global economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.UPS and other global logistics companies are closely watched barometers of global economic health because they transport many of the goods that are the backbone of domestic and international commerce.The company reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share. This was up from $533m, or 53 cents a share, in the same period last year.Scott Davis, chairman and chief executive, said that the strong results came despite “unrest in north Africa and the Middle East, skyrocketing fuel costs and some of the worst weather conditions in years.”Revenues rose 7.3 per cent to $12.58bn from a year ago with the growth spread relatively equally between its three main units: domestic US package delivery, international package delivery and supply chain and freight. This was slightly short of the $12.7bn analysts were expecting, however.Despite the more sobering assessment of world economic growth, the company raised its expected full-year earnings to $4.15-$4.40 a share, ahead of the $4.12-$4.35 predicted in February.Operating margins came in at 11.3 per cent, up from 8.9 per cent in same period a year ago, in a hopeful sign about the ability of US businesses to weather the storm of higher fuel prices.“The higher oil price is definitely a headwind, but the key thing to take away from these results is that it has yet to derail the global economy,” said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer.One of the key drivers of earnings growth for the company was the margin improvement in its domestic package business, which rose 3.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 11.3 per cent.Mr Kuehn said UPS expected its margins to continue to to improve in the US. This sentiment was mirrored by analysts. “Operating margins were strong on the domestic side, which we think will continue,” said Jim Corridore, airlines and air freight analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Average margins for companies on the S&P 500 index are currently near cyclical highs as they effectively streamlined themselves during the latest downturn. Average operating margins for S&P companies are19.7 per cent, just short of the last cyclical high of 20.3 per cent in 2004.Last month, rival logistics company FedEx reported its fourth-quarter earnings, forecasting strong demand and higher margins in the rest of the year. UPS shares have been trading broadly flat since the start of the year, but are up 94.5 per cent since the lows of the financial crisis.
244;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy prices risk derailing equity advance;Direction of commodities will set S&P tone;Sitting on your hands may not win plaudits among the bold and the brave, but it has proved a winning formula for US stock market investors this year.A sharp jump in oil prices has propelled energy companies to a second successive quarter of impressive gains, making them the best performing sector in the S&P 500.Since the start of the year, and thanks in large part to the turmoil in the Middle East that has sent crude to its highest level since 2008, energy stocks including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Marathon Oil have been among the market’s biggest gainers in the first three months of the year. The sector has risen 17 per cent, eclipsing other industries to lead the S&P 5.6 per cent higher.The problem for equity investors is that energy’s sustained run, after a rally of 21 per cent in the past three months of 2010, is just the plus side to an oil supply shock – Libya – that threatens to cast a shadow over the market. Higher fuel costs are predicted to erode profit margins for many other companies and sap consumer spending.Indeed, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, warns that higher energy costs are now “the biggest factor weighing on margin expansion”.One of the most important drivers for equities, therefore, in the second quarter will be whether commodity prices pull back. Stocks exposed to discretionary spending could benefit if the bull run in energy and raw materials runs out of steam.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management says breathing space may be at hand. A slower pace of growth in the world’s emerging markets should translate into a retreat for commodity prices.“Commodities are peaking here and we should get some relief,” he says. If that is accompanied by better jobs numbers – the latest US non-farm payrolls are due today – then stocks have room to rally more broadly, says Mr Paulsen.Other strategists, though, are less confident about the wider market’s prospects. Despite a recent run of robust economic data and solid corporate earnings, the prospect of an end to the Federal Reserve’s second round of “quantitative easing” – its huge bond-buying programme to stimulate recovery – could cap further gains.And, as oil prices have climbed back towards the record high set three years ago of almost $150 a barrel, some economists have begun lowering their growth expectations for the US economy in the first half of the year.“Equities face considerable headwinds in the second quarter,” says Kate Moore, senior global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The market may have got ahead of itself. Rising oil prices, higher interest rates and downward revisions to economic data will weigh on the equity market.”The signs of diminishing confidence in the rally, which at its peak took the S&P to more than double its March 2009 nadir, is already evident in non-energy stocks that did well last year.Materials, for example is up just 3.6 per cent this year after a gain of 18.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. While industrials have done well again, they lag their rise of 11.2 per cent in the last three months of 2010. Technology’s 3.5 per cent gain in the first quarter is less than half its 10 per cent rally the previous three months.“Sectors that led the rally since last August are now lagging as investors worry about the ability of companies to increase their earnings,” says Ms Moore.One closely watched barometer will be the Dow Jones Transports Average, seen as a bellwether. This week, it climbed to a 52-week high, boosted by the performance of railways, which are seen as benefiting from more demand as fuel costs hurt truckers.Yet, having risen more than 140 per cent since March 2009, the Dow Jones Transports has slowed to a gain of 3.3 per cent since the end of December.Mr Ablin says: “A loss of momentum among this type of sector will be a prime indicator that the squeeze is ready to force the broad market lower.”Already, the first quarter has seen a marked reversal for airlines, which are highly sensitive to higher energy costs. The Bloomberg airline index has fallen 7 per centThe share prices for the big two delivery companies, FedEx, up 0.8 per cent for the quarter, and UPS, up 2.7 per cent, could also be useful leading indicators.But, for all the uncertainty over the effects of higher oil prices, equities are still seen by many as a better bet than bonds this year. Ms Moore expects oil prices to peak in the second quarter. A retreat in equities would represent a buying opportunity for those who have added heavily to their bond holdings in the past two years. “We still see equities as outperforming bonds in 2011,” she says.US consumers are not feeling particularly buoyant at the moment and that is potentially bad news for companies banking on a sustained recovery. his week, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge for March plunged to a three-month low. Consumers sharply lowered their expectations for future business activity, employment prospects and income growth. Meanwhile rising prices for food and energy pushed expectations for inflation over the next year to the highest level since October of 2008.
245;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-03-18T00:55:02Z;Multinationals warn over Japanese supplies;;Multinational companies in several sectors are warning of supply-chain disruptions, after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan.General Motors became the first international group to announce a direct impact on production after the disasters. The US carmaker announced that it would halt output from Monday at an assembly plant in Louisiana due to a shortage of parts from Japan. The company said it had sufficient vehicles to meet customer demand.Sony Ericsson, the smartphone joint venture between Japan’s Sony and Sweden’s Ericsson, said the earthquake would affect its supply chain and German carmaker Volkswagen warned of a possible medium-term components shortage.One person close to Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, said it anticipated disruption to its supply chain. The company declined to comment. In 2010, 15 per cent of the components in its handsets were sourced in yen.Sony Ericsson said: “Although the full impact of the current situation on our business will take additional time to assess, [we] anticipate disruption to [our] supply-chain operations.”The company is trying to source alternative components from manufacturers outside Japan. It faces a ­further problem as the country is one of its important sales markets.iSuppli, an analyst firm, said that some Apple components, including flash memory and a thin battery used in the iPad 2 tablet, came from Japan and it warned that the company might “have difficulties obtaining this battery, and it may not be able to secure supply from an external, non-Japanese source”.Apple declined to comment. Most flash manufacturing facilities are in regions not yet affected by the quake and tsunami but problems with power, transport or other issues could affect supply for the iPad 2.Martin Winterkorn, VW’s chief executive, would not rule out that Europe’s top-selling carmaker could be hit by supply shortages in the next few weeks.“We are worried and we have to monitor this every day,” he said, adding that VW saw no near-term supply problems.Mr Winterkorn said the group was concerned about its Japan-sourced gearboxes as its Japanese supplier faced repeated power disruption at its plants.Gary Lynch, head of supply-chain risk management at Marsh Risk Consulting, said most disruption would not come from the physical destruction of production facilities, but from transport problems and a lack of energy supply. “A multinational company should [assume] its business [will be] severely disrupted for an extended period.” He said the high-tech, automotive and steel industries would be hit first.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline group, said there might be some “pinch points” in supply chains in Japan, with “some effect” on automotive and high-tech production.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by sales, and Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for phones, said the earthquake would not hurt production. Motorola Mobility and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, said they saw little or no impact on their supply chains.Additional reporting by Bernard Simon in Toronto and Joseph Menn in San Francisco
246;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
247;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-03-17T13:56:46Z;FedEx delivers with upbeat forecast;;FedEx shares jumped in pre-market trading, after investors shrugged off weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and focused on the package delivery company’s forecasts for strong demand and higher margins in the rest of the year.For the three months to the end of February, net income fell three per cent to $231m, compared to the same period last year, on revenues that rose 11 per cent to $9.7bn. Earnings per share slipped to $0.73 from $0.76 last year.Excluding certain one off charges, FedEx earned about $0.81 a share, which fell just short of revised analyst estimates.Last month, FedEx slashed its third-quarter earnings estimates by about $0.25 per share after the company was hit by severe winter storms, which dented shipping volumes, and higher fuel prices, which increased costs.FedEx shares, which have fallen about 8 per cent since the start of the year, rose about 5 per cent to $89.36 in pre-market trading after Fred Smith, chief executive officer, painted a positive picture of the current quarter and the next year.“Continued growth in the global economy is driving solid revenue gains in our transportation businesses,” Mr Smith said. “We expect strong demand for our services to boost our financial performance in our fourth quarter.”FedEx said that growth would be helped by the recent combination of its FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL (Less than truckload) operations, which would create a leaner, more efficient freight business.FedEx and its rivals, UPS and Deutsche Post DHL, are closely watched by investors as barometers of the global economy because they carry the goods that make up the backbone of international commerce and trade.For 2011, FedEx expects earnings per share of between $4.83 and $5.00, down from its previous forecast of $5.00 to $5.30 per share, excluding restructuring charges and certain legal costs.The forecast assumes that fuel prices remain stable and moderate global economic growth continues and FedEx warned that “ongoing political turmoil” in the Middle East and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan created uncertainties.
248;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-03-14T15:26:16Z;France advises citizens to leave Tokyo;;Amid growing alarm about problems at three stricken nuclear reactors, France on Monday became the first country to advise its nationals to leave Tokyo. In a notice on its website, the French embassy also cited a warning from Japan’s meteorological agency about a possible large aftershock in the Kanto region around Tokyo, following Friday’s 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that devastated the north-east of Japan.“The probability of such an event in the next three days is 70 per cent, and 50 per cent in the two days following,” the embassy said.“Based on the above stated risk of probably a severe earthquake, as well as the uncertainty of the nuclear issue, it seems reasonable to recommend to people who do not have to stay in the Tokyo and Kanto area [that] they should not do so …We strongly advise French nationals to postpone any travels planned to Japan.”As a growing stream of expatriate families and even business executives made plans to leave Japan or relocate to cities west of Tokyo such as Osaka, France’s move highlighted growing concerns among embassies about the safety of nationals.The reports on Monday of a second explosion at a damaged nuclear power plant on Japan’s earthquake-ravaged north-east coast deepened fears of radioactive contamination, although many nuclear experts have dismissed such concerns.Further unnerving Tokyo’s jittery residents, Tepco, Japan’s main power supplier, announced that rolling power cuts would kick in from Monday night in some areas of Tokyo.On top of that was news that many schools, both foreign and Japanese, would be closed for at least part of the week. Many offices, restaurants and shops remained closed on Monday, and it became clear that there would be further disruptions to public transport and shortages of key food supplies. There were also signs of fresh problems in mobile telephone networks, which were severely disrupted for 20 hours following the quake.For worried residents – both expatriate and Japanese – who have decided to leave Tokyo, the clincher was the continuation of tremors from aftershocks in the wake of Friday’s quake.In a message on the US embassy website, John Roos, US ambassador to Japan, warned that there would “continue to be substantial misinformation in the public domain” about quake-related issues and urged US citizens to follow the instructions of Japanese civil defence authorities.The US also urged its citizens to avoid travel to Japan, while advising those in Japan to heed instructions from Japanese authorities including avoiding the vicinity of the troubled Fukushima nuclear power plants within a 20km radius.Many people, however, expressed doubt that such a relatively small radius would guard against radioactive contamination, particularly after news of the second explosion at the Fukushima nuclear plant on Monday. The blast left 11 workers injured and prompted the US navy to order a fleet of ships off the coast of Fukushima to move away, after confirming low-level contamination in the atmosphere.The UK embassy in Japan, meanwhile, warned of the continuing risks of aftershocks and tsunamis throughout the country, saying that the “nature of the disaster means that the threat of a tsunami is changing regularly”. Britain’s Foreign Office advised against all non-essential travel to Tokyo and Japan’s north-east of Japan while it “assesses the damage caused”.Australia has advised citizens to “reconsider” travel plans to Tokyo and eight prefectures hit by the earthquake and tsunami, and has warned people not to visit areas near the Fukushima nuclear power facility.
249;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-03-07T02:35:54Z;Modec runs out of power with debts of £40m;;Modec, maker of pioneering electric delivery vans, has gone into administration with debts of more than £40m.The main creditor is Federated Investments, the vehicle of Lord Borwick, who founded Modec in 2004. He invested the £14m profit on the sale of the 38 per cent stake held by his family for more than 40 years in Manganese Bronze, maker of the London taxi.News of the administration emerged the day after Manganese Bronze announced the single largest order for its taxis. The company’s joint venture with Geely Automobile Holdings of China is to supply 1,000 vehicles worth $27m (£16.6m) to Azerbaijan by the end of November.Lord Borwick, a former chairman of Manganese Bronze, set up an assembly plant in Coventry to build the Modec, which is comparable in size to a Ford Transit or Mercedes Sprinter. Tesco took 15 of the first vans to be built in 2007, but has not placed an order since.The plan was to increase production to 2,000 vans a year, but so far just 400 have been sold, including 150 in the UK, to customers such as UPS and FedEx.The report and accounts for 2009 show turnover of £9.3m, a pre-tax loss of £6m and net liabilities of £29m. Grant Thornton, the auditors, said the figures indicated “a material uncertainty which may cast doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”.Three partners from Zolfo Cooper, a corporate advisory and restructuring business, were appointed as administrators on Friday, and immediately made 26 of the 53 employees redundant. They described Modec as “a market leader in its field, and as such it represents an attractive purchase for the right buyer”.Lord Borwick said the company had been hit by the recession, which had left potential customers reluctant to invest in something new. In spite of low interest rates, companies had been unwilling to incur the high capital cost of £55,000 per van. Enthusiasm for green transport was at a lower level than three years ago, even though diesel was becoming expensive.Nevertheless he believed that electric vehicles with low running costs were “the vehicles of the future. But we are unfortunately operating in the present”.The difficult economic climate has claimed other victims among companies focused on green transport. In April 2009, Axeon, an Aim-quoted company that supplied Modec with battery packs, was taken private after going into administration. At the beginning of this year, Tanfield, the Aim-quoted powered access specialist, completed the sale of the assets of Smith Electric Vehicles UK to its US associate. The group had set out to become a global leader in zero-emission electric trucks through its ownership of Smith Electric, renowned for producing milk floats in the 1950s.
250;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-02-25T19:24:42Z;Companies concerned about rising fuel costs;;Companies around the world have begun to warn about the impact of higher fuel costs on their businesses, raising fears about profits and inflation.Companies in the most energy-intensive sectors, such as airlines, have been the first to raise the alarm, but analysts warned that a sustained period of high oil prices would have a widespread effect on earnings.On Friday, Thai Airways, the state-controlled carrier, said that it would have to review its revenue targets to assess the impact of the rise in oil prices.International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said it was “likely” that fares would rise again, following fuel surcharges already imposed, if the volatility in oil markets continued.US airlines have already been raising fares. At the start of the year, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch calculated that US airlines could still achieve the same operating margins this year as in 2010, even if oil prices averaged about $102 per barrel. US crude briefly exceeded that level on Thursday.FedEx, the transport and delivery company, said last week that its third-quarter earnings, to be reported on March 17, were likely to be lower than previously indicated because of higher fuel costs and bad weather.The car industry is also likely to be feel the impact of higher oil prices, particularly in the US.General Motors and Ford, the US car manufacturers, reported fourth-quarter earnings hit by higher costs for materials, including metals and rubber, and now face a further blow.The US companies remain heavily dependent on pick-up trucks and SUVs, by far their most profitable vehicles, leaving them exposed when fuel costs rise and consumers look for more economical vehicles.Daniel Akerson, GM’s chief executive, said on Thursday: “Energy is going to be more expensive, so we’ve got to prepare for that and it’s come a little bit earlier maybe than the industry or the economy . . . expected or wanted, so we’re going to have to react.”Not every company is yet being squeezed by the higher oil price. Jürgen Hambrecht, chief executive of BASF, the world’s largest chemicals company by market capitalisation, said on Thursday the group had been able to pass on most of the price hikes to its customers in the past year, and it was expecting to do so again.Dow Chemical of the US similarly talked about “pricing momentum”, and only a “slight, and temporary” squeeze on margins, when it reported full-year results earlier this month.However, the damping effect of higher fuel prices on economic growth in oil-importing countries is likely to mean that the impact will in time be felt across most industries.Martin Regalia, chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group, said high oil prices had a “double whammy” effect.“They raise costs for all companies, particularly those that use a lot of oil to move stuff around in trucks or aircraft, and they slow down growth because they take spending power away from consumers. And both of those factors work together to reduce profitability.”Additional reporting by Bernard Simon in Toronto, Daniel Schäfer in Frankfurt and Jeremy Lemer in New York
251;FDX;Fedex Corp;2011-02-15T22:16:15Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;NYSE Euronext lost ground after unveiling formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange, while the wider markets fell away from 30-month highs on disappointing economic data.Shares in NYSE were down 3.4 per cent to $38.12 after it emerged that the German exchange will own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 14 per cent since merger talks were announced, however.The wider markets were lower following data from the Commerce Department showing that US retail sales had risen by their slowest pace since last June . Sales were up only 0.3 per cent in January against the 0.6 per cent forecast by economists.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,328.01, the biggest one-day fall in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,226.64 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,804.35.In the previous session, the S&P 500 index crept to within two points of 1,333.58, which is the point where the index will have doubled since its March 2009 low.The S&P has risen more than 23 per cent in the last six months. Given this strong run, many commentators have been forecasting a short-term fall for the few weeks. “The markets are poised for a sell-off, it just needs a trigger,” said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group.Energy stocks saw the sharpest losses as oil prices softened. ExxonMobil was 2.3 per cent lower at $82.97 while Marathon Oil was down 2 per cent at $48.07. The S&P energy index lost 1.1 per cent. ExxonMobil lost ground in spite of reporting that it had added 3.5bn barrels of oil equivalent to its proved reserves last year.There was also an element of profit-taking in the sector following a run that has seen energy stocks put on 45 per cent since the start of September.Elsewhere in the sector, an Ecuadorian court ordered Chevron to pay up to $8.6bn in damages for environmental damage dating back 40 years but the markets seemed largely unruffled by the news. Chevron was only 0.6 per cent lower at $96.34.The wider markets were also weighed down by news that homebuilder sentiment had remained unchanged at its low levels in February, according to the housing market index from the National Association of Homebuilders.“Unfortunately for builders, there is a massive supply overhang of existing homes, which will present brutal competition to the new home market in the foreseeable future,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.In more positive economic news, data from the Bank of New York’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that manufacturing activity had expanded in February.Also, the Empire State’s business conditions index rose to 15.43, which was ahead of the 11.92 reading last month and the 15 expected by economists.FedEx cut its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2011 by at least 22 per cent, blaming the move on bad weather and volatile fuel prices that have increased expenses and reduced revenues. But this failed to drag down its shares, as the forecast was largely expected. FedEx rose 2.1 per cent to $95.98.The delivery company now expects adjusted earnings to be between 70-90 cents per share for the three months to the end of February, down from previous forecasts of between 95 cents and $1.15.A series of ratings downgrades hurt individual stocks. JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, fell 10.2 per cent to $25.05 after Sanford C Bernstein & Co cut its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”.Netflix was down 2.7 per cent to $240.79 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the video rental and streaming company to “equal weight” from “overweight”.Qwest Communications International was down 3 per cent to $7.20 after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss caused by a series of one-time charges.Dell, the PC maker, was up 0.2 per cent to $13.92 in anticipation of its quarterly results. After the closing bell, earnings came in at 53 cents a share ahead of estimates of 37 cent per share.Sirius XM Radio, the satellite radio company, was down 7.9 per cent to $1.69 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss, although the number of subscribers grew. Sirius reported a fourth-quarter loss of $81.4m from a profit of $11.9m in the same period a year earlier.
252;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
253;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;FedEx slashes earnings forecast;;FedEx on Monday cut its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2011 by at least 22 per cent, blaming the move on bad weather and volatile fuel prices that have increased expenses and reduced revenues.This winter, European and US cities have been snowed under, while oil prices have spiked, in part due to instability in the Middle East.“We experienced significant network disruptions …and unusually high costs from severe winter storms. In addition, fuel prices continued to escalate since we provided our earnings outlook in December,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer of FedEx, said in a statement.The package delivery company now expects adjusted earnings, excluding certain freight costs, to be between $0.70 and $0.90 per share for the three months to the end of February. Previously, FedEx had forecast earnings of between $0.95 and $1.15.FedEx said the constrained performance would dent its full-year expectations and that it would update the market further when it releases its third-quarter results on March 17.Earlier this month, United Parcel Service, FedEx’s main rival, said it was hopeful it could mitigate the effects of poor weather and higher fuel costs, but admitted first quarter 2011 earnings were under pressure. “Europe, [where they had] the worst weather in the UK in 60 years, had a big impact on us. But there really hasn’t been a good, clean week in January so far, week after week,” Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, told investors.Wall Street has reduced its forecasts for both companies. In the past four weeks, analysts have cut their third-quarter expectations for FedEx by $0.06 a share to $1.02 and their first quarter forecasts for UPS by $0.03 a share to $0.87.Nevertheless, most analysts remain positive on the sector. After a tough period in 2009, delivery companies bounced back strongly in 2010 as the global economy experienced a moderate recovery and international trade surged. Christian Wetherbee at Citibank wrote at the end of January: “The bull case for FedEx is underpinned by improving economic growth domestically and internationally, which is likely to drive better volumes and solid pricing.”Mr Graf said FedEx continued “to see strength in our base business across all transportation segments and geographies”. But he cautioned that the revised third quarter estimates assumed stable weather and fuel prices.FedEx shares, which have climbed about 20 per cent over the past 12 months, slipped 1 per cent to $93.34 in after-hours trading. UPS shares, which have added a third in the last year, fell 1 per cent to $74.25.

This sent shares in the company up 5.5 per cent to $19.22.The industry bellwether posted income of $2.89bn, or 36 cents a share, up from $767m, or 10 cents a share a year earlier. Optimism over the stock was muted slightly, however, as the company gave a 2011 profit forecast that was below analysts’ expectations.Nevertheless, the news helped lift the rest of the pharmaceutical sector. Mylan, one of the world’s largest generic drugs companies, was up 1.6 per cent to $23.54 while Merck gained 2.5 per cent to $34.But the best performing sector on Wall Street was the materials sector, which was lifted by data showing booming manufacturing activity in the US and around the world.The S&P materials index was up 2.8 per cent to 246.02 as the ISM manufacturing composite index jumped to 60.8 in January, up 2.3 from December and ahead of the median forecast of 58. This was its highest level since May 2004.“Today’s report is another very strong signal regarding near-term manufacturing activity. To sustain this strength, much will depend on the consumer,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Among the stocks to gain were Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, which was up 4.9 per cent to $89.64 and Alcoa, an aluminium producer, which added 4.5 per cent to $17.32.This helped the S&P 500 close 1.7 per cent higher to 1,307,59 busting through the technically significant 1,300 mark that the markets struggled with last week.The S&P index lost 1.8 per cent late last week on disappointing GDP figures and concerns that the Suez Canal might be shut down due to the protests in Egypt. But the markets have now completely bounced back from those losses after two consecutive sessions of strong gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 12,040.16, the first time the index closed above 12,000 since June 2008. Last month, the index saw its best January performance since 1997. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent to 2,751.19 in the session.Central to investor confidence in the session was a string of healthy earnings reports. Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported that second-quarter earnings had jumped 29 per cent in the second quarter due to high grain prices and strong global demand. This sent shares in the company up 6.2 per cent to $34.70.ADM reported a net profit of $732m, or $1.14 per share, compared with a profit of $567m, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier and way ahead of analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share.United Parcel Service also saw strong results, reporting a 48 per cent jump in profits due to strong demand over the holiday period. The logistics group also forecast that 2011 will see record earnings, eclipsing the 2007 peak in earnings. The news lifted the shares 4.2 per cent to $74.59.Fedex, another global delivery company, added 2.6 per cent to $92.69.Also helping to liven the S&P index were energy stocks, which saw strong gains as the Brent crude oil price hit $100 a barrel in the previous session for the first time since October 2008.ExxonMobil, the giant of the energy sector, was up another 4 per cent to $83.91 in the session. The company posted earnings on Monday close to the 2008 record, which sent the shares up 2.1 per cent. The stock is up 36 per cent since the start of September.Murphy Oil was up 3.1 per cent to $68.37 while the S&P energy index added 1.9 per cent to 554.13.Lexmark International, which makes laser and inkjet printers, saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 13.2 per cent to $39.45 after predicting strong first-quarter
profits.Baidu saw strong gains after the Chinese internet-search group said revenue had doubled in the fourth quarter and net earnings had increased by 171 per cent, beating analyst and company expectations. The stock was up 9.3 per cent to $118.73. Rival Google rose 1.8 per cent to $611.04"
255;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx plans to spend more due to tax break;Delivery group to develop freight aircraft fleet;FedEx will ramp up its capital expenditures in the next two years in the wake of the tax cut extension package passed by Congress in late 2010, according to Fred Smith, chief executive of the global parcel delivery company.Mr Smith’s pledge will be closely watched as one early sign of the impact of the tax deal. If other leading businesses make similar plans it could provide a boost for the US economy, at a time when recovery has been tempered by slow job creation.In December, Washington passed legislation allowing companies to write off their purchases of equipment and software in 2011 and 2012 at a much faster rate than was previously possible, in effect reducing the upfront costs of buying new machinery.Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Smith said that as a result he expected capital investment to exceed the $3.5bn the group spent in the current financial year, much of it on developing a fleet of US-built Boeing 777 freighter aircraft.However, Mr Smith warned that a more extensive overhaul of the corporate tax system was vital if the US was to reach its full economic potential and rebalance the economy from financial services towards manufacturing.The comments come as US businesses are hoping for a “reset” in their relationship with the Obama administration in the wake of the Republican victories in the midterm elections and persistent criticism that the president has little time for corporate America.Mr Obama is due to address the US Chamber of Commerce, a conservative business trade group, for the first time in early February. The group has been critical of the president’s policies and has funnelled millions of dollars towards Republican candidates.Mr Smith said that he had seen signs of progress in the administration’s attitude towards business, particularly in its willingness to “listen” on issues such as the tax treatment of capital investment and the extension of tax cuts in concert with Congress.“The short-term incentives of expensing capital investment in 2011 and 2012 will increase capital investment, and capital investment by the private sector is what is most [closely] correlated with job creation,” Mr Smith said.Still, the depreciation rules have received a mixed reception. The White House estimates the measures will support $50bn in new investment, but economists worry companies will just bring forward investments they would have made in later years anyway.● It emerged at the end of last week that FedEx and rival UPS are under investigation by the US Department of Justice over allegations that they broke antitrust rules relating to their treatment of third-party shipping consultants.
256;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx and UPS in US antitrust probe;;UPS and FedEx, two of the world’s biggest parcel delivery companies, are being investigated by the US Department of Justice over allegations that they broke antitrust rules relating to their treatment of third-party shipping consultants.Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for UPS, said the company had been co-operating “fully” with the authorities since November when the DoJ launched a preliminary investigation in response to a lawsuit filed by AFMS, an Oregon-based consulting firm.“We’re aware that the plaintiff’s attorney has asked the justice department to look into this issue,” said Maury Lane, a spokesman for FedEx. The DoJ declined to comment. AFMS said it had not contacted the DoJ.Such has been the complexity of the rates and services offered by FedEx and UPS, that even multinational companies have employed consultants to help them choose the most suitable products.These third parties also negotiate discounts from carriers, that can range from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the base prices. They typically receive a proportion of the money saved as a fee.In a lawsuit filed last summer in a district court in California, AFMS, one such consultancy, claimed UPS and FedEx had conspired to monopolise the package delivery business, refusing to deal with consultants and intimidating customers who used third parties.AFMS, whose customers include Sony and Guess, said it had suffered damages of more than $20m as a result of the carriers’ actions. UPS and FedEx have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which will be heard this month.In their responses, lawyers for the carriers argued they continued to deal with consultants, that it was, by definition, impossible for two carriers to monopolise an industry and that AFMS had presented no evidence of collusion.Ms Rosenberg said that as a result of the suit, the DoJ had asked UPS for details of its policies for interacting with third-party negotiators and shipping consultants.“We defend our right to decline to work with third-party negotiators if we believe it is in the best interest of customers …The notion that FedEx and UPS would conspire is outrageous …we compete aggressively,” she said.One consultant familiar with the issue said: “Carriers love it when they win new business thanks to a consultant but when they lose a big customer they tend to blame the consultants.”UPS shares, which surged more than 25 per cent in the past year as the global economy recovered, fell slightly to $71.94. FedEx dipped 0.2 per cent to $93.
257;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-12-16T21:46:03Z;US stocks edge higher on manufacturing data;;"FedEx shares rose in spite of missing analyst expectations as the delivery company was upbeat about its fiscal year 2011, while the wider indices edged higher.FedEx missed expectations with its second-quarter profit, which was lower than in the same period a year ago. Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline
for resolving a dispute
over the assets.The biggest truckload carrier in North America, Swift Transportation, edged up 0.9 per cent to $11.10 in its first day of trading. The company had to cut the price of its initial public offering to $806m, or $11 per share, when it had originally offered shares at between $13 and $15 each.In other earnings news, General Mills profits rose 8.6 per cent and shares added 0.6 per cent to $36.59 after the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup missed analyst expectations. Sales volume rose but the company cut prices
to attract cash-conscious
shoppers.Starbucks added 2.3 per cent to $32.59 after analysts at Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the coffee chain by placing it on their “conviction buy” list, saying it has not yet saturated the US market.They gave the stock a $44 price target, 38 per cent higher than the stock’s previous closing price.Meanwhile, Transocean, which fell on Wednesday after it was among the companies that the US government sued over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, dropped further and was down 3.6 per cent to $69.31 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the oil rig owner from “overweight” to “equal weight”."
258;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-12-16T18:37:04Z;FedEx chief sees strong 2011 start;;Strong holiday demand, the impact of tax deals in Washington and another round of restocking will drive faster than expected growth in the new year, according to the chief executive of FedEx, the global package delivery company.“Overall the global economic picture is increasingly positive as the recovery continues at a steady pace,” Fred Smith told investors on Thursday, noting that Monday had been the busiest day in the company’s history in terms of total shipments carried.FedEx expects holiday volumes to grow 3.3 per cent compared to last year, up from an earlier forecast of 3 per cent. Mr Smith said another round of restocking was likely in early February, because US businesses have low inventories.“We believe consumer and business sentiments are improving,” Mr Smith said, noting the company had raised its expectations for US GDP growth in 2011 from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent and expects growth to accelerate in 2012.Mr Smith singled out the recent Congressional action on taxes as an encouraging sign, saying that moves to allow companies to expense capital equipment purchases faster would create “jobs and [increase] economic activity and GDP”.FedEx said it would consider speeding up purchases of 777 Boeing aircraft if the measures were to pass. The company already has 11 of the long-range freight aircraft and plans to take delivery of 22 more by 2016.The comments came as FedEx reported second-quarter fiscal 2011 results that undershot Wall Street estimates as legal expenses and restructuring costs cut into profits and growth rates in Asia moderated slightly.Logistics and parcel delivery companies such as FedEx, UPS and Deutsche Post DHL were hit by the slump in global trade during the downturn but have recovered strongly as commerce has picked up.In the three months to the end of November FedEx’s net income fell 18 per cent to $283m compared with the same period in 2010 due in part to increased fuel prices and a 23 per cent decline in operating profits at the express unit.That division was hit by a $66m charge to fund a legal reserve after it lost a case to ATA Airlines in October. The Indianapolis based airline claimed that FedEx had pushed it out of business by abruptly cancelling a key contract.The company reported earnings per share of $0.89, down 19 per cent from $1.10 in the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings per share excluding one-off items was $1.16. Revenues rose 12 per cent to $9.6bn and FedEx raised its fiscal 2011 earnings forecast to between $5.00 and $5.30 per share, excluding the one-off legal charges. That is up from a previous estimate of $4.80 to $5.25 per share.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.31 a share on revenue of about $9.7bn.
259;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.
260;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-12-02T15:37:24Z;TNT;Dutch postal group’s decision to break up is neutral for investors;"Almost one year ago to the day, Peter Bakker, chief executive of TNT, was adamant the Dutch postal group would not be broken up. Just four months later – and perhaps under pressure from activist investors – he decided to spin off the declining mail business. A few months later, and the express parcel business was set to be jettisoned. Now, a plan for the latter has finally been confirmed; the split is real.The result for investors is effectively neutral. Upon completion of the demerger, they will own a share in the mail business and a separate share in the express business. The former will be valued at roughly €3bn and the latter €6bn, estimates Credit Suisse. Taken together, that is about the same as the combined business now. So why bother? After all, the additional costs of maintaining a second listed company could be €15m in the first year alone.There is certainly strategic logic for the split as the two businesses are very different. The snail-mail division focuses on Europe and particularly the Netherlands, and requires little capital. Its volumes shrank 7 per cent in the third quarter, although it still generates plenty of cash. Conversely, the global express business needs loads of capital to fuel its high growth agenda. Investors can now pick and choose.But the real impetus for the split may have come from TNT’s activist investors, who want to facilitate an acquisition. US rivals Fedex and UPS covet the express business as a vehicle to take them further into Europe; a separate listing would make a takeover easier. More importantly, takeovers fought over shares listed on a public exchange can push up the final purchase price, and with it the premium for shareholders. Either way, TNT shareholders win – which shows that bigger is not always better.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
261;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-11-08T22:26:26Z;Find a way into the hearts of customers;Companies need to pay more attention to client emotions when designing their operations;Imagine a couple goes in to see a doctor who tells them their child will be born with a genetic disorder. It is mid-morning and when they emerge from their consultation, they see a row of parents bouncing their healthy children on their laps. The emotional shock they have just experienced with the doctor will now be compounded by feelings of appalling unfairness. Why us?While the genetic test results cannot be changed, the process by which prospective parents are informed could be. The couple could be asked in to the clinic in the early morning or evening, when there are no other patients around. They could be shown out through a side door, so they don’t have to see babies right after they receive their bad news.It is not just doctors’ offices that could find ways to improve the process by which they handle emotions. Airlines dealing with delayed passengers, insurance companies dealing with traumatised claimants, management consultants explaining their bill could all benefit from a better understanding of the emotional peaks and troughs experienced by their customers.In Designing the Soft Side of Customer Service, a paper recently published in the MIT Sloan Management Review, Sriram Dasu and Richard Chase of the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California argue that emotions are too rarely included in operations design.Operations managers, Prof Dasu told me, regard emotions as too soft an issue to be integrated into the blinking lights and spinning discs of their world. “They don’t realise that emotions are very process driven.”Let’s say you have bought a laptop and within the first month of owning it, it fails three times. Your third call will be a more emotionally intense call than your first. But will the laptop manufacturer assign a more seasoned service agent to deal with you? Or will you simply be led through the same complaint process you experienced with your first call? In the paper, the profs say that companies should design “emotion prints” of the customer experience and tailor their processes accordingly. Emotions are far more predictable and manageable than many operations managers believe. You do not need heroic individuals with extraordinary levels of emotional intelligence to make dramatic interventions. Rather, the process can be designed more like a factory line, with variables that can be managed and measured.One advantage of this approach is that it takes broad intentions such as improving customer service and makes the process detailed and actionable. You do not need to train all employees in the same way. Rather you can identify the emotions they most frequently deal with and train them to deal with those.For example, explains Prof Dasu, bellboys and concierges are trained to display an “attitude of invitation”. This is what matters most when guests arrive. Similarly, a few US sports teams are now training everyone from the ticket-taker to the hot dog vendor to welcome customers as if they were welcoming them into their home. Fans come to games excited and stadium employees should find ways to deliver service that recognises that mood.The professors focus on designing for emotions, trust and control. The first step means crafting that emotion print and allocating resources to deal with customers at the emotional high and low points of their interaction with you.Designing for trust is about trying to create the best environment for doing business. This is the silver bullet for managing customer relationships. A trusting customer believes you have their best interests at heart. One who mistrusts you will constantly be demanding explanations and price reductions and making life a misery. Trust evens out the emotional volatility in any relationship.Designing for control is closely linked to designing for trust. People will accept less control over a process if they trust you. But you can also manage those feelings of control. FedEx does it by allowing you to track your packages. You cannot make it move faster, but by letting you know where the parcel is, FedEx is assuring you it is delivering on its promise. Setting and then meeting deadline expectations is a simple way to create feelings of trust and control.Designing for control also lets people manage their own emotions. When the stock market is down, you can decide whether to look at your investment portfolio. Imagine how different it would be if every week, your investment manager had to call you and explain his performance.“Companies already do a lot of this, but operations managers still treat emotions as outside their bailiwick,” says Prof Dasu. “They get queasy when you bring them up.”But they will wish someone had the moment customers gravitate to competitors that treat them as emotional rather than purely rational or financial beings.philip@philipdelvesbroughton.com
262;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-11-07T21:53:32Z;DHL ready to expand again after US setback;;Express delivery company DHL Express has undergone a tough restructuring after pulling the plug on its US domestic delivery business two years ago and is now ready to expand again, its chief executive said.“We’ve stabilised the business, everyone’s refocused,” said Ken Allen, who is also a board member of Germany’s Deutsche Post, which owns DHL Express. “I know it’s early days, but we know what we need to do to grow.”In particular, he said, DHL Express was aiming to work more closely with Post’s two other freight units, DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply-Chain Management, to offer DHL customers different ways of moving goods.“It’s not about cross-selling, it’s about offering each customer a full range of logistical services,” said Mr Allen, who joined the company some 35 years ago. “People talk about a one-stop-shop, but I call it a [shopping] mall.”After losing billions trying to establish itself as a domestic rival to US-based UPS and Federal Express, DHL Express hit the headlines in 2008 when it closed its national US express-delivery business, shedding 15,000 jobs.In the wake of this dramatic move, Mr Allen moved from heading DHL Express’ US business to running the entire company in 2009 and sought to bring the company back to its original strength – cross-border express delivery.While UPS and FedEx started life as domestic players, DHL was founded in the US in 1969 to provide international express services to its – mainly US – corporate clients, who were then expanding their global businesses.“DHL was pretty much alone in the game until the early 90s, when rivals got into the international business,” Mr Allen said. “We should never forget that we are the global market leader in international express delivery.”While DHL Express’ US presence shrivelled, analysts at Dutch bank ING reckon the company in 2008 moved 24 per cent of international packages from Europe and 36 per cent of packages within Asia – more than any rival.In the second quarter of this year, DHL Express clocked up revenues of €1.6bn ($2.2bn) from cross-border express delivery, while UPS and FedEx respectively recorded €1.5bn and €1.4bn in sales for international package deliveries.Mr Allen said DHL’s selling point was the fact it was “a collection of businesses which all grew up locally to form an international network”, rather than being a more centrally operated business like some of its rivals.“In Australia, we sponsor the lifesavers at the beach, our brand is an integral part of society,” British-born Mr Allen said. “People think of us as a UK company in the UK. It’s a real ‘think globally, act locally’ company.”He recalled taking managers from the US – where DHL continues to pick up and deliver international packages – to Europe and Asia.“The penny dropped,” he said. “They saw how strong the brand was outside the US.”Mr Allen in addition trimmed DHL Express’ structure and costs. He sold domestic delivery businesses in the UK and France, and trimmed management, including DHL Express’ board, which shrank from 13 members to five.DHL Express also bought domestic delivery companies in India and China, although Mr Allen said these moves were “one-offs” rather than an attempt to re-enter national express delivery markets in any major way.“The company is back to a level of profitability not seen since Deutsche Post took over [DHL in 2002]. We’ve taken cost out without sacrificing quality,” said the man who daily receives punctuality statistics by e-mail.Instead of losing most of DHL Express’ international clients in the US, “we managed to keep 75 per cent”, he said. The plan was to cut US losses from €1.3bn to €400m by now. “I can say that we’ve done better than that.”
263;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-11-01T16:34:20Z;Parcel force;For logistics companies, terrorism is just another cost of doing business;Thunderstorms can be terrifying, but are nothing out of the ordinary. The same is true of social weather, even if individual events appear disturbingly unpredictable. So markets are unruffled by the discovery of bombs in aircraft cargo holds– September 11 was a shocker but research from Standard and Poor’s shows that on average the S&P 500 was up 2 per cent within a month of subsequent serious terrorist events. For logistics companies, terrorism is just another cost of doing business, like stormy seas or negotiating with Somali pirates.Indeed, even a new layer of security costs – if governments decide more needs to be done – would be insubstantial next to the big expenses of fuel, capital and labour. Since everyone would pay, no one would lose out to competitors. Customers might face delays, but shippers and freight forwarders are used to rerouting around bottlenecks.Indeed, prosaic concerns are more pressing for freight operators, in particular the gentle pace of economic recovery and its uneven geographic spread. Asian trade is still booming, but in Europe Dutch parcel company TNT on Monday reported average yields and shipment growth in the third quarter that were below analyst expectations. In the US, growth rates for air cargo have slowed as the boost from industrial restocking starts to fade.There are also structural concerns, particularly in Europe. High margin overnight business, a priority for several years, could lose out as customers restructure operations in the wake of the recession. Cheapness and reliability might be more valued than speed. Land shipments are less of a threat to air freight in the gigantic US, but investors in FedEx and UPS might worry that one of them will overpay for the express business of TNT, which is about to be split out from the mail operation. As far as market valuation is concerned, the thunderstorms of terrorism are in the past.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
264;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-10-18T20:49:56Z;Graduates face a hard road to the top;There are few silver linings for today’s students;These are rotten times to be graduating from school, undergraduate or graduate school and trying to find work. All that education, all those high-minded speeches about pursuing your dreams and inheriting the future and boom, smack into the worst economy since Tom Joad chewed the grapes of wrath.What solace is there for students going through this particular agony, and their anxious parents? Well, some of the greatest businesses in the world were founded during dark economic times. Microsoft and FedEx were started in the depths of the mid-1970s recession. Thomas Edison founded General Electric during the slump of the late 1870s.In some ways, recessions are ideal times to start a business. Rents are cheap, suppliers are biddable and hiring should be a cinch. Unfortunately, if what you have in mind is a more conventional career the news is not so good.Antoinette Schoar, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, has studied the careers of managers who start working at different points in the business cycle. She found that chief executives who began their careers during a recession took longer to become CEO and were more likely to have risen through the ranks within one organisation than to have moved over from other industries or companies.They also tend to be CEOs of smaller businesses and to have more conservative management styles, using less leverage and investing more in internal operations than on acquisitions.Prof Schoar also found that CEOs who start their careers during a recession have more graduate degrees, likely a consequence of delaying their entry into the labour market in the hope of escaping the worst of it.It may seem unfair that the economic climate that greets you in your early to mid-20s affects where you end up 25 years later. But Prof Schoar isn’t the only one saying it. Lisa Kahn, an economist at the Yale School of Management, wrote a paper last year that concluded that “graduating from college in a bad economy has a long-run, negative impact on wages”.Why exactly isn’t entirely clear. One reason may be that people hired in a recession tend to start in lower positions and at lower wages than those who start in a boom. Even over the course of a career, that initial gap can be hard to eliminate. Another reason may be that by starting lower down, you waste time investing in skills that may be of no use later on, rather than quickly acquiring senior management abilities. Starting at the bottom may give you a good view of a company’s operations, but it also means you have a lot further to climb than someone in the boomtime rotational programme.Warren Buffett’s snowball theory is also relevant here. The earlier you can define your skills, talents and ambitions, the longer you have to let them roll downhill, accumulating size and power. Spending those early, precious years groping for work and then rolling down snowless ground is a waste that compounds over time.Prof Schoar has recommendations for both those starting work now and the companies that hire them. To recent graduates, she says, don’t let the job you’ve been given or the bad economic times limit you. Part of the reason that those starting out now will take longer to become CEO is that they don’t receive the broad set of experiences easily available to those who start their careers in good times. The cure for this is actively to pursue those different experiences, to demand them even in companies that are in retrenching mode. Ask to be moved to different departments, territories or functions. Don’t be inhibited by the conservatism that naturally affects companies in times like these. Your career will long outlast the gloom.For companies, Prof Schoar warns against misattributing success. People who have thrived in good times may have glittering CVs, awash with surging numbers and promotions. But were they really any good? Or were they just lifted by a rising tide? It is important for companies to look for and reward the managers who started their careers in, say, the dotcom bust of 2001 and then helped stabilise failing businesses in 2008 or 2009. They may seem less glamorous on paper, but they will be good hires and deserve greater recognition.In my own experience, a dose of hardship is useful for anyone. It’s the wild-eyed, boomtime gunslingers who cause the trouble, levering up, building models that misprice risk, persuading themselves and investors that the good times will never end.It can’t be any fun starting a career today. But for those of us hoping the managers of the future behave sensibly, it’s good to know they are starting out with a large inoculation against economic madness.philip@philipdelvesbroughton.com
265;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-09-30T19:22:56Z;UPS looks to tie up a share of domestic China market;;"When it comes to the business of express package delivery, speed is crucial – but so is timing. Little wonder then that United Parcel Service studied its application for a domestic parcel licence in China for more than a year before deciding to make its move this week.In some respects UPS has been slow off the mark. While it is a significant player in the delivery of packages to and from China – a market dominated by international carriers with their vast global networks – it has no domestic set-up, leaving it lagging behind in a fast-growing segment.Its peers have been providing domestic services within China for several years through joint ventures and acquisitions. For example, FedEx launched an overnight express delivery product within China following its 2007 purchase of local partner DTW.According to Parcel Research, a consultancy, DHL, part of Germany’s Deutsche Post, has more than 9,000 staff in China and about 380 domestic depots, while TNT, the Dutch carrier, has more than 16,000 employees and about 1,500 domestic depots.However, Dan Brutto, president of UPS’s international operations, argues that 2010 represents the perfect moment for a cautious company like UPS to expand beyond the international express business that has long been its focus in China.Chinese demand, once a distant possibility, is taking shape, he says. In 2005, less than 30 per cent of Chinese consumers had an annual disposable income of $3,000 or more but, by 2015, it is expected to be more than 77 per cent, according to some forecasts.IBISWorld, a market research company, estimates the Chinese courier market is worth about $9bn a year, of which 60 per cent is domestic volume, and will double in size by 2015.At the same time, Chinese officials have changed their attitudes to foreign carriers, says Mr Brutto. “China wants to export but they also realise that they need to import. Their people are becoming more affluent and want products from the outside.”A revised postal law introduced in October 2009 cut international companies out of the letter and document delivery segment but also for the first time created an attainable path for UPS to gain a domestic package licence.“China’s domestic delivery industry is in a period of consolidation and there is a good opportunity for foreign companies to expand here,” according to Xu Yong, chief adviser to China Express Consulting.In other markets, powerful incumbents have undone new entrants. In 2003 DHL tried to crack the US market but could never gain the scale to take market share from dominant players, FedEx and UPS. By the time it retreated in 2008 it had lost almost $10bn.But the Chinese market remains more fragmented. Apart from Chinese state-controlled EMS, which still controls about a third of the domestic express market, there are at least 10 other local companies vying for position and hundreds of smaller regional players.Mr Xu estimates that international companies may be able to capture a combined 5-8 per cent of the domestic delivery services market by 2015, up from a fraction of that today. The arrival of UPS, therefore, is likely to shake up the competition.According to Doug Caldwell of Parcel Research, while UPS is often slower to move than its peers, it rarely makes a mistake. “The culture of the company is that they don’t do things on the spur of the moment, they are very well thought out,” he said.Mr Brutto argues UPS’s approach has given it the time to get things right. It established its first joint venture in China in 1988, and bought the international operations of its local partner Sinotrans in 2005, rebranding its trucks in the distinctive UPS brown.With more than 5,500 employees in China, running a delivery fleet of more than 850 vans and trucks at 92 operating facilities, Mr Brutto says the company already covers 80 per cent of the domestic population from its presence in 33 of the largest cities.As a result UPS expects to spend millions of dollars to get its domestic service started once it receives government approval – small sums for a company with $45bn in revenues. To promote its brand it will run more brown trucks within cities but will rely on third parties to haul packages long distance.But while Chinese authorities are required to respond within 45 days of accepting the application, Mr Brutto points out that pinning officials down is tough in China. He plans to meet senior officials in the next few weeks to press his company’s case.“We have a target that puts the footprint down and scales very quickly,” he said. “What we can’t determine right now is how
fast we can get licence approval. We may get one national licence [or we] may get approved province by province.”Mr Brutto is in no hurry. UPS started a domestic service in Germany in 1976 but it was 1996 before the business reached a decent scale. “We don’t want to get ahead of demand. China is a huge opportunity and you have to look at it in generational terms,” he said."

JP Morgan Chase declined 1.4 per cent to $38.41 and Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $13.11.But AIG rose 0.4 per cent to $37.45 after the bailed-out insurer said its board would meet later in the day to discuss an exit plan for the US Treasury.Citigroup gained 1 per cent to $3.92 after the US Treasury said it plans to sell a portion of $2.2bn of its Citigroup debt securities.The S&P 500 technology index was lifted for much of the day by Hewlett-Packard raising its forecast for 2011 but it ended the day flat. Intel fell 1.4 per cent to $19.24 and Microsoft declined 0.7 per cent to $24.50.Hewlett-Packard predicting 12 to 14 per cent growth in earnings to between between $5.05 and $5.15 per share compared with the current consensus estimates of about $4.99 per share.The technology company said it was adding thousands to its salesforce and forecast a 5 per cent to 7 per cent rise in revenue.However, the company did not announce a new chief executive, which many analysts hoped it would. Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to $42.53.Standard Microsystems, which makes circuits and systems software for personal computers, consumer electronics and the industrial and car markets, reduced its forecast for the third quarter, saying that earnings will be no more than 43 cents per share. The average analyst estimate was 45 cents, but its shares rose 1.3 per cent to $22.78.The oil price rose after inventories fell last week and pushed up energy stocks by 0.7 per cent.Natural gas producer EQT Corp gained 4.6 per cent to $35.48 after it announced strong production figures from two wells in Pennsylvania. Cabot Oil and Gas added 5.1 per cent to $30.19.US-listed shares in BP rose 1.8 per cent to $40.00 after it said it had ousted Andy Inglis, the head of its exploration division, and announced plans to restructure its safety operations.The oil company’s new chief executive, Robert Dudley, is set to take over on Friday.In industrials, aircraft manufacturer Boeing rose 2.3 per cent to $65.97 after the Pentagon said the company had received a contract to build 124 Super Hornet and Growler fighter jets, valued at $5.3bn.Fedex, the delivery company often seen as a barometer for global trade, rose 2 per cent to $86.37. Fred Smith, chief executive, said he was “very bullish” on the outlook for next year, saying it was seeing a rebound in demand for express shipping and that it intends to raise ship-ping rates.In earnings news, Family Dollar Stores beat expectations as more shoppers turned to the discount chain for bargains.In its fourth quarter, earnings per share were 56 cents compared with forecasts of 51 cents.The retailer raised its expectations for its first quarter in 2011, with predicted earnings per share between 55 cents and 60 cents.Following retailers from Nordstrom to Gap, which have all recently announced share buy-backs, Family Dollar said it may repurchase up to $750m in shares. Its stock rose 1.6 per cent to $44.05.
267;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-09-27T16:40:08Z;Big Data, Big Blue and Going Green;;Forget buckets’ of data, think cloudsBig opportunities lie in big data. Storage giant EMC has teamed up with Cloudera, a specialist in database software, to create technologies to better support “big data”. Once only oil companies and retail giants could afford the technologies needed to analyse the huge and constantly growing quantities of data produced by operational systems – till receipts, image files, sensor log files and so on. But the tumbling cost of storage and the growth of cloud computing has transformed this market. Startup Cloudera is using the open source Hadoop software package to analyse very large sets of data. In similar vein, IBM last week announced it would acquire Netezza, whose data warehouse appliances reduce the cost of managing big data.Have BlackBerry, can printPrinters, printers everywhere. But with an increasingly mobile workforce, users are less likely to be tethered to a desktop PC and office printer. Hewlett-Packard has risen to this challenge with a clutch of new offerings. First off is ePrint Enterprise that lets BlackBerry owners send documents to any printer connected to the enterprise network – or selected external outlets such as a FedEx office or hotel. To ensure privacy, the document can only be printed when the user enters the correct code – sent by email – on the chosen printer. HP also announced a range of touchscreen-equipped multifunctional printer devices designed to eliminate the need for PC when performing simple tasks such as printing a boarding pass or accessing Google Docs to scan in a document that can then be printed at a later time and in a different place.Self service customer support from ‘Big Blue’If your call centre attracts more brick bats then praise, maybe its time to switch to web-based customer support. IBM’s Customer Experience Suite encourages customers to help themselves to information using blogs, chat forums, video, social networking tools and, increasingly, mobile devices. As well as improving post-sales support, the software can help clinch new sales by personalising each customer’s online experience – a more simplified site for mobile users, for example. The CES suite is aimed at large enterprises and comprises the latest versions of IBM’s WebSphere Portal and Lotus Web Content Management software.Proving green credentialsStruggling to go beyond good intentions and put some hard facts in your corporate sustainability report? Oracle has unveiled an environmental sustainability management offering for manufacturers keen to shed their smoke-stack image. The latest version of its Oracle Manufacturing Operations Center software handles sensor data and so can monitor energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions and other key performance indicators.Private clouds and mainframesMeanwhile, Oracle’s annual user conference produced the usual blitz of software announcements upgrades and “roadmaps”. More surprising was to hear the software giant announce a piece of hardware, the Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud. As its name suggests, it is Oracle’s attempt to steal the cloud computing spotlight. It comprises a mix of Oracle software and high-performance hardware and is aimed at enterprises that want to build their own “private cloud” using their own hardware. Sounds suspiciously like mainframe computer.Quick ERP?SAP is out to shake off the perception that its business software takes forever to install. It has launched a range of Rapid Deployment solutions that it claims can be deployed in as little as 12 weeks. The first ones are based on existing SAP software for managing customers, suppliers and business communications. Future offerings will be tailored to diverse industries and in areas such as analytics, manufacturing, mobility, recruiting, supply chain, sustainability and treasury.Cisco VPN app comes to iPhone/iPadBowing to market trends, Cisco has made its virtual private network software available on Apple’s App Store. The VPN software, previously aimed at laptop users, now lets iPhone and iPad users securely access their corporate network from a mobile device. If the wireless connection is lost, the software automatically switches to WiFi – or vice versa – and, in theory at least, any application that’s running should not notice the handoff.

Economists had expected new claims to remain flat after they fell to a two-month low the week before.Claims have been improving in recent weeks after hovering near the half-million mark during the summer. The less volatile four-week average of new claims is down 3,250 to 463,250.Economists argue that new claims need to fall to the low 400,000 level before the economy can sustainably add workers.The data come as the Obama administration is under political pressure to improve the labour market ahead of November’s midterm elections. Earlier this week the Federal Reserve described a soft economic recovery and indicated that it might take additional measures to stimulate the economy if growth continues to slow.Companies have been cautious about hiring as they face an uncertain economic recovery. Some analysts have argued that the US is facing a “structural” employment problem, where businesses are unable to find suitable workers because of a lack of people with appropriate skills.Last week, FedEx, the US package shipping company, said it would cut 1,700 jobs as it consolidates its struggling freight business.At the Goldman Sachs retail conference earlier this month, Bill Simon, Walmart’s chief executive, described how customers line up at its stores before midnight at the start of each month when their electronic government benefits cards are activated to shop for items such as baby formula, milk, bread and eggs.“Our sales for those first few hours on the first of the month are substantially and significantly higher,” Mr Simon said.The number of Americans continuing to claim jobless benefits declined, falling by 48,000 to 4.489m. Although that improvement is welcome, the decrease is partially attributable to idle workers seeing their benefits expire.Florida suffered the biggest rise in claims, with more job losses in construction, the services sector and manufacturing. Several states, such as California, Texas, and Nevada, had fewer claims thanks to a shorter work week.A separate report from the Conference Board showed that its leading indicators index rose by 0.3 per cent. Although that was stronger than expected, the report said it suggested little change in economic conditions during the next few months and a weak economy through 2011.Meanwhile, home resales rose by 7.6 per cent to an adjusted annual rate of 4.13m from July to August, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was better than Wall Street analysts had expected but still left sales off by nearly 20 per cent from the same month a year ago.The US housing market is showing some signs of stability after sales and prices dropped after government support was withdrawn last spring.“The housing market is trying to recover on its own power without the home buyer tax credit,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. “Despite very attractive affordability conditions, a housing market recovery will likely be slow and gradual because of lingering economic uncertainty.”Median home prices climbed by just 0.8 per cent year-on-year to $178,600 in August . Distressed sales accounted for 34 per cent of all transactions, up from 31 per cent a year ago.Regionally, home resales were strongest in the west and northeast and rose modestly in the south and midwest.Christopher Mayer, a professor of real estate economics at Columbia Business School, said that the biggest problem facing the housing market is tight credit and that stimulus measures such as the first-time homebuyer tax credit only succeeded in shifting demand rather than generating new buyers.“I think the Federal government needs to take a more active role in opening up credit,” Mr Mayer said. “We’re in a place in the economy where ordinary borrowers are having an incredibly difficult time borrowing.”

In September, the reading was minus 0.7, showing industrial activity in the region contracted.The markets were unnerved in August when the index fell to minus 7.7. Shares fell after the September release, but quickly rebounded.“I would have thought there would be a little bit more of a negative reaction … with the negative Philly Fed plus FedEx which lowered its fiscal second-quarter outlook,” said Barbara Marcin, portfolio manager at GAMCO Investors.“But there’s now a lot of negativity baked in so in a way it doesn’t surprise even if something is more negative than consensus.”In separate releases, producer prices rose slightly more than expected and the current account deficit, a measure of international trade, was slightly less than economists had forecast.Investors looking for indicators of the pace of economic growth were disappointed by FedEx earnings, even though its quarterly profit doubled because of increased demand for package delivery services.Shares in FedEx sank 3.8 per cent to $82.72 after the first-quarter profit of $1.20 per share just missed the average estimate of $1.21 per share, and the group, often seen as a bellwether for global trade, said that it would cut 1,700 jobs.It forecast a second-quarter profit below analyst projections, but raised its forecast for 2011 for the second time. Excluding the cost of merging some ground operations, full-year earnings should be between $4.80 and $5.25 per share.Both Research in Motion and Oracle rose in after hours trading after releasing their results.Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry, was in focus because the stock has suffered in the past couple of months, after countries from Abu Dhabi to India said they were considering restricting use of the handset because of security concerns. Shares were up 2.1 per cent to $46.49 during the session, and continued to rise after releasing better than expected earnings, up 5.9 per cent to $46.49.Oracle, the world’s third-largest software producer, fell 1.5 per cent to $25.36 during the trading day. But shares rose 3 per cent to $26.14 after hours after earnings beat expectations.Homebuilders fell 3.4 per cent after a report from RealtyTrac showed US home seizures hit record highs in August. Lennar Corp declined 2.8 per cent to $14.09 and DR Horton lost 3.5 per cent to $10.60.In earnings news, Pier 1, the home decor retailer, said tight inventory control had helped it report a better than expected quarterly profit. Earnings per share in the second quarter were 12 cents compared with the 11 cents forecast. Shares rose 6.5 per cent to $8.48.Companies continued to adjust their full-year forecasts.Eastman Chemical rose 3.7 per cent to $69.40 after the US plastic maker boosted its full-year forecast, saying profits should rise to about $7 a share, higher than the $6.40 previously projected.But gas pipeline operator Williams Co lowered its 2011 profit forecast to a minimum of 85 cents per share, lower than the $1.47 consensus estimate. Shares fell 3.5 per cent to $18.44.Ford climbed 4.8 per cent to $12.44 after the carmaker was upgraded by Barclays from “equal weight” to “overweight” because of cost-cutting and new
products.Fifth Third Bancorp dropped 2 per cent to $12.22 after it said it would buy National Processing, a payment services provider, for an undisclosed sum."
270;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-09-16T20:04:36Z;FedEx the bellwether;Future growth remains highly uncertain;Old wives’ tales can be useful for the grain of truth they contain. Even if most body heat doesn’t escape through the head, it still makes sense to wear a hat in the winter. Similarly, investors might expect that if the postman is frequently weighed down with packages, it would suggest the economy is stirring.Novice investors are told that FedEx is a bellwether for the economy. But the reality is that over the past 25 years the stock has shown less correlation to the output of the US and world economies than the broader S&P 500 index. Still, poorly received first-quarter results on Thursday backed up what is widely suspected: business conditions are better than they were this time last year, but future growth remains highly uncertain.FedEx did report a rapid rebound in sales, up 18 per cent on the same period last year to $9.5bn. Volume growth in its Express business, the largest and most profitable part of FedEx, was central to that strength thanks mainly to exports from Asia. The company is adding extra aircraft over the Pacific to keep up with demand. Freight shipments were up more than a quarter on last year.Yet profits double those of a year ago failed to match even loftier expectations. The domestic trucking operations continue to lose money, and will be combined with the so called less-than-truckload freight division at the start of next year. Cost savings involve the loss of 1,700 jobs.Such internal reorganisation is not the mark of a company banking on a strong domestic recovery and reflects the challenge the US faces in reducing persistent unemployment while corporate cost cuts remain the order of the day. There is more than a grain of truth in saying that cutting your way to growth is penny wise but pound-foolish.E-mailthe Lex team confidentially

272;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-09-16T17:21:23Z;FedEx delivers surge in first-quarter profits;;FedEx, the US package shipping company, warned of slowing economic growth ahead as it announced a consolidation of its struggling freight business and cut 1,700 jobs.FedEx said first-quarter profits more than doubled over the past year, but the gloomy outlook sent its shares down nearly 4 per cent to $82.81 in late trade on Thursday.“We expect a phase of somewhat slower economic growth going forward,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, told analysts on Thursday. “The recovery began a year ago and we believe slower growth is consistent with historical business cycles.”FedEx, the second-biggest package shipping company in the world by revenues, is regarded as a bellwether for the US and global economy because of the broad range of goods it transports across the world.The company said it would merge FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL at the beginning of next year. The company would shutter 100 facilities and cut 1,700 jobs in a move that will initially cost FedEx up to $200m in severance and lease termination fees.Last year FedEx cut nearly 2,000 jobs, with 900 layoffs in the freight unit. It currently employs 280,000 people.FedEx said the moves would improve its profitability in 2012 by reducing operational costs and making FedEx freight more efficient. In the first quarter, the freight division made an operating loss of $16m.Mr Smith said that combining the units would give FedEx more appropriate capacity to handle its freight volume and that it would be able to expand its equipment and facilities as volume increased.Overall, net profit at FedEx rose by 110 per cent to $380m, or $1.20 a share, up from $181m, or 58 cents, in the same period a year ago, trailing expectations of Wall Street analysts. FedEx’s revenue increased by 18 per cent to $9.46bn, helped by growing international shipping volumes.In the first quarter, exports from Asia boosted international priority package volume by 19 per cent while domestic daily package volume in the US rose by just 3 per cent.Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said international priority express shipments were helped by businesses wanting to keep inventories low, particularly in the high-tech sector. “Items are going directly from where they’re manufactured to point of consumption,” Mr Graf said. “There’s no need to have an intermediate warehouse, and there’s no need to have a backlog of things that could go obsolete on the shelves.”
273;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-09-16T14:07:12Z;Fall in US jobless claims offers hope;;New claims for jobless benefits fell to a two-month low last week, government figures showed on Thursday, offering a glimmer of hope that the US labour market could be stabilising.Separately, wholesale prices rose more than expected in August, easing fears that a slowing economic recovery could lead to deflation.Initial jobless claims fell by 3,000 to 450,000, according to the labour department. Economists were expecting an increase after another surprise drop the previous week and the less volatile four-week average of claims is down by 13,500 to 464,750.The number of Americans continuing to claim unemployment insurance also fell, declining by 84,000 to 4.485m. That fall reflects both a drop in job cuts but also idle workers seeing their benefits expire.Economists argue that jobless claims need to fall to the low-400,000 level before the US economy can add jobs in a sustainable way. Stubbornly high unemployment has been a persistent political problem for the Obama administration leading up to the November mid-term elections.Analysts at Capital Economics argue that the US may be facing a “structural” unemployment scenario, where employers are seeking workers, but are unable to find suitable ones for their job openings.“A higher structural unemployment rate means that any polices aimed at stimulating labour demand are likely to be less effective in bringing down the unemployment rate,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Policymakers may therefore need to implement supply-side measures, such as retraining workers.”The ongoing struggles of the labour market were underlined on Thursday, as FedEx, the US package shipping company, said it would cut 1,700 workers as it consolidated part of its business.Layoffs eased in states such as Florida and New York, where there were fewer job cuts in the construction and transportation sectors.Meanwhile, the producer price index increased by 0.4 per cent last month, labour department figures showed. It was the second month running that wholesale prices increased and it was led by the first rise in energy costs since March.Year on year, wholesale prices are up by 3.1 per cent.Core prices, which exclude food and energy, ticked up by a modest 0.1 per cent in August, led by increases in prices for pharmaceutical items, light motor trucks and metals.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said consistently that prices will remain “subdued” for some time. Thursday’s data support his argument that measures to stimulate the economy are unlikely to spur inflation in the near term, but that demand remains sufficient to prevent disinflation or falling prices.
274;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-08-24T23:59:25Z;FedEx sues Cuomo over fraud investigation;;FedEx on Monday sued Andrew Cuomo, arguing that the New York attorney-general had overreached his authority by attempting to investigate and possibly prosecute the company for serious civil fraud.The US logistics group urged the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to block Mr Cuomo’s investigation on the grounds that the constitution and several statutes reserve such areas for federal authorities.In the past, FedEx has been the subject of numerous investigations by various state officials but largely in regard to its labour practices rather than other areas of its business.According to the suit, Mr Cuomo wrote to FedEx on June 8 demanding the company turn over documents relating to its agreements with insurance companies and complaints by customers about the way it handled certain items.The attorney-general was particularly interested in the lawsuits or claims relating to valuable items such as antiques, glassware, jewelry, precious metals and musical instruments more than 20 years old.The demands suggested Mr Cuomo planned to investigate “serious and substantial civil allegations of fraud” on the basis that the company’s policies on declared value and limitations of liability “are somehow fraudulent or illegal,” FedEx said.FedEx responded that it had “not engaged [in] any fraudulent or illegal acts,” adding that “regardless, a determination of whether FedEx’s rates, routes, prices and/or services are legal …lies wholly beyond the reach or jurisdiction of the state attorney-general.”According to FedEx, federal laws prevent states from regulating “prices, routes and services” because of the danger of “overlapping and or inconsistent regulation of air carriers by the federal government and each of the fifty states.”In addition to demanding that the court prohibit Mr Cuomo’s investigation, FedEx asked for the attorney-general to pay its costs and “any other relief deemed necessary, proper or equitable.”Mr Cuomo’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the suit late on Tuesday evening. FedEx has until the end of August to respond to the subpoena from Mr Cuomo’s office.
275;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-08-03T13:23:04Z;Deutsche Post sees sharp rise in freight volumes;;Deutsche Post DHL capitalised on a recovering global economy in recent months, announcing second-quarter profits that were double those of last year and raising its estimate for its underlying full-year earnings.The German mail and logistics company followed rivals such as UPS in showing it was reaping the benefits of an upswing in world trade. As an important piece of the global supply chain, companies such as DHL, United Parcel Service and FedEx are considered barometers of global economic performance. UPS and FedEx raised earnings guidance last month.Deutsche Post said it now expected underlying earnings to be between €1.9bn and €2.1bn, having previously given a range of €1.6bn to €1.9bn. Frank Appel, chief executive, said: “We benefited significantly from the recovery of the world economy in the second quarter.” A moderate recovery in global transport volumes was expected over 2010 as a whole, Deutsche Post added.Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax rose from €109m ($144.2m) last year to €253m, including €250m of expenses, mainly related to the sale of DHL’s Express business in France. Quarterly net income – affected by a €145m swing in the market value of options related to the group’s plan to sell its remaining stake in Deutsche Postbank – rose from €66m to €81m.Revenues rose more than 15 per cent to €12.8bn compared with the second quarter of 2009.Mr Appel said the group, which employs 500,000 people, was benefiting from an efficiency drive and the extensive efforts to reshape its businesses over the past two years, which have included the costly closure of its lossmaking US express business.Deutsche Post’s revenue growth came from its DHL businesses – which also include freight, forwarding and supply chain services – and was in contrast to the flat sales in its domestic mail business.However, underlying earnings rose 42 per cent to €243m in the mail business, with Deutsche Post earning more from parcel deliveries.For the first time this year the DHL businesses are expected to contribute more to the group’s earnings than the mail business, which the group is also trying to invigorate with new services such as electronic letters.Axel Funhoff, analyst at ING, said the quarterly earnings were “substantially above expectations with respect to most line items”.Deutsche Post shares rose €14.08 in early afternoon trading in Frankfurt, a gain of 4.3 per cent.
276;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-08-01T19:14:56Z;Supply chain woes threaten global recovery;;Large industrial companies around the world are defying fears of a “double-dip” recession, reporting signs of increasing strength in demand and striking a cautiously optimistic note about the growth of the global economy.Many industrial groups reported better-than-expected profits for the second quarter and raised their full-year growth forecasts. However, big manufacturers could be held back by their inability to secure vital components from supply chains weakened by the downturn and unable to increase production fast enough to meet demand.Caterpillar, FedEx and Honeywell in the US, Honda and Hitachi in Japan, and Siemens in Europe all raised their outlooks last week, while results from companies such as Boeing, Nissan, BASF and VW exceeded analysts’ consensus forecasts.Yet some suppliers to large industrial multinationals that cut costs sharply in the early part of the downturn are finding it hard to increase production capacity rapidly, while many report that financing remains expensive and difficult to access. Manufacturing supply chains in the US and Europe are showing signs of straining to cope with demand.“The problems that suppliers are facing in this upturn are noticeably bigger than in the comparable stages of the recoveries we saw after previous recessions,” said Daniel Corsten, a supply-chain expert at IE business school in Madrid.Some 51 per cent of big US manufacturers said they experienced “significant supply chain disruptions” in the second quarter, while 42 per cent of small and medium-sized suppliers said they had received queries or work from larger companies in need of urgent assistance because of supply chain problems, according to a survey by MFG.com, an online marketplace for manufacturers.Caterpillar, the US-based maker of earth-moving equipment, said last week that many of its most popular products were not being made as quickly as it would like because suppliers had not increased production fast enough. Boeing, the US maker of aircraft, suggested it could struggle to meet demand for commercial aircraft over the next decade because its suppliers might not be able to raise their output accordingly.Supply chain difficulties appear to be particularly affecting electronic components such as semiconductors. Audi and Porsche, the German carmakers, were forced to slow production in some plants last month because their supplier of car radios, Harman Becker, was short of microchips.“Anybody in the electronic supply chain has seen the tightness around certain components,” said Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, last week. Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said “around $50m of revenue maybe got hung up at the end of the quarter in the supply chain”.In response, some companies are building up buffer stocks of components to make sure they have them on hand.Additional reporting by Daniel Schäfer in Frankfurt, Jeremy Lemer in New York, Peter Marsh in London and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
277;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx raises earnings outlook;;FedEx became the latest big US company to raise its full-year earnings guidance on Monday, adding to evidence that the country’s industry is steering its way through an uneven global recovery.In spite of fears of a double-dip recession, concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and slowing industrial production in Asia, several big companies have reported second-quarter earnings that were better than expected. Of 176 S&P 500 companies reporting this quarter, 125 beat Wall Street estimates, 18 missed expectations and 33 were within 2 per cent of forecasts.A handful of industrial companies such as Caterpillar and Eaton Corp have upgraded their outlook for the full year.General Electric partially restored its dividend last week after slashing it in 2009. Analysts said the moves indicated that US corporations were picking their way through the difficult environment, tapping growth in regions and markets that were recovering and benefiting from tight cost controls elsewhere.“Anything touching automotives, trucks, construction equipment and semiconductors has just been white hot,” said Nigel Coe, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, though defence and commercial construction markets had been slower to recover.He noted that in the industrial arena companies had raised revenue forecasts by 4 per cent for the second half of the year and increased the midpoint of profit estimates. “That suggests that the worst-case scenarios are now off the table,” he said.FedEx expects volumes at its International Priority unit – which handles express deliveries – to grow more than 20 per cent this quarter, helping it achieve full-year earnings per share of $4.60-$5.20, up from previous guidance of $4.40-$5.00 per share. FedEx shares were up 5.6 per cent at the close of trading.“Our revenue and earnings growth are exceeding original expectations, primarily due to better-than-anticipated growth in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground volumes,” said Alan Graf Jr, chief financial officer.In June, Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, dismissed what he called “an undue sense of pessimism”.FedEx’s forecast is based on stable oil prices and a “moderate recovery in the global economy”.
278;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-07-26T22:30:40Z;US data provide distraction from stress tests;;Encouraging news on the US housing and earnings fronts provided an upbeat focus for markets on Monday as the results of “stress tests” on European banks, released at the end of last week, offered only limited inspiration.New US home sales jumped 23.6 per cent last month – the biggest increase since May 1980 – although analysts noted the annual rate of sales, at 330,000, was still the second-lowest on record.Furthermore, the rise in June, while substantial, only partially reversed a 36.7 per cent plunge in May.“Sales are low as we are in the middle of the demand fallout following the expiry of the homebuyer tax credit,” said Teunis Brosens, economist at ING. “We expect sales to remain muted throughout the summer months despite good affordability and record low mortgage rates.”Meanwhile, a bright earnings outlook from FedEx, the package delivery group, underlined the strength of the quarterly US earnings season, which has so far seen about 80 per cent of companies beating earnings per share estimates.“While the number of companies that have beaten revenue estimates is smaller – closer to 70 per cent – we are hard pressed to believe this has been anything but a pretty good earnings season thus far,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“Such performance is crucial in light of poor investor sentiment data – sentiment which continues to hang over the market like a plague. In meetings with clients, we are struck by the preoccupation with and negativity related to the debt, deficit and overall spending plans of the current administration. Very few investors we meet with are able to move past these issues.”The FedEx results and home sales figures were greeted with relief by US equities investors, and in New York the S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent to a five-week high – with banks mostly moving ahead – while most Asian markets also gained ground. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.8 per cent and Shanghai advanced for a sixth successive session.The broad view among analysts was that while the results of Europe’s stress tests had reduced some uncertainties surrounding the banking sector, plenty of questions remained unanswered.“The market seems to be shrugging its collective shoulders in a cynical ‘we didn’t think we’d really learn anything anyway’ sort of way,” said Sacha Tihanyi at Scotia Capital.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, said that while the results had offered a first step towards improved transparency, they were not enough to bring about a large improvement in confidence in the European banking system.“It will require more homework by market participants and policymakers to achieve a full normalisation of the financial system,” he said.“The results confirm our view that the bulk of the eurozone banking system is sound, but there are serious questions on whether the tests can be considered sufficiently stringent and informative.”The euro found itself reined in by lingering doubts over the tests. The single currency inched higher against the dollar but was unable to retest last week’s 2½-month high above $1.30.There was more of a sense of relief over the stress tests in Europe’s government bond markets. The German two-year Schatz yield jumped 10bp to 0.83 per cent, and the 10-year Bund yield rose 5bp to 2.76 per cent as the lack of nasty shocks from the tests cut short haven flows.Furthermore, the spread of Spanish 10-year yields over their German counterparts narrowed 17bp to 148bp, the lowest since late May, while the equivalent Irish spread tightened 12bp to 265bp.In the US, the unexpected jump in home sales helped push the yield on the 10-year Treasury back above 3 per cent for the first time since mid-July.In commodities, gold lost some of its safety appeal, slipping to $1,181 a troy ounce from $1,196. US crude oil ended the day unchanged, while copper rose to a 10-week high.
279;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-07-26T22:20:00Z;Wall Street rally continues as all sectors post gains;;US stocks were lifted on Monday by better housing data than expected and a forecast earnings rise by FedEx, the delivery company seen as a barometer for global trade.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent at 1,115.00, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 per cent to close at 10,525.43 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher to close at 2,296.43.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, continuing Friday’s rally.Data for June showed the number of new homes bought were up 24 per cent on May to an annualised figure of 330,000. Analysts had forecast a total of 320,000 units. Home sales had been falling since a tax credit expired this year.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 3.7 per cent, with DR Horton up 3 per cent to $11.17, PulteGroup higher by 4.7 per cent to $9.07 and Lennar rising 3.3 per cent to $15.42.AIG, the bailed-out insurer which has units that initiate, insure and invest in home loans, advanced 6.9 per cent to $39.30.FedEx boosted investor confidence by raising its profit forecast. It pushed up its earnings per share guidance for this quarter to a range of $1.05–$1.25 from $0.85–$1.05. The news came after UPS reported better second-quarter earnings than expected last week. FedEx shares rose 5.6 per cent to $83.39.Ralph Fogel, investment strategist at Fogel Neale Partners, said “It’s interesting to note that with recent moves in the market, both up and down, it is transportation that has led the move.”US-listed shares in BP rose 4.9 per cent to $38.65 after it was reported that the oil company was set to announce the departure of Tony Hayward, chief executive, in the next 24 hours. American Bob Dudley was touted as Mr Hayward’s successor.Shares in Anadarko Petroleum, which owns 25 per cent of the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, rose 3.6 per cent to $50.53.Genzyme biotech company rose 7.7 per cent to $67.38 in early trading following reports that Sanofi-Aventis was more likely to buy the company than GlaxoSmithKline. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis rose 1.6 per cent to $29.82 and GlaxoSmithKline’s US-listed shares lost 0.7 per cent to $36.74. The S&P 500 healthcare index was up 1.4 per cent.On Friday, speculation that French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis might have approached Genzyme about a possible merger boosted its share price by 15.4 per cent.Biogen Idec, the biotech group, advanced on speculation that it was a potential takeover target, rising 8.3 per cent to $57.89.Shares in oil and gas producer Delta Petroleum surged 9.3 per cent to 87 cents after the company agreed to sell several non-core assets to Wapiti Oil & Gas for $130m.Other deals included Core-Mark Holding, a distributor of packaged goods to convenience stores, which was up 5.6 per cent after it agreed to buy Finkle Distributors for about $43m.After the bumper earnings releases of last week, there was a pause in the earnings season on Monday with fewer companies releasing before the bell.Among those that did, FMC Technologies, the provider of technology for oil and gasfields, reported earnings of 78 cents, above forecasts of 71 cents. But the company’s revenue was worse than expected and it did not raise guidance for the full year in spite of a strong order book. Shares were up 2.3 per cent to $61.77.Lorillard cigarette manufacturer also rose after delivering better earnings than expected. Shares were up 1.3 per cent to $77.25 after the owner of the Newport menthol cigarette brand said net income was $263m, or $1.73 a share, for the second quarter, compared with analysts’ predictions of $1.61 a share.Both Office Depot and telecoms company Sprint Nextel rose ahead of results they are due to report this week. Office Depot, which reports today, was up 7.7 per cent to $4.73 and Sprint Nextel, which reports tomorrow, rose 7.7 per cent to $5.05.Onyx Pharmaceuticals put on 21.2 per cent to $26.04 after it reported positive results from a study testing its experimental drug carfilzomib.
280;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-07-14T18:39:10Z;Wildlife charity to benefit from well capture;;"An unexpected bonanza is in store for the conservation charity that will receive the revenue from the oil being siphoned from BP’s leaking well.The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation can expect to collect at least $40m from the nearly 550,000 barrels of oil captured from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill so far, if oil prices hold steady at about $75 a barrel. There could be a similar amount to come
if a further 500,000 barrels are captured, which could be possible depending on whether the relief well operation is successful, experts say. BP’s efforts to put a cap on the well were delayed on Wednesday when the US government asked for further analysis of the procedures the company intended to use.Last year, the NFWF received $37.4m in federal funds. It was able to match this with donations, loans and other forms of leverage from businesses and other organisations, resulting in 508 separate grants for conservation projects worth more than $110m.Matching BP’s funds could be more difficult, but the influx of money could still be overwhelming to the charity.Experts from other environmental charities said it could be difficult to set up the infrastructure necessary to disburse the funds quickly to the areas where money is needed. However, some of the environmental groups already at work in the area are likely to be recipients of some of the grants from the fund, which may make it easier. “Lots of people have already been working in the area since the spill so we have boots on the ground,” said one charity worker.The NFWF, founded by the US Congress in 1984, works to preserve and restore the native wildlife species and habitats of the US. The money that comes to the charity from BP – the net revenues from selling the captured oil – will be directed towards projects to rescue the wildlife and habitats of the gulf coast states that have been affected.“We will invest in projects that will have the greatest benefit to the species most at risk from the oil,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director of the NFWF. “We are working very closely with US Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal and state agencies, and myriad conservation organisations to identify the immediate wildlife needs throughout the gulf.”Past corporate donors to the charity, chaired by Mark Rockefeller, have included many big names from the oil industry: BP, as well as rival oil companies Shell, ConocoPhilips, Chevron and ExxonMobil. Donors from outside the oil industry have included FedEx, Altria, Syngenta and PacifiCorp. The organisation works with a variety of federal agencies, including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. BP provided $5m to the charity immediately on announcing its choice, so projects could get moving before the oil had been sold.Tony Hayward, BP chief executive, said the charity was “a strong and responsible steward” for the money."

Building permits also missed expectations.US producer prices fell by 0.3 per cent last month, less than the 0.5 per cent decline analysts had expected on average.“The net read on the economy from this morning’s numbers is that fiscal and monetary policy has had a positive effect on growth but that the benefits are beginning to fade,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho

A jump in demand in Asia helped increase FedEx’s express business revenues by 23 per cent to $5.9bn, with FedEx adding an extra daily transpacific flight in April.The company reported earnings of $1.33 per share for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $2.82 per share in 2009, although that year’s figures were affected by significant one-off charges. Revenues jumped 20 per cent on 2009 to $9.43bn and the company recorded an operating margin of 7.4 per cent.FedEx made full-year net profits of $1.2bn, compared with profits of $98m in 2009 on revenues that slipped 2 per cent to $34.7bn. Full-year earnings per share were $3.76, up from $0.31 per share a year ago.FedEx shares fell 3.6 per cent to $80.01 in trading, in part because the company said higher pension, healthcare, labour and aircraft maintenance costs would hit 2011 earnings.The company expects 2011 earnings to be between $4.40 and $5.00 per share against analysts’ expectations of $5.08.
283;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-06-03T20:32:04Z;Wall St rally wanes after tepid retail sales;;"US stocks continued the previous day’s rally on Thursday, helped by some positive macroeconomic news, but lacklustre retail sales figures weighed on sentiment.Initial jobless claims were 453,000 last week, compared with the 455,000 consensus estimate, boosting hopes that Friday’s much-awaited non-farm payrolls would at least match expectations.However, ADP private sector payrolls increased by 55,000 last month, less than the 60,000 expected.The rally has been boosted by the recent entry of bargain-hunters into the market, said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. “Never failing to look a gift horse in the mouth, however, we are quick to acknowledge that structural problems in the economic, political and ecosystems abound and remain threatening overhangs to the longevity of any near-term rally,” he added.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,102.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 10,255.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,303.03.The retail sales results were mixed with discounters broadly faring best, even if they fell below some analyst expectations.TJX Companies, owner of the TJ Maxx discount retail chain, added 0.4 per cent to $46.30 as it posted a better-than-expected increase in same-store sales last month and said it saw demand pick up substantially in the second half of the month as the weather turned warmer.Family Dollar Stores lost 3.6 per cent to $38.66 as the discount retailer gave a third-quarter profit outlook that missed analysts’ consensus estimates.BJ’s Wholesale Club, a warehouse discounter, fell 2.6 per cent to $38.76 in spite of an increase in same-store sales that topped analysts’ average expectations for a 6.6 per cent
gain.Costco Wholesale, BJ’s main rival, declined 1.7 per cent to $57.93 after the company reported sales data for May that missed average analyst estimates.Sales in stores open at least a year rose 9 per cent compared with expectations of 9.7 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch, an upmarket teen fashion retailer, advanced 6.6 per cent to $37.58 after its May sales beat analyst estimates.It also said its average unit retail price declined by 6 per cent last month compared with a drop of 10 per cent last quarter.Rival Aeropostale gained 5.7 per cent to $30.01 as its sales last month topped expectations.Limited Brands, a clothing retail chain, gained 1.2 per cent to $26.26 as it said same-store sales had risen 5 per cent in May, easily beating the 2.1 per cent gain analysts had forecast. The company said it expected June same-store sales to be flat or slightly higher, in the low single-digits.Department store chains Macy’s and Saks reported better-than-expected same-store May sales. Their shares were up 0.4 per cent to $22.49 and 0.7 per cent to $9.14, respectively.However, rivals Nordstrom and JC Penney missed average expectations, sending their shares down 4.3 per cent to $38.52 and 0.3 per cent to $27.07, respectively.JPMorgan pulled back 1.1 per cent to $39.10 as its securities arm was fined £33.3m ($48.7m) by the UK’s Financial Services Authority for failing to protect billions of dollars of client money by not segregating it into separate accounts.Had the bank run into financial difficulties, its clients would have been at risk of losing their money. It is the largest penalty ever levied by the regulator.Shares in Joy Global, a maker of mining equipment, rallied 2.6 per cent to $53.81 after the company raised its full-year profit outlook and reported better-than-expected second-quarter results.Dynamex, a provider of same-day delivery services in the US and Canada, retreated 10.7 per cent to $14.35 after it lowered its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year to as low as $1.05 per share. The average analyst estimate is for $1.21 per share.However, FedEx and UPS, its main rivals, were up 0.8 per cent to $83.98 and 0.7 per cent to $63.01, respectively. AutoNation climbed 4.1 per cent to $21.32. The largest US new car dealer said revenues rose 22 per cent last month."
284;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-05-12T23:02:12Z;Air tax angst mars business delight;;Outcry over airline policy marred what was otherwise a warm welcome from business for the coalition deal between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, particularly its emphasis on accelerated reduction in the fiscal deficit.The coalition’s aircraft tax plans provoked protests in the aviation industry, while business groups criticised a ban on new runways at the country’s three biggest airports: Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.Virgin Atlantic branded the tax “unworkable” while British Airways said there was no guarantee it would be used to benefit the environment. FlyBe, one of the largest regional carriers, branded it “illogical” and unfair.Business jet and air freight operators were critical of the government’s adoption of the Lib Dems’ pre-election pledge to replace air passenger duty with a “per-plane duty”, which the party said would ensure “pollution is properly taxed”. Aircraft flown by these groups do not pay the existing air passenger duty.“It’s colossal from our perspective,” said Anne de Courcy, secretary-general of the Association of International Courier and Express Services, which represents air freight operators in the UK such as Fedex and DHL.Business jet operators warned that the move could have a heavy impact on UK corporate work. “It’s always tempting to see this kind of aviation as toys for the rich,” said Guy Lachlan, chief executive of the British Business and General Aviation Association. “But in fact it’s an enabler for business, and if those enablers fly somewhere else the business migrates as well.”However, low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, which have modern, fuel-efficient aircraft that they aim to keep full at all times, welcomed the move. Abta, the travel trade association, also backed the shift.Some tax experts predicted that the change might not have as big an impact on passenger airlines as feared but said there were questions about whether other Lib Dem election promises would also be implemented, such as a tax on short domestic flights where a land-based alternative taking less than six hours was readily available.“If this measure is introduced, that would be bad news for airlines that run domestic flights, albeit potentially good news for the railways and bus companies,” said Neil Warriner, partner and head of indirect taxes at Herbert Smith, a law firm.Jim French, chief executive of FlyBe, said the new tax “will particularly hurt the regions, where aviation is already playing a vital role in dragging the UK out of recession. On paper, a per plane tax is more equitable but seems to be being used as a smokescreen for a further tax grab which is very disappointing given the political optimism on display by the new government”.London First, representing big business in the capital, said the government must come up with a “plan B” if it were ruling out expansion of London’s three airports and insisted that high-speed rail was no substitute for international air links.Paul Kehoe, chief executive of Birmingham airport, said scrapping proposals for Heathrow’s third runway “will mean a more equitable solution for the country as a whole, and more jobs and prosperity in the regions”.Overall, business response to the Con-Lib agreement was positive. “We welcome the emphasis on accelerated deficit reduction and also the idea that the emphasis should be on reduced spending rather than increased taxes,” said Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI employers’ group.UK bond markets strengthened, although sterling fell against the dollar as worries about growth in the quarterly inflation report undermined the currency.Business fears on nuclear power plans were partly assuaged, in spite of a clause allowing Lib Dem MPs to abstain on plans for new stations. Business leaders calculated that the plans would be backed by Labour.Miles Templeman, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said the commitment on deficit reduction was “just what the economy needs”, but insisted this should mean the four-to-one ratio of cuts to tax rises proposed in the Tory manifesto.The British Chambers of Commerce said Vince Cable, the business secretary, “understands business and is popular with many small and medium-sized companies”, but warned that he must ensure reforms of the banking system “do not lead to an upheaval for businesses”.Additional reporting: Ed Crooks and David Oakley
285;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-05-11T10:11:22Z;Deutsche Post takes advantage of recovery;;Deutsche Post DHL took advantage of the recovering global economy and achieved better-than-expected profits in the first quarter while confirming that earnings for the rest of the year would also be at the top end of previous forecasts.The figures from the world’s biggest logistics company follow good quarterly results from US rivals such as FedEx and UPS. Logistics and freight companies are a bellwether of world trade and the underlying economy.Shares in the Bonn-based company, which also provides the postal service in Germany, bucked a faltering market and rose in morning trading in Frankfurt, as Deutsche Post showed signs of recovering after a costly restructuring, including a withdrawal from DHL’s attempt to compete with UPS and FedEx in the US express delivery business. The express business earned €110m compared with a quarterly loss of €392m year ago.The group said it was on course for earnings from its DHL businesses, including freight forwarding, to more or less equal those from its historically more important mail business for the first time.“In the future, our goal is to achieve a stable result in the mail division and for DHL to become the driving force of growth in consolidated net profit,” said Larry Rosen, chief financial officer.Continued recovery in global transport volumes in 2010 should push underlying earnings before interest and tax to about €1.9bn – the upper end of a range previously indicated.Deutsche Post acknowledged that the estimate might still seem cautious, given that projecting quarterly earnings over the year would produce ebit of more than €2bn. Mr Rosen said: “It is much too early to judge how strong and, above all, how stable the economic recovery will actually be this year.”Sales in the first quarter rose 4.4 per cent to €12bn, compared with a year ago, while underlying earnings before interest and tax rose 81 per cent to €566m. Net income and earnings per share increased 85 per cent.A partial end to an exemption from value added tax in Germany would cost an annual sum in the “low triple-digit millions”, Mr Rosen said, with Deutsche Post deciding not to pass on the full costs in order to retain volumes.Deutsche Post said disruption caused by last month’s volcanic eruption in Iceland had only a “negligible” financial impact in spite of the closure of much of Europe’s airspace for several days. The company rerouted flights and used extra trucks to shift freight from its main air hub at Leipzig.Shares rose 2 per cent in Frankfurt to €12.17.

Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81. For much of the session they bounced around the $5 mark – an important level for the stock because some investment funds are prohibited by their own charters from investing in sub-$5 stocks.Las Vegas Strip casino owner MGM Mirage dipped 5.5 per cent to $14.57 after posting a preliminary first-quarter loss of 22 cents a share and revenues of $1.46bn. Consensus expectations were for a loss of
21 cents a share.However, it was not clear whether the preliminary results and the estimates were comparable. Full results would be announced in the first week of May, MGM Mirage said.The company also said it would issue $750m in convertible debt.Rival Las Vegas Sands, a US casino operator that is focusing on expansion in Singapore and Macao, lost 1.2 per cent to $23.72.Mariner Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, jumped 42 per cent to $25.68 on news it is to be acquired by Apache Corp, the second-largest independent US oil producer by market capitalisation, for $2.7bn in cash and stock.Apache Corp was 1.3 per cent lower at $106.67.PPG Industries, a leading paint maker, rose 0.3 per cent to $69.73 after the company reported strongly better-than-expected quarterly results.Excluding non-recurring items, the earnings were 70 cents per share, compared with consensus expectations of 63 cents per share. Revenue increased 12.3 per cent.Google, the online search engine company, added 1.1 per cent to $595.30 ahead of its first-quarter earnings report to be released after the session’s close.Oklahoma-based oil and gas driller Helmerich & Payne rose 2 per cent to $40.74 on unconfirmed market speculation that Statoil, a Norwegian energy group, was planning to buy it for about $5.6bn.American Superconductor, a maker of electrical systems for wind farms and turbines, was up 9.7 per cent to $31.89 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank. The broker cited expected growth in demand from China this year.Dallas-based cement producer Texas Industries lost 4.4 per cent to $36.76

287;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-04-09T05:35:38Z;TNT plans to spin off its mail business;;TNT, the Dutch mail and express delivery company, on Thursday unveiled plans to spin-off its mail operations in preparation for a possible partnership with a rival or a listing of the business.The group has been under pressure since late last year from two activist shareholders who believe splitting the mail business from the express division would create value.The company said in December it was abandoning its strategy of trying to become the leading European mail company because liberalisation of European postal markets had not delivered enough benefits.TNT then signalled that the Dutch mail business might “over time” participate in Europe-wide consolidation.Peter Bakker, chief executive, on Thursday said the spin-off could be completed this year but he would not say how long the company would take to make a definite decision on the fate of the business. Talks on partnerships with rival postal companies had yet to start, he said.“Can we, through partnerships, strengthen the position of mail? Can we make it part of European mail consolidation? Are there other incumbents who, like us, have an interest in joining forces? Or, alternatively, should we consider a separate listing for the mail business?” Mr Bakker said, describing the questions facing TNT.He conceded the spin-off could fuel speculation of an approach for the express division by larger rivals such as US groups UPS and FedEx. In the past both have signalled interest but were reluctant to take on the mail division.While Mr Bakker had previously argued a break-up would be disruptive, he has faced renewed questions about the company’s structure since Jana Partners, an activist investor, and Alberta Investment Management built a 5 per cent stake in TNT last year.On Thursday he said an outright sale of the mail business, valued at about €3bn ($4bn) by analysts, was “not the most likely scenario” but also said “nothing is totally off the table”.The group has shifted its growth ambitions to the express delivery division, which is focusing more on deliveries guaranteed on a given day rather than by a certain hour and is growing in China and other emerging markets. The mail division, by contrast, is facing 7-9 per cent annual volume declines in the Netherlands.
288;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-04-08T12:46:48Z;TNT;Considering a listing of the domestic mail division is the right step;"The usual debate is under way over whether the activist shareholders camped on its lawn pushed TNT of the Netherlands into a strategy shift or – as Europe’s second-largest mail and delivery company naturally claims – it was already moving in that direction. Either way, considering a partial listing or initial public offering of the sluggish domestic mail division, as well as looking for partnerships, is the right step.TNT’s two halves are diverging fast. Its express delivery service, with a fifth of the European Union market and mushrooming emerging markets presence, is high-growth – but investment-hungry. But e-mail’s rise condemns the Dutch snail mail business, like peers everywhere, to live with constant volume declines. Hopes of revitalising it by taking advantage of coming European postal liberalisation have been undermined by long delays in the legislation and political obstacles even in markets already opened to competition.So instead, putting hopes in the consolidation of European mail operators or attracting outside investors is smarter. After all, the mail business generates lots of cash – potentially attractive to income investors. Any gain from the mail arm could be ploughed into developing the express arm. Alternatively, the express business becomes much more attractive to, say, FedEx or UPS of the US; both are thought to have looked at it but been deterred by the snail-mail burden.Do not expect an express delivery. TNT must consult with its union – though March’s new labour agreement may have eased the path. It needs a government ruling on the return it can make on delivering its obligation to provide a universal mail service across the Netherlands, which could be delayed by forthcoming elections. But at only 12.5 times forecast 2011 earnings, TNT lags far behind FedEx or UPS’s 18 times; management has taken an important first step towards closing the gap.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyTNT, the Dutch mail and express delivery company, said on Thursday it would spin off its mail operations in preparation for a possible partnership or listing of the business.The group has been under pressure from several shareholders who believe splitting the mail business from the express division would create value.The company said in December it was abandoning a previous strategy of trying to become the leading European mail company, largely due to a flawed European liberalisation of postal markets, and signalled that the Dutch mail business might ”over time” participate in European-wide consolidation.Thursday’s announcement of a legal and financial carve-out of the entire mail business is a marked acceleration of those plans and sent shares in the company up almost 6 per cent to a 19-month high."

290;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-03-28T23:27:56Z;Publishers see iPad as path to sales increase;;When Time magazine goes to press this Wednesday night, there will be more than the usual sense of expectation among its editors. The issue will be one of the few iPad applications available to early buyers of Apple’s tablet.The edition has taken far longer than the usual week’s work. “We called it Project Noah,” says Josh Quittner, editor-at-large. “We had 40 days and 40 nights to do it. Our tech guys worked miracles.”Biblical references have been rife as media executives await the Easter Saturday launch of a device dubbed “the Jesus tablet” by the New York Times. But it may take months to know whether the iPad offers publishers a path to financial salvation.Apple has allowed only a few publishers – including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal – to work with the device and there will be just a handful of dedicated media applications for the device at its US launch this weekend.The early apps display a wide variety of business models, suggesting that there is little consensus among publishers about how to exploit a category of mobile devices they hope will help change the economics of content.Time will offer its US print issue, with additional photos, videos, international content and updates from Time.com, for the same as its news-stand price. Hearst’s Esquire title should go on sale for a similar $2.99 on the iPad, but this is $2 below the cover price.The Journal will charge $17.99 a month for its iPad application, compared with its $1.99-a-week introductory offer for print subscribers. The Financial Times app, planned for release in Europe and the US in late April, will be a free download, but will have the same subscription requirements as FT.com, one of the few websites to charge for news.The FT iPad app will be sponsored at launch by Hublot, the watchmaker, subsidising a two-month free access period, highlighting interest in Apple’s device from advertisers, a constituency as critical as readers to media owners.Time has signed up six advertisers including Fidelity and Unilever, each paying about $200,000 to appear in its first eight iPad editions. The Journal app will launch with six advertisers paying about $400,000 each for four months.“We think we’ve got pretty good value,” says Steve Pacheco, managing director of advertising at FedEx, whose ads will appear on the Journal, Thomson Reuters and Newsweek apps.FedEx hopes to align its brand with the buzz around Apple, he says. “If it’s done to half the degree Apple typically does its products to, there’s going to be a lot of energy, natural awareness and built-in curiosity.”FedEx will be the exclusive advertiser until July on the Thomson Reuters News Pro app, which promises more multimedia features and better data manipulation.The app is free, but Alisa Bowen, head of consumer publishing for Thomson Reuters, says the company plans “additional high-value content sites consumers can choose to upgrade to”.The financial information group has seen its iPhone app downloaded 850,000 times, but Ms Bowen says it hopes the larger iPad will replace the laptop for senior executives.In spite of the hype, some publishers still have reservations about everything from how much data Apple will share to the iPad’s incompatibility with Adobe’s widespread Flash software.Michael Gutkowski, president of Hearst’s LMK division, which sells apps aggregating updates about interests from Barbie dolls to baseball teams, said it had done little work so far on an iPad launch.“Apple is an amazing organisation. That said, it’ll be interesting to see how well they’re able to expand the market beyond the core of Apple lovers,” he added.

Core inflation increased by 0.1 per cent, in line with expectations.Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics, said: “It is becoming clear that there is next to no inflationary pressure in the US economy. In fact, the disinflationary pressure of the recession is only just starting to be felt. Deflation may yet re-emerge as the Fed’s main policy concern.”At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,165.83, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,779.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent at 2,391.28.The Vix index, a measure of expected equity market volatility, fell to 16.55, its lowest level since May 2008.Nike rallied 5.3 per cent to $74.66 after the sportswear company reported strong third-quarter earnings that beat average analyst estimates.

294;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-03-18T12:33:18Z;FedEx profits surge in third quarter;;FedEx, the US package giant, said on Thursday that its third-quarter profits surged as a “modest” economic recovery fuelled shipment growth.Net income at FedEx jumped 146 per cent to $239m, or 76 cents a share, from $97m, or 31 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. The results beat expectations of Wall Street analysts, but the company’s shares fell 3.23 per cent to $86.90 in pre-market trading.“Outstanding execution of our business strategy and an improving global economy drove solid financial performance in the third quarter,” said Frederick Smith, FedEx chief executive in a statement.Revenues also picked up, rising 7 per cent to $8.7bn. That was driven by the strength of the international express and ground divisions. Blunting gains, however, was weakness in FedEx’s freight unit, the higher costs of fuel and reinstated benefits programmes.The Memphis-based company said it expected to see stronger revenues and earnings in the fourth quarter as demand continued to grow. FedEx upgraded its earnings outlook for 2010, offering a slightly higher range of $3.60 to $3.80 a share than it had previously projected.FedEx is among the most closely watched companies because it is seen as a bellwether for the overall US economy.In spite of Mr Smith’s optimism over the economy, he warned last week that the recovery could falter because businesses remained reluctant to invest in equipment and technology.FedEx said on Thursday it was raising its capital spending forecast for the year to $2.9bn from $2.6bn, citing investments in Boeing 777 aircraft.
295;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-03-15T02:08:33Z;Smith & Nephew’s growing pains;;The skills required in running a parcel delivery force would not, at first glance, appear to be those required at a FTSE 100 company that makes artificial hips and knees.But those are the skills being called on by David Illingworth, chief executive of Smith & Nephew, as he looks to the expertise of Federal Express, the logistics group, to drive the next stage of earnings growth at the orthopaedics group.Mr Illingworth has hired a former FedEx executive to streamline the group’s operations in the coming years and reduce its inventory overhead.It is part of a strategy to continue the momentum achieved in improving margins under the company’s three-year earnings improvement programme, which started in 2007 and expires at the end of this year.The programme is on course to deliver three percentage points of margin improvement in the period to 24.5 per cent by the end of 2010.“We’re trying to kill the idea of it ending, because really there is no finish line here,” Mr Illingworth says.“The bottom line is that there is more scope for improvement in this business, and all things being equal, I believe we will be able to expand the margin further.”As part of this quest to improve margin, FedEx knowledge will be used to make the group’s processes more efficient.When Smith & Nephew sells an artificial hip or knee to a surgeon, it provides a suite of ancillary instruments as well as joints of different sizes in case the original choice does not fit as well as first believed.Providing up to five sizes of hip as well as all the tools to go with it bloats working capital, which could be trimmed by a number of measures, including inventory reduction and better assessment of patients’ physiology before surgery.While a hip replacement alone may cost $10,000, there could easily be $250,000 of additional hips and specialist tools in an operating room to implant the replacement.“We have to get a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of inventory, including instruments and tools to do the surgery, plus all the right implants to the right customer and the right surgical suite every single time without fail,” Mr Illingworth says.“It’s a huge logistical challenge for us.”Although creating a leaner supply chain is a longer-term goal, Smith & Nephew will be hoping for greater success in sales of its core orthopaedic products in the shorter term.Group sales fell 1 per cent in the past year to $3.8bn, and the orthopaedics division, which makes up half of group sales, has been struggling.This is because a lot of its newer products in knee and hip replacements are pitched not at the traditional joint replacement demographic of someone in their 70s but at patients who are either younger – in their 40s and 50s and needing a longer-lasting joint – or who are older but lead more active lives.“We have put a focus in the past on the younger or more active patient,” Mr Illingworth says.“There are 60-year-old people and 70-year-old people who are still climbing mountains and riding bikes and doing triathlons.“We have worked hard to brand ourselves in that area. We think longer-term that this is a very, very powerful strategy for us.“But I think, in the short term, that the younger demographic is very, very cautious about whether or not they are going to take time off work and go get a hip replacement or knee replacement done and take four to six months off work to rehabilitate.”
296;FDX;Fedex Corp;2010-03-11T22:24:52Z;FedEx warns on US recovery;;The nascent US recovery could falter because businesses are still reluctant to invest in new equipment and technology, the head of global delivery and logistics company FedEx has warned.“Business investment went up somewhat in the fourth quarter but is far below what it ought to be in a cyclical recovery like this,” Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, told the Financial Times.He added that companies were being held back by continuing “uncertainty” over the outlook.During the downturn many companies, including FedEx, cut their capital expenditures in response to falling demand, moves that in turn intensified the drop-off in economic activity. The levels have yet to recover.Boosting investment spending was crucial to catalysing a sustainable recovery, Mr Smith said, because it created jobs. When people were worried about unemployment, they tended to spend less, undercutting a driver of the economy.Mr Smith’s views on macroeconomic issues are widely sought because FedEx is seen as a bellwether of the global economy with connections to most big companies and insights into their planning. Last month Barack Obama, US president, singled out Mr Smith, a long-time supporter of Republican Senator John McCain, as the chief executive he most admired, citing his ability to think “long term”.FedEx, which reports its fiscal third-quarter results next week, expects US growth to be healthy in the first and second quarters as companies cut inventories less aggressively and even begin to rebuild stocks.Such actions propelled US gross domestic product growth to its highest rate in six years for the fourth quarter of 2009.Government data showed that the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 5.9 per cent between October and December. But Mr Smith said growth would probably slow as the restocking fillip passed.“In my opinion, for consumers to spend you have to get business investment up because that is what creates the jobs,” Mr Smith said.“I don’t think you will see substantial increases in employment until you see substantial increases in business investment.”To help encourage businesses to start investing again, Mr Smith has been urging politicians to change the tax rules on capital expenditures to allow companies to recoup money earlier than in the past.
297;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Dollar’s revival damps demand for stocks;Wall Street follows global equities lower;21:15 GMT. The dollar shot to its highest level in three months on Thursday after traders perceived the Federal Reserve had adopted a more upbeat tone regarding the US economy following its decision to leave interest rates at historic lows.However, in a sign that the the carry trade mantra of “strong dollar equals weak stocks” is still afforded some heft, global stock markets turned lower on the greenback’s advance.The FTSE World Index fell 1.7 per cent: the steepest daily decline since October. The global banking sector gave back all and more of the previous day’s gains after Citigroup’s stock offering attracted disappointing demand.The S&P 500 in New York fell 1.2 per cent to 1,096, with a worse-than-expected report on initial jobless claims and a downbeat forecast from FedEx also weighing on sentiment.London’s FTSE 100 shed 1.9 per cent to 5,218, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 dropped 1.3 per cent to 1,019. Resources stocks were particularly weak as the strong dollar hit commodity prices.News that Standard & Poor’s had also cut Greece’s credit rating further damped spirits and reminded investors that sovereign debt risks remained. The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds at one stage jumped 25 basis points to 5.82 per cent, taking the spread with German Bunds close to 270bp. However, later the spread tightened to 250bp. The Athens stock market fell another 1.2 per cent.The dollar’s gains had accelerated once it breached the $1.45 level to the euro, later leaping 1.3 per cent to $1.4346 and gaining 0.9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis to 77.72, its highest level since the start of September. Sterling fell 1.2 per cent to $1.6142 after UK retail sales unexpectedly contracted in November.The yen fell only 0.1 per cent against the dollar, however, to Y89.89 and jumped 1.2 per cent versus the euro to Y128.96. The yen’s relative strength signalled that part of the dollar’s bounce was down to the re-emergence of risk aversion, of which the yen is usually also a beneficiary.The Federal Reserve’s statement after its rate decision on Wednesday contained few surprises, but some investors later focused on the central bank’s confirmation that a raft of money market support mechanisms would be removed at the start of February.This, coupled with the Fed upgrading its assessment of the US economy, convinced some market players that the timetable for monetary tightening has shuffled forward a touch, and this reasoning lent further support to the dollar’s recent rally.The greenback’s surge higher did not come until the early hours, however – at about 01:00 GMT – and it was therefore Asia that was first to take the brunt.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index lost 1 per cent. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo, which had earlier benefited from the yen’s weakness relative to the dollar, closed down 0.1 per cent at 10,613.More year-end profit-taking saw mainland China’s benchmark, the Shanghai Composite, tumble 2.3 per cent to 3,179, its lowest in three weeks. Concerns about a possible flurry of new share issuance also weighed on sentiment. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.2 per cent to 21,347.Australia bucked the trend. The S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2 per cent to 4,670, though this was well off its highs as National Australia Bank‘s stock slid following its bid for Axa Asia Pacific.Gold struggled in the wake of the resurgent greenback, the precious metal losing 3.4 per cent to $1,099 a troy ounce. Oil also succumbed. After a more than $4 rally over the past two sessions, crude was flat at $72.69 a barrel.US natural gas prices soared to their highest in 11 months, however, after a report showed inventory levels were lower than expected. At one stage the Nymex Natgas contract was up more than 8 per cent to breach $5.90 per million British thermal units.The US 10-year Treasury yield fell 13 basis points to 3.47 per cent as investors went bargain hunting following a 40bp spike in December and as traders sought havens. The spread between the benchmark and two-year Treasuries had hit its widest yet overnight, close to 280 basis points, as the short end remained depressed because of ultra-low interest rates but the long end had moved higher on economic growth prospects and fears over increased supply of paper.
298;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-12-17T20:07:36Z;FedEx plans to unfreeze salaries;;FedEx said on Thursday that it would end its salary freeze next year, but warned the outlook remained uncertain in spite of signs the economy is recovering as it unveiled quarterly earnings.The US package shipping company last year froze salaries as well as its contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement savings accounts. On Thursday it said the US economy reached a turning point in the latest quarter, and that it was time to reward its workers.“As we bring additional traffic back, it’s time to repair and improve our compensation programmes and reward that productivity that we are getting,” Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, told analysts.FedEx is resuming merit-based pay increases and restoring half of its pension contributions that match those of employees. Mr Graf said he did not expect the shift in pay policy to hit the company’s earnings growth because it expects to see higher package volume and greater productivity from its workers.In its second quarter, FedEx said it earned $1.10 a share for the period ended November 30, a decline of 30 per cent from the $1.58 it earned a year earlier. That was in line with the preliminary announcement it made this month and better than its previous guidance.However, shares of FedEx fell 5.1 per cent to $84.83 by early afternoon on Thursday, after the company’s outlook for the upcoming quarter failed to meet Wall Street predictions. The company said it expected to earn between 50 cents and 70 cents a share in the third quarter and $3.45 to $3.75 next year.“The guidance is what got everybody flummoxed,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Jesup & Lamont, who noted that FedEx would have to cope with higher maintenance costs to keep up with rising volumes next year.FedEx is seen by investors as a corporate bellwether, because of its position as a driver of global trade. Frederick Smith, the company’s chief executive, said on Thursday that inventory liquidation had bottomed out among customers and that capital spending appeared to be on the rise as they restock.The Memphis-based company said that its quarterly revenues were off by 10 per cent at $8.6bn.International shipping volume rose by 6 per cent in the quarter, while domestic daily package volume climbed by 4 per cent.Mr Graf, however, warned of uncertainty about FedEx’s ability to maintain that pace in January and February.
299;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-12-17T17:51:18Z;US stocks slide on employment worries;;US stocks fell on Thursday after a disappointing outlook from FedEx added to concerns over unemployment.Shares in Fedex dropped 5.3 per cent to $85.20 after the shipping company forecast worse third-quarter results than the market had been expecting. The group, which is considered an economic bellwether of business activity and consumer spending, said its forecast reflected the outlook for fuel prices as well as a modest pace of economic recovery.Futures extended their early declines on Wall Street after data showed an unexpected rise in the number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits.“Admittedly, the job claims numbers weren’t great but the leading economic indicators and the Philadelphia [Fed] numbers were terrific,” said Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors. “I would have thought that the market would have been acting much more positively.”However, Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that a distinctive pattern had begun to emerge on Wall Street since August.“We’ve been cautioning people to watch out for the latter part of this month,” he said. “The market has normally been strong in the early part of the calendar month until right around options expiration and then it’s been weak in the latter part of the month.”Citigroup shareholders’ losses also continued to mount up after the bank sold $17bn of shares at such a low price that the the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake in the bank. The shares, which have already lost almost 20 per cent this week, were down 6.7 per cent at $3.22. Citigroup’s problems weighed on investor confidence in the sector, helping to send S&P financials down 1.2 per cent.By midday, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 1,099.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 0.9 per cent to 10,342.80 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower at 2,185.00.The financial sector was also hurt by Meredith Whitney downgrades. The banking analyst group cut its forecast for Morgan Stanley, sending the group’s shares down 3.9 per cent to $29.16. Meredith Whitney, which is headed by the analyst who won a following on Wall Street for her warnings about toxic assets in 2007, also reduced its forecast for Goldman Sachs, prompting the bank’s shares to drop 2.1 per cent to $161.57.Harley-Davidson added to the downbeat mood, falling 4.6 per cent to $25.66 after Goldman Sachs added the motorcycle manufacturer to its conviction sell list.Analysts at the bank said they expected year-on-year sales in October and November to have dropped 35 to 40 per cent: a steeper decline than Wall Street’s current consensus. Earlier this month, the manufacturer said it would cut almost half of its workforce at its central Pennsylvania plant.Among the market’s gainers, Pier 1 Imports, which sells imported furniture, reported a third-quarter profit after analysts had predicted a loss. The retailer said it had benefited from improving sales as well as cost cuts, sending its shares up 5 per cent to $5.23.While Rite Aid posted a third-quarter loss, it was smaller than expected, sending the shares up 10.5 per cent to $1.47. The country’s third-largest drugstore chain reported fewer charges than last year and also said its pharmacy division had shown particular improvement.General Mills edged 0.7 per cent higher to $68.80 after the food company reported higher-than-expected results. The group, which owns brands such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, also said it had boosted its advertising budget by almost 40 per cent.In deals news, Apollo Global Management announced that it was buying Cedar Fair at a 27 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price, sending shares in the amusement park owner up 23.4 per cent to $11.20.The total transaction was valued at $2.4bn, including the refinancing of the company’s outstanding debt, and ranked as the third-largest LBO this year, according to Capita IQ data.

Sales fell 0.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the company’s home market and also declined in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Strong demand in Europe helped the group post a 0.7 per cent rise in global like-for-like sales but it was the smallest monthly gain in five years. The restaurant chain’s shares were down 2.1 per cent at $60.61.A lower than expected profit forecast from 3M, the diversified manufacturer, also weighed on the market from the opening bell.However, it said it still planned to spend about $1bn on acquisitions over the next 12 months. Shares in the group, which makes Post-it notes, fell 1 per cent to $77.11.Kroger fell the most in the benchmark index after the grocery chain reported quarterly results sharply below estimates and cut its forecast. The retailer said it had suffered from greater competition and declining food prices. Its shares plunged 11.9 per cent to $20.13.The pessimism spread to its competitors, sending shares in Safeway down 6.8 per cent to $20.91 and Supervalu 8.7 per cent lower to $13.18.The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent at 1,091.94 and all the S&P sectors were in the red. Energy stocks showed the sharpest declines as oil prices fell due to the stronger dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,285.97 and the Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent to 2,172.99.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Procter & Gamble said AG Lafley, chairman, would retire in early 2010 and Bob McDonald, chief executive, would take over the role as chairman. Shares in the world’s biggest consumer products company fell 1 per cent to $61.87.Kimco Realty, the shopping centre owner, announced plans to sell 25m shares to pay down debt. Last month, the group trimmed its outlook after reporting a 63 per cent drop in third-quarter profit. The group has been plagued by rising vacancies as retailers have downsized in the recession. Its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $12.51.Strong demand for Jack Daniel’s whiskey helped Brown-Forman post quarterly profit above expectations, prompting the drinks group to raise its outlook. Its shares slipped 0.2 per cent to $52.12.After weeks of wrangling, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sealed a deal to buy Diedrich Coffee for about $290m in cash. Green Mountain had been locked in a bidding war with Peet’s Coffee & Tea over the company but Peet’s announced on Monday that it would not raise its offer any further.

The move is being seen as a prelude to the sale of the group.Details of the stake, which were disclosed by the Dutch market regulator on Tuesday, follow news of a similar investment by the US asset manager BlackRock.Jana’s move marks a big-ticket return to activism, with echoes of its boom-time peak in 2007 when hedge funds triggered the sale of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, to Royal Bank of Scotland.Activist hedge funds, which were hard hit in 2008, were now queuing up to deploy capital in Europe, industry insiders said.Cevian Capital, Europe’s largest dedicated activist fund, told the Financial Times it had made more than twice as many investments this year than usual.Other funds said they were quietly building stakes in target companies and expected to disclose next year.Jana and Aimco’s stake in TNT was revealed because it triggered Dutch market disclosure rules, which require shareholders to announce positions of more than 5 per cent in companies.TNT, which took its name from the international express carrier that merged with the Dutch post office in 1996, has long been in the frame as a possible takeover target.US postal services companies UPS and FedEx, together with DHL – which is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Post – were last year said to have been interested in acquiring the group.TNT’s directors, however, have since outlined a “standalone” strategy. The group has made inroads into the UK market on the back of declining Royal Mail services.The intentions of Jana and Aimco are unknown, but a sale of TNT to one of its rivals is widely seen as one possible outcome.Jana’s last significant foray into European corporate activism was in 2007, when the company, together with hedge fund giant DE Shaw, took a 1.6 per cent stake in Philips, the electronics company.On Friday, TNT unveiled a “Vision 2015” strategy to analysts in London that played up its prospects in “day-definite” express deliveries, but failed to outline a explicit plan for the mail business.It is struggling with a 4-6 per cent annual decline in mail volumes in the Netherlands and full competition after the European market was liberalised this year.Its workforce is partly unionised.The company has warned that it may need to make up to 11,000 staff redundant. It declined to comment.TNT shares closed 2.8 per cent higher at €20.91.
302;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-12-08T18:46:08Z;TNT chief says split-up call ‘disruptive’;;Like all incumbent postal operators, TNT was already suffering from declining mail volumes due to the rise of digital communications.But this year the Dutch group had to struggle with what it called “the perfect storm” of full competition in its home market and an ongoing collapse in volumes for express services due to the global financial crisis.A perennial subject for takeover speculation – most recently in July 2008 when its bigger US rival FedEx held preliminary takeover talks– the group must now face the further challenge of activist shareholders who favour splitting the mail business from the express operations.Peter Bakker, the group’s chief executive, told analysts last Friday that a break-up would not unlock any value, suggesting that potential bidders for parts of the company should instead just call him.“Splitting the group in our minds does not help address the challenges or get to the opportunities that we have identified for this group,” he said. “It will be a highly disruptive decision to consider that.”Instead, unveiling a new “Vision 2015” six-year plan, he said TNT had decided to drop plans to become a European leader in mail delivery because the liberalisation of EU postal markets had been “distorted”.TNT will now consider “partnerships and sales” for its European Mail Network that operates in seven countries, including Italy, the UK and Germany. The group also hinted for the first time that even its core Dutch mail business might “over time” participate in “possible future European Mail incumbent consolidation”.TNT says it needs to cut labour costs because its new competitors pay €8 ($11.80) an hour while it is saddled with costs of up to €23 per hour. The unions accept job losses are unavoidable but are pushing for a 1.5 per cent pay rise.Meanwhile, TNT’s global express delivery network, which grew out of the Australian group that merged with the Dutch post office in 1996, has seen international volumes fall to 2006 levels and European air volumes drop to 2002 levels.But the business, which accounted for €1.5bn of TNT’s €2.5bn revenues in the third quarter, is seen as attractive, particularly for its Asian operations and a strong European road network.
303;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-12-08T15:11:40Z;TNT;Activist shareholders could press for a break-up;"Yikes! Activist hedge funds are back in the Dutch market; remember what came out of TCI’s 2007 push to break up ABN Amro. But these are more sober times, and Jana Partners and co-investor Aimco, newly announced on the register of Dutch postal services group TNT, could make a useful contribution.TNT has a plain-vanilla mail service, the former Dutch post office, subject to increasing competition due to European Union liberalisation and the decline of snail mail. Trade unions, meanwhile, are cutting up rough over a new labour agreement. But it has a peachy express parcel service, with nearly a fifth of the EU market and a growing emerging market network. Jana is likely to push for TNT to be sold, ditching its standalone strategy. US rivals FedEx and UPS – with only 9 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, of European express delivery services – were both thought to have been interested in acquiring it in 2008, when TNT’s shares, as today, were trading at about €20.But the Dutch mail arm could put off potential acquirers, so realising full value might entail a break-up. The mail business – a handy cash generator, if a decent union agreement can be reached – could go to, say, private equity or a European operator such as Deutsche Post. The express arm would then be more attractive to US buyers. Collins Stewart suggests that, valuing mail on a discounted cash flow basis and express parcel somewhere between FedEx’s 7.5 times 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and UPS’s 11 times, TNT could be worth up to €30 a share, or about €11bn. A break-up, however, could provoke political opposition – and like many Dutch companies, TNT has a foundation that could, in theory, block a takeover. Change is likely to move at the pace of snail mail, not an express parcel. And the package may yet not arrive.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially"
304;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-12-08T01:22:40Z;FedEx exceeds profit expectations;;FedEx said mounting demand for international and domestic shipments, along with cost cuts, had helped the package delivery company beat its own quarterly profits forecast.Considered a bellwether by many investors for its role in facilitating global trade, FedEx has seen its outlook brighten steadily since June, when the company ended a fiscal year that its chief executive, Fred Smith, called “the most difficult economic conditions that the modern world has seen since the end of world war two”.By the end of the summer, Mr Smith said in September, the early stages of a recovery appeared under way. FedEx forecast that US gross domestic product would expand by 3 per cent this quarter, then 4.9 per cent in the last three months of the year.In a statement announcing the Memphis-based company’s preliminary fiscal second-quarter results, FedEx said it earned $1.10 a share for the period ended November 30, down 30 per cent from the $1.58 it earned a year earlier. The courier had forecast a profit of 65-95 cents a share.Christopher Ceraso, an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote on Monday in a note to clients: “We believe that the positive preannouncement represents further evidence of improvement in both the domestic and the international freight environment. This is well above our current estimate of 84 cents a share and consensus of 95 cents.”FedEx’s shares surged $2.59, or about 3 per cent, to $90.11 in late trading following the close of US markets. Before the announcement, the stock had climbed 36 per cent this year.United Parcel Service, FedEx’s rival, rose $1.38, or 2.4 per cent, to $59.25 in after-hours trading.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said in the statement: “FedEx will exceed previous earnings guidance in the second quarter primarily due to better-than-expected growth in FedEx International Priority and FedEx Ground volumes, coupled with the benefits of our continuing cost control programmes. Year-over-year growth in our US overnight express and FedEx International Priority services increased each month during the quarter, aided by inventory restocking and …successful sales efforts.”Mr Graf said demand for international services had “improved significantly” since the first quarter.FedEx will report its complete second-quarter results on December 17.FedEx reported net profits of $181m, or 58 cents a share, last quarter, a 53 per cent drop from a year ago. Total revenue slipped 20 per cent to $8bn.
305;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-11-11T22:33:43Z;Wall Street hits fresh highs for the year;;Wall Street hit fresh highs for the year on Wednesday after positive surprises from a luxury homebuilder and an armoured-tank manufacturer added to rising investor optimism.Production data from China showing that factory output had hit a 19-month high in October lifted commodity-based stocks, pushing United States Steel3.2 per cent higher to $39.30.Comments from Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday about the weakness of the economic recovery also left investors more confident that interest rates would be maintained at their low levels for a longer period.On light volumes, the S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,098.51, its highest level since October last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for the sixth session in a row, gaining 0.4 per cent to 10,291.26. The Nasdaq rose 0.7 per cent to 2,166.90.“We’re seeing more productivity overseas but the main thing that’s driving the market today is the Fed,” said Doug Roberts of Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They indicated that they’re going to keep rates fairly low and that’s what people are looking for. The government is the lender of last resort and as long as the stimulus programmes continue then there’s plenty of liquidity. A weaker dollar is also fuelling the whole market.”Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, surprised the market by announcing that fourth-quarter revenues would only drop 30 per cent and would come in more than $100m above analysts’ estimates. The Pennsylvania-based builder also said that net contracts for the quarter had risen 42 per cent, raising hopes that the housing market is beginning to stabilise. Shares in the group climbed 16.4 per cent to $21.41.Shares of United Parcel Service, the world’s largest package delivery service, gained 2.2 per cent to $58.07 after its chief executive, Scott Davis, told Reuters that he expected volume to grow next year and would also increase shipping rates. Last week, the group said that it was looking to emerging markets and the healthcare sector for acquisitions in order to bolster its supply-chain and freight-forwarding units.On Tuesday, FedEx, the second-largest player in the market, also forecast a rise in shipments in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers spend more money and business deliveries begin to pick up. FedEx shares were up 0.5 per cent at $82.50, leaving them 7 per cent higher this week.Oshkosh, the speciality vehicle manufacturer, said that it had received a $438m order for an additional 1,000 blast-proof trucks from the US military, sending its shares up 3.2 per cent to $40.25. The trucks are designed for use in Afghanistan, where the military can’t use the vehicles it normally deploys in Iraq because of the poor quality of the roads.Microchip Technologies gave a boost to the Nasdaq after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” and removed it from its sell list, saying the company was beginning to address gaps in its portfolio. The shares were up 1.9 per cent at $26.71.However, shares in Nucryst Pharmaceuticals surged the most on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising 70 per cent to $1.70 after Smith & Nephew, a medical technology company, agreed to buy the drugmaker’s assets for about $21m.The wider market also managed to shrug off a series of disappointing corporate results on Wednesday.Macy’s fell 8.1 per cent at $17.86 after the department store chain reported a third-quarter loss and gave a full-year profit forecast below expectations. However, its net loss narrowed to $35m from $44m a year earlier due to stronger sales at it Bloomingdale’s stores and online.Shares in Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat producer, slipped 1.1 per cent to $13.04 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” due to increased corn and hog prices and pressure from rivals.Simmons First National, the financial holding company, priced its public offering of 2.65m common shares at a discount to their closing price on Tuesday. Shares in the Arkansas-based group fell 4.2 per cent to $24.52
306;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-10-09T23:36:33Z;A long wait in St Moritz;;"I don’t have a particularly big relationship with letterboxes. At the office, my assistant Alex does a daily edit of the bundle that thumps down daily at around 9.30am. After about an hour, I’m left with a few letters to read, a couple of magazines to add to the pile (to be read during a quiet moment but not urgent), a couple to go into the tote bag (for quiet, bedtime reading) and some that will be devoured as soon as I’ve done my own edit of the post.There are always a couple of letters marked “private and confidential” and those tend to be a mix of thank-you notes, story proposals from old colonels now retired to Devon and the odd, and I do mean odd, prison inmate that’s either a fan of this particular part of the FT or of Monocle.At home in London I rarely see the post as mostly everything is directed to the office but, since I’ve been recovering from last week’s knee operation in St Moritz (my real home), I’ve started to wait for the Swiss postman to show up and fill all the neat, perfectly lettered aluminium postboxes that line the entrance to my building.Several weeks ago one of our fashion editors in Tokyo mentioned that he’d done some freelance work for a Japanese women’s magazine that was launching a men’s edition. Already a fan of the women’s magazine, which has undergone a complete turnround under its new editor and a 200 per cent sales increase, I was keen to see the new baby brother.I alerted my colleagues in Tokyo and London via e-mail that I was keen to get hold of an advance copy of this new beast. The London office got hold of one and reported: “They really, really get what’s needed in magazines right now. You’re going to love it.”In hindsight, I’d put too much faith in the powers of Britain’s Royal Mail but I convinced myself it would show up at some point on Saturday, either by regular or special delivery. Nothing!With no deliveries on Sunday, I got a very early call from FedEx on Monday asking what time I’d be around. The company didn’t seem very interested in my physiotherapy schedule so I told them to leave it with the porter or just to lean it against my door.I had to figure out how to keep myself busy for the next few hours. Physio would only eat up an hour. A quick trip to the local branch of Co-op for the papers and essentials would take another 15 minutes and then what?When I returned from my errands, my electronic letterbox was filling up with various reports that Condé Nast was closing more magazines. Gourmet was going along with Cookie and a couple of others. While I sifted through the views and analysis on all this, the buzzer sounded.I shuffled to the door and the FedEx lady was standing with pen at the ready and holding two boxes – one was big and one was a large envelope. Knowing what was in the envelope, I tackled the box first and was surprised to find a microphone and a very elaborate set of gear for my own mini-karaoke system. The card explained that it was the perfect gift for keeping occupied in the mountains and also for making friends with Swiss neighbours. It was from Emilia de Poret and her husband Amaury – she being a talented Swedish pop singer and a new karaoke soulmate.Before turning my attention to the envelope, I fixed myself a coffee and then tore into the package. As my e-mail chimed in the background, it made me wonder if there is a digital media equivalent of the whole experience: this funny foreplay that one can have with some pulped trees, glue and ink – the ritual of waiting for a prized magazine or book and the ceremony of regarding a front cover? And then that tentative first flip through the pages to tempt the eye. Then, with your appetite whetted, you close it, so that it can be savoured later when you’re properly settled. I couldn’t think of a new media equivalent. I’ve rarely been that excited about a website launch, never been that filled with anticipation to see something on YouTube. The only thing I could come up with was some excitement about seeing the most recent Jason Bourne film.Eventually, I poured myself a small glass of wine, switched on the bedside light and settled in with this magazine. The cover was warm, welcoming and beautifully lit. The magazine was slightly oversized and stapled with an interesting binding technique that has allowed the publisher to incorporate a variety of different papers. It smelled woody and felt substantial to the touch. It was everything that so many magazines (poor Gourmet and Cookie included) are not: it was both a commercial and editorial piece of craft, as opposed to most magazines today, which have ceased to be a proper celebration of the medium they represent and are instead little more than brochures for their lossmaking web editions.Some of you will recognise the magazine I am talking about, the rest will have to wait for next week’s big reveal.Tyler Brûlé is editor-in-chief of Monocle

307;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-10-06T17:27:39Z;UPS focus turns towards tighter supply links;;The raised crane booms at the ports of China’s Pearl River Delta are a sign of the behind-the-scenes drama in global outsourcing.The booms have often been raised out of use since early in 2008, when the Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on labour standards in the area, which had been the first beneficiary of China’s manufacturing boom. Production, and port activity in coastal cities such as Shenzhen, shifted to elsewhere on China’s coast or even to other countries.Such shifts have become more frequent and more dramatic, according to Daniel Brutto, president of the international business of UPS, the US parcel delivery and freight forwarding business, since the world economic downturn forced many companies worldwide to re-examine their supply-chain costs.Speaking during a visit to London, Mr Brutto says companies are becoming increasingly discriminating both about which of their products needs to be sourced where, and how they travel to their destination.There are increasing concerns about manufacturing being based in a single site in China and the dominance of air freight for transporting whole categories of some consumer goods.The changes have come about partly due to a rise in the low wages in China that initially helped to make it what Mr Brutto calls “the factory of the world”. Some companies have simply sought out a cheaper base.“Where we see them going is Vietnam,” Mr Brutto says. “Certainly, that’s a big area. We don’t see as much of India, but there’s a start to that, and even [to] Pakistan.”With the outsourcing of more valuable goods, such as internet routers and medical devices, there is some “near-sourcing” – migration of production to low-cost centres near the main consumer centres of western Europe and North America.Such “near-shoring” could help companies by letting them hold less stock and be more responsive to changing trends than is possible with production in China.“You have some companies setting up in Mexico to feed the United States or, central Europe to feed western Europe,” Mr Brutto says. “It was a much greater phenomenon when oil was $150 a barrel because the fuel surcharge [from ship and aircraft operators] was almost wiping out the labour-cost arbitrage.”Other companies are moving the manufacturing of their most sophisticated products to the most developed economies, he adds. They fear their intellectual property rights might be at risk elsewhere.However, the biggest trend Mr Brutto identifies is a differentiation between how companies are treating similar products of different values. Some fashion goods might need to be made close to customers, but others might not.“If I’m going to manufacture gym shoes and I know that, if I can get it down to the right price point, it’s just going to be a consumable, I’m going to try to get that from the lowest-cost area I can,” Mr Brutto says. It would, however, make less sense to go around the world to make a customised gym shoe.For other goods, the key issue might be how quickly – and how expensive it would be – to move them to market, even if they are still made far away.Mr Brutto uses the example of a maker of hard disks whose cheapest product has predictable sales patterns, but sells at low profit margins. Until recently, it was expensively air-freighted to its market in line with the company’s policy of keeping inventories small to reduce costs. That logic has now been re-examined.“If you can predict your cycle, you can use ocean shipping and reduce your cost to the point where the increase in inventory will be offset by the decrease in transportation costs,” Mr Brutto says.However, the most sophisticated case he describes involves a maker of laptops. Its calculations illustrate the minute detail in which many companies are now seeking new supply-chain efficiencies.The company scrapped a policy of flying laptops to market – complete with product manuals, batteries and cables.“Now they’re saying: ‘Maybe I don’t need to fly everything’,” Mr Brutto says. “The thing you really need to turn over fast is the computer. But, if you standardise the cables and produce the documentation near the customer, you can put the cables on the ocean.”
308;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-09-17T21:32:05Z;FedEx bullish on delivery demand;;FedEx on Thursday declared that a global economic recovery was under way, which it said would fuel demand for the company’s package deliveries.The forecast came as the US logistics company, considered a bellwether for the US economy, said that quarterly results had exceeded its own expectations, reflecting corporate America’s optimism for the immediate future.Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, had called FedEx’s last fiscal year, which ended in June, “the most difficult economic conditions that the modern world has seen since the end of world war two.”The large logistics companies – FedEx, UPS and Deutsche Post DHL, which are considered bellwethers for global trade – all suffered during the past year as the global downturn took hold.However, by the end of the summer, Mr Smith said on Thursday, conditions had improved.“The economy was slightly better during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and confidence appears to be improving,” said Mr Smith said during a conference call with analysts.“The housing sector seems to have bottomed and auto sales have picked up.”The package-delivery company predicted US gross domestic product would expand by 3 per cent this quarter, then 4.9 per cent in the last three months of the year. US GDP will grow at a 2.9 per cent pace next year.“More importantly,” Mr Smith said, “industrial production – a significant driver of FedEx’s business – should improve more than 4 per cent in 2010, a strong contrast to its 10 per cent decline in 2009.”FedEx reported net profit of $181m, or 58 cents a share, in its first fiscal quarter, a 53 per cent drop from the $384m, or $1.23, the Memphis-based company earned a year ago.Total revenue slipped 20 per cent to $8bn.FedEx’s express-delivery business earned $104m, down 70 per cent, on sales of $4.9bn. The ground-shipment arm reported a 7 per cent increase in operating income, to $209m from $196m. Revenue fell 2 per cent to $1.73bn.The company’s shares slipped 3.1 per cent to $75.79 by midday trading in New York, paring much of the gains they had made since FedEx disclosed its per-share results in a preliminary report a week ago.Its 59-cent profit exceeded the 30-45 cent range FedEx predicted in June. The company also reiterated its second-quarter profit forecast of 65-95 cents a share. FedEx earned $1.58 a share in the same period a year earlier.The company plans to raise its shipping rates in January by an average of 5.9 per cent for US domestic and export services, while trimming its fuel surcharge by 2 percentage points.

Analysts had been expecting initial jobless claims to rise.Homebuilders rallied after data showed new US residential building rose in August to a nine-month high. A separate study on Wednesday indicated confidence among US homebuilders rose for the third consecutive month in September.Beazer Homes, which operates in 17 states, rose 6.2 per cent to $5.13. Standard Pacific, which also provides mortgage financing, gained 1 per cent to $4.25.But after opening lower, Wall Street struggled to hold on to mid-morning gains. The S&P closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,065.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 9,783.92 and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,126.75.On Wednesday, US stocks had rallied to their highest levels since October after industrial production data raised hopes of economic recovery.“The economic news has been primarily good,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com. “We’ve had a heck of a rally and you have a lot of money managers on the side who, whether they like it or not, are forced to participate. But at the same time, when it’s been rallying this much you’re definitely going to get a pause after a few days.”Financial stocks initially led the market higher. Citigroup rose 5.2 per cent to $4.42 after Rochdale Securities said the group’s shares could return to the $5 level and that a share offering or sale of stock by the government was unlikely.Optimism about economic recovery also lifted Bank of America shares 2.1 per cent to $17.61 and JPMorgan 0.7 per cent to $44.96.Rising commodity prices continued to prop up material and industrial companies in early trading before they led the declines in the afternoon. Nucor, the second-largest US steel
producer, rose 3.6 per cent to $49.84 after Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold” on expectations the group could return to profit in the fourth quarter.While energy stocks also clung on to the fluctuating oil price, Ivanhoe Energy powered ahead of the sector, gaining 11.1 per cent to $2.41. The oil and gas exploration company said analysts had found one of its oilfields in Ecuador contained as much as 12.1bn barrels.But Peabody Energy fell 1.9 per cent to $39.86 and Patriot Coal lost 5.6 per cent to $12.76 after both were downgraded by UBS analysts, who said stock prices already reflected a recovery in the industry.After three straight days of losses, Oracle, the software company, fell another 2.8 per cent to $21.52. The California-based company has been facing a delay in closing its purchase of Sun Microsystems, and the shares took another battering on Thursday after the company’s first-quarter sales missed analyst estimates.In an effort to return to profitability, American Airlines said it had raised $2.9bn in cash and loans to increase its number of flights from Chicago, New York, Dallas and Miami. Shares in AMR, its parent company, soared 19.7 per cent to $8.80.The consumer staples index led the market during early losses, but from midday it remained in the red. Smithfield Foods added to the sector’s woes, losing 3.3 per cent to $13.71. The pork processor said a public offering of 21.66m shares was priced at $13.85 per share, below the closing price on Wednesday.FedEx shares also slipped 2.2 per cent to $76.46 after reporting first-quarter profit that matched forecasts on Wall Street but lower-than-expected revenue. The delivery company, which is considered a bellwether for US business activity, also reaffirmed its forecast.In the pharmaceutical sector, Immunogen said late on Wednesday that it had extended its licence for technology to develop anti-cancer drugs to Amgen, the biotechnology company. Immunogen rose 3.5 per cent to $8.24, while Amgen gained 1.4 per cent to $60.52."
310;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-09-17T12:57:43Z;Stable fuel prices strengthen FedEx results;;FedEx told investors on Friday that stable fuel prices and a modest recovery in the world’s economy had helped lift the package delivery company’s earnings well above expectations for the first half of its fiscal year.FedEx said it earned 58 cents a share during the fiscal first quarter, well above the 30-45 cent range it predicted in June, and forecast a second-quarter profit of 65-95 cents a share.“First-quarter financial performance exceeded our guidance thanks to better-than-expected international priority volume, strict cost management and solid execution of our strategy,” Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said in a statement.The improved outlook, which exceeded Wall Street’s consensus estimates for each quarter, also helped FedEx’s shares to their highest level in almost a year. The stock was up 6 per cent to $77.01 at midday in New York, after increasing as much as 7.8 per cent.Investors were hoping this summer would mark not only the start of a new fiscal year for the package-delivery company, but also the end of an economic downturn that has sapped worldwide demand for shipments.Three months ago, FedEx’s executives said that while the first six months of its fiscal 2010 would remain “extremely difficult”, they believed the worst of the slowdown was behind them. In a September 1 note to clients, JPMorgan Chase analyst Thomas Wadewitz hinted that demand for international shipments had improved enough to prompt FedEx to revise its forecasts.The Memphis-based company reports its full quarterly results on Thursday.FedEx predicted in June that first-quarter earnings per share would range between 30 and 45 cents, compared with $1.23 a year ago and well below the 70-cent estimate analysts had averaged at the time.By September, the consensus had dropped to 44 cents. FedEx has withheld any profits outlook for the full fiscal year 2010.But in a July regulatory filing, the company said it would see a “slight increase” in earnings before income before interest and tax at both its express- and ground-delivery businesses.“We think the outlook implies a pretty strong back-half recovery for its fiscal year,” Christopher Ceraso, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a July note to clients.In Friday’s statement, FedEx cautioned that it remained “difficult to predict the timing and pace of any economic recovery”.FedEx also said the US Internal Revenue Service planned to assess $14m in taxes and penalties, plus interest, on the company to cover 2002 federal employment and withholding taxes for independent contractors working for the FedEx Home Delivery division. FedEx said it would contest the findings

But light trading volume suggested investors were reluctant to commit themselves after analysts had predicted equities would fall after the summer’s rally.“After a huge run over the last couple of days, the market is a bit overbought so everybody is waiting for a pull-back,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.After the oil price sunk back below the psychologically significant $70 level, stocks erased their early gains. The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,042.73 points after gaining 2.6 per cent this week.The Nasdaq fell 0.2 per cent to 2,080.90 points but it has still outperformed the other indices in recent sessions and was up 3.1 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to end the session at 9,605.41 and was up this week by 1.7 per cent.After leading the market higher this week, technology stocks deteriorated throughout the day. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lost 1.3 per cent to $19.51 even after an upgrade from Roth Capital.In spite of posting better first-quarter results than had been expected, National Semiconductor fell 5.9 per cent to $15.03. The chipmaker’s shares have risen 30 per cent since the beginning of July after investors bet on a sector recovery.Garmin, the maker of GPS products, rose 0.3 per cent to $36.18 after a recommendation from Bank of America.But Cree, a maker of light-emitting diodes, weighed on the sector after it announced on Thursday that it would place 11m shares in a common stock offering. Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.83.After strong performances in the week, the energy and materials sector also dragged the market down but industrial stocks stayed strong. During the week, General Electric powered the sector after JPMorgan upgraded the stock and Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the company the day after.Its shares fell back 0.9 per cent to $14.67 but were up 5.8 per cent for the week.Fedex delivered a further boost to the sector on Friday. The second-largest US package-shipping group, considered a gauge of economic activity, rallied 6.4 per cent to $77.32 after announcing earnings would exceed its forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Quidel gained 1.7 per cent to $16.99 after the maker of tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases forecast strong profit in its third quarter due
to higher demand for flu products.Healthcare stocks also fell back after a week of volatile trading.Uncertainty lingered over President Barack Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system. After clawing back some losses on Thursday, Wellpoint fell 0.3 per cent to $54.03 and Unitedhealth Group also slipped 0.1 per cent to $29.07.The financial sector, however, was in negative territory from the outset.American International Group was downgraded by Wells Fargo Securities, which said the company had no tangible book value.Its shares, which have lost 7.5 per cent this week in spite of the market’s rally, fell 0.8 per cent to $37.55. Morgan Stanley was one of the few gainers in the sector. The shares rose 0.6 per cent to $28.82 after it said John Mack, chief executive, would step down and be replaced by James Gorman, head of retail
brokerage."
312;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-08-21T18:10:32Z;JAL / NYK;;Banks routinely carve out duff assets. Why shouldn’t other companies too?Japan’s largest airline and its leading shipping line, in discussions to pool their air cargo units, are pondering the transport equivalent of a bad bank. Japan Airlines will be the senior partner in any deal, with $2bn of cargo revenues – more than twice that of Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Its operating income for international cargo in the quarter to end-June more than halved, year-on-year, the steepest fall of any business segment. For NYK, air cargo has always been marginal, and with expected recurring losses this financial year of $234m, on sales of $565m, it is a business it can do without. Cost synergies could be significant, perhaps $200m, if both sides retain an interest in the merged business. But plucking out these problem assets and fobbing them off to greater fools would instantly boost earnings per share.For airlines, making money from air cargo has never been easy or a particularly high priority. Stuffing electronics, food and textiles on passenger flights is a commoditised service that most offer not because they want to, but because – with wide-body aircraft with masses of belly room – they would be mad not to. Many also operate dedicated freighters, but struggle to compete with the likes of FedEx and UPS for urgent, high-margin business. And when it comes to ordinary bulk cargoes, the freighters are selling on the basis that they are quicker than a container ship. That’s hardly compelling, when there is no rush for retailers to restock shelves.Until details of the deal emerge, Japan’s two largest air cargo operators will continue to take out capacity. Other airlines with deadweight freight divisions will study the tie-up with interest.Japan Airlines (JAL) and Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) announced on Friday that they have reached an agreement to begin negotiations involving a potential merger between their air cargo businesses.Through a major restructuring of the cargo business and by combining the strengths of the two largest cargo operators in Japan to form the biggest solitary Japanese cargo transport provider, JAL and NYK foresee being able to secure profitability and raise the value of both companies.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
313;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-07-06T21:14:07Z;Wall St defensive stocks provide support;;Defensive stocks spurred a late rally on Wall Street to turn US equities positive on Monday following the previous session’s heavy falls.Multinational brand names fared well as investors remained in a cautious mode ahead of the start of earnings season this week.Philip Morris gained 2.8 per cent to $44.15 and Colgate-Palmolive picked up 3.2 per cent to $74.38.But energy and materials stocks were a significant drag as investors continued to worry about the pace of economic recovery.Those concerns triggered a fall on Thursday ahead of the long independence day weekend after a worse than expected jobs report, and were further heightened by words from Joe Biden, the US vice-president, over the weekend.Mr Biden said the Obama administration had “misread” how bad the economy was when forecasting 8 per cent unemployment, which took a further toll on commodities stocks as investors worried about demand.The price of oil tumbled to a five-week low, weighing on ConocoPhillips, which lost 0.3 per cent to $40.83, and Schlumberger, which fell 2.1 per cent to $51.45.Metal producers also suffered and, with Deutsche Bank warning that demand for copper could fall 3.9 per cent in 2009, shares in Freeport McMoRan, which mines the metal, gave up 7.6 per cent to $45.94.Alcoa the aluminium maker that is due to start the earnings season on Wednesday, dropped 6.1 per cent to $9.26.“We could see a defensive rotation here as investors wait cautiously for the start of earnings season,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 898.72 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 8,324.87. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.5 per cent to 1,787.40.Many big name banks were also lower with Citigroup down 3.1 per cent at $2.79 and Bank of America3.9 per cent lower at $12.15.The financial sector was near its lowest level since the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets sparked a rally in May.American Express was one of the few financial stocks to find significant gains after Stifel Nicolaus, the brokerage group, said it may benefit from new legislation restricting teaser rates, which analysts said AmEx did not rely on.AmEx’s shares picked up 5.6 per cent to $23.52.The economic negativity was punctuated by promising signs from Ford and FedEx two companies that provide early signs on consumer and corporate health.Ford’s shares lost early gains after sales at the company’s joint ventures in China rose 14 per cent to record highs. They closed 2.4 per cent lower at $5.75.Meanwhile, Michael Ducker, head of FedEx’s international business, told a German magazine that he saw signs of a turnround in the second half of the year. Shares in FedEx were up 3.2 per cent to $56.04.Data from the Institute of Supply Management also provided a glimmer of economic hope, showing that business activity in the non-manufacturing sector was marginally better than expected in June.But analysts warned economic data would need to show more positive signs to trigger another rally.“For the market to continue to rally, the news will have to go from negative to neutral or positive, and investors have started to realise that,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.EMC provided some impetus to the technology sector after the company said it would increase its offer for data storage company Data Domain to $33.50 a share.This puts EMC in a head-to-head battle with NetApp, Data Domain’s rival, which received regulatory clearance for its own bid for the company.EMC picked up 0.9 per cent to $12.89 while NetApp was 0.6 per cent lower at $18.85. Data Domain rose 2.6 per cent to $34.06.In the telecommunications sector, Sprint Nextel rose as analysts at Auriga upgraded the stock, citing continued demand for the company’s Boost pre-paid mobile telephone contracts, which have sold well during the recession.Its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $4.47.
314;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-06-17T22:55:58Z;FedEx swings to fourth-quarter loss;;FedEx executives told investors they believed the worst of the economic downturn was behind them.The note of optimism came during an otherwise sobering review of the package-delivery company’s fiscal fourth quarter, during which its net loss widened from a year earlier on goodwill writedowns, and the company warned that it would slog through harsh conditions for another six months.The quarterly shortfall capped a fiscal year its chief executive, Fred Smith, called “the most difficult economic conditions that the modern world has seen since the end of world war two.”FedEx withheld any profits outlook for fiscal 2010. But Mr Smith said there were signs that a recovery may be under way by the end of the year.He noted that corporate inventory-to-sales ratios were moderating, credit markets had thawed and FedEx’s own international express-delivery shipments – in freefall for much of the past year – had stabilised.The company is considered a bellwether for the wider economy because of its role in facilitating global trade.“We remain optimistic about a turnaround beginning later in calendar 2009,” he said. But he added that a return to growth could be pushed out “a little bit later” if companies remained conservative on spending and managing their inventories.The US company also made clear that the next six months would be “extremely difficult”.FedEx predicted first-quarter earnings per share would range between 30 and 45 cents, compared with $1.23 a year ago and well below Wall Street’s 70-cent consensus estimate.The shares closed 1.4 per cent down at $50.70 in New York on Wednesday. They have fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year.“While the fuel impact is very large, volume weakness is also clearly a factor,” Thomas Wadewitz, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.FedEx’s fourth-quarter net loss widened to $876m, or $2.82 a share, compared with $241m, or 78 cents, a year earlier.Excluding $1.2bn in goodwill from its acquisitions of Kinko’s and Watkins Motor Lines, earnings fell to 64 cents a share from $1.45.Revenue slumped 20 per cent to $7.85bn from $9.87bn. FedEx reported net income of $98m, or 31 cents a share, in fiscal 2009. Full-year revenue fell 6 per cent to $35.5bn.Mr Smith reiterated his opposition to US legislation that would strip FedEx’s express-delivery business from its right to bargain under the Railway Labour Act, making it easier for the division’s workers to form local unions.A bill containing this provision, which was backed by United Parcel Service, FedEx’s archrival, has passed the US House.FedEx has threatened to cancel orders for new aircraft if the provision becomes law and is lobbying to keep it out of the Senate’s version of the bill.
315;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-06-17T20:48:21Z;Wall Street afternoon rally peters out;;"US equities fluctuated on Wednesday as bullish healthcare stocks balanced a flagging financial sector, which fell as the government released details of proposed new regulations.The Obama plan would mean tighter regulation of derivatives and stricter controls on capital reserves. This was part of the reason for the decision by S&P to downgrade 22 banks.The rating agency said: “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.”This sent bank shares sharply lower. And although the market took some reassurance from the president’s speech, banking shares remained lower.Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 5.4 per cent to $23.09, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 5.2 per cent to $6.81.“The effect of the regulation is a little bit worrying,” said Stephen Auth of Federated Investors. “But even though it could reduce returns, it may be helpful in damping risk also.”The effect of those falls was outweighed by a strong performance from drug makers. Pfizer gained 3 per cent to $14.58, while Merck rose 1.4 per cent
to $24.77.The sector had been sparked into life by news that Watson Pharmaceuticals was to buy the privately owned Arrow, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $30.27.Although shares rallied in the afternoon as investors took confidence from positive words about the outlook for the US AAA credit rating from S&P, they fell back again shortly before the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.1 per cent down at 910.71 and 8,497.18 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,808.06 however.Equities had spent the early part of the morning in negative territory after results from FedEx gave rise to concerns about the health of corporate spending.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings.But FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent to $50.70 as it said first-quarter earnings could be less than half analysts’ estimates.Consumer stocks rallied strongly during the afternoon, however, with Abercrombie & Fitch a stand-out performer after the clothing retailer said it would close its struggling Ruehl chain. The shares rose 4.5 per cent to $26.97.The strength in the sector came as figures showed inflation is not a near-term concern, with consumer prices rising less than analysts forecast.This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which revealed a much more moderate rise than some had feared.Wall Street also took solace from results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 1.8 per cent to $28.68.Lincoln National avoided the worst of the sell-off in the financial sector after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock closed 1.1 down at $14.90.E-Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 11.5 per cent to $1.46 after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in fresh capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as metal prices fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 3.8 per cent to $10.49, while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 3.7 per cent to $50.48.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped. Nucor dipped 1 per cent to $46.38.Steel Dynamics managed to hold steady however after it received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans. The shares were flat at $15.26."
316;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-06-17T14:34:48Z;Wall Street hit by business spending fears;;Wall Street stocks slipped on Wednesday morning as news from FedEx suggested business spending was not improving.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, managed to beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings. But its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $50.35 as the company said first-quarter earnings could be less than half of analysts’ estimates.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank said that results from Best Buy and FedEx demonstrate that earnings are not the problem. ”Revenues are falling and companies still need to cuts costs, which push other company’s revenues lower. There is no consumer spending power in this economy and equities face a considerable period of consolidation.”This knocked futures and the markets opened in negative territory. After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index were both down 0.3 per cent at 909.21 and 1,791.94 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fraction to 8,501.72.Wall Street was took some solace in results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits both dropped sharply compared to a year ago, but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.80.Concerns over business spending were exacerbated by worries over the consumer sector after consumer confidence was shown to have dipped last week. There were further negative signs on individuals’ financial health from figures showing mortgage applications fell 15.8 per cent last week compared with the previous week as mortgage rates rose.There were encouraging signs, however, that inflation is still not a near-term concern after the consumer price index was shown to have risen by 0.1 per cent in May compared with April, which was less than analysts’ predictions. This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which showed a much more moderate rise than some had thought.All this came on a day when the government was set to unveil an overhaul of financial regulation, which would give the Federal Reserve much more power to monitor financial companies that pose systemic risk.The increased regulation was one of the factors in the decision by S&P to cut its credit rating on 22 banks, saying, “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.” This sent banking shares tumbling. Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 3.9 per cent to $23.45, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 8.4 per cent to $6.58.Lincoln National was one of the few financial companies to find gains after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock was up 0.3 per cent at $15.10 by mid-morning.E*Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 13.9 per cent to $1.42, however, after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in new capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as the price of materials fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 4.2 per cent to $10.44 while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 4.1 per cent to $50.25.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped, and Nucor lost 3 per cent to $45.45. Even Steel Dynamics fell in spite of received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans in exchange for higher interest rates. The shares gave up 3.7 per cent to $14.70.There was further consolidation in the healthcare sector as Watson Pharmaceuticals said it would buy the privately owned Arrow Group, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5.2 per cent to $30.33.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 2 per cent at 845.60. Asian equity markets closed mainly lower, with the FTSE Asia Pacific index 0.1 per cent lower at 193.66.Bond yields were generally lower and the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 4 basis points to 1.143 per cent. That on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3bp to 3.63 per cent.The dollar was stronger against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.63.Gold was trading $0.37 lower at $931.42 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices fell $0.65 to $69.82 a barrel.
317;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-06-08T20:47:15Z;FedEx hits at UPS on union bill;;FedEx is taking aim at United Parcel Service for its role in pushing US legislation that would make it easier for express-delivery workers to organise with a multimedia campaign that links its arch rival to banks, carmakers and other recipients of government ­largesse.In advertisements and a website, FedEx argues that the measure would leave its air and ground delivery networks – and in turn the US economy – susceptible to costly disruptions and is tantamount to a “legislative bail-out” for UPS, which is subject to different bargaining rules and remains the largest employer of members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.“This is a bail-out, plain and simple, and the American people won’t stand for it,” FedEx says on its site, whose address, Brownbailout.com, takes a swipe at the UPS slogan, “What can Brown do for you?”The provision affecting FedEx is included in a bill authorising funding for the country’s aviation regulator. UPS, one of Washington’s most generous campaign contributors, has supported the measure, which was passed by the US House last month.The campaign is FedEx’s latest and most visible attempt to stop a bill that would strip the company’s express-delivery business from its right to bargain under the Railway Labour Act, which blocks workers at railroads and airlines from organising at a local level.UPS dismissed the FedEx effort as “noise”.“It would appear that FedEx is preparing to spend millions of dollars trying to convince Congress that a FedEx driver delivering a package is different somehow [from] a UPS driver delivering a package,” UPS said. “The packages aren’t delivered by airplanes, and we don’t believe FedEx can fool Congress about that.”FedEx must now wait to see if the Senate includes a provision on its bargaining status in its version of the authorisation bill. Even if it does not, the House and Senate could reach a compromise that affected the company’s RLA status.A similar bill was passed by the US House in 2007 but failed to come before a vote in the Senate, leading Congress to extend the life of a Federal Aviation Authority Reauthorisation law, which sets policy on FAA funds and how the agency can tax air carriers for two years.FedEx has said its express business fits the description of the kind of integrated transportation system Congress sought to protect from disruption, and points to a US circuit court decision that supports its case.“It is extremely bad public policy,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in December. “FedEx Express has been a Railway Labour Act carrier since its inception. It was one of the key elements in the formation of the company.”FedEx also made a recent order of 15 Boeing 777 aircraft contingent on its continued exemptions under the Railway Labour Act.In an unrelated statement, UPS said its pilots agreed to concessions that will help the company avoid as many as 300 absences.
318;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-06-06T01:20:54Z;It’s time to adopt the brace position;;"I’ve never paid much attention to the news channel France24, but from Monday morning until the moment I reluctantly had to board a flight for Singapore on Tuesday, it was on non-stop at home and in the office as I followed the story of Air France flight 447.I’m not sure if 2009 is shaping up to be a good or bad year for the aviation sector, but the crash in Buffalo of a Q400 (an aircraft I fly frequently) in February, followed by the cartwheeling of a FedEx freighter down the runway at Tokyo’s Narita (an airport I use frequently), already had me on edge long before the events of early Monday morning over the Atlantic.It had been bad enough to learn some weeks ago – from a National Transportation Safety Board report published in Aviation Week – how overworked and underpaid regional airline pilots are in the US, and that fatigue might have played a part in the Buffalo crash. It was even more alarming to see how there’s very little a triple-engine jet can do when caught in cross-winds in the final stages of its approach at one of the safest airports in the world. The loss of an Air France A330 mid-flight between Rio and Paris is more unsettling still.For frequent long-haul fliers, the sudden, as yet unexplained, crash of a dependable aircraft operated by a reputable airline is almost enough to keep you out of the skies until French investigators come up with some conclusive answers and until the aviation industry modifies its operating procedures accordingly.Last year I developed a fear of storms following two particularly unpleasant flights within Europe. On a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Zurich, our approach into the airport was so violent due to the up- and down-drafts caused by a thunderstorm that I was sure we were going to be thrown into the quaint houses in the hills below.A couple of months later, on a Lufthansa flight to Munich, there was such a sound-and-light show as our little Airbus weaved in and out of the cumulonimbus clouds that again it was a miracle that the plane managed to stay aloft. At the time I questioned on this very page whether pilots were perhaps not putting too much faith in technology and airlines putting too much pressure on pilots.The “fright flights” of last summer still have me so rattled that I found myself obsessively watching the weather forecast for Berlin while I prepared to give a speech in Oslo. With severe thunderstorms forecast for most of northern Germany in the late afternoon, I decided to swap my Lufthansa connection through Frankfurt for an earlier direct flight on Air Berlin. On boarding I checked the forecast with the captain, who said we should beat the storms – but as we started our descent the chief flight attendant came out of the cockpit and warned me it was going to be a tricky approach. She wasn’t wrong: for a full 15 minutes that seemed like 15 hours we slalomed around dark menacing clouds, blasts of rain, angry winds and flashes of lightning. We started being hit by high winds but, just beyond the threshold at Tegel, the pilot seemed to take full control and we made a gentle landing.At the gate I thanked him for the smooth landing and he explained that while they never take risks, he had also taken on more fuel than normal in case of diversions due to the weather across Germany. I had found comfort in his caring and confident words – until last Monday.Since pulling myself away from France24, I’ve spent a lot of time reading interviews, e-mailing pilots and aviation industry contacts and researching the topic of flying in dangerous weather conditions. Of course, it’s not impossible that flight 447 could have been the victim of terrorism or of some random fault in the aircraft’s systems; and, oddly, though my thoughts and prayers will be with the missing passengers and their relatives, there’s a chance that I’ll find comfort in those findings.If, however, it turns out to be a perfect storm that brought down the Air France flight, I’ll be curious to see how the industry reacts. Will airlines give storms a wider berth than the 20 or so kilometers that are recommended? Or will it be business as usual, with everyone in the cockpit crossing fingers and hoping to ride out the “turbulence”?Airlines have their own operating procedures and the final call will, ultimately, rest with the captain in command of the aircraft – so I’ve been wondering what the prevailing cockpit culture is at Air France (and others) regarding thunderstorms? After the crash of an Airbus A340 at Toronto during a thunderstorm in the summer of 2005 (there were no fatalities but the aircraft was destroyed by fire), the investigators’ conclusions made for sobering reading about flying in challenging weather conditions.If it turns out that Air France flight 447 crashed because the crew took the aircraft through a storm that should have been avoided, then France’s national carrier will have more than a PR exercise to contend with – it will have to rebuild its reputation and training culture from the tarmac up.Tyler Brûlé is editor-in-chief of Monocle

319;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-04-23T21:09:25Z;US shares struggle on economic news;;US stocks struggled for direction before ending higher on Thursday as investors reacted to quarterly earnings reports from companies including Apple and United Parcel Service and digested more disappointing economic news.UPS reported quarterly profits that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package delivery group.Its quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, from $906m a year earlier to $401m. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $53.33. Shares in its main competitor, FedEx, which like UPS has been on a cost-cutting drive, rose 3.4 per cent to $55.04.In contrast, Apple said after the market closed on Wednesday that its profit had risen 15 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.33 a share, compared with forecasts of $1.08. Its shares closed 3.2 per cent higher at $125.40 in spite of a relatively downbeat forecast for the current quarter, with revenues estimated at $7.7bn-$7.9bn and earnings at $0.95-$1 a share.The previous session had ended lower with leading indices giving up an earlier rally, leaving some analysts to express doubt about the sustainability of the rebound. A late sell-off in the financial sector had erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher at 851.92 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,652.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7.957.06 points.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was down 2.5 per cent at 37.15 and remains significantly below highs of approaching 90 reached last year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Disappointing economic news also weighed on stocks with a weekly report on jobless claims saying the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending April 18 rose by 27,000 to a higher than expected 640,000, while continuing claims crept up again to a new record high.The pace of sales of existing homes in the US fell 3 per cent in March to a sharply lower-than-expected 4.57m unit annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.Shares ended higher led by late gains for banks and companies involved in the credit card business. These moved higher after senior executives from the industry met with President Barack Obama. Representatives from banks including Wells Fargo, Visa, JPMorgan, MasterCard and Visa, were among those at the meetings. Wells Fargo shares rose 10.5 per cent to $20.09 while Capital One shares rose 17.7 per cent to $16.93.The earnings season is in full swing with many reports issued before the bell on Thursday and several more due after the close. Before the open, Hershey and Raytheon posted better-than-expected results. Shares in Hershey rose 3.9 per cent to $37.45 while Raytheon rose 5.9 per cent to $43.72.Fifth Third Bancorp shares rose 3.5 per cent to $3.82 after it also beat analyst expectations, posting a smaller than expected loss.Boutique investment bank KBW swung to a first-quarter profit on lower costs that offset declines in commissions and investment-banking revenue.Shares in the company advanced 2.6 per cent to $24.87.SunTrust Banks shares fell 3.3 per cent to $14.89 after it swung to a $714.8m first-quarter loss, hurt by real-estate and mortgage investments and ”recession-related costs” as it boosted reserves for bad loans. PNC Financial Services’ shares rose 7.5 per cent to $40.93 as first-quarter profits came in well ahead of expectations. Microsoft, American Express and Amgen were due to report after the closing bell last night. Microsoft shares moved 1.2 per cent lower to $18.54.The exchange sector was in focus as profits at the CME Group operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008.But in spite of this, CME shares rose 9.4 per cent, to $239 leading other exchanges groups higher.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 13.7 per cent at $23.37 while Nasdaq OMXshares rose 3.3 per cent.
320;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-04-23T13:45:14Z;UPS profits tumble by 56%;;United Parcel Service reported on Thursday a quarterly profit that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package-delivery company.UPS’s quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, dropping to $401m in the first quarter of 2009 from $906m a year earlier. Revenues fell 13.7 per cent to $10.9bn from $12.7bn a year before.Delivery companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have been under severe pressure during the economic downturn as businesses and consumers send fewer packages. Diluted earnings per share at FedEx, which reported its prior quarters results last month, fell to 31 cents, compared with $1.26 for the same quarter a year earlier. And decreases in demand forced DHL out of the US domestic market at the end of January.Adjusted earnings per share were 52 cents, missing analysts’ estimates of 56 cents a share. Including a non-cash charge related to the earlier than expected retirement of aging aircraft, diluted earnings per share were 40 cents.The company saw broad losses across its domestic and international businesses. Even after rival DHL left the US domestic market, volumes declined 4.3 per cent. During its conference call with analysts the company said it expected to continue to look for opportunities from DHL’s exit from the market.New investments in China, Europe and Puerto Rico helped offset declines in international volume, which fell 1 per cent.The company saw no quick turn around, forecasting that earnings per diluted share would fall in a range of 45 cents to 55 cents in the second quarter. The company expects that revenues in all markets, except for China and Poland, will fall over the next quarter.”Economic indicators tell us recovery in the US might begin late this year, but more likely not until 2010,” said Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer. ”So we expect the second quarter will be another difficult one.”UPS, along with rival FedEx, have both unveiled a series of cost-cutting measures to combat the downturn in their revenues. UPS has cut 10,000 employees from its US workforce and operating expenses, excluding fuel, have been slashed by 10 per cent.”As economic activity deteriorated throughout the world during the quarter, we managed costs while maintaining our excellent service to our customers,” said Scott Davis, UPS chief executive .
321;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-04-13T18:17:27Z;Trucker hopes to back pensions with property;;"YRC Worldwide, the biggest trucking company in the US, is negotiating with its unions to allow it to suspend cash payments to its defined-benefit pension plan and
to pledge real estate as collateral instead.It would be the first major US company to use its real estate to help meet its pension obligations. The talks are also a strong sign that corporate payments to defined benefit plans, usually considered sacrosanct, could be reduced or suspended as a result of the
economic downturn.The largest corporate pension plans, which provide employees with a defined benefit on retirement, have lost more than $330bn since January 2008, leaving companies under pressure to make up the shortfall, according to Milliman, a consulting firm.Companies are struggling to make payments to the plans while their profits are plummeting. YRC said it had to pay $34m to $45m a month to its plan, while its freight volumes had fallen by 29 per cent in the latest quarter compared with a year ago.It said it was finalising talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters “to provide certain of the company’s real estate as collateral to its …defined benefit plans in lieu of making payments for certain to-be-agreed-upon months”. The Teamsters declined to comment.More than a third of US companies have cut back or eliminated matching payments to employees’ defined-contribution pension plans since January 2008, according to Spectrem Group, a research firm.Defined contribution plans, called 401(k)s after the section of the tax act which governs them, require employees to pay into their own plans, with their company typically matching contributions up to a certain level. Saks, General Motors, Coca-Cola Bottling, FedEx, Motorola and Sprint Nextel are among the companies which have suspended such contributions in recent months.George Halper, the president of Spectrem, said: “This …raises questions about the ability of the current generation of working Americans to adequately fund their retirements.”Among employees who have 401(k) plans, 20 per cent have reduced their contributions, and more say they intend to over the next 12 months, said Spectrem.The trend has in recent weeks spread to the UK, where Aon became the first large UK company to cut payments to its workers’ defined contribution plan."

323;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-03-25T00:13:05Z;Republican rules out support for union reform;;Trade union hopes for a decisive legislative victory in the first few months of the Obama administration were dealt a blow on Tuesday when an important Republican came out against a proposal to weaken secret ballot rules.Advocates of the Employee Free Choice Act, which would remove the requirement for an anonymous vote on whether a company’s workforce should unionise, had hoped for the support of Arlen Specter, a centrist Republican, who has been previously sympathetic.Employers’ groups have argued workers would be intimidated by labour leaders if votes were held in the open and decided by a simple majority signing a card.The AFL-CIO union federation argues the so-called “card check” law is needed and accuses some companies of pressing staff not to support foundation of a union.A marketing war has erupted between unions and employers’ groups, both sides buying hours of television adverts. Wal-Mart, the country’s biggest retailer, was downgraded by Citigroup on the mere prospect of the bill becoming law, with the broker warning of a steep rise in costs. “The …recession makes this a particularly bad time,” said Mr Specter on Tuesday. He faced critics in his own party and the prospect of a strong rival from his party for his Pennsylvania seat at mid-term elections next year.His decision was a “close call” and card check “the most heavily lobbied issue I can recall”. Mr Specter suggested legislation to prevent intimidation by employers during union elections was a possibility but the secret ballot must be maintained.Without his support, the Democrats who drew up the bill may lack votes necessary to pass it. But Harry Reid, Democratic leader in the Senate, said other Republicans may support it: “Anyone [who] thinks they’re burying card check because of Specter’s statement in an effort to avoid a primary in Pennsylvania should not think that legislation is going to go away.”In January, FedEx ordered 30 Boeing 777s contingent on another piece of union friendly legislation failing. A provision in a House bill to set funding for the Federal Aviation Administration would, if passed, free workers at FedEx’s express-deliver business to organise at local level.

324;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-03-19T20:54:57Z;Wall St retreats on stimulus scepticism;;"US stocks fell on Thursday as investors continued to react to the Federal Reserve’s bold plan to buy up assets in order the stimulate the economy.Financials fell steeply, outweighing rises in materials and energy stocks, as investors bet the plan would not be as beneficial for banks as hoped, but would trigger a rise in commodity prices and a fall in the dollar.Banking stocks had surged on Wednesday as investors bet their balance sheets would be cleared of distressed assets. But on Thursday, many were more sceptical of the move and the financial sector fell below where it had been before the Fed’s announcement.They had earlier risen as figures showed that first-time unemployment claims fell to 646,000 from 658,000 last week, against consensus estimates of 655,000.But the fallout from the Fed plan soon started to dominate investors’ thinking once more, and banks were further weighed down that a new 90 per cent tax rate on bonuses for high earning bankers at companies which had taken over $5bn from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp) could trigger an exodus of talent.JPMorgan closed 8 per cent down at $24.95, Morgan Stanley fell 13 per cent to $21.04 and Goldman Sachs dropped 5.7 per cent to $99.30.Credit card companies were also big fallers after Discover announced an operating loss of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. The company said it would cut its dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.02, and its shares lost 13.3 per cent to $6.28. American Express also fell, dropping 7.2 per cent to $13.07, while Capital One gave up 13.6 per cent to $12.30.Shares in Citigroup, which have more than tripled in the past two weeks, were particularly volatile, as the company announced it had begun plans to swap $5.3bn worth of preference shares into common stock. After an initial rise of more than
11 per cent, they slumped 15.6 per cent to $2.60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 784.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 7,400.8 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,483.48.“The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MFGlobal. “This is suppressing the price of equities.”Others warned that the Fed’s actions could only be judged on a more long-term view however.“We need to let the Fed’s efforts begin to work,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “They will help clear the balance sheets of good banks, but that will take time.”The oil price rose sharply on Thursday to its highest level this year, which boosted the price of energy stocks. Chevron gained 0.8 per cent to $67.13.Materials also gained on hopes that a weaker dollar would boost demand for US goods from overseas buyers.Alcoa the largest US aluminium producer, lifted 16.8 per cent to $6.40, bolstered also when JPMorgan raised its estimates of the company’s earnings for 2009 and 2010.The steel sector was another strong performer. Nucor gained 7.2 per cent to $38.08, US Steel picked up 9.2 per cent to $20.94 and AK Steel rose 8.8 per cent to $7.55. AK Steel was also helped by news of a $5bn Treasury bail-out for car parts makers, which lifted the big carmakers. GM one of AK’s biggest customers, rose 8.7 per cent to $2.87.There was further good news for the technology sector, as Oracle announced better profits than expected and said it would pay its first quarterly dividend. Its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $17.37.General Electric fell however after it told investors it was likely to see a smaller profit in its financial arm than previously predicted as the economy had worsened faster than expected. Rapidly rising job losses had hit the consumer-credit business, executives said, and the company’s shares lost 1.8 per cent to $10.13.Earnings for FedEx, the delivery company, missed analysts’ estimates but its shares rose 4.8 per cent to $45.10 after executives said they did not expect a further significant deterioration in the economy this year."
325;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx to cut costs by $1bn;;FedEx on Thursday announced its second $1bn cost-cutting plan in two years after its quarterly profits plunged 75 per cent, far below Wall Street’s expectations.The package delivery company said the worsening global economy was forcing it to cut more jobs and pay, and reduce working hours as profits in the three months to the end of February plunged to $97m or 31 cents per share, from $393m or $1.26 per share in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had forecasted about 48 cents per share.“Our financial performance was sharply lower during the quarter due to the global recession,” said Fred Smith, FedEx chairman, president and chief executive. “While we are gaining market share in all of our transportation segments, the downturn in our industry and the severity and expected duration of the recession require that we take additional actions.”FedEx has already slashed salaries for 36,000 of its 290,000 employees by up to 20 per cent. It said it would extend those pay cuts to include employees not based in the US, as well as cutting more jobs and working hours, reducing network capacity and making other spending cutbacks. The company said the actions would help it to reduce expenses by $1bn in fiscal 2010, which begins in June, up from its previous target of $600m of savings for the year. FedEx cut $1bn in costs last year, as the company responded to the deteriorating economy.“Our goal when we implemented compensation reductions in January for US salaried personnel was to both protect our business and minimise the loss of jobs,” said Mr Smith. “With industrial production and global trade trends worsening since last quarter, we are applying these additional measures to continue to secure as many of our jobs as possible during this downturn.”The company said it expected profits of 45 cents-70 cents per share in the next three months, excluding extraordinary charges. FedEx said it would take a charge of approximately $100m next quarter to pay for the cost-cutting plan.Analysts at Robert W. Baird this week slashed their price target on FedEx by 37 per cent to $41 citing “a deteriorating earnings environment, incremental pension expense and deteriorating cash flows”. They noted that, in Thursday’s results, FedEx benefited by 40 cents-50 cents per share from from falling fuel prices but said that benefit would end in the next quarter.
326;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-03-12T20:20:38Z;A need to reconnect;Crisis of the most basic corporate faiths;In different times, the offer from the check-in attendant would have been accepted with alacrity. But in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, with an angry public, populist politicians and an aggressive press baying for a crackdown on Wall Street’s “excesses”, the senior banker paused for thought when he heard those usually welcome airline words: “Sir, you have been upgraded to first class. Please follow me.”Finally replying, “I am fine in coach, thank you”, he gave up the better seat and opened another chink in the armour of beliefs and practices that corporate America had built and spread around the world over decades.Once hailed as examples of an American dream that rewarded success with large pay cheques, lavish perks and popular admiration, executives and their companies have been caught in the grip of a storm that will revolutionise business. The deep freeze of capital markets, the implosion of financial groups and the resulting rise in governments’ sway over the private sector have called into question some of the foundations of Anglo-Saxon capitalism.Long-held tenets of corporate faith – the pursuit of shareholder value, the use of stock options to motivate employees and a light regulatory touch allied with board oversight of management – are being blamed for the turmoil and look likely to be overhauled. “We are in uncharted waters,” says Jack Welch, the former General Electric boss who embodied an era when the untrammelled interplay of market forces, domineering chief executives and the laser-like focus on quarterly earnings rises reigned supreme.If, as it has become painfully apparent, the value system and operating principles that informed the corporate psyche since at least the end of the cold war were found wanting, what should replace them?Business leaders are by instinct glass-half-full type of people but, this time, few believe their companies’ future lies in their own hands. The financial sector’s role in causing the shocks that have jolted the world economy has had a big side-effect: the debate on the future of corporate governance is no longer confined to the boardroom. Stakeholders ranging from trade unions to activist investors and government itself are claiming the right to draw the boundaries of a new corporate order. In the words of one union leader: “The time for corporate dictatorships is over. This is our time.”Such pressure, combined with an internal reassessment of companies’ priorities precipitated by the crisis, is starting to crumble one of the cornerstones of the previous corporate edifice: the cult of shareholder value.Since Mr Welch made the concept famous in a speech at New York’s Pierre Hotel in 1981, the short-term goal of rewarding shareholders by increasing profits and dividends every quarter has become a mantra for companies around the world. With the share price of GE and other shareholder-focused companies soaring, executives from all over the world took up the credo Alfred Rappaport spelt out in his 1986 book, Creating Shareholder Value: “The ultimate test of corporate strategy, the only reliable measure, is whether it creates economic value for shareholders.”Fund managers encouraged this attitude, as pressure from their own quarterly reviews addicted them to the periodic improvements in earnings and stock prices promised by the prophets of shareholder value.Today, that focus on the here and now is seen as a root cause of the world’s economic predicament. “Immediate shareholder value maximisation, by itself, was always too short-term in nature,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale School of Management. “It created a fleeting illusion of value creation by emphasising immediate goals over long-term strategies.” Even Mr Welch argues that focusing solely on quarterly profit increases was “ the dumbest idea in the world”. “Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy,” he says. “Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.”Like many other business figures, Mr Welch wants the task of charting a new course away from short-termism to fall to directors and executives. But unions, regulators and government authorities argue that a drive for change led by the same corporate elite that helped bring about the turmoil would not remove the contradictions that undermined the previous regime. “We don’t feel companies should be run in the interest of short-term investors and executives who are hell-bent on making a killing regardless of the risks and leave taxpayers and real long-term holders to pick up the pieces,” says Damon Silvers at the AFL-CIO, the US union federation.Unions and “socially responsible” investors argue that the focus on short-term profits should be replaced not just by long-term strategic thinking but also by attention to issues such as the environment and the needs of customers and suppliers. The corporate social responsibility movement, on the rise before the crisis, is likely to receive fresh impetus from an investor recognition that companies’ narrow search for profits was not always the best strategy.Many business leaders object to what they regard as the growing encroachment by the state and other interest groups on their ability to run the company. “If there is a danger in the current situation, it is that we don’t know how to exit from this little adventure in socialism so that the private sector can do what it does best – which is to innovate, grow and create job,” says John Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, the lobby group for some of America’s largest companies.But the arrival of President Barack Obama at the White House on the heels of a Democratic majority in Congress has, coupled with increased public antipathy towards plutocrats, already resulted in big wins for unions and other campaigners. Reforms that activist investors had demanded for years without much success, such as an (albeit non-binding) annual vote on executive pay, have already been approved by Congress. Others such as “proxy access” – the right for shareholders to nominate candidates to the board and vote down underperforming directors – are on the way, while the bonus caps imposed on the banks that took government funds have sent chills down many an executive spine.These moves give campaigners new ammunition in the first big battle to reshape the rules of the business game: executive compensation. The failure of Wall Street’s high-risk, high-reward model is set to bring about change on two main fronts: top management’s pay and the use of stock options.After years of soaring pay, business chieftains in America can expect to reap relatively meagre rewards in the coming years. As the downturn moved from Wall Street to Main Street, even companies that have not received federal aid, such as GE, FedEx and Motorola, have joined those on government life support in slashing top executives’ compensation.Many are also re-examining the gap in pay between executives and other employees. In America, the discrepancy between the compensation of those at the top of the corporate tree and those further down the trunk has grown steadily for decades, reaching an estimated 275 times the average in 2007 and contributing to rising wealth inequality in the country.A significant portion of the blame for rocketing executive remuneration and managers’ obsession with short-term goals is being pinned on stock options and other forms of incentive pay. Hitherto praised as a tool to align executive compensation with shareholders’ gains, options have been increasingly discredited for rewarding executives for stock market rises that have nothing to do with them. In banking, end-of-year awards of options and stock had the added drawback of remunerating staff well before the company or its shareholders could find out whether their bets had paid off.Several banks have announced plans to claw back future bonuses from employees whose deals sour in later years. But the fallout from what one executive calls “an era of rewarding ourselves with other people’s money” will be felt beyond the financial sector. Regulators and investors look certain to strengthen the link between pay and long-term performance by introducing measures such as a ban on the sale of shares and options until after retirement, or even a straight pay cap.Fred Smith, the founder and chief executive of FedEx, spoke for many corporate leaders in December when he predicted: “Some of the fantastic outsized gains that were offensive to people will be increasingly less likely. At board level …things will not be looked at as costless to the shareholders.”Boards themselves will be in the line of fire. The losses suffered by financial groups have exposed the belief that directors were the knowledgable guardians of shareholders’ interests as a fallacy – one that will not be lost on angry investors and fee-hungry lawyers. As a result, the composition of boards is likely to change dramatically.Russell Reynolds, the doyen of American headhunters, says directors will have to be both more knowledgeable and more selfless. “Gone are the days when directors played a good game of golf but did not understand the risk-reward ratio of the business,” he says. “And yet the current environment calls for people who can devote time to the business for relatively little pay. It is almost a charitable act.”Investors such as Bob Pozen, who runs MFS Investment Management, believe that listed companies’ boards should become more like their private equity-owned rivals: smaller, nimbler and more competent. “The directors on those boards have the expertise, the time and the incentive to fully understand the company’s issues,” he says.Jeffrey Immelt, who has presided over a fall of about three-quarters in the price of GE’s shares since succeeding Mr Welch in 2001 and this week saw the removal of its triple A credit rating by Standard & Poor’s, recently lamented: “Anybody could run a business in the 1990s. A dog could have run a business.”Unfortunately for Mr Immelt and his contemporaries, these are not the 1990s and nor are they like the several years that followed. As business structures that were thought to be indestructible collapse in the meltdown, the corporate sector will have to give up a lot more than first-class seats.Additional reporting by Justin Baer
327;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-03-10T23:34:10Z;US companies pull out of retirement contributions;;"A wave of US companies are suspending payments to their staff 401(k) retirement plans in a bid to cut costs amid the economic downturn.Saks, General Motors, newspaper group McClatchy, clothing company J.Crew, FedEx, UPS, Coca-Cola Bottling, Reader’s Digest, Motorola, Regions Financial and Sprint Nextel are among the growing list of companies which have suspended contributions in recent months.Even the AARP, the influential advocacy group formerly known as the American Association for Retired Persons, will suspend contributions to its staff 401(k) plan from March 22 for the rest of the year.The growing number of suspensions appears to strike a blow against the viability of 401(k) plans, which were introduced 30 years ago as the main way that Americans should save for retirement, replacing defined benefit pension plans. Companies typically offered to match employee contributions up to 5 per cent of annual salary.The average 401(k) plan at the end of 2007 held about $65,000, but half of them held less than $19,000, according to a trade group, the Investment Companies Institute. They would hold much less today because of stock market falls. The suspensions mean that individuals can continue to contribute to their plans, but their companies will not.Adam Sohn, a spokesman for AARP, said his organisation, which has 40m members aged 50 and over, had fully matched staff contributions up to 3 per cent of annual salary.“We have taken a temporary suspension for the remainder of the year to help with cost containment measures,” he said. The AARP, whose revenue comes in part from investment income, also offers its 2,400 staff a defined benefit pension plan.In recent months, companies have also become increasingly less likely to enrol new workers automatically in their 401(k) plan, citing the costs as the main
reason, according to a study by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consultancy.“The continued bleak economic outlook is forcing many companies to make difficult decisions with respect to their retirement benefits,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research, said in the study.Hewitt estimated that only 5 per cent of large companies would halt 401(k) contributions in 2009, but that could rise to more than 10 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months."
328;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-02-26T20:32:43Z;Deutsche Post disappoints;;"Now does not look a good time for the British government to proceed with politically touchy plans to sell 30 per cent of Royal Mail. Echoing comments last week from the Netherlands’ TNT – seen as a potential Royal Mail buyer – that 2009 is proving grim for the logistics industry, Deutsche Post reported a fourth-quarter net loss and hacked its dividend by a third.With volumes falling, Europe’s largest postal operator politely declined to give specific 2009 guidance, except to say that it expected underlying earnings to fall. Deutsche Post’s shares, down 20 per cent in the previous two weeks, fell another 6 per cent yesterday.The loss related to the group’s partial strategic retreat from its unprofitable US express business. But the real shock was the dividend cut from €0.90 to €0.60, in spite of hints from senior managers that it was probably safe. Admittedly, the postal group is paying this from reserves. But it closed the sale of 22.9 per cent of Deutsche Postbank to Deutsche Bank on Wednesday: having received total cash of €4.2bn, it is virtually debt-free. Reducing the dividend hardly signals underlying confidence.Look at the business environment, however, and a confidence crisis is understandable. Sharp demand falls in the fourth quarter have deepened, hitting all regions and most sectors, Deutsche Post said. It expects volumes to decline through the first half and perhaps beyond. Most worrying are shrinking sales in the cash-generative core mail division, hit by falling demand for direct marketing as businesses slash budgets. At 7.9 times this year’s forecast earnings, Deutsche Post’s multiple is close to TNT’s. Both are at sizeable discounts to UPS and FedEx, boosted by hopes of an earlier US recovery. Given the uncertain global outlook, the UK government should take heed of European caution before banking on the postal service to ring up even half-decent privatisation receipts.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

329;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-02-10T01:13:05Z;Return of bill heightens union threat to FedEx;;"FedEx this week faces the return of a bill that could escalate a lobbying war with organised labour and rival United Parcel Service.US congressmen plan to reintroduce legislation this week that would authorise funding for the country’s aviation regulator, containing a provision that targets only one company, FedEx, and its ability to keep more of its express delivery employees from organising.If the bill succeeds, the provision would strip the company’s express delivery division of its rights to bargain under the Railway Labor Act, meaning the company could no longer block FedEx Express workers from organising at a local level.Such a reversal would leave the business more susceptible to strikes and could drive up labour costs.FedEx argues that local labour actions could disrupt its air and ground delivery network and, in turn, the country’s economy.United Parcel Service, founded as a ground-based courier, has not enjoyed the same treatment as FedEx, because the original exemption covers railways and airlines. FedEx was founded as an airline.UPS has been pushing for the exemption to be scrapped for many years.A similar bill passed the US House in 2007 but failed to come before a vote in the Senate, leading Congress to extend the life of an existing Federal Aviation Authority Reauthorisation law, which sets policy on FAA funds and how the agency may tax air carriers for two years.The current extension expires at the end of March.Jim Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who chairs the House transportation and infrastructure committee, will unveil the bill before Wednesday’s scheduled hearing, a committee spokesman said.Some analysts and investors predict that the FedEx provision stands a better chance of surviving during the current Congress, and with a Democrat in the White House.“With the exception of the pilots’ union, FedEx has been very successful at holding off unions,” Tom Wadewitz, a JPMorgan Chase analyst, wrote in a November note to clients.“We believe the risk of unionisation would increase significantly if FedEx Express was moved out of [the Railway Labour Act]”.FedEx has argued that the express business fits the description of the kind of integrated transportation system Congress sought to protect from disruption, and points to a US circuit court decision that supports its case.“It is extremely bad public policy,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in December.“FedEx Express has been a Railway Labor Act carrier since its inception. It was one of the key elements in the formation of the company.“We would hope that that provision would not see the light of day.”●
FedEx said on Monday it would cut about 900 jobs at 130 facilities, citing unprecedented economic conditions and aggressive pricing by carriers."
330;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-02-03T18:06:13Z;UPS offers gloomy outlook;;United Parcel Service, the world’s largest parcel delivery company, missed Wall Street’s quarterly profits estimates on Tuesday and gave investors little reason to expect a recovery this year.“The severe decline in economic activity around the world resulted in sharply lower package and freight volumes for UPS,” Scott Davis, chief executive, said. “Consequently, we’re making the tough decisions necessary to adapt our enterprise to today’s realities.”The company also cast doubt on striking an accord to airlift packages within the US for Deutsche Post’s DHL, which is withdrawing from the domestic market to cut losses.“We’re finding it increasingly difficult to reach an agreement,” Kurt Kuehn, finance chief, told the Financial Times.While its bleak outlook echoed a forecast by rival FedEx, which last month called the downturn “the worst economic conditions in the company’s 35-year operating history”, UPS also predicted the market would stabilise as the year progressed.The company’s shares jumped 6.3 per cent to $45.08 in midday trading on Tuesday.UPS will look to offset the slowdown by consolidating air and package-handling operations, freezing managers’ salaries and suspending matching contributions to employees’ retirement-savings accounts. The efforts will shed more than $500m in annual costs, Mr Kuehn said. The company has also trimmed capital expenses by $400m.UPS reported net income of $254m, or 25 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with a net loss of $2.63bn, or $2.52, for the same period a year ago, when the company took a $6.1bn charge to withdraw some employees from a pension plan following its new contract with the main union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Excluding one-time charges in the most-recent quarter, UPS’s profit fell to $829m, or 83 cents a share, missing Wall Street’s average estimate.Revenue fell 5.2 per cent to $12.7bn from $13.4bn. US package volume, which usually tracks at or slightly above growth in the nation’s gross domestic product, slipped 4.4 per cent during the quarter.The Atlanta-based company predicted it would earn 52-68 cents a share in the first quarter – also less than analysts’ expectations, while declining to offer a forecast for the full year.“Since economists do not expect any meaningful recovery until 2010, earnings in 2009 will suffer,” Mr Kuehn said in a statement. “Lower volume levels and reductions in package weight will put further pressure on margins. We anticipate the first quarter will be weak, with slight improvements later in the year.”DHL’s decision to abandon the US market has complicated the company’s discussions with UPS, which had planned to ferry packages between US cities by aeroplane. While both sides agreed to narrow the scope of the venture to reflect DHL’s reduced presence, they have failed to reach an agreement.
331;FDX;Fedex Corp;2009-01-30T23:31:22Z;Super Bowl advertisers toe Obama line;;Advertisers in Sunday’s Super Bowl game are trying to embrace Barack Obama’s message of self-restraint, even as they spend $100,000 a second for commercials in the biggest US televised event of the year.Nearly 100m Americans are expected to watch the annual ritual marking the end of the American football season. Viewers – from Detroit assembly line workers to Wall Street investment bankers – have been tackled, beaten and bruised by the global economic crisis since last year’s game but they have also watched history made as the US elected its first black president on a platform of hope and ­responsibility.“These difficult times call for honesty and simplicity,” said Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer for Coca-Cola North America. PepsiCo and Coke are both running campaigns embracing “optimistic” and “positive” messages, which Pepsi has deliberately tied in to Mr Obama’s inauguration.Andrew Swinand, president of Starcom MediaVest, said the tone of his clients’ messages had changed since the recession bit. “I see the end of an age of excess and the beginning of an age of simplicity,” he said. “You no longer want the biggest car on the street. Messages of hope and messages of value are more ­relevant.”Audi, which last year touted its $114,000 R8 sports car, has bought a 60-second spot to advertise the A6 saloon car that costs about half the price.Advertisers including Monster.com, Anheuser-Busch and General Electric are paying broadcaster NBC 11 per cent more than last year, or $3m per 30 seconds, to appear in the only show whose commercials are as heavily scrutinised as the action itself. Detroit carmakers have dropped out and FedEx is not returning, but DreamWorks Animation and PepsiCo plan to make a splash with 60-second 3D spots that require the use of special glasses.Getting the tone right is key, marketers say. To the freshly unemployed, lavish marketing spending could come over as distasteful, especially for advertisers such as CareerBuilder.com, a website for jobseekers, which announced 300 job cuts last month.“When you’re cutting salaries and laying people off, it’s hard to explain why you’re buying a Super Bowl spot,” said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University. Richard Castellini, chief marketing officer at CareerBuilder, said: “It is the one time a year when you truly meet a mass audience …and they go to the office the next day and say: ‘Hey, did you see that commercial?’”Scott Keogh, Audi of America’s head of marketing, noted that last year Audi car dealers reported a surge of interest from buyers after its Super Bowl advert.“The dealers right now are at the front lines of the credit issues and they asked us almost immediately after the Super Bowl if we were returning.”One staple of Super Bowl marketing, humour, is making a comeback.“Last year, I think we really tried to shake people up and get them out of a funk,” Mr Castellini said. “This year we’re doing it in a lighter tone …People don’t want to go to a Super Bowl and have depressing overtones. They still want to have fun.”Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
332;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-12-21T19:07:11Z;US corporate tax policy is in need of reform;;"It is unfortunate that the US, which has led the capitalist world for so long, is woefully uncompetitive in corporate tax policy. We have the second highest corporate tax rate among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and many other tax policies that make it difficult for US companies to compete. Studies such as one done by William C. Randolph of the CBO in 2006 have estimated that 70 per cent of corporate taxes are ultimately borne by the American workforce.Our tax system is particularly onerous for asset-intensive, industrial businesses such as manufacturers and transport companies. For example, Caterpillar, Boeing, FedEx, commercial airlines and carmakers produce goods and services and provide jobs for millions. But to maintain or increase jobs and compete globally, these companies must be able earn an acceptable return on capital expenditure.How can we make US companies more competitive and increase their ability to offer good jobs? Two things: accelerate the expensing of capital investment; and reduce the corporate income tax rate.Let us permit US companies to write off all their capital expenditures when they make them, as opposed to the current system of long-term depreciation. Why? Experts such as Ernie Christian and Gary Robbins have said that, over time, every dollar of tax cuts for expensing adds about nine dollars of gross domestic product growth. Even without counting the benefits to the economy of new jobs, it is a relatively cheap option for the US Treasury, since the only cost to the government is the time value of money.How does this affect American jobs? Let me use an example from FedEx. If we buy a 777 aircraft from Boeing, under the current tax code, we generally write that asset off over seven years for tax purposes. But buying a $150m aircraft is a big risk because you do not know what the market is going to be like when that aircraft is delivered some four years after the order. The best way to mitigate the risk is to allow the company to get that money back quicker. It reduces risk and encourages investment more quickly in equipment, facilities and jobs.While faster capital expensing is smart tax policy in any case, it is particularly so in times of economic downturn such as the present.The US also needs to lower its corporate income tax rate. At 39 per cent, it is the second highest in the OECD, behind Japan. The rates of some of our trading partners are much lower – Germany 30 per cent, China 25 per cent, the UK 28 per cent and the Netherlands 26 per cent.The benefits of multinational trade to the US are well known: more jobs, national wealth, consumer choice, all of which contribute to a better standard of living. Yet tax policy damages our economy. First, we are a less attractive place for foreign companies to do business. Second, we make it harder for US companies to compete with foreign companies outside the US.Some have questioned why it is important that US companies expand their global businesses. FedEx is a great example because our business is dependent on having a global network. A customer who needs to move inventory from India to Germany will not use FedEx for any of its business if our network does not include those countries. (It does!) More robust growth in our business portends, of course, greater growth in jobs, both in the US and around the world.But if we must pay 39 cents of every dollar of what we make in corporate income taxes while foreign competitors pay lower (often much lower) amounts, there is no question but that our competitors will have more earnings to invest in new capital projects and jobs.The US is seriously out of touch with the rest of the world in corporate income tax policy. We must reduce our federal rate by at least 10 percentage points and the states should follow suit. Until we do that, we will continue to fall behind simply because we are standing still.While the political debate has centred on Wall Street and Main Street or government infrastructure initiatives, I believe expensing capital and lowering corporate tax rates would quickly stimulate additional economic activity.The beneficial impact on our economy and longer-term federal tax receipts would far outweigh the relatively small near-term increase in the deficit, particularly when compared with other actions such as consumer rebates and/or increased government spending.The writer is chairman, president and chief executive of FedEx"
333;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-12-18T21:50:25Z;Wall St slips lower on struggling oil stocks;;General Electric sparked a sharp afternoon sell-off on Thursday as Standard & Poor’s negative credit rating outlook led investors to question which other companies could be vulnerable.Several big financial and industrial names came under heavy selling pressure in the wake of the move, which extended a commodities-led retreat.“If a titan like GE is susceptible in the current environment, it makes you wonder who else is,” said Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments.Shares in GE, one of the few companies in the world to retain a triple A credit rating, fell 8.2 per cent to $15.96.S&P, the credit rating agency, affirmed the rating but said there was a one in three chance it could cut it in the next two years.The move helped drag the benchmark S&P 500 index back beneath its 50 day moving average, a key technical level that was surpassed earlier in the week for the first time since shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The S&P finished down 2.1 per cent to 885.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.5 per cent to 8,604.99 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.7 per cent to 1,552.37.The energy sector led the declines as crude oil fell below $36 a barrel for the first time since July 2004 in spite of the Opec oil cartel’s record 2.2m barrel-a-day production cut.Massey Energy and National Oilwell Varco were among the biggest losers, off 11.4 per cent to $13.83 and 12.4 per cent to $22.86, respectively.Materials also staged a retreat as base metals fell. ArcelorMittal shed 4.7 per cent to $25.04 after Barclays downgraded its view of the stock to “equal weight”.“In our bear case scenario, we note the possibility that ArcelorMittal violates its debt covenant,” said Dana Guido, Barcalys analyst. “We stress that we find it highly unlikely that ArcelorMittal would actually breach its debt covenants . . . but, in our opinion, balance sheet concerns are likely to prevent significant outperformance in the months ahead.”Industrials also came under pressure from the latest profit warnings in the sector, this time from Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair. The manufacturers lost 4.7 per cent to $15.59 and 4.6 per cent to $23.75, respectively.The latter disclosed plans to cut about 1,600 jobs and close facilities as it prepares for a 15 per cent drop in profit next year.FedEx fell 2.1 per cent to $62.60 even after the delivery group disclosed second-quarter earnings that were broadly in line with expectations lowered by a profit warning last week, when the shares tumbled 16.8 per cent. The shipping company said it would cut executive salaries and freeze hiring in 2009.Among the big names to come under pressure, Caterpillar lost 5.6 per cent to $42.16 after unveiling plans to cut hundreds of workers.Semiconductors also did badly. Intellost 6.6 per cent to $14.26 after Jefferies cut its recommendation on the stock to “underperform”.Elsewhere in technology, Take-Two Interactive Software disclosed an an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned profit next year would be lower than forecast. Shares in the Grand Theft Auto video game publisher sank 26.2 per cent to $8.91.Although the leading indices posted big declines, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – fell 5 per cent to 47.34, its lowest level since October.Despite the losses elsewhere, defensive stocks held out after more largely downbeat economic data on unemployment and manufacturing provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession.Investors dipped their toes into the healthcare, utility and consumer staple sectors, all of which found positive territory.Soft drink bottlers were among the best performing defensive names after Coca-Cola Enterprisesraised its earnings outlook and unveiled a well-received restructuring plan.Its shares rallied 8.3 per cent to $11.58 while peer Pepsi Bottling Group jumped 7.7 per cent $21.01.Conagra Foods advanced 1.9 per cent to $16.55 after Citigroup named the stock as its favourite in the large cap branded food sector, highlighting that it traded at a 23 per cent discount to peers on an earnings basis.
334;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx wage cuts;;"There is good and bad news. You may keep your job but you will be paid less to do it. FedEx took pay restraint far beyond Wall Street boardrooms on Thursday, pledging salary cuts for top brass including a 20 per cent reduction for Frederick Smith, its forthright founder and chief executive. That pain will also be shared by 36,000 US salaried staff, or about 16 per cent of its US workers, who will see a permanent 5 per cent cut, loss of bonuses in 2009 and no company contributions to 401k retirement savings. Those measures, affecting managerial jobs rather than those paid by the hour, should save about $800m through to May 2010. One aim is to limit job losses.The stickiness of nominal wages during downturns has long perplexed economists. Indeed, FedEx’s rather unusual move may be helped partly by the fact it has low levels of unionised staff. Elsewhere, the usual modus operandi is to cut jobs while also freezing salaries. Those left behind are then supposedly grateful to have dodged the axe, although rising prices over time still help to reduce the real wage bill. Workers do suffer but without the psychological hit of a cut to their nominal salaries.FedEx’s approach, therefore, has a certain brute honesty about it. Of course, it relies on a dire labour market so that dissatisfied FedEx workers find few openings elsewhere (or, alternatively, on a bet that their loyalty prevails). But in an environment of falling prices, where workers’ real spending power is rising in relative terms, companies should be able to cut wages rather than slash headcount. That trade-off will become more prevalent outside head offices, with UK unions already considering pay cuts to maintain employment at JCB and Corus. Intransigent US unions take note – pay-cheque pain will not just be for fat cats in 2009.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

335;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx to cut wages in face of downturn;;FedEx on Thursday moved to slash employees’ salaries and other benefits in the face of what Fred Smith, chief executive, called “the worst economic conditions in the company’s 35-year operating history”.Betting the downturn will steepen in the next six months, FedEx plans to add an additional $200m to its cost-cutting programme in the fiscal year to the end of May and will trim expenses by $600m in 2010.The Memphis package delivery company, which has this year shed about $1bn in costs, reiterated that it expected earnings per share of $3.50 to $4.75 this year.The pay cuts affect 36,000 of FedEx’s 290,000 employees and range from 5 per cent for mid-level salaried workers up to 20 per cent for Mr Smith. The reductions do not apply to hourly workers or contractors.FedEx will also eliminate merit-based increases for US salaried employees in 2009 and suspend matching contributions to 401(k) retirement accounts for a year.The company’s capital spending budget has dropped to $2.4bn, compared with $3bn at the start of fiscal 2009.The measures came as FedEx reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $493m, which represents a 3 per cent increase from a year ago.While the company benefited from the rapid fall in aircraft fuel prices, none of FedEx’s four main businesses – express delivery, ground shipping, freight and services – escaped unscathed from the economic slowdown. Average daily package volumes fell 2 per cent during the period, while revenue climbed 1 per cent to $9.54bn.“We frankly expect the difficult global economic environment will worsen in the second half of fiscal 2009, and we obviously have reduced our earnings forecast accordingly,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.“Weak conditions in the US have spread to Europe and Asia, and ongoing weak global economic factors are expected further to reduce demand for all our transportation services in the second half.”The company predicted that the US’s gross domestic product would not begin to expand again until the final three months of 2009, as industrial production and consumer spending began to recover.“There’s a big wild card there,” Mr Smith told the Financial Times in an interview. “And that is what the new Obama administration does in terms of its stimulus package.” Mr Smith has implored the incoming US president to ensure the industrial economy is not left out of policies designed to boost growth, and has advocated lowering corporate tax rates.
336;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-12-12T21:53:08Z;Wall St losses pared on alternative auto rescue hopes;;US stocks drew another volatile week to a close on Friday with an afternoon rally after the Bush administration signalled it would use the $700bn bail-out fund created for the financial industry to avert a collapse of the car industry.General Motors, down as much as 36.7 per cent in the morning, finished 4.4 per cent lower at $3.94. Ford, which has said it has enough cash to last into 2009, closed up 4.8 per cent at $3.04.“There’s a reluctance to be short the market going into the weekend, in the expectation that a deal could be done come Monday morning,” said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global.Lear, the car parts supplier, fell as much as 24.9 per cent but later stood 2.6 per cent higher at $1.88.After a choppy session, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent at 879.73 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent higher at 8,629.68.The arrest of Bernard Madoff, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market, weighed on sentiment as investors assessed potential losses from an alleged $50bn fraud.Yet some sectors enjoyed spectacular gains. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished 2.2 per cent stronger at 1,540.72 after strong gains in technology. General Growth Properties soared 25 per cent to $1.80 and prompted a rally in real estate investment trusts after refinancing its debt. Consumer stocks found positive territory, helped by consumer confidence figures that showed an unexpected improvement this month from the lowest level in 28 years. For the week, Friday’s gains left the S&P up 0.4 per cent, the Dow down 0.1 per cent and the Nasdaq up 2.1 per cent.Commodity and infrastructure stocks provided the market with support, helped by plans from Barack Obama, US president-elect, for the biggest infrastructure investment in the US for half a century.Caterpillar and Alcoa rose 10 per cent to $42.08 and 23.7 per cent to $10.08 over the five-day period, respectively.The energy sector was the strongest performing of the week, up 8.5 per cent overall as oil prices staged a strong recovery from the previous week’s heavy losses.Meanwhile, fresh signs of stress in credit markets – investors paid for the privilege of owning US government debt for the first time in postwar history – helped drag financials lower.The sector tumbled 5.7 per cent overall as banks suffered heavy declines amid nervousness ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season.Comments on CNBC Television by Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, that the bank has endured a “terrible” November and December helped drag the shares down 7.2 per cent to $30.94.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs lost 11.9 per cent at $13.85 and 4.2 per cent to $67.74 ahead of their results expected next week.US Bancorp, whose shares have outperformed the financial sector this year as the bank appeared to have avoided serious difficulties that have afflicted peers, heightened concerns that forthcoming earnings would bring heavy writedowns.The shares lost 10.6 per cent over the week to $25.84 after the bank said it could incur $1bn in credit costs and writedowns in the fourth quarter.Credit card stocks were also sold off heavily as fears heightened over the financial health of US consumers. American Express shed 6.6 per cent to $20.34.Meanwhile, a fresh glut of downbeat corporate outlooks and analyst downgrades weighed on other sectors.In media, Gannett, owner of USA Today among other titles, sank 15.6 per cent to $7.53 after the Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Profit warnings from several companies, including FedEx and Eastman Kodak, raised concerns over the prospects for company earnings during the recession. Shares in the pair lost 16.8 per cent to $61.34 and 11.6 per cent to $6.41 over the week, respectively.
337;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-12-09T22:16:27Z;Overview: Investors focus on weakening earnings outlook;;"Global equity markets diverged on Tuesday and risk aversion increased amid year-end worries, after investors were forced to focus on the weakening earnings outlook.Disappointing news from some high-profile companies dominated markets. Sony, the Japanese electronics group, said it was cutting 16,000 jobs and curbing investments; US logistics group FedEx slashed its 2009 outlook; and Texas Instruments, the US chipmaker, issued a profit warning.Year-end funding concerns were highlighted as $30bn four-week US Treasury bills were sold at a discounted rate of 0 per cent for the first time. Implied yields for three-month bills briefly traded at negative 0.1 per cent as investors continued to seek the safety of government debt and disregard returns before the end of the year.The effective Fed funds rate was quoted at 1/16th, or 0.0625 per cent, well below its target rate of 1 per cent, as strains in the financial system intensified.Wall Street’s losses were led by financials and overall sentiment was also depressed by weak earnings news. The S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent lower.Equity markets outside the US managed a resilient performance, which helped maintain the year-end bear market rally, which had been predicted by a growing number of analysts.“A lot of the bad news is already discounted in valuations,” said Robert Buckland, global equity strategist at Citigroup.“We expect equities to stabilise, but a sustainable rally is unlikely until an economic and earnings recovery becomes more visible.”European investors pushed equities higher for a second consecutive session. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 1.4 per cent led by oil groups, banks and carmakers, taking its gains for the past two days to 8.4 per cent.Performances in Asia were mixed. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.8 per cent, but Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.9 per cent after climbing by nearly 9 per cent on Monday.Singapore’s Straits Times index, which was closed on Monday, rose 5.8 per cent.Economic data showed no let up in global economic frailty. Although Germany’s ZEW survey of investor sentiment showed a slight pick-up, analysts were unimpressed and said much of it was down to falling oil prices, the weaker euro and interest rate cuts, rather than a fundamental change in sentiment.“The fact that the index remains deeply in negative territory shows that far more investors expect the German economy to deteriorate further over the next six months than think that conditions will improve,” said Jennifer McKeown, at Capital Economics.Retail sales in the UK were also weak. The British Retail Consortium reported that sales fell 2.6 per cent in November, after dropping 2.2 per cent in October.Manufacturing output fell 1.4 per cent in October – the eighth consecutive month of declines.Trading in currency markets was volatile and followed the fluctuating fortunes of equities and economic reports. The dollar briefly slipped below Y92 against the yen as Wall Street sank in afternoon trade.Sterling was hurt by the weak UK data and fell against its leading rivals.The Canadian dollar slipped more than 1 per cent against its US neighbour after the Bank of Canada surprised the market with a three-quarter point rate cut, leaving its overnight rate at 1.5 per cent.As investors favoured the dollar, commodities markets ended their brief rally. Oil prices slipped after the US Energy Information Administration reduced its demand outlook for 2008 and 2009. US crude fell $1.64 to settle at $42.07 a barrel.Government bonds were mixed. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund climbed 8 basis points to 3.23 per cent as European investors favoured equities over government paper. In the US, Treasury yields fell as losses for stocks deepened.The yield on the two-year note dropped 11bp to 0.84 per cent.Credit markets were mixed. The iTraxx Crossover index in Europe edged back to 1,001 while the CDX North American index edged wider to 265bp. A six week drought in US high yield issuance was broken when El Paso, the oil and gas producer sold $500m of five-year debt."
338;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-12-09T21:54:47Z;Financials suffer losses as Wall St rally fades;;Financial stocks bore the brunt of the losses on Wall Street on Tuesday as a two-day rally fizzled out.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs dropped 8.2 per cent to $14.97 and 5.7 per cent to $72.77, respectively, amid nervousness of more write-downs ahead of fourth quarter earnings.KBW said their figures are “expected to be grim”. The broker cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Morgan Stanley from a profit to a loss of $0.19 a share.Fresh signs of stress in credit markets – the Treasury sold $30bn in four-week bills at zero per cent as investors fled to safety – added to the selling pressure. JPMorganfell 6.9 per cent to $33.96. Bank of New York Mellon was among several regional banks to sustain heavy losses, down10.2 per cent to $27.63.Discount brokers were in focus after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the sector with a “neutral” view. “Client activity could retract significantly in 2009,” Goldman said. OptionsXpress lost 8.5 per cent to $12.82 after the bank gave a “sell” recommendation and a $13 price target. “We expect 2009 to be the first year since 2002 when industry option volumes decline.”Profit warnings and downgrades added to the gloom and pushed the S&P 500 index 2.3 per cent lower to 888.67 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.7 per cent to 8,691.33 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.6 per cent to 1,547.34.Investors took profits in infrastructure stocks, which had enjoyed strong gains on the back of economic stimulus plans from president-elect Barack Obama.FedEx was the worst hit in the industrial sector, off 14.5 per cent – its worst show since 1987 – to $63.65 after the package shipping group issued a profit warning.United Parcel Service, another delivery group, lost 7 per cent to $54.51 and was also pushed lower from a bearish JPMorgan note.“The deterioration in express demand trends appear to be so sharp that the market weakness will overwhelm the benefit from DHL’s withdrawal from the US and also the support for earnings from falling fuel prices,” the bank said, and cut its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.Transport stocks came under further pressure from Con-way, which dropped 13.9 per cent to $22.19 after the trucking group also slashed its earnings forecast.The financial sector led the retreat, down 4.9 per cent, amid concerns about more possible writedowns in the fourth quarter.Host Hotels was the biggest loser on the S&P, down 16.1 per cent to $7.15. The lodging sector came under pressure after Wachovia downgraded its recommendation on the sector to “underweight”.Still, there were rare signs of encouragement. The market entered positive territory during the morning and traders appeared encouraged by signs that some sectors had stopped reacting so adversely to bad news.Semiconductor stocks performed well in spite of a profit warning from Texas Instruments, which rose 4.9 per cent to $15.55.Investors also overlooked planned factory closures by Sony, the Japanese electronics group, and snapped up technology stocks on hopes they may have reached a nadir. The sector finished down 0.5 per cent.Better than feared results from Autozone lifted shares in the car parts retailer 6.9 per cent to $124.51.The energy sector had earlier provided the market with support but tracked the oil price lower to finish down.General Motors and Ford lost 4.7 per cent to $4.70 and 4.4 per cent to $3.23, respectively, amid fears political wrangling could delay a government bail-out of the ailing car industry.Food retailers came under pressure from Kroger, which warned fourth-quarter profit would be less than Wall Street had expected.Shares in the grocery chain lost 6.7 per cent to $25.47.Wal-Mart lost 3 per cent to $55.81 after the discounter agreed to pay $54.3m to settle a wage and hours-related lawsuit in Minnesota and suspended its share buy-back.Airlines were one of the worst performing sectors, off 7.2 per cent overall, after Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association, warned that the industry would suffer a $2.5bn net loss next year.
339;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Okay passenger flights brought to a standstill;;Okay Airways, China’s first privately owned airline, will suspend its passenger services indefinitely in response to a severe industry downturn and a business dispute between the carrier’s majority shareholders and management.The airline was on Thursday ordered by the Civil Aviation Administration of China to suspend all passenger flights from December 15 after a request for suspension from the airline’s majority shareholder, officials of the CAAC and Okay said.An official from Okay Airways, who asked not to be named, said: “The notice only said that our passenger flights will be suspended from December 15 but did not say when the ban will be lifted.”Okay operates six aircraft on its passenger routes but its suspension is seen as a sign of worse things to come for the country’s crowded airline market.John Koldowski, a managing director at Pacific Asia Travel Association, said: “There have been a lot of start-ups with high hopes in recent years but then oil started spiking, the financial crunch hit, forcing airlines to consider whether they can afford to service their aircraft leases and now they’re faced with falling consumer demand. Unquestionably, we’re going to see more airlines go to the wall.”Two of China’s three big state run carriers, China Southern and China Eastern, have received emergency bail-outs of Rmb3bn ($436m) each in the past week to compensate for plummeting passenger demand and huge losses from jet fuel hedging operations.Without similar assistance, many of the 24 private and state-owned airlines operating in the country are expected to shut down.Okay operates three cargo aircraft and is a partner of US logistics company FedEx. Its cargo operations would be allowed to continue for now, officials said.The airline’s passenger service operates on 13 domestic routes. All but two of them are code-share arrangements with other carriers “so the impact to the market and passengers is limited”, said Sun Defu, an official with the CAAC Northern Regional Administration.Beijing-based Okay was established in 2005 to much fanfare as the first privately owned carrier in China but serious disagreements between major shareholders and management emerged earlier this year.Its disagreements with Shanghai-based majority shareholder group Juneyao have centred on funding.Juneyao has also accused Okay’s management of obstructing a planned merger with other airlines under Juneyao’s control.Officials said it was Juneyao that asked CAAC to suspend Okay’s operations.Additional reporting by Du Juan in Beijing
340;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-11-28T20:08:52Z;US Postal Service;;"Heard the one about the layoffs at the post office? To make sure everyone received their pink slips on time, they were mailed last year. Often the butt of jokes about inefficiency, the US Postal Service is bleeding red ink just two years after it was put on a more independent footing by Congress. The Post Office’s latest fiscal year ended with a $2.8bn loss on $75bn in revenue. Its accumulated deficit of $7.2bn, covered by a Treasury credit line, is now nearly half the limit allowable by law.The losses may revive calls to end the Post Office’s monopoly, but these miss the point and ignore its tough operating environment. The main privilege it enjoys is the sole right to deliver to mailboxes – hardly enviable given the accompanying universal service obligation requiring it to be ubiquitous. What private company would deliver a Christmas card to the bottom of the Grand Canyon by mule for 42 cents? With e-mail replacing letters, bills increasingly being paid by direct debit, spam usurping junk mail and credit card solicitations dropping amid the slump, volumes are sagging.It is likely this unionised federal agency could be more efficient and fetch a high price to boot if privatised. Applying the average revenue multiple of FedEx and United Parcel Service yields a value of $60bn, not to mention the Post Office’s valuable real estate. However, efficiency gains have been decent with a 12 per cent cut in employees since 2001. And the Post Office performs numerous unprofitable but vital chores for the government while raising prices only in line with inflation. After the government- sponsored enterprises fiasco, a private sector company with public obligations and a backstop looks like a bad idea. And it is positively refreshing to see a company nearly as big as UPS and Fedex combined whose “CEO” – the Postmaster General – makes about 3 per cent as much as each of their bosses.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

341;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-11-10T22:32:55Z;Financials lead Wall St declines;;Wall Street stocks failed to cling onto early gains on Monday as China’s near $600bn economic stimulus package did little to assuage fears for the growth prospects of some of the biggest names in corporate America.The bankruptcy of a well-known retailer, concerns over the fate of shareholders in the nation’s automakers and drastic losses at AIG and Freddie Mac sent many stocks to multi-year lows.Financials led the declines, down 4.4 per cent overall. Goldman Sachs hit a five-year low, down 8.5 per cent to $71.21, after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth-quarter loss, citing in part its exposure to private equity.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.3 per cent at 919.21 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent at 8,870.54 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent at 1,616.74.The market had risen as much as 2.3 per cent on the hope that the Chinese plan could lessen an expected global slump. Hard-hit construction, material and energy stocks were given a particular boost. New projects such as railways and airports as well as rebuilding earthquake-hit areas seemed likely to form a key plank of the Chinese government’s plan and the move sparked hopes of a floor in commodity prices.Also helping the market earlier, the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for AIG.The shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $2.28 in spite of third quarter figures from the struggling insurer that showed a net loss of $24.5bn .Stocks retreated as familiar concerns returned to the fore. Among the biggest, General Motors shed 23 per cent to $3.36 after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for the shares and recommended clients sell them.The bank said that while necessary for its survival, a government bail-out would do little to help shareholders. “Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company’s future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,” Deutsche analysts wrote, adding that “equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything”.Barclays also downgraded its recommendation on the stock and cut its price target from $4 to $1.Ford lost 4.5 per cent to $1.93 in spite of further signs that the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, would secure government assistance. Credit Suisse called Ford’s cash burn “eye-popping” and also lowered its price target from $4 to $1.Best Buy rallied as much as 7.3 per cent on hopes the bankruptcy of smaller rival Circuit City would provide an opportunity for the electronics retailer to expand.Best Buy had previously said it could take over stores that struggling rivals closed. Yet the shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $25.21.Other retailers came under pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on a series of department stores after last week’s October sales figures.“We remain especially concerned about declining access to consumer credit and higher finance charges for consumer credit card balances,” the bank said in a report.Macy’s tumbled 9.3 per cent to $9.94 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $18 to $15.Starbucks fell 3.3 per cent to $10.20 and a further 2.8 per cent in after-hours trade, when the coffee chain disclosed fourth quarter profit slumped 97 per cent, hurt by the cost of closing underperforming stores.Earlier, UBS trimmed its forecasts and said that “new smoothies did not seem to drive significant sales”.Defensive names were among the biggest winners. Among them, upbeat like-for-like sales figures from McDonald’s lifted the burger chain 1.8 per cent to $56.48, and gave the fast food sector a boost.Delivery stocks United Parcel Service and Fedex rose after rival Deutsche Post unveiled plans to scrap domestic express services in the US.UPS and Fedex climbed 3.2 per cent to $53.60 and 2.7 per cent to $66.29 respectively, as the move is expected to allow the dominant US duo to take yet more market share.Dish Network slid 14.7 per cent to $13.24 after the satellite television group said quarterly profits dropped more than half. DIRECTV Group, its larger rival with which communications group AT&T has struck a deal to replace Dish in providing bundled deals, gained 1.1 per cent to $22.17.
342;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-11-10T21:55:24Z;DHL to cut 9,500 US jobs;;DHL’s express delivery service within the US is to close with the loss of 9,500 jobs after Deutsche Post, its parent company, abandoned its attempt to compete with FedEx and United Parcel Service on their home turf.The withdrawal from all ground and air domestic deliveries is a radical response by Deutsche Post to the widening losses in DHL’s US express business. Restructuring costs – estimated at $2bn in May – will almost double to $3.9bn, which Deutsche Post said would drive it into a net loss in 2008.Deutsche Post said the global economic slowdown had sparked a need for “more prudent action” in the US, where it had intended to cut its ground operations by 30 per cent.With 5,400 jobs already cut this year, DHL Express’s US workforce will shrink from 18,000 to fewer than 4,000.Frank Appel, Deutsche Post’s chief executive, acknowledged the company would face a “strong public reaction”. He said: “We are more than aware of the consequences but there are no alternatives.” Losses at DHL’s US Express business are set to widen from $1.3bn to $1.5bn this year.Deutsche Post shares rose 6.8 per cent to close at €10.00 in Frankfurt.From January, DHL Express will handle US packages only as part of international shipments, cutting costs by more than 80 per cent. John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express said: “If you are shipping between cities in the US you will not have that service”.DHL’s US Express business will contract from more than 400 stations to 100 and all 18 ground hubs will shut. The air network will handle about 100,000 daily shipments compared with capacity for 1.2m today.Deutsche Post is not closing its other US businesses, including DHL’s global forwarding and supply chain businesses, which employ 25,000.For FedEx and UPS, DHL’s departure from the domestic express delivery business eliminates a competitor from a market that the two US companies dominate.Most of the more than $2bn in domestic air revenue that DHL makes annually, and another $750m in ground parcel revenue, should shift to UPS and FedEx, said Thomas Wadewitz, a JPMorgan analyst.Deutsche Post has been negotiating for months with UPS on a contract to handle air shipments in the US. The much lower volumes now anticipated will complicate efforts but Mr Mullen said talks should end this year. He said: “If that does not happen we will have to make other arrangements”.UPS said: “Clearly today’s announcement is going to affect the size and scope of any such contract.”Axel Funhoff, an analyst at ING, said: “Deutsche Post needed to do this to get their performance and cost problems under control. The market has been waiting for this for up to two years. But too much of the future strategy is still subject to the UPS contract.”Deutsche Post’s underlying third-quarter earnings fell 9 per cent year-on-year as the worsening economic climate took its toll. Underlying earnings in DHL Express fell 46 per cent but would have risen 8 per cent without the US.DHL will show a net loss this year as it incurs most of the $3.9bn restructuring charge.
343;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-10-23T22:05:53Z;UPS still delivering;;A much-anticipated parcel delayed in transit can be most vexing. Sometimes, though, a hold-up is good for you. United Parcel Services benefited in its third quarter as the cost of fuelling its fleet of brown trucks reversed sharply, in parallel (alas) with global economic prospects. Customer charges for rocketing fuel costs, however, take two months to respond, boosting its flagging US operations by $90m. Should oil prices stabilise or continue to tumble, this lag will also give the fourth quarter a helping hand.It may be needed. UPS has seemed slow to appreciate its deteriorating environment, suggesting in July that the worst of the slump was over. Third quarter earnings of $0.96 a share surpassed expectations, but average daily volume for US packages fell 3.4 per cent. Modern businesses’ need for speed – or just-in-time delivery – means UPS no longer functions as a canary for US economic fortunes. But numbers of parcels dispatched still tend to move in synch with output, and volumes are forecast to fall 4 per cent in the rest of the year.Customers shifting from pricier air options to road and rail could help UPS relative to higher-end competitors like Fedex. But UPS’s international operations, still posting strong volume growth of 7 per cent in spite of falling US imports, can only head one way as woes spread. Rather like UPS’s strategic plan for $200 oil, decoupling as a business model must, for now, be filed away.With the business throwing off $4.6bn of cash this year, UPS’s confidence in its funding is such that it will continue buying back its shares, down 32 per cent this year. Ultimately, the severity of the expected Christmas retail slump will determine whether it hits its (broad) range for the fourth quarter. With growth in business to consumer flows now slowing more than other areas, signs are that fewer festive households will be waiting for parcels, timely or otherwise, come December.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

344;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-10-21T19:58:26Z;Wal-Mart seeks green in China;;In the Darwinian struggle for global manufacturing orders, the “Wal-Mart price” has generally been short-hand for shaving production costs to the bare minimum.But on Wednesday in Beijing, Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, will tell hundreds of the company’s top Chinese suppliers that the retailer intends to use its market power to get more than just low prices – at a “sustainability summit” devoted to raising standards in its vast supply chain.Attending the gathering will be AG Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, Fred Smith, head of FedEx, and Yuanqing Yang, chairman of Lenovo, who are keen to adopt a similar approach. Executives from Kimberly-Clark, Coca-Cola and Newell Rubbermaid will also be on hand for the most ambitious private sector drive yet to reduce waste and pollution in China’s export-focused manufacturing industries.Mr Scott will set out a range of objectives for the company’s supply chain and for its Chinese retail operations, which will include targets for the reduction of water and energy usage, reductions in packaging, and commitments to develop more sustainable products.“Our environmental footprint is primarily through our supply chain as a company,” says Matt Kistler, head of Wal-Mart’s global sustainability efforts. “So we have the ability to really build a world-class, better quality, better value supply chain.”In the US alone, Wal-Mart is estimated to sell about $30bn of goods annually that are made by about 30,000 factories in China, or about 10 per cent of all US imports. In categories such as clothing, footwear and toys – worth $64bn last year – Wal-Mart’s share is far higher.The retailer will also be promoting a new “Green Supply Chain Initiative” being led by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a non-profit group that has worked with Wal-Mart on sustainability issues in the US. The project is aimed at working with individual suppliers on energy saving and other issues, and is expected to extend to other US and European retailers, covering another 20,000 factories.“We will leverage the market clout of global retailers to help create a green playing field for China’s exporters,” says EDF.In the US the retailer has embraced a series of environmental initiatives over the past three years, including developing solar power systems and promoting more sustainable products such as low-enegy light bulbs. This year, it introduced a packaging scorecard that evaluates the efforts of suppliers to reduce packaging waste, which is now being translated into Mandarin.Jennifer Turner, head of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Center in Washington, says that in China similar pressure from international companies could help counter the problems of enforcement that continue to dog central government efforts to enforce existing environmental laws.“Local governments are not interested in enforcing laws, sometimes because they own the factories …I think this initiative from international companies to be crucial because it is a new kind of pressure on local government,” says Ms Turner. But the initiative also represents a shift in Wal-Mart’s traditional focus on securing the lowest possible price, which has helped shape the current supply chain and is blamed by critics for its social and environmental shortcomings.Mr Scott told Wal-Mart managers at their annual meeting in Kansas City this year that “we will favour – and in some cases even pay more – for suppliers that meet our standards”.However, Conrad ­MacKerron, head of supply chain programme at As You Sow, which co-ordinates pressure on companies from ethical investors, questions how the new approach would work in a world where brands and retailers have played suppliers off against each other on price.“If you go to a supplier that is already feeling the squeeze financially, and you say that they need to reduce energy and stop waste water, how do they do that given that Wal-Mart’s business model is basically to pay less year after year?”The focus on raising environmental standards in China’s supply chain comes against the background of broader concerns over regulation of factories there, with a new scandal over the contamination of Chinese milk-products with melamine. Last year saw a crisis over the safety of Chinese-made toys, which was preceded by a massive pet-food recall in the US because of melamine contamination of Chinese made ingredients.Ed Chan, head of Wal-Mart China, says the central government is giving the initiative “very active support”. “Sustainability is a top priority, and they have been encouraging Chinese and multi-national companies to really rethink the business model.”Jeff Macho, the China-based head of Wal-Mart’s global procurement division, insists the company wants to view its supply chain “holistically”, including both environmental and social factors such as labour conditions with product quality. He also said that in keeping with Mr Scott’s professed readiness to pay more the company had recently moved a home fashion contract to a more expensive supplier because of concerns over standards at the original factory.“I would say we are seeing an evolution to a new business model,” he says. “I think we are developing that relationship with suppliers, to look not only at price, but at all of these other elements.”
345;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-09-29T08:51:37Z;We have the power;;"Green IT is trendy. Five years ago, did you see power consumption in the datacentre as the stuff of headlines? It is now.Following this fashion, technology companies are falling over themselves to show off their green credentials. BT is designating “green champions”; Cisco flirted with handing out carbon budgets to its managers. As well as juggling finances to hit their end of period targets, people may one day have to eke out their carbon quotas.Sadly, a lot of this attention is focused on the wrong target.With the IT industry’s immense talent for being inward looking, a lot of thinking on green IT has focused on the datacentre. The world’s datacentres, it is said, consume as much power as the world’s airlines. Server and storage consolidation, virtualisation, cooling strategies – these are the things most IT executives think about as they drive their SUVs to work.Like many statistics, however, measures of power consumption in the datacentre conceal as much as they reveal. Another way to state that statistic is to note that the world’s datacentres consume a lot less power than the world’s logistics companies (airlines, railways, shipping firms, trucking fleets and all). Improving the efficiency of our supply chains might be worthwhile even at the expense of higher power consumption in our datacentres. FedEx, for example, has reduced fuel bills by up to 30 per cent through better route planning for its trucks. That justifies a lot of server power.The same is true in many other industries. We’ve invested hugely in improving the financial and temporal efficiency of our business processes. Most organisations are a lot further behind when it comes to improving their power efficiency. You just have to look at their reporting tools. Managers can see the cost and time implications of every decision. When it comes to energy, they are running blind.For example, consider the information that Cisco’s managers will need to manage their carbon budgets. They will want to see which aspects of their operations are consuming the most carbon. They will want to understand the carbon-intensity of the services they sell. “How can we adjust our product mix to reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining margins?” they will ask. Substitute “cash” for “carbon” in those questions, and their ERP systems can probably do it all already.Modifying those ERP systems to account for carbon should not be all that hard to do. Our ERP systems already have the basic functionality needed to track and balance resources. This functionality will need to be tweaked to handle carbon instead of cash. It may need to be connected up in slightly different ways, reflecting the different routes by which carbon flows through our enterprises. But those are differences of detail, not of the fundamental architecture.Our application vendors tell us that they have invested heavily in Service Oriented Architecture in order to improve the flexibility of their systems. Our IT departments have invested heavily in service buses and suchlike in order to connect up the applications. Here is a real test for those investments: can they smooth the way for us to move to this world of carbon accounting?To date, too many of our carbon initiatives have been piecemeal. Without an end-to-end view of the way carbon is flowing through our organisations, we can only make point savings. This is where our financial management systems were a few decades ago. No CFO would accept that situation now.If we could rebuild our accounting systems to accommodate a carbon economy that parallels the financial one, then we could begin to identify and address efficiencies holistically. That’s where the biggest gains will come. This is a worthwhile goal for green IT.That’s not to say that improving server and datacentre efficiency isn’t worthwhile. It clearly is. But it’s missing the bigger game. By focusing on IT efficiency we may miss the opportunity to build more substantial efficiencies across the wider environment.One final thought: will we start getting memos saying “Turn up all the heaters – we’ve got carbon left in the budget and if we don’t use it, we’ll lose it”? Unintended consequences indeed.Graham Oakes helps people untangle complex technology, relationships, processes and governance.

346;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-09-23T18:49:22Z;Corporate America sits on its cash;;Corporate America waded into the darkest days of the credit crisis with more cash than ever before, a sign many of the US’s biggest companies have been bracing for signs that Wall Street’s problems will infiltrate the rest of the economy.Excluding utilities and financial institutions, members of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended June with a record $648bn in cash and short-term securities.“Corporate profits until the last six months were pretty good,” said Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the package delivery group. “With the exceptions of the autos and housing, there’s a lot of cash flow and a lot of capability in the industrial sector outside of the funds provided by financials.”Many large US companies began to stockpile more cash in the aftermath of the last economic downturn, earlier this decade. The size of S&P 500 members’ war chest reached a plateau in 2005 as conditions improved but never slipped below $600bn. And in the past year, their liquidity has inched higher.They may need it. Even if big companies have plenty of cash to weather the slowdown, many of their customers, be they consumers or smaller business, may not.While some of Wall Street’s most venerable names collapsed and lawmakers debated the White House’s proposed $700bn bailout, corporate finance chiefs have closely monitored the credit markets for any effects on their funding plans.“We will see the total amount of credit will be reduced a little bit,” said Rick Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, an industrial conglomerate. “There is an amount of leverage that needs to be reduced. It’s a logical concern and one we’re watching carefully.”Some have more to worry about than others.The crisis “will create a real winner takes all environment,” said Jason Trennert, chief investment strategist at Strategas Research Partners. “Well-run companies not dependent upon credit markets will take market share from companies which aren’t well run and are [dependent on credit].”On Monday, one US bellwether, General Motors, drew down the remaining $3.5bn from a revolving credit line, while three others – Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Nike – unveiled plans to buy back as much as $53.5bn in stock.Short-term borrowing costs have climbed. Rates on 15-day commercial paper have jumped 127 basis points in two weeks, according to Bloomberg.One US clothing chain, Talbots, has already faced challenges. In April its shares plunged after Bank of America and HSBC did not renew $265m in letters of credit.Talbots eventually won extended credit terms from the majority of its suppliers, while covering its remaining supplier credit requirements with a $50m unsecured loan from its largest shareholder, Aeon, the Japanese retailer.Talbots had $215m in working capital borrowing capacity at the end of its second quarter ending on August 2.“In a period in which credit is being rationed, the price of leveraged assets declines and cash is king,” Mr Trennert said.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York
347;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-09-18T22:09:25Z;FedEx delivers plan to weather downturn;;FedEx delivered to investors its plan for navigating a global economy that the package-delivery company expects will expand at a tepid pace for at least another year.The company is trimming its capital-spending budget, reducing compensation costs on existing employees and limiting new hires, while sticking with plans to migrate its aircraft fleet to more fuel-efficient planes.FedEx also said its US express-delivery unit would raise its shipping rates by an average of 6.9 per cent in January.Considered a bellwether for its role in facilitating global commerce, FedEx predicted that the US economy would expand at 1.9 per cent this year and again in 2009. The rest of the world would not pick up any time soon either, executives predicted.The initiatives are aimed at helping the company meet an earnings forecast for fiscal 2009 that it reaffirmed on Thursday would range between $4.75-$5.25 a share. On a call with analysts, FedEx’s officers said they were prepared to take further steps if the outlook darkened.“As FedEx faces today’s especially tough economic challenges, we’ll continue to hold a line on costs across all segments,” Fred Smith, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said.While acknowledging the crises that have unfolded on Wall Street and the effect they have had on corporate America’s borrowing costs, Mr Smith noted that many US industrial companies had continued to report profits, generate cash and strengthen balance sheets.The Memphis-based company reported a 22 per cent drop in fiscal first quarter profit, to $384m, or $1.23 a share. The results matched preliminary figures released last week that exceeded the company’s initial guidance.Revenue rose 8 per cent to $9.97bn on similar gains from its express-delivery, ground and freight businesses. Second-quarter earnings will climb to $1.40-$1.60 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago, the company said.FedEx cut its capital investment budget by $400m, to $2.6bn, this year.
348;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-09-10T20:52:23Z;Rally in energy and tech stocks lift Wall Street;;Washington Mutual slid to its lowest level since 1991 on Wednesday as the wider financial sector took scant comfort from Lehman Brothers’ hurried update and failed to recover from the previous session’s heavy losses.The mortgage lender, which has been placed under special regulatory supervision, fell a further 29.7 per cent to $2.32 as the cost of insuring against the risk of its default rose markedly. Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on the lender from “stable” to “negative”.Also in focus was American International Group, which fell a further 4.7 per cent to 17.50 after the world’s largest insurer suffered a fall of 19.3 per cent in the previous session on the back of mounting uncertainty over Lehman Brother’s ability to raise capital.Citigroup, which cut its profit forecasts, nevertheless wrote in a note to clients: “Not similar to Lehman – we believe that AIG has plenty of less drastic options in its arsenal …before the impact of a controlling partner is even under consideration.”Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch lost 3.7 per cent to 38.92 and 5.9 per cent to $23.30, respectively.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a sector note: “The bank operating environment remains challenging, amid slowing economic growth, contraction of credit and constrained capital.”E-Trade Financial fell 4.4 per cent $3.03 after it said three-year cumulative losses on its home equity loans would be greater than expected.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which disclosed its third-quarter earnings a week early to reassure investors, edged down 1.8 per cent to $7.95, after a 45 per cent fall in Tuesday’s session.On Tuesday, the financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to strengthen its balance sheet prompted wider concerns over asset sales ahead of banks’ third quarter earnings season.However, a rally in energy and technology stocks helped lift the major indices into positive territory on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,232.04 by the close in New York while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 11,268.92 and the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent to 2,228.70.Outside financials, the mood was upbeat. In particular, an update from Fedex helped sentiment.The cargo group said first-quarter profit would exceed its forecasts on the back of lower fuel costs and its shares rose 3.7 per cent to $87.86.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rose 0.6 per cent to $21.85 on the back of a positive update from the chipmaker that eased concerns over reduced mobile phone demand.Orders this quarter matched its expectations and the company did not cut forecasts. S&P raised its price target from $96 to $105.That gave a boost to technology stocks, which have been hard hit in recent sessions on fears of global growth slowdown.The sector boasted gains of 0.7 per cent while shares of technology bellwether IBM rose 2.61 per cent to $118.04.Research in Motion rose 5.4 per cent to $104.61 after unveiling plans to launch a new “flip” version of its BlackBerry Pearl phone.Yahoo edged up 0.7 per cent at $17.70 even after Sanford C Bernstein cut its price target from $26 to $24.But Google lost 1.1 per cent to $414.16 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from $620 to $600.Meanwhile, energy stocks rallied following Opec’s decision to lower oil production.Among the top gainers were ExxonMobil, up 2.7 per cent at $75.25, Massey Energy, up 8.2 per cent at $42.10 and Hess, which which stood 7.5 per cent higher at $85.67.US Steel advanced 4.5 per cent to $35.23 after reaching an agreement with the United Steelworkers union.In other news, interdealer broker GFI Group fell 24.5 per cent to $7.26 after merger talks with Tullett Prebon of the UK fell apart as the two were unable to reach acceptable terms.Elsewhere, software maker Salesforce.com and Fastenal rose after the duo were picked to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the S&P 500. Their shares rose 7.7 per cent to $56.09 and 0.8 per cent to $52.58, respectively.
349;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-08-22T19:27:56Z;Banks to the fore as Europe advances;;A last-minute rally in banking stocks and a wave of takeover speculation boosted European shares, but failed to cancel out their losses from the start of the week.The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 jumped 1.8 per cent to 1,175.79, but ended down 1.2 per cent on the week.Dutch logistics firm TNT stood out, gaining 6.9 per cent to €26.45 on rumours that US rival United Parcel Service was preparing to make a bid at the weekend.Takeover speculation has surrounded TNT for two months, with FedEx also in the frame as a potential suitor. The shares fell nearly 18 per cent on July 25 after FedEx was reported to have pulled out of talks.Meanwhile, Hochtief, the German construction group, gained 8.5 per cent to €54.34 on speculation that Spanish builder ACS, which owns 25 per cent, was interested in Hochtief’s US, Australian and Asian divisions. ACS shares rose 2.5 per cent to €30.20 after the company denied that it had break-up plans for the company. It refused to comment on whether it would make a full takeover bid for Hochtief.Financials provided much of the upside for European stocks, rallying after recent sharp losses. Switzerland’s UBS gained 4.8 per cent to SFr22.86, putting it 3.6 per cent higher over the week.However, the rally was an isolated bright spot for the European banking sector this week. Fears for the health of the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US had cast a pall over banks and other businesses exposed to Europe’s property market.Irish banks took a battering, with Anglo Irish Bank down 12.9 per cent to €5.53 over the week, Bank of Ireland falling 13.5 per cent to €5.25 and Allied Irish Banks sliding 5 per cent to €8.22. Irish cement producer CRH also slid 7 per cent to €16.97.Spanish banks and construction companies also faltered. Sacyr Vallehermoso shed 7 per cent to €12.32, Banco Popular lost 4.9 per cent to €7.01 and Grupo Ferrovial lost 5.3 per cent to €33.36. Ferrovial was hurt by fears that its subsidiary BAA will have to sell three of its British airports this year after a report by UK competition authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.Airlines stocks had a bumpy descent as the oil price rallied. Deutsche Lufthansa lost 5.5 per cent to €14.44, Air France-KLM slid 5.6 per cent to €16.43, while budget airline Ryanair sank 10.2 per cent to €2.56.However, oil and mineral stocks crested the gainers list. Portugal’s Galp Energia rose 4 per cent to €13.71, France’s Total added 3.3 per cent to €49.17 and Norway’s StatoilHydro gained 8.2 per cent to NKr165.60 and Austria’s OMV climbed 4.1 per cent to €42.42.Mining group Eramet advanced 11 per cent to €363.16, while German steel company Salzgitter rose 5.1 per cent to €103.32.
350;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-08-05T21:22:07Z;Wall Street higher as oil prices drop;;"Wall Street stocks snapped a three-session losing streak on Tuesday as oil prices fell to three month lows and the Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold for a second straight meeting.The move by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee to keep its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent was widely anticipated.Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, said: “Everyone expected the Fed to do what it did the only question was how much dissent would there be? I think that the dissent was less than expected, the Fed did what it was supposed to and then oil came in and gave markets a boost.”The day began in positive fashion after some estimate-beating results from Procter & Gamble cheered investors.The consumer products group behind Head & Shoulders shampoo, said fourth-quarter profits had jumped 33 per cent to $3.02bn as it passed on rising input costs to customers and benefited from the weak dollar which boosted foreign revenues. Proctor & Gamble shares rose 3.3 per cent to $67.97.A drop in the oil price below $120 a barrel helped the equity market shrug
off news that services industries in the US shrank for a second straight month in July.The consumer discretionary sector was among the leading gainers, adding 4.5 per cent with retailers making particularly strong progress after some data showed strong year-on-year same store sales last week.Macy’s surged 8.9 per cent to $19.49 and Sears Holdings rose 10.6 per cent to $91.56.Industrials and consumer staples also made ground adding 3 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.FedEx added 6.8 per cent to $83.99 and General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.25 while Wal-Mart Stores rose 3.3 per cent to $60.34 and Tyson Foods gained 7.8 per cent to $16.16.Oil is now down nearly 20 per cent from its high on July 3. As oil has pulled back, energy stocks have suffered. On Monday, the S&P 500 energy sector dropped into bear market territory after declining more than 20 per cent from its record highs in May.But energy and material stocks made ground on Tuesday in spite of falling commodity prices.Refiners Tesoro and Sunoco rose 5.3 per cent to $41.89 and 4.1 per cent to $15.53, respectively, helping the energy sector to a 1.1 per cent gain.In materials, a rebound in metals stocks pushed the sector up 1.3 per cent. US Steel rose 2.4 per cent to $143.17, Allegheny Technologies added 4.8 per cent to $45.89 and Titanium Metals gained 7 per cent to $10.68.All 10 leading industry groups closed in positive territory helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 2.9 per cent to 1,284.88 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.9 per cent to 11,615.77 The Nasdaq Composite added 2.8 per cent to 2,349.83.On Monday, equity markets declined for a third straight session as a broad slide in commodity prices helped some stocks but hurt the heavily weighted energy and materials sectors.About 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have reported in this earning season
and, on average, profits have declined about 19 per cent.On Tuesday, investors were presented with a mixed set of earnings reports. In addition to results from P&G, DR Horton also reported earnings. The largest US homebuilder reported a fifth straight quarterly loss and the shares dipped 0.3 per cent to $11.19.Archer Daniels Midland, the grain processor, said fourth-quarter profit dipped 61 per cent missing analyst estimates. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $25.87.Tenet HealthCare also lost ground, losing 8.2 per cent to $5.72 after it reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss but the healthcare sector as a whole gained 2.6 per cent nonetheless.Financials regained some ground, adding 5.1 per cent as oil prices slipped back.Lehman Brothers surged 12.8 per cent to $20.24, Citigroup added 5.8 per cent to $19.92 while JP Morgan advanced 4.4 per cent to $41.89.AIG was among the leading gainers, adding 12 per cent to $29.89 after analysts at UBS recommended that investors buy shares in the insurer saying it was “well-positioned” to absorb losses from credit-related assets."
351;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-29T20:51:54Z;Wall St shrugs off writedowns and housing data;;US stocks shrugged off news of further writedowns in the financial sector and some weak housing data to make steep gains on Tuesday due to a sharp drop in oil prices and decent earnings reports.Oil prices fell about $3, prolonging a four-week slump that has seen prices tumble from more than $145 a barrel to about $122.That news, and an unexpected rise in the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, helped trigger broad equity advances.Nine of the 10 top industry groups were in positive territory. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.3 per cent, industrials gained 2.7 per cent and technology posted a 2.1 per cent rise.The moves helped offset news of an $8.5bn stock offering from Merrill Lynch. After the close on Monday, the brokerage also announced a further $5.7bn in writedowns on certain mortgage securities.The International Monetary Fund said the US housing crisis could continue for some time and stood by its estimate that losses for the banking system could reach $1,000bn, sending financials into a tailspin.As if to underline that thesis, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite home price index dropped 15.8 per cent in May compared with a year earlier.That was the biggest decline since 2001, but was smaller than expected, and housebuilding stocks rallied 9.1 per cent.The news from Merrill heartened some analysts.Meredith Whitney, of Oppenheimer, noted that the stock was closer to “fairly valued levels” and applauded the “purging of assets as an attempt to cut its losses and focus on stabilising its platform and righting the franchise towards growth”. Analysts at CreditSights, a research provider, noted the moves made Merrill “more appealing as a takeout candidate.”Investors seemed to agree and Merrill’s shares overturned early losses to gain 7.8 per cent to $26.25. The S&P 500 financials index surged 7.5 per cent, led by an 8.2 per cent advance for regional banks and a 9.7 per cent gain for diversified banks such as Wachovia and Wells Fargo.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent higher at 1,263.2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.4 per cent at 11,397.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,319.62.The second-quarter earnings season continued apace. So far, about 255 companies in the S&P 500 have reported and, on average, earnings have dropped 22.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials were the worst performers, posting a 90.2 per cent decline, but excluding that sector, profits rose 8 per cent.Overnight, Amgen, the biotechnology company, reported that net income fell 7.7 per cent due to poor sales of certain anaemia drugs. But the fall was smaller than expected and it raised its full-year earnings forecasts. Amgen’s shares rose 3 per cent to $62.28.In the consumer staples sector, Colgate-Palmolive also beat expectations, posting a 19 per cent increase in profit as it passed on costs to the consumer and achieved strong sales in Asia and Latin America. Colgate’s shares rose 8.2 per cent to $74.15, leading the broader sector to a 2 per cent gain.In the consumer discretionary sector, McGraw-Hill said profit fell 23 per cent, but the education and financial services company re-affirmed its 2008 earnings forecasts and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $39.78.The drop in oil prices proved a boon to the likes of Dillard’s and General Motors. The pair added 8.3 per cent to $10.43 and 8.2 per cent to $11.90 respectively.Consumer-facing technology groupsbounced back from Monday’s sell-off. Ebay, Apple and Dell climbed 3 per cent to $25.52, 1.7 per cent to $157.08 and 3.3 per cent to $24.01 respectively.In industrials, transportation stocks led the gainers with a 4.5 per cent advance. Ryder System added 5.7 per cent to $68.35, UPS added 3.3 per cent to $63.31. FedEx rose 5.2 per cent to $82.12.Material stocks were among the leading gainers, advancing 2.2 per cent thanks in part to US Steel. The company said second-quarter profits more than doubled on higher steel prices. US Steel’s shares rose 14.1 per cent to $165.76.The oil moves were less positive for energy stocks. ConocoPhillips dipped 2.4 per cent to $80.27 while Schlumberger slid 1.4 per cent to $96.23.
352;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-28T10:04:58Z;TNT pursuing ‘standalone’ strategy;;TNT, the Dutch postal group, on Monday said it was open to partnerships but was following a strategy designed for a standalone company.The remarks came as the company reported a drop in profits in the second quarter.TNT, which has a market capitalisation of about €8.8bn and is seen as a takeover target, held preliminary talks with bigger US rival Fedex earlier this month but has not publicly confirmed or commented on their status.“We will always look into the benefits of partnerships,” Peter Bakker, chief executive, told reporters, giving a joint venture with Swiss Post for express parcel deliveries as an example. “But in general our strategy is one which can be deployed on an organic, standalone basis.”TNT’s net profit fell to €205m or €0.56 per share from €244m or €0.63 as volumes in its air express parcel delivery business in Europe dropped in June, an effect aggravated by sharply higher fuel costs in the quarter.However, the company said it had already seen some recovery in July and also partially compensated for the decline by growth in its economy service that goes by road.While the Dutch company’s European parcel business has made it an attractive target for potential suitors, its slower-growing postal division is a potential sticking point.Its core Mail Netherlands operations saw a further drop in volumes in the quarter while wages have risen due to a new collective labour agreement that is not fully offset by cost cuts elsewhere.Mr Bakker said TNT’s dense road delivery network in Europe would prove an advantage with higher fuel costs if more of the parcel delivery business shifted from air to road.But he denied he was highlighting the network, built up over many years, to burnish TNT’s image for potential suitors, noting that it gave the company an operational advantage.Shares in TNT traded 8.8 per cent lower at €21.88 in mid-morning trading in Amsterdam.
353;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-24T22:20:24Z;TNT and Daimler cast pall over bourses;;European shares lost steam on Thursday, with Dutch mail company TNT leading the fall after speculation that takeover talks with US giant FedEx had collapsed.TNT plunged 15.9 per cent to €22 after gaining more than 45 per cent in the past two weeks on hopes that the US company had begun negotiations to takeover its smaller peer. Neither company commented on the reports.A bleak outlook from German luxury carmaker Daimler and a weak performance by commodities stocks added to the gloom, leading the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index down 1.5 per cent to 1,170.80 points after it gained more than2 per cent on Wednesday.Daimler fell 9.6 per cent to €38.47. The stronger euro, rising raw material costs and falling global growth drove the company, which had been seen as one of the strongest performers in the global car sector, to slash its 2008 profit outlook.“It will be difficult for Daimler to continue its aggressive share buy-back programme in an environment of falling fundamentals, falling cash flow, falling cash balance and rising risk on multiple fronts,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The news knocked European carmakers, which had gained after stronger than expected results in the previous session. Peugeot lost 7.2 per cent to €32.38, Fiat fell 4.9 per cent to €11.28 and VW shed 2.8 per cent to €203.78.Rising costs also hit paper makers, with Finland’s Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene and Sweden’s SCA all missing market forecasts with their second-quarter results. Shares in SCA fell 11.4 per cent to SKr69.75, while Stora Enso lost 7.8 per cent to €5.93. UPM-Kymmene shed 7.3 per cent to €10.02.Crude prices fell towards $124 a barrel on the back of falling US demand for petrol adding further pressure to some energy stocks.Portugal’s Galp Energia fell 4.2 per cent to €11.13, while Spain’s Repsol lost 3 per cent to €21.68 and France’s Total shed 2.8 per cent to €47.67.Steelmakers were tarnished by lower than expected results from Finland’s Outokumpu, which plunged 22.9 per cent to €14.82. The stainless steel company undershot analysts’ expectations and gave a soft outlook for the market, knocking other stocks in the sector.Sweden’s SSAB A shares fell 10 per cent to SKr157 in spite of robust results. SSAB outstripped analysts expectations with its second-quarter operating profit and gave a strong outlook. Austria’s Voestalpine fell 8.8 per cent to €39.Credit Suisse topped a strong performance in the troubled banking sector. The Swiss group’s second-quarter earnings fell 62 per cent, but were not as bad as some people had feared. “Wealth management inflows substantially beat expectations and these results should be well received, in our view,” said Matthew Clark at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Credit Suisse rose 5.3 per cent to SFr52.55.Also in Switzerland, investment bank Julius Baer rose 2.2 per cent to SFr66.4 after Citigroup wrote a bullish note.Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo rose 3.3 per cent to €3.71, while in Greece Bank of Piraeus climbed 3.1 per cent to €20.42.Spain’s Banco Popular fell 6.7 per cent to €7.42 after its exposure to bad loans from the country’s ailing property market overshadowed a better than expected profit performance in the second-quarter.Retail stocks were bolstered by French group PPR, which climbed 5.3 per cent to €70.10 after announcing better than expected second-quarter sales. This helped lift fellow luxury brand LVMH 2.6 per cent to €70.05.
354;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-14T21:53:35Z;Bid activity lifts European stocks;;European equity markets rallied on Monday after bid news raised hopes that takeover deals would ease the pain in the embattled financial sector. There was also a renewed round of merger activity in wider markets.Santander, the Spanish bank, made an all-paper bid for troubled UK mortgage lender Alliance & Leicester.Santander, which bought Abbey – the fourth-largest UK bank – in 2005, was 0.1 per cent higher at €11.24, while A&L shares jumped more than 50 per cent.The financial sector led the rally, buoyed by news of a US government rescue plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage groups hurt by the credit market fall out. Hedge funds rushed to close their short positions boosting hard-hit financial stocks, dealers said.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,133.95, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax was 0.8 per cent higher at 6,200.25 while the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 1 per cent to 4,142.53.Irish banks, which have been hit severely in the recent market sell off, were led higher by Bank of Ireland. The bank, which at last week’s annual meeting warned of an uncertain outlook, rose 5.1 per cent to €4.88. Allied Irish Banks climbed 3.4 per cent to €7.6.Irish cement maker CRH, which has been battered in recent days, also rebounded gaining 5.8 per cent to €15.35.In France, BNP Paribas climbed 1.4 per cent to €55.86, Crédit Agricole added 2.5 per cent to €11.86 and Franco-Belgian Dexia rose 1.7 per cent to €8.54.Germany’s Commerzbank gained 1.8 per cent to €19.88 and Deutsche Postbank rose 1.8 per cent to €51.49 while Sweden’s Swedbank added 6.1 per cent to SKr113.75.Outside the banking sector, TNT, the Dutch mail and logistics company, surged 26.4 per cent to €23.40 on reports that US rival FedEx was in talks about a possible takeover. Merrill Lynch upgraded TNT to “buy”, while Andrew Fitchie. a Collins Stewart analyst, said: “There appears to be massive upside in owning TNT if the deal goes ahead and the stock is cheap on fundamentals if it doesn’t.”There was also some speculation that United Parcel Service would be taking a look, sparking hopes of a bidding war.Meanwhile, shares in Continental , the German tyremaker jumped 22 per cent to €65.80 after it said that Schaeffler Group, which makes bearings, was in talks to make a €10bn bid. Rival Michelin rose 2 per cent to €43.75.Grupo Ferrovial, the Spanish construction and concessions group, rose 4 per cent to €33.25 on speculation that BAA, its UK airports unit, was close to announcing plans for its delayed refinancing.Safran, Europe’s second-biggest aircraft-engine maker, advanced 6.9 per cent to €13.35 after the company said its joint venture with General Electric would develop a model to preserve its lead on single-aisle commercial planes when a new generation of airliners arrives late next decade.There was unexpected good news on the earnings front after Philips, the Dutch electronics leader, said second-quarter profit beat expectations. Shares in Philips rose 6.4 per cent to €20.67.But Norsk Hydro fell 13.1 per cent to NKr65.2 after the Norwegian aluminium producer warned second-quarter earnings would fall 20 per cent short of its first-quarter level due to higher costs.French miner Eramet tracked London-listed copper producer Kazakhmys higher, rising 2.9 per cent to €525, after Kazakhmys said it was in merger talks with an unnamed company.
355;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Targeting TNT;;Nothing spices up a morning like receiving an unexpected package. Possible interest in TNT from rival FedEx sent shares in the mail group up by more than a quarter on Monday. Yet the idea of consolidation has surfaced periodically since UPS, another US competitor, listed in 1999. Will FedEx actually make a bid this time?The logic behind a deal is clear. FedEx and UPS are both strong globally in express delivery services, but lack scale in Europe. For example, FedEx serves only about 2 per cent of the intra-Europe express market, compared with TNT’s 17 per cent. With TNT’s exposure outside Europe limited mainly to a decent Australasian business and some nascent Asian exposure, the geographic fit would be attractive.However, the chances of picking up TNT on the cheap are slim. Its share price, before Monday’s pop, had halved from last year’s high of €36. Putting TNT’s express courier division on the same 15 times earnings multiple carried by FedEx and UPS suggests a valuation for that business alone of about €7bn, or €18 per share. This is before valuing other divisions – such as the reliable, but mature, Dutch postal arm that contributes half of TNT’s operating profit – or synergies, although scope for the latter looks limited. To get management talking, any bid would have at least to approach €30 per share. UPS, meanwhile, would be forced to consider a counterbid.The timing is not ideal either. FedEx has already notched up three profit warnings amid a sagging economy and rising oil prices. Profits are expected to fall by a fifth in the year ending May 2009 – hardly the ideal time to embark on the group’s first large-scale acquisition and then integrate a business based several thousand miles away. Investors have had a useful reminder of TNT’s attractions as a target, but delivery of a deal looks some way off.
356;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-13T18:45:12Z;M&A falls victim to sombre look;;"The global deal environment is set to deteriorate over the next 12 months as the grim economic outlook erodes the confidence of companies and their balance sheets weaken, KPMG has warned.KPMG’s Global M&A Predictor – an index that looks at 1,000 companies and the ratio of their share price to earnings – is forecasting a decrease in both appetite and capacity of companies to make deals. The warning shows a change in sentiment of companies that had hoped the credit crunch would provide opportunities to make acquisitions at cheaper valuations.It comes in spite of a pick-up in activity including Dow Chemical’s $18.8bn acquisition of Rohm & Haas; InBev’s negotiations with Anheuser-Busch; Schaeffler’s attempt at acquiring Continental of Germany and FedEx’s negotiations to buy TNT of The Netherlands.All regions, bar Latin America, have shown a fall in their respective forward price/earnings ratios coupled with a deterioration in the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.“We had hoped the gradual decline seen earlier this year could be maintained, but now all indicators are pointing at a marked fall across all regions and sectors,” said Stephen Barrett, global chair of KPMG’s corporate finance practice. “While we don’t think M&A is falling out of bed, there will definitely be a material decline.”Companies across the world are trading at a forward PE of 15.3 times forward earnings, compared to a multiple of 17 six months ago, KPMG found. At the same time, global balance sheets appear to be deteriorating, with the forecast net debt to ebitda ratio moving from 0.81 times to 0.93 timesGeorge Maddison, managing director of the UK investment banking team at Credit Suisse, said many corporations had put fresh banking facilities in place during 2007. “However, the operating sides of their businesses are increasingly under pressure, which always makes M&A deals more difficult.”The value of mergers and acquisitions in the first half sank by nearly a third from the same period last year to $1,860bn, according to data from Dealogic.Carlo Calabria, head of European M&A at Merrill Lynch, said he did not expect a further material decline: “CEOs remain in control of their corporate agenda and will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions.”"
357;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-07-11T22:31:54Z;FedEx in talks to buy Dutch rival TNT;;FedEx is in preliminary talks to acquire TNT, its smaller Dutch rival, in a deal that would bolster the package-delivery company’s parcel network throughout Europe.A deepening economic downturn and mounting fuel costs have hurt demand for package deliveries, reviving merger discussions that have continued in starts and stops for years.While FedEx and arch-rival United Parcel Service have coveted TNT’s European parcel business, they have been reluctant to take on the Dutch company’s slower-growing postal division.On Friday, FedEx’s market capitalisation was $22.8bn (€14.3bn), while TNT’s market capitalisation was $11.3bn.Deutsche Post’s £3.7bn to acquire Exel, the UK-based logistics group, in 2005 has so far been the biggest deal in the sector. Other transactions have included the $1.1bn merger of Deutsche Bahn, the German rail operator, and Bax Global, the logistics arm of US-based Brink’s and the €490m acquisition of Paris-based ACR Logistics by Kuhne & Nagel of Switzerland.DHL, TNT and FedEx together account for about 60 per cent of the European express logistics market in value terms.TNT, which primarily operates in Europe and North America, divides its business into two segments: express and mail.FedEx runs the world’s largest express-delivery company. The group mainly operates in the US, but in recent years has begun to expand its international operations.However, the US company in June posted its first quarterly loss in 11 years and projected earnings that fall short of analysts’ estimates because of fuel costs and declining demand.FedEx reported a fourth quarter loss of $241m on a writedown for its Kinko’s unit and predicted a “very difficult” environment in the coming year.Economists have cut their US growth forecasts for later this year and next as job losses, food and fuel prices and tougher lending rules hurt consumers.“As a matter of policy, FedEx does not comment on rumours or speculation about corporate development activities,” a company spokesman said.FedEx has sought to build out its Continental network as well as aiming to establish a presence in individual European countries. The company bought ANC in 2006 to strengthen its domestic express-delivery business in the UK.
358;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-25T22:12:51Z;Cargo version of TGV to court air traffic;;The company that designed and built France’s high-speed TGV trains is developing a cargo version that could see short-haul air cargo shifted to Europe’s growing high-speed rail network.Philippe Mellier, president of Paris-based Alstom Transport, told the Financial Times the plan was to win over from air the express parcel business of companies such as UPS and FedEx.“I think that very high-speed trains in the future could be a good alternative to the UPS and FedEx fleet of planes today,” he said.The area is one of several which Alstom aims to capture for rail business created by the rising cost of other, more fuel-intensive means of transport.A single-deck version of the new train could be based on the 360kph AGV model unveiled earlier this year. A double-deck variant could be based on the 320kph TGV Duplex used on France’s busiest high-speed routes.FedEx said it continued to support the Carex group, which is examining the viability of high-speed rail freight, which it helped to found two years ago. UPS, which currently avoids using European rail because of the priority given to passenger trains, said it would monitor developments in the area.High-speed freight’s potential is growing as new lines such as France’s LGV Est – which opened last year to near the German border – link up once-separate national high-speed networks. Many air cargo hubs also have high-speed rail connections.“There’s a high-speed train stop at Roissy,” Mr Mellier said, referring to Paris’s main Charles de Gaulle airport.“From there, you could run to London, to Marseilles, to wherever.”
359;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-24T21:29:15Z;US stocks hit lowest level in three months;;US stocks hit their lowest level in three months on Tuesday as investors weighed a handful of mixed earnings reports, a rally in financials and new data showing the continuation of a slump in house prices and consumer confidence.The day began in downbeat fashion after UPS, the world’s largest shipping carrier, cut its earnings expectations for the second quarter, blaming slowing US growth and higher fuel costs. UPS is often seen as an industrial bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the broader economy.Last week, rival FedExsimilarly disappointed markets when it posted an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss. Together, these results will heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.UPS lost 6 per cent to $62.26 while FedEx slipped 0.2 per cent to $79.98, helping to drag the industrials sector down 1.3 per cent.Markets took another downward leg after the release of data showing a further record decline in house prices and tumbling consumer confidence.Estimate-beating first-quarter results and full-year forecasts from food retailer Kroger helped offset some of that bad news, boosting the consumer staples sector and broader equity indices – but only for a time.Kroger added 7 per cent to $27.82 and was followed higher by Safeway and Supervalu which climbed 2.6 per cent to $29.65 and 3 per cent to $31.35 respectively. The consumer staples sector rose 0.2 per cent as a whole.The benchmark S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses but eventually closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,314.29 points – its lowest level since mid-March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,807.43 while the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,368.28.Analysts had expected trading to be subdued ahead of Wednesday’s decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve but the main indices have instead been notably choppy so far this week.In spite of the volatility, some observers found reason for optimism. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said recent market weakness could be a prelude to a recovery in the second half as the lagged impact of Fed easing, the fiscal stimulus and attractive valuations took effect.“We are in the middle of a healthy seasonal correction but if we retest the mid-March lows and bounce back we will have set up a nice triple bottom . . . and I think we could see record highs for equity markets in the next six to 12 months.”In the background, financials provided a rare fillip to market sentiment, shrugging off another round of analyst downgrades to climb 2.5 per cent after retesting five-year lows.The most heavily sold banks and brokerages were among the biggest gainers. SunTrust Bank advanced 4.1 per cent to $37.40, Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $24.35 and Wells Fargo climbed 3.9 per cent to $25.20. Wachovia also made ground, rising 5.6 per cent to $17.86 after it said it had hired Goldman Sachs to assess its loan portfolio.Even the consumer discretionary sector, initially hit hard by the latest data, just about held its own. Eastman Kodak led the way, soaring 13.7 per cent to $14.03 after the photography company said its board had authorised a $1bn share repurchase. Over the past year, however, Eastman shares have lost about half of their value.Starbucks and Darden Restaurants were also among the gainers, adding 1.7 per cent to $16.57 and 3.1 per cent to $31.60 respectively.Homebuilders proved im­pervious to the housing statistics, rallying after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the sector with an outperform rating on Centex, DR Horton and others. Centex and DR Horton advanced 7.5 per cent to $15.15 and 7.3 per cent to $12.62 respectively.But inflation worries have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, a trend that looks set to continue as producers pass on higher input costs.Dow Chemical said it would raise prices by up to 25 per cent and institute freight surcharges to combat high energy prices. The price rises are the second in a month. Dow fell 2.8 per cent to $36.58 while the material sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, losing 2.5 per cent – its biggest one day loss since the start of the month.

Shanghai led the region lower by plunging 6.5 per cent as investors worried that Beijing would not support share prices as it has in the past.Asia markets followed the example of New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to a three-month low overnight, in part on the first quarterly loss in 11 years at FedEx, the express shipper, which many investors consider a barometer for the wider US economy.Carmakers, electronics companies and banks bore the brunt of the drop across Asia.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index had lost 2 per cent to 141.49 by mid afternoon in Tokyo, wiping out around two-thirds of the gains made over the previous four days.Oil settled slightly above $136 a barrel in Asia, close to its peak overnight in New York.The Nikkei 225 average was trading 2.2 per cent lower by early afternoon in Tokyo at 14,130.17 and the broader Topix index was 2.4 per cent lower at 1,375.60.The yen strengthened to Y107.55 per dollar after depreciating as far as Y108.43 overnight, which added to the worries of Japan’s biggest exporters, as a strong currency makes their products less competitive.Honda Motor made the biggest loss among the members of the Nikkei during the morning session and Toyota, the world’s second biggest car maker after General Motors, was not far behind.Honda, which makes half of its sales in North America, dropped 3.4 per cent to Y3,700 and Toyota was down by 3.2 per cent to Y5,490.Fanuc, which makes robots and computer-controlled tools, fell by 1.6 per cent to Y11,670.The consumer electronics company Sony was down 2.6 per cent to Y5,220.

361;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
362;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-18T19:07:18Z;Kinko’s and fuel costs lead FedEx to loss;;"FedEx issued a bleak outlook for this year’s results, as mounting fuel costs and a deepening economic slump that limited the package-delivery company’s profit in the 2008 financial year show no signs of abating.“Record-high fuel prices and the weak US economy [damped] volume growth and substantially affected our bottom line,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said.FedEx, considered a bellwether for its role in facilitating global commerce, forecast a profit of $4.75 to $5.25 a share for the next financial year, below analysts’ expectations.The company said it would earn 80 cents to $1 in this period. The predictions did little to inspire confidence in a quick recovery from the slowdown; US stock indices had slipped by midday in New York.Writedowns caused by its struggling Kinko’s retail chain had wiped out FedEx’s profit in the fiscal fourth quarter.“Looking ahead to [2009], we do expect conditions to remain extremely challenging and we anticipate, in both the first-quarter guidance and the yearly target, the current economic weakness will continue and the current level of fuel costs will not mitigate,” Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts.FedEx, which cut its capital budget by 17 per cent to $2.9bn in 2008 as the economy weakened, aims to spend less than $3bn again this year.The company intends to close a freight depot in San Jose in California and has cut back plans to expand its network of shops.The cost cuts, along with the addition of more fuel-efficient aircraft to its fleet, will help FedEx restore the “upward trajectory of our financial performance that we saw when we achieved record earnings in fiscal year 07”, Mr Smith said.Fuel expenses jumped 54 per cent in the fourth quarter, offsetting revenue gains at FedEx’s express, ground and freight divisions.While FedEx can pass on higher prices to ­customers by raising fuel surcharges, the increases have failed to keep up with the surge in fuel.Higher energy costs and a deteriorating economic outlook have also spurred some customers to seek cheaper shipping options.FedEx reported a fourth-quarter loss of $241m, or 78 cents a share, compared with net income of $610m, or $1.96, in the same period a year ago.FedEx took an after-tax charge of $696m to account for the declining value of the Kinko business and brand.The Memphis-based company unveiled plans this month to change the name of its photocopy-shop chain to FedEx Office.Revenue rose 8 per cent to $9.87bn in the fourth ­quarter."
363;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-18T18:29:45Z;FedEx and fuel;;Calling all scientists: oil’s properties appear to change when it is subjected to high prices. Instead of greasing the wheels of industry, it causes them to start seizing up.Just ask FedEx, the self-styled “engine of the global economy”. Oil is burning a hole in its profits, accounting for half the increase in fourth-quarter operating costs. On its own, this is troubling but hardly a bolt from the blue. Although the headline fourth quarter loss came as a shock, once exceptional charges were stripped out earnings were in line with the consensus forecast. FedEx’s situation is a world away from that faced by those other kerosene- guzzlers, the airlines.But when FedEx does not deliver, it is time to worry. The company, not known for irrational exuberance, slashed earnings guidance for the year ending May 2009, implying a drop of up to 19 per cent. Clearly, it is not expecting a V-shaped recovery in the economy. As the economy slows and FedEx raises fuel surcharges, so customers decide they can afford to wait for deliveries rather than pay extra for express services, resulting in a stagflationary squeeze on margins.Longer term, FedEx hopes expensive crude will prompt consumers to switch to other fuels, causing crude prices to drop. As messages of reassurance go, this one is up there with Neville Chamberlain’s declaration of “peace for our time”. Demand destruction will come in the form of recession long before structural changes in behaviour have any impact. Moreover, to reduce oil prices, demand will have to fall in China and the Middle East, where oil consumption is still growing. Yet these are the very regions accounting for the bulk of America’s export growth – the one bright spot in the economic picture and the tailwind for FedEx’s fastest growing business, international deliveries.Post and read comment on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

364;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-18T15:58:34Z;UK builders hammered after alert on outlook;;Housebuilders resumed their downward trend on Wednesday after a Goldman Sachs warning for the sector and lowered earning forecasts.Persimmon, down 8.1 per cent to 379½p, took the FTSE 100’s wooden spoon and Redrow, off 17.5 per cent to 137¾p, finished as the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.There were sharp declines for Barratt Development, 11.1 per cent weaker at 80½p, Bellway, down 10.4 per cent to 473p, and Bovis Homes Group, which dropped 9.2 per cent to 342¾pAs Goldman Sachs lowered earnings forecasts for this year and next by 30 and 40 per cent respectively, the broker said: “The UK housing market is only at the start of a deep downturn, which could last up to three years”.Traders also attributed the falls to talk of a large portfolio of housebuilding stocks being liquidated.It was a dismal day for the London market. Weighed down by disappointing results from FedEx in the US and fears that the worst of the credit crunch had not yet passed, the FTSE 100 fell 105 points, or 1.8 per cent, to 5,756.9 while the FTSE 250 shed 189.1 points, or 1.9 per cent, to 9,534.8.Just eight blue-chip stocks managed to close in positive territory. The best was Smith & Nephew. Shares in the medical devices group rose 2.9 per cent to 595½p after UBS upgraded to “buy”, citing valuation.S&N was trading at 655p before the company revealed in May that it had discovered “unethical” sales practices at its Plus Orthopedics division.S&N was also supported by talk of a bid approach from a Japanese company.On the flipside, British Airways, down 5.2 per cent to 225¾p, lost further altitude after Morgan Stanley cut its target price to 149p.Penelope Butcher,analyst, said: “In our view, market prices are not yet discounting $136-plus fuel into perpetuity, or are assuming double-digit annual price increases can be implemented without demand destruction.“With two dozen bankruptcies worldwide year to date and a large number of aircraft groundings, the industry is in greater peril than is reflected in current valuations.”Tate & Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, lost 5.2 per cent to 402¼p after Citigroup lowered forecasts to reflect the impact of rising corn prices. Following the recent floods in the US corn belt, the cost of corn has risen 25 per cent.Pubs operator Enterprise Inns lost 5.2 per cent to 420p after ABN Amro removed the stock from its “buy” list in a review of the UK leisure sector.Analyst Simon Larkin said: “We fear sector share prices could test new lows as consensus earnings, which have barely changed, begin to fall for 2009/10” .Friends Provident, the life assurer, dipped 3 per cent to 116.1p, in spite of talk that it was set to dispose of its holding in F&C Asset Management, off 2 per cent at 155¾p.Separately, ABN Amro said that there was strong logic in Standard Life, down 2.5 per cent at 236½p, bidding for FP.“In our view, the two businesses are complementary. There are cost synergies, a good management fit at the top and the price is undemanding,” it said.International Ferro Metals grabbed top spot on the FTSE 250 leaderboard. Its shares added 6.4 per cent to 149p after Merrill Lynch started coverage with a “buy” rating and a 200p target price. The broker said: “Globally, stainless steel demand is growing at 6 per cent per annum. Unlike nickel, ferrochrome cannot be substituted in stainless steel production due to its unique properties,”.Informa dropped 8.7 per cent to 429p as traders took the view that Providence Equity Partners would struggle to finance a cash bid for the Lloyd’s List publisher.On Tuesday, United Business Media, down 0.4 per cent at 599p, said it had ended merger talks with Informa.UK Coal firmed 0.8 per cent to 556p on further rumours of predatory interest from Drax, up 0.3 per cent to 759½p. Drax owns the UK’s biggest coal-fired power station.
365;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
366;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-06-07T02:42:10Z;Treasury hints at retreat on aviation tax plan;;The Treasury has signalled its willingness to offer concessions on reforms to aviation tax that have been lambasted by business and long-haul airlines and drawn implicit threats of legal action from the US.Substantive changes to the proposal to replace air passenger duty with a tax per aircraft would mark a further unravelling of Alistair Darling’s pre-Budget report of last autumn. The chancellor has already been forced to stage partial retreats on capital gains tax and the levy on non-domiciled foreign residents in the UK.“We’re the last in a series of tax changes that has gone pear shaped,” an airlines industry insider told the Financial Times. A senior Labour MP said: “This is another Treasury mess.”The proposed reforms, due to come into force in November next year, would significantly affect airline passengers and operators, as well as raise more than £500m ($985m) extra a year for the strained Treasury coffers.Delivery companies such as FedEx and DHL would have to pay the new tax on freight-only flights, in contrast to their exemption from the existing air passenger duty, unless they decide to use other European airports instead and bring the goods into the UK by truck.Millions of passengers transferring between aircraft in the UK would also be brought within the scope of aviation duty for the first time. The proposed design of the new duty – charging for each flight, rather than charging passengers according to their final destination – means UK passengers could save significant amounts of tax by using non-UK hubs, such as breaking long-haul flights from Britain in Amsterdam.The US embassy has formally notified the government of its “significant policy and legal” concerns, warning that the proposals appear to breach the 1944 Chicago convention and last year’s “open skies” transatlantic agreement.Business is warning that the changes will cause significant damage to the UK aviation sector, to airport hubs such as Heathrow and to regional airports. The CBI employers’ group said the duty was “misconceived” and “likely to be ineffective” as a green tax.The Treasury signalled on Friday night that it would respond to the outcry over the impact on transit business in this autumn’s PBR.“We are aware of people’s views around this and, like all consultations, will take those into account in designing the final form of the tax,” an official said.
367;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-05-28T15:21:06Z;D Post enlists UPS in ‘radical’ delivery deal;;DHL’s parent company has turned to an arch-rival to help salvage its lossmaking US express-delivery business, agreeing to pay United Parcel Service $1bn annually to fly customers’ packages between North American cities.Deutsche Post will also shut down 30 per cent of DHL’s US infrastructure and pull out of some areas as part of a restructuring plan that will cost $2bn. The effort aims to stem years of losses at the US express business that may widen this year.For UPS, the arrangement will help ensure its fleet of aircraft remains full even if more of its customers opt for cheaper shipping options than overnight delivery.DHL’s decision to abandon its own air network reflects the company’s failure to loosen UPS’s and FedEx’s grip on the US market, as well as the spiralling cost of jet fuel.Deutsche Post said its underlying earnings would improve by $1bn annually by 2011. Frank Appel, chief executive, said the move was a “radical” solution that would maintain a strong US presence for DHL. Less than 4 per cent of shipments would be affected by the plans to cut infrastructure, the company said.John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express, said: “We have modelled this extremely carefully …for most customers it will have very little impact.” But up to 10 per cent of the 18,000 staff at DHL’s US Express division could lose their jobs.Both companies will retain their brands under a 10-year contract, with UPS ferrying DHL’s express, deferred and international packages between airports within the US, Canada and Mexico.DHL will still make pick-ups and deliveries, although it will do so using the US Postal Service in some sparsely-populated areas.Shares in Deutsche Post fell by 5 per cent after the announcement of the plan. UPS’s shares jumped 3.4 per cent in midday US trading.The outsourcing agreement would end DHL’s reliance on an ageing and inefficient fleet, according to Deutsche Post.Deutsche Post now expects the underlying loss for its US Express business to widen to $1.3bn before interest and tax. That would be reduced to $500m by 2010 and $300m by 2011 through the restructuring, the company said. Mr Appel did not say the US express business would eventually be profitable, saying it was “not a standalone business”.John Allan, chief financial officer, said the company expected “further erosion” in its US business this year. Deutsche Post cut guidance for underlying earnings before interest and tax this year by 2 per cent to €4.1bn ($6.4bn), but left estimates for 2009 unchanged. “The rest of the group is trading well,” Mr Allan said.
368;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-05-22T03:38:49Z;Business Post plans faster letter delivery;;Business Post, the parcels and postal delivery group, is to launch a letters service in the summer that will guarantee next-day delivery anywhere in the UK.Customers will send letters over the internet to UK Mail, a Business Post subsidiary, which will print them in colour at depots close to the destinations. The company will then put the letters in envelopes and hand them over to Royal Mail for delivery over “the final mile”.The iMail service could reduce the carbon footprint of a letter by up to 80 per cent, Business Post said. It will also appeal to big corporate users that are keen to reduce emissions produced by their businesses.“This will be our first foray into the first-class postal market,” said Guy Buswell, chief executive.“It will also allow us to offer our service to consumers and small businesses whose mailing requirements are too small for our existing services.”UK Mail has doubled its share of the British postal market for the second year running. It collects and sorts about 11 per cent of mail before passing it on to Royal Mail for delivery to homes and businesses around the country.The group’s shares rose 30p to 305p after it reported pre-tax profit up 45 per cent in the year to March 31, from £9.8m ($19.3m) to £14.2m.Revenues from its mail operation rose 52 per cent on the previous year, to reach almost 38 per cent of the group’s total.Business Post plans to change its name to UK Mail at the general meeting in July in recognition of the growing importance of the division.The parcels division, which still accounts for more than half of revenues and profits, continued to suffer from the loss last year of a contract with Federal Express.Excluding the FedEx contract, revenues rose 2 per cent and margins increased from 7.8 per cent to 8.6 per cent.Earnings per share were up 40.6 per cent, from 12.8p to 18p. The final dividend of 10.8p is unchanged, as is the full-year dividend of 17.2p.FT Comment● First-mover advantage is providing impressive results in the liberalised UK postal market, though Business Post’s parcels division continues to face fierce competition. Its broker Dresdner Kleinwort is forecasting £18.1m pre-tax profit for this year, putting the group on a multiple of 13.4 at last night’s closing price. With plenty of opportunity for more growth in mail, and with parcels no longer ailing, the share price has further scope for recovery.
369;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-05-18T17:54:07Z;FedEx chief confident on US exports;;Fred Smith, founder and chief executive of package-delivery pioneer FedEx, said growing demand from developing countries for high-technology and other valuable goods would assure continued growth in US exports even if the dollar’s slide reversed.“It’s a powerful statement about the integration of the global economy,” Mr Smith told the Financial Times.The growth in exports, which touched a record in February, have spared the nation’s economy from an even deeper slump, brought about by mounting energy costs and the housing market’s upheaval.Economists from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have predicted that the narrowing trade deficit could add one-half of a percentage point to the US’s gross domestic product in the first quarter.“Were it not for US exports, the country would be in a significant recession right now,” Mr Smith said. “The consumer is getting clobbered.”While the dollar’s decline has helped make US goods more attractive to overseas businesses and consumers, it will not be the primary driver of a sustained growth in exports for high-value products, Mr Smith said.The burgeoning wealth of emerging economies has spurred demand for many high-end goods made in the US, from network routers to artificial knees and hips.The advent of electronic commerce has eliminated language barriers and other traditional impediments to international trade, he said.“People are getting wealthier in China, in Russia and the Middle East, and they can afford to fix that bad knee or hip that they might just have lived with a decade ago,” Mr Smith said.“When you get into the high-tech and high value-added trades, it’s the globalisation of those markets that’s more powerful than the currency.”FedEx warned investors this month that the run-up in fuel costs would leave the company short over its quarterly profit forecast.While FedEx can pass price increases to customers by increasing its fuel surcharges, the higher fees do not kick in immediately. “We can’t pass it along fast enough to recover it,” said Mr Smith.
370;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-05-13T06:01:41Z;Event processing: A monitor that can set alarms ringing;;Complex event processing (CEP) is a nascent three-letter acronym for an old concept: a way of sifting masses of business data in real time to enable patterns to be discerned and better business decisions made.It can be thought of, along with Service Oriented Architecture and Business Activity Monitoring, as an essential component of a Business Process Management suite of software.A white paper from BEA Systems, the middleware group now in the process of being taken over by Oracle, says the goal of CEP is to enable information contained in the events flowing through all layers of the organisation to be discovered, understood in terms of its macro-level impact and acted upon in real time.Put together business process management and complex event processing and you get intelligent business processes that react to changing conditions in real time, providing continuous visibility, BEA says.Signals that cause the CEP system to raise an alarm can come either from the outside – a particular item of data causes a reaction – or from the inside, where the system itself polls its sources on a regular basis looking for significant change. Legacy systems are not typically event-driven: this additional layer of software is needed to coordinate their activities.Traditionally, CEP has been the preserve of the financial community, used to support algorithmic trading, where computers are programmed to make automated decisions on when to buy and sell and how to execute a set of orders.Computer systems can act at a speed that would be impossible for any human trader tasked with monitoring separate flows of information – stock prices on one set of screens, for example, and world news on another – looking for correlations that might suggest a trade is desirable.CEP, business activity monitoring and business process management are spreading well beyond the financial services industries, however. Phil Gilbert, president of Lombardi, a specialist US-based BPM software group, says the company has been working with Dell Computer for several years.“With Fedex and UPS we are coordinating Dell’s global computer shipments,” he says. “We receive real-time feeds from third-party logistics carriers for the status of every single shipment.“The moment any of those goes into a ‘distressed’ state, the software fires off a dispatch in real time to people in the call centre based on who the customer is and in what geography. Humans can then deal with the exception and ensure the computer is delivered. Over the course of the past four or five years, this has saved Dell hundreds of millions of dollars.”Dr Giles Nelson, director of technology for the European arm of the US-based group Progress Software, says systems of this kind have been around – but with disadvantages.“Either people would have had to build a bespoke system tailored for a particular use (and therefore expensive and inflexible) or they would have used a database management system,” he says.“All the data would have been brought in and stored in the DBMS which would have been structured to provide answers to queries easily. It would not have scaled. With the quantities of data involved, you would not have been able to get an answer quickly enough.“An event processing system turns the DBMS concept on its head, saying: ‘We know pretty well what question we want, we know what pattern of behaviour we are looking at in all this data’. CEP enables you to do that better.”Dr Nelson objects to use of the term “complex” and last month IBM renamed it “business event processing” in an attempt to demystify the subject. But whatever it is called, it is becoming critical to modern business.Colin Clarke, vice-president for customers at the event processing company StreamBase Systems, points to the dangers that CEP addresses.“Recent high-profile examples such as the meltdown at Société Générale have shown the dangers inherent in relying on anything less than monitoring profit and loss and risk-based exposure in real time, “ he says.“Trading systems that monitor not only for anomalies but also for risks inherent in trading must trigger affirmative, swift action.”He acknowledges the problem of the sheer volume of data modern businesses have to deal with.“Real time profit and loss systems and portfolio stress-testing require platforms able not only to handle tremendous volumes but also to incorporate complicated pricing algorithms that correctly price complex securities while capturing intricate interactions between diverse asset classes,” he argues.Indeed, research across Europe commissioned this year by Progress Software indicated that 75 per cent of business managers are expected to absorb data from at least 11 regions.The demand for comprehensive, accurate and current business information was also found to be acute and 88 per cent of businesses said they needed better information flow up and down the supply chain. Only 50 per cent of businesses canvassed had access to information in real-time.“In a world where large enterprises are bombarded with 1m events a second,” BEA Systems concludes, “CEP is the only technology able to filter out unnecessary data, recognise patterns and aggregate, process and derive composite events that matter.”
371;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-04-09T20:49:57Z;Wall St sags after disappointing earnings;;Wall Street stocks fell the most in eleven days as the unfolding first-quarter earnings season highlighted mounting concerns about the outlook for the US economy while record oil prices also weighed on sentiment.United Parcel Service, the logistics and package-delivery group, dropped 3.7 per cent to $70.57 after it cut its first-quarter earnings estimate, saying that domestic shipments were slowing as the US economy weakens.The company is seen as a bellwether of the wider business environment and its pre-announcement will add to concerns that the US economic slowdown, long debated by experts, is starting to be felt in the corporate world.“We think UPS’s numbers are clearly saying ‘recession’,” Rick Paterson, an analyst at UBS said.“UPS is the big dog in the transport space, hence we think FedEx will also take it on the chin and this profit warning will also resonate with US trucking, railroad, and logistics equities.” FedEx shares fell 3.1 per cent to $93.11.A broad-based sell off sent the benchmark S&P 500 index down for a second succesive session. It lost 0.8 per cent to 1,354.49 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,322.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4 per cent to 12,527.26.Retailers were in focus after Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings group, said fourth quarter profit fell as declining home values hit consumer spending.The company also forecast first-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ estimates.Bed Bath shares fell 4.7 per cent to $29.47 in the run up to the annoucement. Earlier in the day analysts at Piper Jaffray downgraded from “neutral” to “sell”.Amazon, the online retailer, lost 3.8 per cent to $74.39 and Google fell 0.8 per cent to $464.19 after Lehman Brothers said its first-quarter profits were at risk from an economic slowdown.Circuit City, the harassed electronics retailer, swung unexpectedly into profit in the fourth quarter, thanks to a round of cost-cutting. But it said it expected to post a loss in the first quarter, reinforcing impressions that plummeting consumer confidence is begging to take its toll on the high street. Shares in the group, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value in the past year, fell 1.8 per cent to $4.45.Homebuilders dragged on the consumer discretionary sector for a second day. Lennar dropped 7.3 per cent to $18.54 while Pulte Homes lost 6.2 per cent to $14.01.The news was not all bad though. Sealy, the bedding manufacturer, and California Pizza Kitchen, the chain restaurant operator, jumped after beating analysts’ earning estimates with their reported and forecast first quarter results.Sealy jumped 9 per cent to $7.74 while California bounced 5 per cent to $15.Industrial conglomerates, which were downgraded by analysts on Tuesday, were mixed. Boeing shares rose 4.8 per cent to $78.60, after it said delays to the 787 Dreamliner would not impact on its 2008 profit forecasts. But UPS’s outlook weighed on the sector and knocked transport stocks. Ryder System fell 4.4 per cent to $61.29.On Tuesday technology stocks bore the brunt of investor irritation, after a number of companies posted disappointing first-quarter results and forecasts.That trend continued on Wednesday with poor results and forecasts from FormFactor, a maker of chip-testing equipment, and Spansion, a maker of memory chips for mobile phones. FormFactor dropped 2.9 per cent to $18.90 while Spansion lost 0.3 per cent to $2.99.Still, news that a Japanese memory maker had raised prices helped buoy US peers. Micron advanced 3.5 per cent to $6.77. SanDisk climbed 6.5 per cent to $27.21.Downtrodden financial stocks fell again on Wednesday, hitting their lowest levels this month after a number of companies reported increased holdings of hard to value securities.An index of financial stocks dipped 1.8 per cent, while the S&P 500 investment banking index dopped 3 per cent, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 7.2 per cent to $40.54.The three largest US mortgage insurers also tumbled after Standard & Poor’s cut their ratings. MGIC Investment fell 5.1 per cent to $10.90, PMI Group slipped 8.3 per cent to $5.66 and Radian Group plunged 12.6 per cent to $5.14.Even Citigroup, initially made ground on reports that it planned to sell nearly $12bn in leveraged loans, closed down 0.8 per cent at $23.58.Energy stocks were the only ones to end the day in the black. The sector gained for its eighth session in a row after oil prices hit record highs. Chevron added 0.8 per cent to $89.95, while Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $89.70.
372;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-04-05T00:40:12Z;When business is pleasure;;"Gone are the days of travelling salesmen hoofing it door to door with suitcases filled with encyclopedias, bibles, and beauty supplies. Ours is an international economy; we do business by e-mail, fax, FedEx conference calls and video chats, and yet despite the efficiency and brilliance of our electronic interconnection, on occasion, many of us still have to show up in person in order to get the job done.What does it take to make business travel physically and emotionally tolerable – or better yet – worth it? To stay ahead of the curve, I travel as early in the day as possible: there are fewer delays, and it can be so depressing to be on the last flight out of one city and land in another that’s been asleep for hours. And, if I am going to be away from home, I want my accommodation to be nicer than home. I am a true hotel aficionado – as bold and adventurous as I want to be on my field trips, I don’t want to be put off by my hotel room. It is not beyond me to arrive in a strange city, take one look at my hotel, and be instantly on the phone about changing not just rooms, but hotels.Because I travel early, I often arrive in a city well before check-in time, which is perfect. As an author, the majority of my work events are readings or lectures given in the evening – so my days are left free for exploring. All over the world, I orient myself by visiting museums. There is a universal language to museum-going, a hushed reverence for these sacred spaces.Immediately any difficulties evaporate and I am returned to a relaxed version of myself. And at a time when so much regional culture has been lost, when cities are filled with brand name chain stores, local museums remain a way to quickly get in touch with what is unique to each place.I often skip a city’s enormous and infamous museums, which can be exhausting, and opt for smaller more individual collections. A few favourites include the Phillips Collection in Washington DC, America’s first museum of modern art, opened in 1921 in the home of Duncan Phillips. The collection includes Renoir’s “Luncheon of the Boating Party” and works by Monet, Cézanne, Bonnard, Picasso and Matisse, who used to visit the museum when he was in Washington.One of the great things about having a travel passion is that it gives me something to talk about with my hosts in each city. In Heidelberg I set off in search of the Prinzhorn Collection, which I’d heard about for years but never expected to have the occasion to visit in person. Assembled in the early 1920s by art historian and physician Hans Prinzhorn, the collection contains thousands of artworks produced by people in mental asylums.I spent the afternoon walking the length of Heidelberg before I located the collection in a former lecture hall at the Psychiatric University Hospital. The art work was mesmerising for its specificity, intensity and obsession with detail.In Berlin I had limited time and visited the Jewish Museum, which is in a building constructed in 1735 as part of the Court of Justice and reinvented in the 1990s by architect Daniel Libeskind. In a city so filled with history, and the inescapable remnants of difficult times, it is amazing just to walk through the old neighbourhoods. I spent the night at Berlin’s Hotel Adlon Kempinski overlooking the Brandenburg Gate. It’s a perfect hotel for business travellers; the rooms are excellent for getting work done while exploring a reborn city and the Adlon’s complex history parallels the country’s evolution.In Cologne, the Hotel Excelsior Ernst looks out on the city’s dramatic cathedral. During the first world war the British army used the hotel as its headquarters; during the second world war the hotel was virtually destroyed. The Ernst is a delightful, truly European hotel, offering guests a choice of pillows. The nearby Museum Ludwig features an international collection of contemporary art, and a great café, while The Wallraf-Richartz-Museum is the oldest museum here and holds significant works by Rubens and Rembrandt.My long-awaited visit to the Käthe-Kollwitz museum in Berlin was missed due to a gastronomic detour – the Lindt Chocolate Factory Museum, a bit kitschy, but it did remind me of childhood visits to the Hershey chocolate factory in Pennsylvania and I bought enough chocolate to last for days.Zurich’s Hotel Baur Au Lac is a fantastic spot for combining business, pleasure and maybe even a little romance. The service was among the best anywhere and prices for the annual white asparagus were also among the highest anywhere. In Zurich I oriented myself with a visit to the Fraumünster Church, founded in 853, with its beautiful stained glass windows by Marc Chagall, and spent the afternoon at the Frauenbadi women’s swimming pool. The pool is literally in the river and women, young and old, topless or not, take a midday break here. With a panoramic view of the city in the background, this unexpected stop was beyond relaxing.Long business trips often run into a weekend. Rather than feeling stuck in a city where I’ve been for work, I love to hop on a train and go somewhere special, such as Paris. The Plaza Athénée is one of the world’s most perfect spots – all the more if you’re trying to combine work, pleasure and luxury. If you’ve been good up until now, with no midnight raids on the mini-bars, you can treat yourself to a heavenly meal at this three-star Alain Ducasse restaurant. The setting is opulent, an otherworldly calm floats over the dining room, the service is fit for royalty, (something one could easily get used to) and the food beyond sublime.Then breakfast at the Plaza Athénée is surely the most memorable you will ever have in your life – starve yourself the night before and be sure to leave at least an hour and a half to linger over the meal. But don’t worry if you can’t fit in another mouthful – as you are leaving, they will hand you a bag of baked goodies to take with you – which is perfect if you are going straight to the airport and heading home. And when your family asks how your trip was, you can hand them a brioche: “Taste this.”The American novelist AM Homes’s most recent book is ‘The Mistress’s Daughter’ (Penguin)……………………………………..Culture with comfortMuseums

373;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-04-03T18:13:03Z;ATA grounds flights and files for protection;;ATA Airlines on Thursday cancelled all its flights, fired most of its 2,230 employees and filed for bankruptcy protection, becoming the latest casualty in a US commercial-aviation industry buffeted by record fuel costs, competition and ebbing demand.ATA also blamed its demise on FedEx, which pulled the carrier from an agreement to transport US military personnel and their families internationally. The airlift contract comprised most of ATA’s charter business.The shutdown dealt a blow to Southwest Airlines, which had reached a 2005 code-sharing agreement with ATA that allowed each carrier to book passengers on the other’s flights. Southwest had viewed the carrier as a springboard to its first international offerings.With the bankruptcy protection filing, the Indianapolis-based carrier’s second in the past four years, ATA joined Hawaii’s Aloha Airgroup in ending services amid soaring fuel prices. The rises have ended the US airline industry’s modest recovery from its last downturn that followed the September 2001 terrorist attacks.Founded in 1973, ATA was once the nation’s biggest charter carrier. The company built a presence at Chicago’s Midway Airport serving domestic destinations and vacation spots such as Cancun, Mexico, and Hawaii. The carrier filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2004, emerging two years later.A unit of Global Aero Logistics since last year, ATA slashed its flight schedule last month to cut costs and, at the time of its shutdown, was serving 10,000 passengers daily with 29 aircraft, many of which are leased.Southwest, which had planned to use ATA’s flights to Mexico and the Caribbean to offer passengers international destinations, said it would look for a new partner.ATA’s troubles came as Southwest drew scrutiny in Washington on Thursday from members of Congress for the carrier’s recent safety-inspection violations and allegations of improper relationships with federal aviation officials.Spurred by an ongoing US House committee investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration last month ordered Southwest to pay a record fine of $10.2m for continuing to fly more than 100 aircraft that had missed inspections.“I fear that complacency may have set in at the highest levels of FAA management, reflecting a pendulum swing away from vigorous enforcement of compliance, toward a carrier-favourable, cozy relationship,” said James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the committee.
374;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-03-31T20:38:16Z;US stocks rise on Treasury plan;;Wall Street stocks rose on Monday, breaking a four day losing streak as markets broadly welcomed the US Treasury’s plans to shake up the regulatory framework of the American financial system.All eyes were on Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary, as he unveiled a “blueprint” for overhauling the current system including giving the Federal Reserve increased powers to regulate investment banks and limit the risks they take.However, Mr Paulson said “more regulation” was not the answer, that the proposals would take many years to implement and the Treasury’s priority would be resolving the current market turmoil.The news provided a small boost to stock markets sold off as initial enthusiasm for the Fed’s extraordinary interventions two weeks ago began to wane.Downtrodden investment banks rallied with an index of their stocks adding 1.5 per cent. During the past year, the S&P 500 investment bank index has lost 26.6 per cent.Morgan Stanley shares rose 2.2 per cent to $45.70 while Wachovia climbed 3.9 per cent to $27.00.Energy stocks also moved higher thanks to sale and contracts news.Noble, the offshore oil and gas drilling contractor, said it could benefit from contracts with Brazil’s Petrobras worth $4bn, driving the shares up 3.4 per cent to $49.67.Rowan, another drilling company, said on Monday it would divest its LeTourneau Technologies unit and possibly buy back up to $400m of its own shares, which climbed 8.7 per cent to $41.18.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,322.70, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.8 per cent to 2,279.10.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,262.89.The latest Chicago Purchasing Managers index data also lifted indices suggesting that manufacturing activity in the Midwest contracted in March, although by less than some had feared.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “Right now the market is grasping for any piece of economic news that that may suggest the economy has stopped declining.”Industrial stocks gained with General Electric adding 1.1 per cent to $37.01 while Fedex rose 1.5 per cent to $92.67.Consumer discretionary stocks, which came under heavy selling pressure last week after JC Penney cut its earnings forecast, bounced back on the news.Macy’s, another department store operator, rallied 5 per cent to $23.06 while JC Penney climbed 06 per cent to $37.71.For the most part, recent economic data have lent weight to fears that the credit crisis has tipped the US economy into a recession and that has weighed heavily on investor sentiment.Despite the day’s rally, those concerns, and the implication that corporate earnings estimates remain too optimistic, dragged markets down for a fifth month in a row. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent over the month – depressed by poor performance in the health care, energy and financial sectors.During the month only the telecoms, industrials and consumer staples sectors have managed to find any consistent momentum.Bad news for leading drug makers Merck and Schering-Plough undercut positive sentiment Monday. A day earlier an expert panel said patients should use drugs other than Vytorin, the cholesterol drug jointly developed by the two companies, after a key study failed to show the drug worked better than cheaper alternatives at reversing heart disease.Lehman Brothers downgraded Merck from “overweight” to “equal-weight” and cut its price target on the stock from $35 to $20.The shares were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 14.7 per cent to $37.95 per cent, while Schering shares tumbled 26 per cent to $14.41.Lehman came into focus after it filed a suit against Marubeni, one of Japan’s biggest trading firms, for $352m after the US bank fell victim to an alleged fraud by two former employees of the Japanese group.Lehman shares, already depressed by consistent but uncorroborated talk of liquidity problems at the investment bank, fell a further 0.6 per cent to $37.64.Meanwhile, shares in Citigroup advanced 2.8 per cent to $21.42 on reports that it intended to hive off its credit card unit and overhaul its consumer unit as part of a wide-ranging reorganisation to restore profitability.Citigroup shares added 2.8 per cent to $21.42.In other corporate news, Boeing, the commercial aircraft maker and a partner received a $10.4bn contract for the V-22 Osprey.Boeing shares added 1.2 per cent to $74.37.Fortune Brands stock climbed 8.8 per cent to $69.50 after the company said it would begin a share buyback after losing out in its bid for Vin & Sprit AB, the maker of Sweden’s Absolut Vodka, to Pernod Ricard.
375;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-03-25T10:20:11Z;Logistics: Big three seek ways to keep delivering;;For the first three weeks of 2008, US businesses and consumers continued to ship packages and parcels ahead of the pace they set a year earlier, undaunted by a spate of gloomy headlines and government reports on the weakening health of the nation’s economy.By late January, as though corporate America’s optimism that the downturn would soon pass had drained, they began to slow, according to United Parcel Service. UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, announced on March 12 that volume at its domestic business was mired in a six-week slump.UPS, FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL, the trio of big integrated logistics companies, pride themselves on their vast global reach and indispensable role in facilitating international trade. But UPS’s warning served as the latest reminder that their fortunes remain closely tied to that of the world’s largest economy. More than 45 per cent of the world’s shipments are tied to American companies, says John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express. “The greatest worry for us is the US,” he says. “The general US economic situation is of particular concern.”The country’s gross domestic product, which expanded at a rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, may have slowed further during the first three months of 2008. Housing prices have declined, employers are trimming payrolls, and consumer confidence has slipped to its lowest level since the start of the Iraq War in 2003.If the malaise does not lift soon, UPS says, the company will fall short of its quarterly profit forecast of 94-98 cents a share. The Atlanta-based group’s international-package and supply-chain arms remained on track to meet their goals.UPS today produces about 30 per cent of its revenue and profit outside the US.“Our goal obviously is to increase that,” says Scott Davis, UPS chief executive.In a strategy adopted more than 10 years ago, UPS has sought to reduce its dependence on the fleet of brown trucks that ferry packages in the US. Through acquisitions, partnerships and organic expansion, UPS’s package operations serve more than 200 countries.By 2010, the company expects to generate 40 per cent of its operating profit from its international, supply-chain management and freight divisions.UPS first sold stock to the public in 1999 after almost 100 years under private ownership. Mr Davis, elevated to the top post in January, is the first UPS chief executive who has not spent his entire career at the company.Investors expect that Mr Davis, a former chief financial officer, will help redefine UPS as an “enabler of global commerce” that is “standing on the doorstep of tremendous opportunity”, as he said during a March presentation.That will mean shaking UPS’s reputation as a stodgy company unwilling to flex its financial muscles to pursue opportunities for growth. Its shares have trailed those of arch-rival FedEx in six of the past eight years.Less than two weeks after Mr Davis’s promotion, UPS unveiled a new balance-sheet strategy in which the company will take on more debt to buy back stock and make acquisitions. For years it maintained the highest corporate investment grade, a strategy that investors argued no longer made sense given its financial strength and potential for higher growth.As the company that invented the overnight-delivery industry in 1971, FedEx executives have not had to persuade Wall Street that they will move boldly to spur growth. Like UPS, the company has braced for a slowdown in the US.FedEx twice trimmed its fiscal-year earnings forecast in late 2007, in part because of weakening demand for US freight. To avoid another warning, the company will count on cost controls and growth from its international express delivery arm.FedEx has also faced a slew of lawsuits from contracted drivers claiming the company treats them as full-time employees without the same benefits, and a US Internal Revenue Service audit on the way those drivers were classified. The company has said it does not expect that the IRS’s rulings will result in losses.“We’re not getting any resolution any time soon,” says Jon Langenfeld, an analyst with Robert W Baird.The same cannot be said for DHL’s future in the US. Deutsche Post said it would reveal its plan for the business in May.Deutsche Post furthered its push into the US with the 2003 purchase of Airborne Express, an overnight-delivery company, and has invested more than €2bn ($3bn) on the network, according to HSBC Global Research analysts.“We have our own specific issues,” Mr Mullen says. “We tried to enter a market, where we have been pretty successful. But it has come at a huge financial price.”The business, which remains a distant third in market share behind UPS and FedEx, continues to lose money. The mounting losses, including a fourth-quarter charge of $922m, has compelled Deutsche Post to review its options for the business and encouraged speculation that the German postal group will withdraw from the US.After the writedown, Deutsche Post’s quarterly net income fell from €649m to €255m. Annual profit dropped from €1.92bn to €1.39bn.The company says it does not intend to exit the market completely.“We invested a huge amount of money in building a third alternative in the US,” Mr Mullen says. “We’re not about to walk away from that.“We have to find a solution that allows us to maybe scale back our ambitions from trying to be all things to all people, to match them in every zip code, every product.”
376;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-03-24T22:39:38Z;Entrepreneurial way to deliver a package;;When Scott Davis sold II Morrow, a “little technology company in Oregon”, to United Parcel Service, he figured it would not be long before he left the package-delivery behemoth for another startup.“I really had no intention of staying at a big company like UPS,” Mr Davis told the Financial Times. “I’m an entrepreneur.”Mr Davis’s restlessness faded quickly, however, once he began to recognise the opportunities that lay ahead for his new employer, and his own career, as UPS began its transformation from a stodgy domestic courier to one of corporate America’s truly global companies.His perseverance has paid off. In January, Mr Davis became the first UPS chief executive who did not start his career at the company handling packages or driving one of its ubiquitous brown trucks.Twenty-two years after the II Morrow deal, Mr Davis stood before a roomful of investors and analysts at New York’s Grand Hyatt hotel hoping to persuade his audience to give UPS a chance, too.Wall Street has high hopes for Mr Davis, a known quantity from his years as chief financial officer.He is expected to continue to extend UPS’s reach abroad, reducing the company’s dependence on a domestic package business that ebbs and flows with the US economy, and shake up a culture whose conservative sensibilities, some say, has at times hindered its growth.The company’s shares have trailed those of archrival FedEx in six of the past eight full years since UPS first sold stock to the public in 1999, following almost a 100 years under private ownership.Mr Davis sees his role as merely executing a plan his predecessors, including his immediate one, Mike Eskew, helped shape.“Mike Eskew was the architect for where we are today,” Mr Davis said.“He did all the hard work, he did the acquisitions, the integrations. We’re in a position now where we’re hopefully able to reap the rewards.”UPS now operates in more than 200 countries, boasts the world’s ninth-largest fleet of aircraft and manages the supply chains of corporate clients ranging from retailers to technology equipment manufacturers.And analysts say Mr Davis has begun to make a mark.Less than two weeks after he succeeded Mr Eskew as chief executive, UPS unveiled plans to borrow as much as $10bn to buy back stock and make acquisitions.UPS’s once-stodgy culture may also continue to evolve under Mr Davis. A visitor to the cafeteria in the company’s airy Atlanta headquarters last year could not help but notice the prevalence of men sporting white shirts and ties – a by-product of UPS’s buttoned-down culture.Mr Davis said he would also take steps to assure more women and foreign nationals hold key management posts, so that they, as he once did, were able to see a path to the top.While Mr Davis and his colleagues may never be accused of mimicking the candour of Fred Smith, the celebrated entrepreneur who runs FedEx, the UPS team’s detailed overview of their businesses at the company’s investor meeting this month pleased analysts.“They’re starting to thaw,” Dan Ortwerth, an Edward Jones analyst, said of UPS.“The change of leadership turned up the dial on the gas burner on the stove, increasing the rate of that thaw.”
377;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-03-20T14:04:58Z;FedEx warns of fuel costs and weak economy;;FedEx warned that mounting fuel costs and a weak US economy, which crimped quarterly profit, may weigh on the package-delievery company’s results well into its next fiscal year.The company’s outlook echoed that of arch-rival United Parcel Service, whose executives noted last week that domestic shipments began to ebb in late January.“FedEx faces a challenging economic environment that includes persistently high oil prices, sluggish US growth and continued concerns in the credit markets,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in a statement.Net income for the fiscal third quarter slipped 6 per cent to $393m, or $1.26 a share, as fuel costs and other operating expenses outpaced a 10 per cent increase in revenue. Demand slackened for US express packages, less-than-truckload shipments, and copy and printing services.The Memphis-based company, which forecast that fourth-quarter profit will fall to $1.60-$1.80 from $1.96, trimmed its annual capital-spending budget to $3bn.“Looking ahead to our fiscal 2009, we are expecting a continuation of fourth-quarter trends, which would result in limited earnings growth next year,” Alan Graf, FedEx chief financial officer said. “We are scrutinising all expenses and investments to realign them with the current environment.”
378;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-03-07T01:41:35Z;Deutsche Post set to reveal plan for DHL arm;;Deutsche Post is to reveal in May how it intends to sort out its troubled US express delivery business, the logistics group’s new chief executive said after an impairment charge of almost €600m ($922m) reduced fourth-quarter profits.Losses in the “flawed” business were “unacceptable”, while the faltering US economy had caused further problems at the end of the year, Frank Appel said.But Deutsche Post said it expected group pre-tax profits to reach €3.2bn this year, against €2.19bn last year – the first time it has given guidance for this measure. It reiterated that underlying earnings before interest and tax should be €4.2bn.Two weeks after taking over as chief executive, a cautious Mr Appel said he would not be pressured into judgments about the future of Postbank, the German retail bank in which Deutsche Post holds a majority stake.Deutsche Post is expected to initiate a sale of Postbank this year and interest would be expected to be strong from German rivals lacking a strong retail banking base.Postbank, which gained 1m customers last year, was “a luxury problem” that would allow Deutsche Post to play an active role in German banking consolidation, said Mr Appel, who refused to set a timetable for a possible sale.DHL, Deutsche Post’s express subsidiary, has only a small market share in the US behind UPS and FedEx.But Mr Appel, who was propelled into the top job after Klaus Zumwinkel stepped down last month amid a probe into his tax affairs, said pulling out of the US express business was not an option.Axel Funhoff, an analyst at ING, said Deutsche Post might seek a cost-cutting tie-up with FedEx that would allow it to maintain international deliveries in the US and outsource its domestic service.After a €594m write-down in the US express business, group fourth-quarter net income fell from €649m to €255m, while annual net income declined from €1.92bn to €1.39bn.Underlying earnings rose 7.6 per cent to €3.76bn and should reach €4.7bn in 2009, Deutsche Post said.Annual revenues rose almost 5 per cent to €63.5bn. Earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 1.15p.John Allan, chief financial officer, said Deutsche Post remained committed to returning more cash to shareholders via an increased dividend and had agreed property sales of €350m since November.Acquisition spending of €300m in 2007 was “the lowest for many years”, Mr Allan said.
379;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-02-25T02:10:33Z;Why pilots are forced to stay for a long haul;;Pilots at Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines may have seen the terms of their compensation and benefits change from one labour contract to the next but no figure matters more than the one next to their names on their union’s seniority list.Now, as the two airlines inch closer to a merger agreement, the pilots are grappling with how to best combine two lists into one. For some members, where they land on the list could change what they’re paid, what plane they fly – even where they live.“Seniority is really the keystone of a pilot’s career,” says Derek Martin, vice-chairman of the FedEx pilots’ union. “Every aspect of your career, from the time you’re hired to the time you retire, is driven by your seniority number. It stays with you.”Because Mr Martin was hired 12 years ago, near the start of a long recruiting wave at the delivery company, he has always reached the next phase of his career faster than many of his peers. Within two years he was first officer on a wide-bodied jet ferrying packages internationally.The captain says the key to his rapid advancement was his position on the FedEx pilot seniority list. Its importance is also a reason Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, in talks to merge since last month, may never combine.Now that the two US carriers have found common ground on a chief executive, a corporate headquarters and a new labour contract, the deal hinges on whether the two pilots groups can agree where members will rank following the merger.While the airlines can proceed without an agreement from pilots, its absence could undermine the companies’ pledge to present a unified front with employees as they seek regulatory approval.Delta and Northwest executives had hoped to present their boards with a definitive agreement last week, people familiar with the matter said. But as the weekend arrived the pilots were at an impasse, trading accusations of inflexibility.Not all pilots are convinced that the combination is in their best interests.Mike Stark, a Delta pilot who has sought to recall his union’s leadership in part for supporting potential mergers, argues that whatever his colleagues gain from the new contract could be offset by a lower position on the seniority list.“You’re getting a short-term pay-off, but it’s much better waiting,” he said.What is more, the further their name sits from the bottom of the seniority list, the more likely they will keep their job even as an airline take steps to slash expenses and eliminate routes.“It’s job security, pure and simple,” said Charles Craver, a labour law professor at George Washington University. “You lay off in reverse order of seniority.”
380;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-02-11T18:54:25Z;Europe’s saplings need financial fertiliser;;"After recent financial turmoil, it would be tempting for European policymakers to rein in the scope of financial innovation – tempting, but misguided. On the contrary, the current focus on financial stability must go hand in hand with a renewed policy impetus to improve the European financial system’s ability to foster enterprise growth.A look at the world’s largest companies offers both comfort and concern. On the face of it, Europe holds its ground well. Its share of the FT Global 500’s market value has increased over the past five years and now reaches 32 per cent, while the US share has plummeted from 57 per cent to 38 per cent. But, in contrast with the US and most other economies, Europe’s champions are ageing giants. Only 12 out of the 154 European companies in the ranking were created after 1950. Among US companies, those born after 1950 number 51 out of 174. Europe has a prosperous stock of established large companies, but does a dismal job of grooming new ones.One reason is that Europe lacks the high-powered innovation ecosystems that generate the Microsofts, Genentechs and Googles of this world. But among US companies now worth more than $20bn and born in the past half-century, high-technology companies remain a minority. Apart from a few energy companies, most of the rest are service innovators: the likes of FedEx, Carnival Cruises, Las Vegas Sands, retailers such as Wal-Mart or Home Depot, media outfits and financial services companies. Technological innovation, while crucial, is not the only factor driving the continuous emergence of new giants in the US. Others are the size of its domestic market, especially for services, where Europe remains fragmented; the flexibility of its labour market; and the higher cultural and social status of entrepreneurs.But an additional factor is often overlooked: the American finance industry offers more support for the growth of emerging companies than its European counterpart. Economic research in the past 20 years has firmly established that financial development is not only a consequence, but also a cause, of economic growth. Efficient financial systems enable the allocation of capital to businesses and entrepreneurs with the highest growth potential.Europe’s recent financial development has been impressive but remains unbalanced. The continent’s large companies can now rely on deep, liquid and efficient capital markets. But every available indicator suggests that emerging enterprises benefit from a wider range of appropriate financing solutions in the US than in Europe.Private equity comes first to mind. Beyond it, many credit offerings, such as high-yield bonds, mezzanine loans and other subordinated debt instruments are well suited to high-growth service businesses that can pledge no tangible assets as collateral. The markets for these financial products remain comparatively underdeveloped in Europe, especially outside the UK and Nordic countries.Moreover, corporate finance for mid-sized businesses is a proximity business: it must reach the companies where they are and it requires the intensive use of local information. The concentration of a very efficient finance industry in a few places cannot be a substitute for widespread financial development.This important factor in economic growth remains a blind spot of policy. The European Union’s much-heralded Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has 24 “integrated guidelines”, but none specifically touches the financial system. The reasons may be found in the political economy of Europe’s post-war economies, when capital scarcity was the norm and the financial sector was managed under tight state control.A new impetus is needed to make Europe’s financial system more supportive of emerging enterprises. The times for direct provision of financing by governments, through co-investment or public guarantees, are largely gone. Instead, policy initiatives should focus on creating a level playing field with the right incentives for market players. Much could be achieved with a mix of assertive competition policy, less prescriptive securities regulation in markets reserved for professional investors, a Europe-wide effort to simplify and harmonise insolvency procedures, the elimination of tax distortions between financial instruments and an evolution of prudential rules to encourage investment in emerging companies. Many levers are at national level, but a concerted effort by the EU’s member states would maximise the chances of success.In the current turmoil, policymakers must keep their eye on the ball. Europe’s priority remains higher long-term growth and that means entrepreneurial new companies. The financial crisis will inevitably result in a rash of initiatives and regulations: in their discussion, all should remember that what Europe needs is more private equity for growth and expansion, more venture capital, a liquid market for high-yield bonds and more sophisticated and competitive corporate finance offerings.Policy responses to the perils of instability should not put a heavy lid on those financial innovations that are necessary to improve Europe’s growth potential. From an economic and political point of view, Europe’s financial system must be improved so that more young sprouts can grow and challenge Europe’s tall old corporate trees.The writers, respectively assistant professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business and research fellow at Bruegel, are the authors of Financing Europe’s Fast Movers (www.bruegel.org)"

And it was a buyer from Barneys, the US department store, who helped propel him into the spotlight.The dearth of US retailers at this year’s London Fashion Week will not affect Mr Olowu but he is worried about a new generation hoping to follow in his footsteps. “It is a concern for UK designers that are looking for US stockists,” he says.But London retains its pull: Mr Olowu will be showing his latest collection in the city next week. “There’s always the opportunity to show in New York. [But] you get more attention [in London] than if you were showing at the same time as Ralph Lauren.”Those with wanderlust, he argues, should also question what damage they will do to their personal brands by moving to foreign cities: “The reason why British designers are sought after is because they are British designers working in Britain.”His advice to aspiring designers is to create clothes that cry out to retailers hungry for something to interrupt the humdrum. Despite US buyers’ decision to shun London this year, he is convinced fresh talent remains a draw regardless of geography. He says: “What I’m hearing from all the big buyers is that they will go anywhere to find something beautiful . . . ”He concedes that “the collection is actually sold in Paris . . . because everyone goes to Paris”. But he also acknowledges a rival to the conventional fashion circuit: “Nowadays there’s also Fedex and e-mail.”
382;FDX;Fedex Corp;2008-01-24T23:54:40Z;D Post considers US unit sale;;Deutsche Post, the world’s biggest logistics group, is considering selling its ailing DHL express delivery unit in the US as part of a wider turnround plan that could be announced within months, FT Deutschland, the Financial Times’s sister paper, has learned.It is understood that Klaus Zumwinkel, the group’s chief executive, is planning to sell the express unit and to merge Postbank, the group’s profitable banking subsidiary, with another bank.The measures are due in part to pressure from big investors and analysts who have criticised Mr Zumwinkel over losses at the US arm. Institutional investors have called for the separation of Postbank to raise reserve assets.Discussions with Frederick Smith, the chief executive of Fedex, are under way, according to insiders. One possible outcome could involve Fedex taking control of the whole parcel delivery business of Deutsche Post in the US. In return Deutsche Post could assume control of Fedex services in Europe.Deutsche Post declined to comment on the plans.John Allan, who has been chief financial officer of the group since September, told FT Deutschland: “We have several options. Some can be realised in the short term – some not.”Mr Zumwinkel is due to hand over as chief executive to Frank Appel, his designated successor, by the end of November. “Zumwinkel wants to leave the house clean”, said one Deutsche Post executive.The group is understood to be intending to sell its US express delivery business by the end of May. A spin-off of Postbank could come in the last six months of the year.Mr Allan is considered the driving force behind the reorganisation plans. He is pushing for the group to end its US express delivery activities, which have generated losses of up to €7bn for Deutsche Post.

It lost its triple-A rating from Moody’s Investors Service last month after paying more than $6bn to exit an employee pension plan.That payment, along with a contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, gave UPS the clarity it needed on future cash needs to take on additional debt, UPS said.The company has said it wants to expand its small-package delivery network internationally and recently struck deals in the UK, China and Poland.S&P cut UPS’s rating three notches, from triple-A to AA on Wednesday, following the company’s announcement.The new policy marks the first large initiative unveiled during the nine-day-old Scott Davis era. The former UPS chief financial officer succeeded Mike Eskew as chief executive this month.

Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices. The shares fell 4.9 per cent to $25.35 and 4.8 per cent to $7.14 respectively. The PHLX semiconductor sector index lost 2.9 per cent to 396.34.Also in the chip sector Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $38.39 after it said it expected an “immediate short-term impact” from a court ruling that it must halt chip sales that infringe patents belonging to Broadcom. Broadcom gained 1.5 per cent to $26.52.Amazon outperformed after Citigroup told investors to buy the shares citing expectations of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures. The stock fell 5.7 per cent to $19.31.Shares in Industrial companies declined after the ISM report and as Citi downgraded Textron, the industrial conglomerate, to “hold” from “buy”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $66.81.Financials fell heavily as National City said it would slash its dividend by almost 50 per cent and that it planned to raise more capital to cope with credit market turmoil. The shares dropped 5.3 per cent to $15.59. The S&P investment bank index shed 3.5 per cent with Morgan Stanley, down 4.1 per cent at $50.95 and Lehman Brothers, 5 per cent weaker at $62.19.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, rose 7.3 per cent to $52.39, the best performer on the S&P, as gold prices surged to a record high.As oil prices rose, energy stocks benefited. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company gained 2 per cent to $145.95.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent on the week to 13,450.65 while the Nasdaq Composite fared better, gaining 2.1 per cent to 2,691.99 over the period. The Russell 2000 small cap index climbed 4.2 per cent to 785.60 this week, helped by an increase in deal-making.The New York Stock Exchange set a volume record in the first hour on Friday as traders settled positions before the holidays and as several types of derivative contracts expired – a quarterly event known as “quadruple witching”. However, volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called “fear barometer” – fell to its lowest level since the end of October, down 19.7 per cent for the week at 18.68.Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail device, capped a good week for technology after it said third-quarter net in-come more than doubled to $370.5m and revenues soared. The company’s up-beat fourth-quarter guidance exceeded analysts’ estimates and the shares jumped 11.9 per cent on the week to $118.63. UBS raised its price target to $155.RIM’s stellar results came in the same week that Oracle increased second-quarter profit by 35 per cent, helped by strong software licence sales. Its shares rose 7.1 per cent to $22.71 this week.Adobe Systems, the software company, beat estimates with a 21 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits and the shares edged up 0.2 per cent to $42.18.“There’s been no crisis in technology. The momentum has been phenomenal,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Financials had a mixed week as investors were forced to weigh up whether to avoid the sector because of more mortage-related losses or buy into the stocks because of the prospect of big capital infusions from abroad.Reports that Merrill Lynch is in talks with Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency, about a potential multi-billion-dollar investment moved the shares higher on Friday.Like many US banks, Merrill could benefit from a boost to its capital reserves after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October. The shares fell 2.3 per cent on the week to $55.54 after an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton forecast Merrill would take another $8.6bn in writedowns this quarter.Morgan Stanley this week tapped China Investment Corp for $5bn as it an-nounced a total of $9.4bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and posted the first loss in its history. The shares ended the week up 8.1 per cent at $54.37.Bear Stearns, which in October took a $1bn investment from China’s Citic Securities, fell to its first loss this week, after it wrote down $1.9bn for the quarter. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $89.95 on the week.Investors were rocked by the threat of credit downgrades on monoline bond insurers.A downgrade of bond insurers could seriously affect world credit markets, triggering sharp losses on insured securities.MBIA, fell 27.4 per cent to $20.03 this week after it revealed $30.6n in exposure to complex debt securities. Fitch Ratings warned it could cut MBIA’s triple-A rating unless it raised $1bn in capital.Fitch issued the same warning to Ambac Financial on Friday after identifying $32.2bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations backed by subprime collateral.However, Ambac’s shares rose 16.9 per cent to $26.66 on the week after Moody’s affirmed its triple-A rating.Transport stocks were disappointing after FedEx, the logistics company, and Union Pacific, rail operator, issued weak earnings guidance, citing rising fuel costs. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $94.29 and 3.5 per cent to $126.02 respectively.
386;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-12-20T21:50:20Z;Tech sector rallies after Oracle calms concerns;;"Wall Street stocks posted modest gains on Thursday with technology stocks leading the pack after strong quarterly results at Oracle helped allay fears of a slowdown in corporate tech spending.However, the major equities seesawed throughout the day after MBIA, a bond insurer, said it had billions of dollars in exposure to high-risk securities, stoking credit market fears.Financials were a weak point after Bear Stearns fell to a big loss and made more mortgage-related writedowns. Meanwhile, a gauge of future economic growth fell to its lowest level in two years and a measure of regional manufacturing activity contracted sharply.In a choppy session, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent in early trade, then fell into negative territory, before closing 0.5 per cent higher at 1,455.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 13,245.64, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.5 per cent at 2,640.86.“Nothing seems able to push the market up [much] because we have these daily torpedoes with respect to credit,” Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said.MBIA’s shares fell 26.2 per cent to $19.95 after it revealed $30.6bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations, including $8.1bn of high-risk securities known as “CDO-squared”.Fitch Ratings put MBIA on watch for a possible credit rating cut and gave the company four to six weeks to find $1bn to shore up its capital reserves. A downgrade of a top monoline like MBIA could trigger severe stress in credit markets and potentially huge losses on insured securities.“MBIA simply did not disclose arguably the riskiest parts of its CDO portfolio to investors,” an analyst at Morgan Stanley said. The cost of insuring MBIA’s debt soared.News of the disclosure came a day after Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on several bond insurers, including MBIA, to “negative” – meaning a downgrade is more likely – and cut one, ACA Financial Guaranty, to junk.Bear Stearns fell to a $854m loss in the fourth quarter, the first deficit in the investment bank’s history and much worse than analysts had anticipated.Mortgage-related writedowns totalled $1.9bn, $700m more than previously advised, and the company posted negative net revenue of $379m, compared with $2.4bn a year ago. The shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $91.42, but are down 44 per cent this year.Bear’s results followed a terrible quarter for Morgan Stanley, which also fell to its first loss after taking a total of $9.4bn in mortgage-related writedowns.There was better news from technology giant Oracle, which increased second-quarter profit 35 per cent to $1.3bn, helped by a jump in software licence sales. Revenues increased 28 per cent to $5.3bn.The results beat expectations and the shares rose 6.5 per cent to $22.10 after several analysts raised their target prices on the stock.Oracle’s results provided support to a range of large-cap technology stocks including IBM, up 1.6 per cent at $108.84, and Microsoft, 2.1 per cent higher at $35.52. Qualcomm, the wireless chip developer, rose 2.2 per cent to $39.12 after it raised its fiscal first quarter profit outlook.Technology was among the best-returning sectors this year, but confidence wobbled in recent weeks after Cisco’s chief executive cautioned about prospects for sales to financial companies. After the market closed Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handheld e-mail device, said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $370.5m.The shares closed up 4.8 per cent at $106.99 and climbed another 6.7 per cent after-hours.The transport sector had another disappointing day after FedEx, the logistics company that is seen by many investors as an
economic bellwether, rep-orted a fall in second-quarter earnings from $511m to $479m.While that beat expectations, the company’s third-quarter guidance was below analysts’ forecasts and FedEx also cut its fiscal 2008 capital expenditure forecast. The shares fell 1.1 per cent to $93.63.Retail stocks were also sold after Rite Aid, the pharmacy chain, posted a wider-than-expected $84.8m quarterly loss. The shares fell 31.7 per cent to $2.80."
387;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;FedEx hit by slowdown and price of fuel;;"FedEx reported a drop in quarterly earnings and predicted another shortfall this period as high fuel costs and a weakening US economy limited demand for freight and express deliveries in its home market.The company, considered an economic bellwether for its role in facilitating global trade, said growth in its international and US exports businesses helped soften the effect of the US decline.Nevertheless, Fred Smith, FedEx chief executive, noted that energy costs are soaking up a greater portion of the nation’s gross domestic product, and urged the government to lessen corporate America’s burden through tax cuts or credits.“With fuel prices up and the housing meltdown, you see a very tepid growth rate in the US economy,” Mr Smith said. “Congress and the administration ought to put stimulative things out there. Monetary policy and the Fed can’t do it all.”Mr Smith’s views on Washington echoed those of Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary, who on Wednesday urged President George W. Bush to adopt temporary tax cuts, extended unemployment insurance and other stimulants to help the US stave off recession. “Even Larry Summers, who has a Democratic point of view, is calling for a tax cut,” Mr Smith said.Net income for the quarter that ended in November fell 6 per cent to $479m, or $1.54 a share. Sales climbed 6 per cent to $9.45bn, outpaced by 7 per cent increase in operating expenses. Fuel costs surged 23 per cent.Income at FedEx’s express-delivery business, its biggest division, rose 5 per cent to $531m on $6.04bn in revenue. Its international-priority unit reported a 13 per cent gain in revenue, helped by high package volume from Asia. Mr Smith said the US dollar’s weakness should continue to spur demand for exports.“That has been, to quote my friend the president, misunderestimated for a very long time,” Mr Smith said. “Our planes go both ways. We’re happy to take stuff from China; from the US, exchange rates are clearly an exogenous factor, as are petroleum prices.”FedEx predicted it would earn $1.15-$1.30 a share this quarter, down from $1.35 a year ago.It stuck with its full-year profit forecast of $6.40-$6.70, assuming fuel prices stabilise and the economy doe not further deteriorate. It said increases to fuel surcharges, which lag behind actual swings in commodity prices by about six weeks, should be in effect by the fourth quarter to help ensure it finishes its fiscal year on track."
388;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-12-05T04:40:27Z;Delivery technology: Fixing retail’s weakest link;;"The annual Christmas ritual of braving a packed high street for gifts does little to encourage a festive frame of mind.Hence it is no surprise that 90 per cent of shoppers plan to do at least some of this year’s shopping online, according to the recent American Express 2007 Retail Monitor survey. Respondents said buying online provides a welcome respite from crowds (82 per cent), parking problems (60 per cent) and Christmas music (28 per cent).That is great news for online retailers. As early as October, analysts from Forrester, the IT market research firm, forecast final-quarter sales for European e-retailers for Christmas 2007 to reach €51bn, or 39 per cent of total annual online sales.For shoppers, buying online could hardly be less stressful: prices are competitive and choice is unrestricted. Security may still be a worry, but convenience overrides the fears – provided, that is, goods can be delivered without fuss. Anyone who has bought large items will be familiar with the card through the door saying: “You were out when we called.” So how can IT help mend this weakest link in the delivery chain?Those who really feel the strain of the online Christmas shopping spree are shipment and courier companies charged with delivering the packages.Take UPS, for example. On an average day, the company will deliver 15m packages worldwide – but on its biggest delivery day of the year (December 19), that is likely to rise by 45 per cent to 22m, according to Donna Barrett, the company’s technology representative.A large proportion of those packages contain goods purchased online, as UPS boasts that it delivers for 21 of the world’s top 25 online retailers, including Amazon.com. For that reason, delivery companies such as UPS and its rival FedEx now make it possible for customers to schedule a time for delivery and to track a package’s progress online, either via the delivery company’s website or increasingly, using application programming interfaces (APIs), via the website of the online retailer.That has involved investment in technology, and in particular, in “smart labels” that mean
a parcel can be “swiped” by a reader at key stages in the
delivery process, such as leaving the warehouse, boarding a
truck or aircraft, or at its final destination.This information lays a trail of information about a parcel’s whereabouts that can be presented online to the recipient.Likewise, vehicles and drivers can now be tracked and controlled using global positioning systems (GPS), says Fran Howarth, an analyst at research firm Quocirca: “Vehicles transmit signals
via on-board GPS devices, which are transmitted to a central server via satellite, allowing
courier companies to keep track of where all their vehicles are
at a particular time,” she explains.They can also send out alerts when problems occur, such as traffic jams or breakdowns, she adds, so that an alternative route can be planned and customers kept informed of the new delivery schedule.Meanwhile, the increasing sophistication of handheld devices – giving drivers out on the road the ability to upload information about packages in real time as well as record
details of their handover – has transformed the delivery business, says Rob Carter, CIO of FedEx.His company has 70,000 handheld devices in the field, capturing and uploading information on 6m daily shipments worldwide. “There’s no question in our minds that the information about a package is as important as the package itself – that’s how we stay competitive,” he says.But the ability to track a package online does not mean someone is at home to receive it. And what happens if the item is too large or valuable to go through the letterbox? Either is inconvenient for both parties, certainly, but for the delivery company, it also means incurring the cost of arranging re-delivery.Fortunately, new technologies designed to smooth the delivery process still further are constantly emerging, says Evan Puzey, global vice-president of sales and marketing at Kewill Systems, a specialist in global trade management systems that works with FedEx and competitors such as TNT.One option, already proving popular in the US, is coded lock boxes outside a customer’s home, he says. “The recipient enters the code online when buying a product and the driver is supplied with this code for the delivery to open the lock box and deposit the parcel,” he explains.Another option, says Ms Howarth of Quocirca, is the use of automated text or e-mail alerts, “stating when a parcel is due to arrive, or where it has been dropped off”.Voice, however, offers a more personal approach, argues JJ Kett, CEO of VoiceSage. His company, a spin-off from the University of Cork, Ireland, provides a hosted messaging service. Indesit, the white goods manufacturer, uses it to remind customers that their washing machine or dishwasher is scheduled for delivery next day.A recorded message, detailing the scheduled delivery time, is sent to VoiceSage’s hosted system by an Indesit customer service representative using a microphone on their PC, accompanied by a list of the phone numbers of intended recipients. That message is then sent by VoiceSage to recipients at the specified time.On receiving the call, customers are prompted by the recording to press 1 if they are happy with the stated delivery arrangement, or 2 to be diverted to a
call centre if they need to reschedule it.The results speak for themselves, says Mr Kett. Only 4 per cent of those “called” by Indesit using VoiceSage need to press 2, vastly reducing the burden on call centre staff. And the failure rate, he adds, has plummeted.“The company delivers 5,000 units per day, and prior to using VoiceSage’s technology, it had a 4.8 per cent non-delivery rate. Each day, that meant that approximately 240 units could not be delivered, resulting in a huge waste of labour,” he says. Since using the new technology, he adds, this no-show rate has dropped to 0.7 per cent – just 30 deliveries a day.VoiceSage is currently in discussions to supply similar technology to Royal Mail and to DHL in Ireland, as well as a number of leading mail-order catalogue companies, Mr Kett says.And this suggests the “nobody home” scenario is increasingly unpalatable to both customers and couriers, at Christmas or any other time.

DHL Logistics: interview, Page 8"
389;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-12-02T22:09:50Z;Reinventing the wheel;;"As Fred Smith grabs a piece of paper and begins illustrating the idea behind
the company he founded 36 years ago, it becomes clear that the chief executive of FedEx is not much of an artist.The resulting sketch looks more like a bicycle wheel than the revolutionary business model behind a $31bn logistics giant with more than 280,000 employees and operations in over 220 countries.It is only when Mr Smith puts the pen down and explains his intuition that the hastily drawn wheel springs to life as the “hub and spoke” model that turned FedEx into an essential cog in the global economic machine.Mr Smith’s initial thought – first articulated, according to FedEx lore, in a piece of college homework while at Yale – was as iconoclastic as it was simple.He believed that the fastest, cheapest way of delivering parcels was to fly them from the points at the end of each spoke to a central hub where they could be sorted, put on different aircraft and transported with others sharing similar destinations.When supporters of traditional point-to-point postal deliveries balked at the thought that a package going from New York to Philadelphia might have to take a 2,000-mile detour through FedEx’s hub in Memphis, Mr Smith demonstrated the superior efficiency of his system.“I simply used a mathematical formula about how to connect a lot of points to a lot of other points,” the 63-year-old Mr Smith recalls, from a sparsely decorated conference room in the company’s Memphis headquarters. “If you take [a single] transaction out of the aggregate, it looks very inefficient…Take the aggregate of all of them, rather than 9,900 couriers connecting 100 points, [and] you have 99. It’s more efficient by a factor of 100.”In the ensuing years Mr Smith used that formula, coupled with his other innovation of stationing trucks at airports to take parcels to their final addresses – to turn an undergraduate essay into the world’s biggest express delivery company. Yet FedEx’s impact over the past four decades has been felt far beyond the logistics industry.Reliable, just-in-time delivery of anything from computers to body organs is credited with facilitating an explosion in global trade and enabling a range of other companies – from Amazon to Dell to Wal-Mart – to become corporate icons in their own right.From his original vision he eventually established a system that allowed companies to move and track inventory in FedEx’s fleet of “550-mile-an-hour warehouses”. But he is at pains not to take all the credit for his creation: the hub and spoke model, he says, had already been used by the French and Indian postal services.And the inspiration for the integrated army of trucks and aircraft, he maintains, came from his Vietnam war stint as an officer with the Marines, “the only [US armed] service that has both air and ground components”.With his windswept white hair, his thickset frame hugged by a brown sports jacket and his Mississippi drawl promoting the virtues of teamwork and “bench strength”, Mr Smith looks and sounds more like an American football coach than the man behind a business revolution.Although he is often lionised as the embodiment of the American dream of the self-made entrepreneur, Mr Smith did not emerge from poverty. Born in Marks, Mississippi, about 80 miles south of Memphis, he came from a well-off family, with transport in the blood: his father founded a successful regional bus company.He went to an Ivy League university, attending Yale at the same time as the future US President George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger in the 2004 election, Senator John Kerry.And when, in 1971, he returned from Vietnam and decided to go into business, he was able to pledge a $4m inheritance and secure $80m from venture capitalists, lenders and family members, to found Federal Express.As the company grew from handling a few dozen parcels in a windowless room on the fringes of Memphis airport to dealing with more than 6.5m packages a day, Mr Smith says he had to transform his management style.In spite of now delegating day-to-day operations to his management team, he still maintains a low-key corporate persona – FedEx’s Memphis office bursts with pictures of trucks and aircraft but lacks the founder’s effigies and words of wisdom seen in so many US corporate headquarters.“I’ve never been someone who is shouting orders from the bridge, and expecting the oarsmen to pull a certain way,” he says.Mr Smith even argues that the words “chief executive officer” are a “misnomer”: big companies these days rely on a team of managers. Members of the company’s executive committee – which include Mr Smith and his top four deputies – say they strive to reach a consensus on important decisions.But when they cannot, they call a “jump ball” – the way opposing basketball teams decide a disputed possession – with Mr Smith as the referee. “We have four votes – Fred has five,” jokes Mike Glenn, executive vice-president of market development. FedEx insiders say there is little doubt who is in charge.Although Mr Smith has not announced his departure date and is still nine years away from FedEx’s retirement age of 72, his succession plans, like the giant screen that displays flight plans at the company’s global operations centre, are monitored with militaristic precision.Mr Smith, like every other executive ranked managing director, has had to identify two potential replacements – another practice he imported from the Marines, where officers have a second-in-command ready to take over should something happen to them.Although Mr Smith’s selections are secret, it is a safe bet FedEx’s next chief executive already lives in Memphis. Mr Smith’s top four lieutenants have been at his side for a combined 90 years. “It’s almost inconceivable, given the talent that we have in the organisation, that it would be a requirement to go outside,” he says.Mr Smith is adamant that if he walked out, the company “would not miss a beat”.“I don’t mean this in a derogatory way at all, but I’m not Rupert Murdoch or Barry Diller, or someone like that who really is ‘L’état, c’est moi’,” he says. “This is a highly choreographed industrial company that beats to a very formal management system…It operates like clockwork.”Investors must hope the bicycle wheel at the heart of FedEx will keep spinning even without its visionary designer.Strengths of FedEx: few rivals and resilient infrastructureFred Smith’s stewardship of FedEx has taught him a valuable lesson on the ebb and flow of the global economy.“The only thing you can truly learn is what the good book says: ‘This too shall pass,’” he says.Until the current turbulence subsides, Mr Smith must grapple with an unprecedented spike in fuel costs, competition from UPS and Deutsche Post’s DHL, and the threat of a recession in the US, its biggest market. This month the company was forced to slash its quarterly earnings forecast, the second warning in two months.FedEx’s shares have slipped nearly 15 per cent this year, underperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and arch-rival UPS – unfamiliar territory for a company whose market value has more than tripled in a decade.In some ways, problems at FedEx, which owns 669 aircraft, the world’s largest fleet after AMR’s American Airlines, mirror those faced by commercial airlines, whose profits are threatened by rising fuel costs and the economic slowdown.But unlike the fiercely competitive air travel sector, Mr Smith’s company can count its main rivals on one hand – the advantage of operating in an industry where the huge costs of building and maintaining an integrated road and air transport network represent a formidable barrier to entry.“The barriers to entry are much greater than [for] a low-cost airline.”"
390;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-12-02T22:01:33Z;FedEx warns over slowdown;;"Fred Smith, the chief executive of FedEx, the logistics giant, has warned that global growth will not be enough to counter a US slowdown, raising doubts over corporate America’s ability to export its way out of a sluggish domestic economy.The warning from Mr Smith, a respected business leader whose company is both a gauge and a beneficiary of globalisation, will deepen investor pessimism over the prospect that the world economy could “decouple” and survive a US downturn unscathed.In an interview with the Financial Times in which he also indicated he would like his successor to come from within FedEx, Mr Smith dismissed suggestions that the rapid pace of economic development in emerging markets would offset a US slowdown.“Growth elsewhere helps cushion the shock but nothing can displace a slowdown in the US,” he said. “I don’t care how optimistic people are about China or anything else, [the US] is still 25 per cent of the world’s economic activity so when it slows down it is going to have an effect.”Three weeks ago, FedEx issued the second profit warning in a month, citing flagging demand for US freight and escalating fuel costs. The announcement confounded investors’ predictions that a weak dollar and resilient economies in the rest of the world could help multinationals buck a domestic downturn.In the interview, which took place before the second profit warning, Mr Smith said that although the company’s international operations were expanding more rapidly than the domestic business, the US still accounted for most of its revenues.Mr Smith said his long-held belief that a rise in oil prices usually led to global economic downturns was likely to be proved right this time too. However, he said, unlike previous oil shocks, which were caused by supply restrictions, this one required different responses because it had been triggered by demand in developing countries and widespread use of complex financial instruments.Asked about succession, the 63-year-old Mr Smith said he was still nine years away from FedEx’s retirement age. But he added that under the company’s rules he was required to pick two potential replacements and have them reviewed by the board each year.Mr Smith declined to name his choices but he is believed to have selected from among his top lieutenants – Alan Graf, chief financial officer; Mike Glenn, executive vice-president of market development; Robert Carter, chief information officer; and Christine Richards, general counsel."
391;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
392;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Transcript: Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx;;"Francesco Guerrera, US business editor, and Justin Baer, US business reporter, interviewed Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx.FINANCIAL TIMES: As FedEx developed from start-off stage to its current size, how do you feel you had to change yourself, in terms of the way in which you viewed the business, but also worked with your employees and suppliers and customers?FRED SMITH: The secret to it is pretty straightforward, whether it’s business or coaching sports, or being a researcher or a physician, and that is to know what the essentials of your job are at any certain time, given the circumstances that you find yourself in. It’s not like people are learning how to run $40bn companies for the first time. There’s lots of literature out there as to what you need to do to be successful at various stages of size of an enterprise, and I think one of the things that I have tried to do is to be a student of management, and to understand what those things are at various sizes and scope levels, and to adjust accordingly, and obviously, in any profession you’ve got to stay up with the times.You’ve got to understand what the imperatives are, both external and internal and deal with them. The young people coming to work for us today are substantially different than they were when I started the company. The executives are a different breed of executive and so forth. But there are a few constants here too, and one of them is that FedEx has always been run by a team of very qualified people; I’ve never been someone who is shouting orders from the bridge and expecting all of the oarsmen to pull in a certain way, and we’ve got our best team ever on the field right now. We have very strong executives, and in fact, in big business today, there’s almost a misnomer, the chief executive officer. In every big successful business today, there is a small team of executives, and the business is sort of divided up along functional lines, and indeed, that’s the way our company is. I rely completely on them.I just know how to synthesise those skill sets into a cohesive whole and I think put together a reasonable strategy. So, that’s kind of the three things. One is to be willing to change, based on a lot of available literature, given the size and scope of the organisation to have a keen understanding of the environment you’re dealing with, and have good people and run the business in a team fashion.FT: And, how would you say your role has changed from the early days?MR SMITH: I’ve always felt that the number one job of a chief executive is to develop in concert with the board and directors and the top management team the business strategy. There are lots of great managers who have floundered in poor businesses, and a reasonable number of poor managers who’ve done quite well in very good businesses.I had a great friend – he was almost 100 years of age when he used to tell me this – he said, `Fred, you know what the secret of a good business is?’ He was the founder of Schering-Plough. He said the secret of a good business is being a good business.So, you’ve got to have a good strategy. If you don’t have a good strategy, everything else is very difficult. Probably more today I would say my job is related to making sure that our strategic direction is correct, and dealing with a lot more externalities than used to be the case. Big enterprises today, and businesses in general have to satisfy a lot of constituencies, and that wasn’t the case 25 years ago. So, those two things are much bigger today than they used to be I think.FT: And, I guess one of the topical issues at the moment is the issue of succession, and succession planning, What are your thoughts on that?MR SMITH: We have a very formal succession process. We have an annual review of it with the Board of Directors. It’s both quantitative and qualitative, and is done in part with the assistance of external experts, and we have a lot of depth on our team, and I can assure you, if I walked out of this business today and got hit by a bus, the company would not miss a beat.There are several candidates, and the Board has a process to deal formally with my incapacitation or death, and we also have a process to deal with it in a more orderly fashion upon my retirement. So, I’ve always felt that was an integral part of running an enterprise. We have that formally incorporated throughout the organisation by the way. Every position at managing director level and above has to have two designated potential successors, and if you don’t have one that’s acceptable to your reporting senior and so forth, you must have a process underway to develop or recruit such a successor.FT: And, that includes the CEO?MR SMITH: Of course.FT: How do you prepare not only your employees, but those external audiences, for your retirement?MR SMITH: I’ve studied that to some degree. I can assure you internally the people that make their living here know what I told you to be correct, that there is a team of top flight officers, and there are people who are perfectly able to run this business other than myself. I’ve reinforced that over and over again, and continue to do so, just as I’m doing now, and I’ve done it internally and externally. Secondarily, I hope I’ve done a good job of not developing some sort of personality cult, I’m not let’s say, and I don’t mean this in a derogatory way at all, but I’m not Rupert Murdoch or Barry Diller or someone like that who really is `L’Etat c’est Moi.’ It’s a very entrepreneurial deal oriented type of business. This is a highly choreographed industrial company that beats to a very formal management system which we developed over many years.I mean, it operates like clockwork. There’s a formal process the way it’s planned each year, and how we go about dealing with the strategic imperatives of the future and how we make decisions and so forth, and it simply isn’t related to my personality.You’ve got to remember that my job before FedEx was to be a marine officer, and that’s the ultimate requirement for succession planning! So, it never crossed my mind not to have a person who everybody in the unit knew exactly who took over and the chain of command, and had complete confidence in their ability to do so. I mean, it’s just in our DNA, it really is. I think you could go throughout the organisation and ask people and say, well, what do you think when the old man retires? And hopefully they’d say, well he’s a good guy, but we have some strong people.FT: Will you consider external candidates?MR SMITH: Well, obviously that would be a decision that would be made by the Board as a whole, but I would say the odds are highly in favour of an internal candidate. I mean, it’s almost inconceivable, given the talent that we have in the organisation that it would be a requirement to go outside the organisation.FT: Is there a mandatory retirement age?MR SMITH: 72. I’m 63.FT: I guess the reason why it may come up, or at least the topic may come up sooner, is that of course we have a US presidential election next year. There has been speculation, depending on who wins the general election, that you might be part of the new administration.MR SMITH: I don’t have any idea about that whatsoever, but I admire people who do it, let me put it that way, it’s a tough slog, a tough business, particularly for some of the defence and state (departments) and things like that; those are very difficult jobs.FT: Tougher than running a corporation?MR SMITH: I don’t think it’s tougher, I think it’s different.FT: But if you were asked?MR SMITH: If the President asks you to do something, and the President in the past has asked me, you have to listen to them. But you also have to give them your best advice as to whether you’re the best person and whether you can really do it, given your family situation and so forth. I mean, I would highly doubt that that would be the case, but you certainly can’t just not take the phone call when they call you. Tell them I’m busy.FT: There’s legislation in Congress that would grant FedEx Express workers the right unionise at a local level, under the National Labour Relations Act. What do you think?MR SMITH: The thing you’ve got to remember is we have lots of operations already that are under the National Labour Relations Act. It’s not like this is some new regime that we don’t know how to operate in. In fact, every other part of our company is under the National Labour Relations Act.Having said that, there’s a reason that FedEx Express is under the Railway Labour Act. This legislation goes back to 1880, and there were four bills that were passed by the Congress from 1880 until 1926 to try to bring stability to the rail and related transport industries, and the reason for that is that in most business issues, you have only two parties that have a real stake, management and share owners, and labour. So, if they can’t come to an agreement on something, the work stops. But if you have the railroad that shuts down, and you produce livestock in the Midwest, or grain that spoils if you can’t move it, there is a very big third party at the table, and that is the public interest.So, in 1926 the Congress passed the Railway Labour Act, and what the Railway Labour Act does is to put the public interest at the table, and unlike the National Labour Relations Act, it does not let a local labour dispute shut down a large capital intensive network upon which the public relies, and for 46 years prior to that, there were example after example where people were badly hurt because of the brakemen in Harrisburg who shut the Pen Central Railroad. In 1936, airlines were added to the Railway Labour Act, and the rail express companies, which were the pick and delivery portion of the rail business on which FedEx was modelled. And then air carriers were put under that.The amendment that was proposed in the House would turn that 127 years of precedent on its ear, completely disregard the public interest. And our view about that is, the same issues that were there when the law was passed are still here today.If they pass it, they pass it, but it’s certainly poor public policy and it’s even worse public policy to propose something like this that has such profound risk for the public interest, and propose not to even have a hearing about it. I don’t think it’s going to pass the Senate.FT: You’re often credited with creating the hub and spokes model, right?MR SMITH: It was there a long time before I came along, but many people used hubs and spokes for different businesses.FT: Where did you get the idea from?MR SMITH: Well, a hub and a spoke system has been used in a lot of industries, most notably in telecommunications. If you want to connect a lot of points, like we were talking about a moment ago, the difference between the airlines and our business, in an airline, you just generally want to connect two points, where you’re going from and where you’re going to. We have to, on the other hand, connect a single point to an enormous number of points, so a network is simply the mathematics are nxn-1. If you’ve got 100 points on a network, and you want to connect them all one to the other, and you want to go point to point, then you would take n = 100 x 1-1 = 99, 9,900 planes or couriers or wires, whatever the case may be, and the way you mitigate that is that you have a single hub and you connect all of those hundred points through the hub.Now, if you take a transaction that goes from point A to point B, and it goes through a hub, which is a way, if you take that transaction out of the aggregate, it looks very ‘inefficient’. It’s silly. You mean you’re taking this all the way from mid town Manhattan, down to Wall Street, and then back, simply to move something between the Chase Manhattan and the Citigroup? But, if you take the aggregate of all of them, rather than 9,900 couriers connecting these points, you have 99, and it’s unbelievably more efficient. It’s more efficient by a factor of 100, so it was used in telecommunications, switches, in bank clearing houses and so forth, and the idea for FedEx was simply that you connected all points on the system to each other point in a non-discriminatory way, and you could make widgets or whatever at any point on the network, and have the same ability to connect them, and it was a very profound thing, and when we first introduced it, people were just astounded.You can take stuff from Rochester, New York, and get it overnight to every point on the network? It was impossible, because people were always thinking about those linear connections. It wasn’t particularly unusual, but it was applied on the scale that it was, using airplanes, and the second major innovation goes right back to the question you asked me about the Railway Labour Act, is it was a completely integrated air/ground system, because prior to that time, there were affiliations, but they were different organisations, but I’d served in the Marine Corps, and it was very logical to me. The Marine Corps was the only service that has both air and ground components, in fact, I was in both, so it was very logical to me. This is crazy to have two companies to do this, it’s just one company, and integrated thing, and so when planes come in, everybody in point B, the same company can know exactly what to do. That’s why to this day we keep our express company focused on the air transportation network, express, because we can provide this unduplicated service. So, I’m pleased that some people think that I’m the father of this, but I’m not, and the French Post used it for years before, and the Indian Post.FT: And, you were aware of all those when you thought about planning it?MR SMITH: Sure, I just simply used the mathematical formula about how to connect a lot of point to a lot of other points, in an efficient way.FT: You make it sound awfully simple.MR SMITH: You know, most ideas are very simple. It was just the synthesis of several thoughts together, in relation to the market that led to the thing, and of course everybody had to adopt that eventually, because it was so profound.FT: Just following on from that, that was the idea. Now, how did you go about instilling that kind of culture that to this day is in existence in the company, which is focused on actually doing it?MR SMITH: Service.FT: Doing what?MR SMITH: There was an awful lot of emphasis in the company from the early days and remains to this day on our culture, people, service, profit. Make sure that everybody is tied into the mission, tied into the requirement for extreme service, and then that, to some degree morphed into why we became such a huge technology company, because once you start reaching a certain level, it really doesn’t make any difference how well you motivate people, and how well you treat them and so forth. When you’re dealing with a lot of large numbers, stuff happens. So, what we had to do was to invent a way to handle large numbers of shipments, but retain the ability to deal with each one of them discretely, as if they were one of a few shipments, and that’s why we had to develop a way to track and trace items. Now, that, along with the deregulation you’re talking about is what’s changed the logistics, because remember a warehouse is only a place where you put something so you know you have it.I bet you didn’t buy your car because the salesperson said we have this gorgeous warehouse. You like the fit and the finish, and the fact that the car’s going to operate, and they’re going to fix it if it doesn’t. Well, once you can track and trace things, and you can see them in motion, just as if they are at rest, then our trucks and planes become in essence 550 mile an hour warehouses, so we had to develop a system where we could measure, every single day, every shipment we had, and to be able to see every one that went wrong, and that’s why we developed the bar code and the tracking and tracing, and then eventually migrated it onto people’s desks with PCs and now through the Internet, and that’s what changed the whole logistical world, because you can see inventory moving as well as any warehouse.FT: We take it for granted now, but when you were talking about 550 mile an hour warehouses at the time at the start, people must have thought you were crazy?MR SMITH: That’s been a uniform theme over the years. The unpredictability of demand and supply is what created a lot of the volatility in the economy. The huge gap in knowledge between demand and production, in the past, has been flattened because of IT technology, and in the case of the goods area, a huge part of that was this tracking system that we developed, and Wal-Mart too. You could see, the moment that they sold a tube of toothpaste, and it would go back and reorder at Procter & Gamble, who presumably were taking it up the supply chain, so that got shorter and shorter, and the inventory to sales ratio got better and better, and you were able to substitute fast cycle, visible transportation and logistics for lots of excess inventory and lots of uncertainty, in terms of prediction in demand and supply.FT: You mentioned the importance of defining culture. How has that process progressed with respect to Kinko’s [the chain of copy shop bought from the private equity group Clayton Dubilier & Rice for $2.4bn in 2004]?MR SMITH: I think that it’s been a challenge. Kinko’s was a college copy shop originally and lots of turnover, quite a different culture, As we run out of the calendar year, we’re producing well over $900m worth of shipping through the channel, very profitable, because it’s small customer and retail, and I think we’ve got it on the right track, in terms of its core copy and print business, and we also have convenience office supplies. They’re our Tiger Mart. You can go and get your cigarettes and fill your tank up, that’s the whole concept behind FedEx Kinko, you can go and get your packaging shipping and pick up some posters or binders or pens or notebooks and also do whatever kind of printing you need.FT: Did you look at that business before it was sold to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice?MR SMITH: We always liked Kinko’s, but CD&R, when they bought it, it was a roll up, a franchised operation, and they bought it and rolled it up. That was a very difficult thing to do, and I doubt that that would have been our cup of tea, but once they had done that we liked the business. It had core adjacency to our business, and it allowed us to have a retail presence, which just simply wouldn’t have been possible without those other product lines. Again, going back to Tiger Mart, that’s why ExxonMobil has those other products there, because it wouldn’t be nearly as profitable to sell gas if you didn’t sell the beer and cigarettes.FT: A lot has been said about what CD&R did to the Kinko’s culture during its run as its owner.MR SMITH: I don’t think they did much to the culture, other than that they were private equity folks. They put a lot of the hammer down on the expenses, and so forth, so it probably wasn’t nearly as free wheeling.What we’ve done obviously is try to change the culture so that it’s where we want it, in terms of it’s customer service orientation, the wages and benefits. Turnover is way down and we’ve expanded it, about 500 stores in the last two years, developed a smaller footprint, and we’ve put a lot into moving toward the digital print world from the old analog copy world, so we’re pretty optimistic about it.FT: The concept of the corner copy shop will change?MR SMITH: Yeah, it will be much more of an office convenience store. The things you need to run your business every day. The one I went into on Saturday, it’s right next door to the European Union, and the European Union produces a lot of paper, so they had a lot of people in Kinko’s doing the stuff we all do.FT: I think you once said, there is a correlation between the run up in oil prices and recession?MR SMITH: Yeah, I said, there is a correlation between economic slow downs and the run up in the oil prices.FT: So, what do you think is happening now, with this run up in the oil prices?MR SMITH: I think things are going to slow down, predictably.FT: Should we be worried?MR SMITH: This is different than the times in the past, because in the past it’s been supply interruption, and this is demand increases, fed by India and China, so there’s probably more systemic, sustained pricing built in here. Now it’s just another asset class for the financial funds. People are investing in it like they invest in gold or wheat or anything else, so you have those two things, and that’s a very different market than it was in the past. The US gasoline consumption is up less than 1 per cent year over year, but consumption in India and China is up much more than that. But markets work.We’re buying 777 jets to get rid of 757s, and our fuel efficiency gets better. We’re testing hybrids, we’re trying to be smarter, so markets will work and I suspect that industrial efficiency will continue to improve. In 1981, I think consumption of gasoline was about 6 per cent of household income, now it’s about 4 per cent, so there’s been a 50 per cent improvement in it.There’s going to be an adjustment period, as the world digests its $100 a barrel oil, and clearly the financial markets, related to housing and the home improvement, things of that nature. We certainly see that, but markets are very flexible today, and people will start using less gasoline when it costs $4 a gallon.FT: What if you run the second largest airline in the world, as FedEx does?MR SMITH: What we do is we simply have a base price and we pass it along, in terms of fuel surcharges, so our issue is much more what it does to the macroeconomic economy. That doesn’t mean that it’s not an issue to us on the way up, because we lag, we take it on the chin, but we don’t change it every day, and if it ever goes back down, we’ll pick up a windfall, what we gave the consumer. We have been adjusting the base price in our rates over the last four or five years, but we’re still far from where it looks like it’s going to settle out.When you have something like $100 oil, everything that’s related to these commodities is going through the roof, so our employees, they’re having a reduction in their standard of living, because of oil prices, and we pass along wage increases that were bigger than they were last year.Any way you slice it, there is an increasing cost of operating in large measure, because of the increase in the price of fuel. That’s just a fact. How much slowdown there is, that’s the debate. Anybody who says there’s not, is obviously not watching what’s going on.FT: On the positive side, you don’t believe there’s going to be a dramatic slowdown?MR SMITH: I think that markets are more flexible today than they used to be, and so what has generally happened in the last ten to twenty years, is you have, for lack of a better term, many recessions. You have inventory adjustments, which can be in particular sectors very severe, but in the economy as a whole, it chugs along. Now, because of the oil prices and the fact that you can’t just turn over the fleet of American SUVs or airplanes, it’s going to be perhaps a bit louder. Part of it was brought on by OPEC cutting the supply last April, and they’ve announced they’re going to increase it again, so maybe it will stabilise it, but I think even they’re worried about $100 barrel oil, because you see them making statements like, you’re going to have to guarantee us you will have a demand for our supplies.FT: You’re well known to be a student of history. What do these days feel like, in terms of past cycles? What can we learn from the past?MR SMITH: The only thing you can truly learn is what the good book says, this too shall pass. It won’t last forever. I do think, as most of these events are, there are a lot of novel things. The dot com boom was a novel thing, built on the Internet. This is a novel thing, largely built for the first time really as a demand oil problem, not a supply oil problem, and it’s certainly a new, uncharted field, where everybody was sitting around in Wall Street and in London and in Paris, slapping themselves on the back on how they had eliminated risk by putting these collatalized debt obligations around, and nothing could go wrong.Of course, when they found out, when it melted down, all of the CDOs were under water, and there is the problem, and with the CDOs you can’t reach through and get the fundamental assets. They were great in theory about diversifying risk, but wrong in terms of the effect, and that’s what nobody thought about.FT: Do you believe that global growth is going to offset and help the US mitigate the effects of a slowdown?MR SMITH: Sure, our international business is very strong, we’ve been saying that for a long time and in many parts of the world stronger than the United States.FT: Even so, the last quarter you had to say that overall things were going to be tougher, because of the US.MR SMITH: I’m not saying that it doesn’t make any difference, certainly not to FedEx, because it is still the majority of our revenue, so over time our international business is growing much faster.What I am saying is that the growth elsewhere helps cushion the shock, but nothing can displace a slow down in the United States. I don’t care how optimistic people are about China or anything else, it’s still 25 per cent of the world’s economic activity, so when it slows down, it’s going to have an effect.FT: Even from as global a company as it gets, FedEx?MR SMITH: Of course."
393;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-22T22:00:43Z;Investors cool to US multinationals;;Investors are losing their appetite for US multinationals amid mounting worries that the weak dollar and growth in the rest of the world will fail to offset a slowing domestic economy.The market’s lack of enthusiasm for companies that had underpinned recent rallies highlights growing pessimism over the prospect that exports and global trade would help large US companies weather a slowdown in their home market.With US-focused sectors such as financial services and consumer products reeling from the housing downturn and credit squeeze, the new concerns over multinationals are forcing analysts to further downgrade their earnings forecasts.In the first six months of the year, corporate America’s foreign profits rose at an annual rate of 15 per cent, outpacing domestic earnings growth and prompting investors to buy into multinationals as a hedge against a US slowdown.But over the past month shares of international companies such as General Electric, 3M, UPS, Exxon Mobil and Intel have suffered some of the biggest losses among large-cap companies.“Large-cap US multinationals, the darlings of the investment world for most of this year, have been roughed up over the past few weeks. More trouble lies ahead,” wrote Joseph Quinlan, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, in a note to clients this week. “US corporate earnings, supported earlier by strong global growth and a weak US dollar, succumbed to …deteriorating economic conditions at home”.Investors blame disappointing earnings and forecasts from large companies such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, the logistics giant FedEx, and the technology group Cisco, for the change in sentiment.The results dashed hopes that overseas earnings might help companies compensate for falling consumer confidence and business spending in the US – a key reason for investor flight to multinationals earlier this year.Wall Street expects earnings of S&P 500 companies to have risen just 3.1 per cent in the last three months of 2007, according to Bespoke Investment Group.At the start of October, analysts were expecting fourth quarter earnings to increase more than 11 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Some economists argue that the prospects of an export-led recovery in the US were always remote given the domestic economy’s reliance on consumer spending.
394;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-22T21:09:52Z;New York’s skies fly near their limit;;It does not take an airline executive or federal aviation official to recognise that the skies above New York’s three main airports are jammed with aircraft travelling to and from the US’s biggest city.For the legions of bleary-eyed passengers the congestion has meant missed connecting flights and lost business opportunities.“There’s only a limited amount of capacity that you can put in airports,” says Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the package-delivery company with more aircraft than any carrier save American Airlines. “The problem is: whose ox is going to get gored? It’s an intractable argument and one that’s been played out around the world.”Today the debate’s main stage may be in the New York City borough of Queens, home to John F. Kennedy international airport. In the wake of a miserable performance in punctuality this summer, the Federal Aviation Administration last month proposed capping the number of flights during peak hours at about 80 per hour instead of the current uncapped level of up to 115.It was not always this way. Andrew Watterson, now a director in the aviation practice of consultant Oliver Wyman, remembers when most domestic air travel coursed through LaGuardia airport and JFK was relatively underused.“People always talked about JFK being the place to go for cheap [domestic] flights,” said Mr Watterson, who lived in Manhattan in the late 1970s.Mounting demand for transcontinental routes, coupled with the advent of lower-cost regional carriers, swelled capacity at both JFK and nearby Newark Liberty international airport.In a recent survey by Zagat’s, travellers ranked LaGuardia and JFK as two of the five worst US airports.Airlines and politicians have now united in protest at the FAA proposal.Jon Corzine and Eliot Spitzer, the governors of New Jersey and New York, wrote that the cap “would be a crippling blow for our region’s passengers, our aviation industry and our economy”. Continental Airlines fretted that the excess JFK flights would be diverted to Newark, clogging what is the carrier’s regional hub.Fearing the cap would discourage tourism and economic activity in New York, Michael Bloomberg, mayor, has joined the chorus of FAA critics. He has backed a plan to tax carriers wishing to land during peak hours.Either way, the costs of air travel will probably rise.Airport officials in other large cities see opportunity in New York’s congested skies. “It’s not as though international carriers are going to pull out of New York, but they could start looking at other parts of the country,” said Jeffrey Fegan, CEO of DFW international airport in Texas.Airlines argue that the FAA could find ways to alleviate the restraints on capacity, pointing to President George W. Bush’s move to free some airspace normally reserved for military aircraft during the peak Thanksgiving holiday travel season. Giving commercial jets more frequent use of this space would help, the airlines say. So would reducing limits on flight paths to JFK, though such plans would surely draw anti-noise protests.While efforts are under way to upgrade air-traffic control technology, which would help increase capacity, airports are still years from achieving that. Forcing carriers to upgrade their fleet sooner could shave years off that timetable, Mr Watterson said.Meanwhile, carriers may ground some aircraft to help reduce the strain of record fuel costs. “If oil stays at $100 a barrel, airlines will look to put down unproductive capacity,” Mr Watterson said.
395;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-16T23:03:42Z;Weak data and FedEx raise fear of slowdown;;Investor worries about a US economic slowdown deepened on Friday after reports that industrial production had dropped unexpectedly and FedEx, a bellwether of economic activity, issued its second profit warning in two months.Weak industrial figures for October and meagre demand for freight on the part of FedEx customers raised fears that global economic growth and the weak dollar would not be enough to offset plunging house prices and waning US consumer confidence.“The key lesson from today’s weak manufacturing figures is that strong export growth is insufficient to prevent the manufacturing sector from slowing down in the face of domestic headwinds,” Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients.The poor news came a day after sluggish results from Starbucks and retailers JC Penney and Kohl’s suggested housing woes were affecting consumers.US industrial production fell 0.5 per cent in October, the biggest decline since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Federal Reserve said. The fall confounded economists’ expectations for a rise of 0.1 per cent.FedEx added to the gloom by slashing its forecast for the quarter to the end of November. FedEx linked the downgrade to rising fuel costs and “weak” demand for smaller, urgent shipments between businesses.Shares in FedEx, which had cut its full-year earnings forecast in September, fell 4.5 per cent. Starbucks shares lost 3.9 per cent to close at a 52-week low.
396;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-16T20:31:22Z;Wall St falls after FedEx warning;;Wall Street stocks were mostly weaker on Friday after higher fuel costs hit FedEx’s earnings outlook while a Federal Reserve governor cautioned against expectations of further rate cuts.In afternoon trade, the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,449.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.15 per cent at 13,090.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.03 per cent at 2,617.79.Starbucks reported its first decline in customer traffic in its US stores after the market closed on Thursday. Although fourth quarter earnings rose 35 per cent the company lowered the upper end of its fiscal 2008 guidance and the stock was down 8.6 per cent at $22.02.Shares in FedEx slid 4.1 per cent at $97.19 after it cut its second quarter earnings outlook citing the impact of higher fuel costs. Robert Baird downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral. The Dow transport index was down 1.6 per cent at 4564.85.Advanced Micro Devices rose 0.4 per cent at $12.75 after Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Development took an 8.1 per cent stake.Cisco Systems rose 1.9 per cent at $29.85 after the company raised its share buyback programme by as much as $10bn, or 6 per cent of shares outstanding.Hewlett-Packard was up 1.9 per cent at $49.84 after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to an ”overweight” from ”equal weight.”In economic news, foreign investors continued to remain cautious about investing in US markets. Net acquisition of long term securities by foreigners was $5.8bn in September but total net flows were -$14.7bn. The figure is an improvement on August, when capital outflows were In August outflows were $150.7bn, revised from $163bn.Meanwhile US industrial production fell for the first time in five months, down 0.5 per cent in October. Economists were expecting a small increase.Jan Hatzius, economist at Goldman Sachs said total credit losses linked to the housing slump could reach $400bn which would have a “dramatic” impact on leveraged investors.“If leveraged investors see $200 billion of the $400bn aggregate credit loss, they might need to scale back their lending by $2 trillion,” he said.Treasury bond prices were weaker after a sharp rally on Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 2 basis points at 3.34 per cent, after a decline from 3.51 per cent on Thursday.“The looming year-end and the increasing pace and threat of mortgage debt downgrades has the Treasury market on the run again,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “It’s becoming more clear that the tentacles of the crushing weight of the housing recession are spreading and gaining a tighter grip on the financial markets globally.”Interest rate futures fully price a cut in the Federal funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent in December.But Randall Kroszner, Federal Reserve governor, said on Friday that policy makers were unlikely to cut interest rates further.“The current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year, with growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable rate,’’ he said in a speech in New York.European stocks were lower ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 0.4 per cent and in London the FTSE 100 was also down 0.4 per cent. Asian equity markets closed lower after Wall Street’s losses on Thursday. Hong Kong fell 4 per cent, while in Toyko, the Nikkei 225 index fell 1.6 per cent.The dollar was modestly weaker against major currencies early in New York.Oil prices were higher with US crude prices up $1.70 at $95.10 a barrel.Stocks closed lower on Thursday, after JC Penney, the department store operator, warned of “dramatically” weaker sales and financials were sold amid continued concern about credit-related losses.The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 1,451.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 13,110.05 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1 per cent at 2,618.51. The CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer, jumped 9.3 per cent to 28.4.
397;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-16T17:27:58Z;US industrial output falls 0.5%;;US industrial production dropped last month by the largest amount since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, adding to signs that the US economy is slowing.Industrial production fell 0.5 per cent in October, figures from the Federal Reserve showed, equalling the drop recorded in January of this year, and the sharpest decline since output fell 1.6 per cent in September 2005. Production undershot economists’ expectations of a 0.1 per cent rise. Last month industrial output rose 0.2 per cent.The largest decline in production came in utilities, following an unusually mild October that eased demand for gas. But consumer goods also showed a sizeable decrease in production, indicating that the worst US housing slump in 16 years and the credit squeeze could be spilling over into the manufacturing industry. Construction, mining and manufacturing output were also lower.Capacity utilisation, which is a measure of the proportion of factories in use, fell to 81.7 per cent from 82.2 per cent.“Production was weak across almost all major sectors in October, a broadly based decline that indicates a weakening economy,” said Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight.The weak figures came as a series of other signals have pointed to a downturn in the economy.Fedex, the delivery and logistics company viewed as a bellwether of the US economy, issued its second profit warning in two months on Friday as it highlighted falling demand for shipments of freight.It was just the latest company to cut its profit outlook because of fears over the US economy.Starbucks said on Thursday that the number of people coming into its stores had fallen for the first time ever, while JC Penney warned that the state of the economy was hitting consumer’s wallets.The worrying signs in retail were complemented by softer weekly jobless figures on Thursday, which showed more people applied for unemployment benefit than expected.“The very definition of recession is a decline in both employment and production, both of which could well be either under way or at risk of occurring in the first quarter of next year,” said Tony Crescenzi, an economist at Miller Tabak.Industrial production may receive a boost from the weak dollar, currently at a record low, which has helped spur international demands for US goods.Stocks fell, yields on Treasuries rose and the dollar fell after the release of the figures.The growing signs of weakness put pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates further at their next rate-setting meeting. But the Fed is worried that inflation, which on Thursday rose sharply because of higher energy and food costs, still poses a risk.
398;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-11-16T16:47:49Z;FedEx warns again as fuel costs jump;;FedEx issued its second profit warning in two months on escalating fuel costs and meagre demand for US freight, sending the company’s shares lower and darkening the outlook for the world’s largest economy.The package-delivery company, long considered a bellwether for its role in facilitating domestic and international trade, slashed its forecast for second-quarter earnings to the end of November to $1.45-$1.55 a share from $1.60-$1.75, and dropped its full-year estimate to $6.40-$6.70. FedEx’s shares closed down 4.5 per cent at $96.80.Alan Graf, FedEx chief financial officer, said fuel expenses had jumped by 8 per cent, or $85m, since September, when the company made its previous earnings ­prediction.The surge in energy prices alone probably skimmed as much as 11 cents from FedEx’s earnings per share in the second quarter, according to Thomas Wadewitz, JPMorgan Chase analyst.Trends in so-called less-than-truckload freight, or more urgent bulk shipments between businesses, “remain weak, despite economic signs that the decline in US industrial production has hit bottom”, Mr Graf said.Production fell unexpectedly last month, the Federal Reserve said.Mr Graf cited the same conditions in September when FedEx cut its full-year profit forecast by 4 per cent.“We are taking prudent steps to reduce expenses, and are reviewing our capital investment plans for further reductions,” he said.Company officials declined to specify where or how much they planned to cut. In September, FedEx said capital expenses for the year would total $3.5bn, with 70 per cent of the budget earmarked for growth businesses, though it said spending could fall this year if some investment is delayed.While FedEx and its rivals share the burden of higher oil prices with their customers, any increase to the fuel surcharges they place on shipments do not kick in immediately. This lag works in FedEx’s favour as fuel expenses subside.The freight division, which operates predominantly in the US, accounted for about 13 per cent of the company’s total revenue in the first quarter. It is smaller than FedEx’s core express- and ground-shipping businesses.Less-than-truckload, or LTL, freight refers to shipments corporate customers make when they need to move goods quickly and cannot wait until orders fill an entire truck.FedEx will report its ­second-quarter results on December 20.
399;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US results point to weaker economy;;US companies on Tuesday underlined the resilience of their international operations but failed to dispel fears that the slowing domestic economy would weigh on future earnings.Third quarter results released by a raft of large US groups showed that the weaker dollar and global economic growth are helping parts of corporate America to cushion the blow of the housing downturn and liquidity squeeze.The chemical maker DuPont became the latest company with large overseas sales to report strong profit growth and a bullish outlook for next year.The company said that, although it expected the US housing market to remain depressed in 2008, profit growth would come from rising international demand, particularly for its agricultural products.The stock market took heart from DuPont’s comments, as well as strong results released by Apple and American Express on Monday after the closing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.16 per cent higher in midday New York trading, while the S&P 500 was also in positive territory.However, Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, saw its shares slip five per cent after missing analysts’ estimates on weak US sales and issuing bearish predictions for the near-term future of its domestic business.Meanwhile, UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, predicted that domestic retail sales would rise at its slowest pace in four years.Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, who is to become chief executive on January 1, told the FT that high energy prices and falling housing prices are “bound to put pressure on the consumer”.However, UPS said a gradual rebound in industrial production would quicken the pace of US economic expansion to around 2.5 per cent in 2008.Other companies, such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, have been less sanguine, warning the economy was heading for a recession.Unlike its arch-rival FedEx, which cut its earnings forecasts for the rest of the year due to the slowing US economy, UPS expects to earn $4.13 to $4.19 a share in 2007, within the range of estimates provided to investors at the start of the year.
400;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-10-15T22:39:35Z;UPS chief steps down after 6 years;;"Mike Eskew, chairman and chief executive of UPS, is to step down after six years at the helm of the world’s largest package-delivery company.Scott Davis, UPS’s 55-year-old finance chief, will succeed Mr Eskew on January 1. Mr Eskew, 58, will keep his seat on the company’s board.His decision to retire comes less than a month after the company reached a new contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the labour union that represents 240,000 of UPS’s 360,000 US workers.Mr Davis will inherit a company facing an uncertain economic outlook in the US and struggling to persuade investors its future is as bright as that of its arch-rival, FedEx.Under Mr Eskew’s direction, UPS sought to expand beyond its traditional package business. He strengthened the company’s presence overseas, and made dozens of acquisitions to establish a freight division.The moves, designed in part to counter market-share gains by FedEx in the US, did not help UPS shares keep pace with those of its rival.The stock has climbed 40 per cent since Mr Eskew was elevated to the top job; in that same period, FedEx’s shares have doubled.Mr Davis will be the first chief executive who has not spent his entire career with the company, having joined through its acquisition in 1986 of II Morrow.Kurt Kuehn, a management committee member and senior vice president of global sales and marketing, will replace Mr Davis as chief financial officer."
401;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Business Post extends share of UK postal market;;Guy Buswell, chief executive of Business Post, the private parcel and mail delivery group, said the postal strike beginning on Thursday could endanger the future of the mail industry if the dispute was not resolved soon.During the strike, he said, the 6m to 8m pieces of mail which Business Post’s UK Mail subsidiary collects every night would continue to be delivered into Royal Mail depots and wait there for final delivery once the postmen and women were back at work.Mr Buswell also said the group’s parcels business had seen a sudden slump in deliveries to consumers in the days following the Northern Rock crisis. He said there had been “a huge reduction in volumes” of parcel deliveries from companies which sell electronic goods, such as computers, over the internet.He said the business had picked up again since, but that it showed that consumer confidence could be hit by such events.In a trading update covering the group’s half year to the end of September, the group said the UK Mail business “continues to achieve strong growth with revenues in the period up by some 60 per cent.” The mail market in the UK was fully opened to competition in 2006 and UK Mail now has a 7½ per cent market share.Mr Buswell said that in the new year the group was launching a service called iMail, which would allow customers to send letters electronically to UK Mail’s offices, where they would be printed, put in envelopes, stamped and delivered at a price the same or lower than first class mail.This service would be available to anyone, whereas UK Mail caters for customers posting at least 500 pieces of mail a night, such as banks and utilities.Group revenues in the half year were affected by the loss of a contract with Federal Express. That contract, worth £20m a year in revenues and £2m in operating profits, ended on April 30 after FedEx acquired a UK parcels business.Mr Buswell said that the group was having success in winning new contracts, however, the loss of the FedEx contract meant that group revenues had increased in the first half by 9 per cent rather than an underlying 15 per cent.Revenues from the group’s parcels operation were in-line with the same period of last year, as “good growth” in the business-to-business parcels operation had been offset by a decline in deliveries to consumers.Mr Buswell said that consumer business was increasingly competitive with rivals setting up and offering a cheaper, but lower quality, service. Business Post – which delivers time-sensitive products such as top-quality meat and fish – would “not chase volume at low margins,” Mr Buswell said.The group’s shares, which have fallen from around 480p in recent weeks ahead of the postal strike, slipped another 6p to 394p in morning trading.Interim results will be published on November 14.
402;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-21T21:22:33Z;Wall St enjoys best week in six months;;"Wall Street stocks had their best week for six months after the Federal Reserve surprised markets by slashing interest rates by half a percentage point.The S&P 500 on Tuesday enjoyed its biggest one-day gain since March 2003 as investors bet that low interest rates would lend support to the US economy.The decision to cut both the Fed Funds rate and the discount rate – the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed – appeared to calm equity markets as share volatility eased.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, a measure of future market volatility, fell 24 per cent to lows last reached at the end of July before the credit squeeze.Trading volumes were high on the week and on Friday the New York Stock Exchange set a new volume record for the first hour of trading.Equity markets surged even as the dollar fell to a new record low against the euro.The CurrencyShares Euro Trust exchange traded fund, which tracks the price of the euro, closed the week at an all-time high.The S&P 500 was 2.8 per cent higher on the week at 1,525.72, within 1.8 per cent of its all-time high, set in July. The Dow Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.8 per cent at 13,820.19 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.7 per cent at 2,671.22.Large-cap companies saw particularly strong gains. The Russell Top 50 index of the largest US companies by market capitalisation hit its highest level since 2001.“I’m surprised at the strong snap back – it’s almost like we discounted everything that happened over the last three months,” Joe Ranieri, managing director of trading of Canaccord Adams, said. “The weaker dollar is going to be good for earnings at the larger cap companies, particularly in the tech sector.”The Nasdaq was lifted on Friday by some positive earnings news from Oracle and details of a share buyback by Texas Instruments.Google set a new all-time high, up 5.9 per cent for the week at $560.10.However, it was a disappointing week for Microsoft, down 1.3 per cent to $28.65, after a European court upheld a European Commission ruling that the software group had abused its near-monopoly position.Oracle reported a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The stock was up 9.5 per cent on the week at $21.98.Texas Instruments was 5.6 per cent higher at $36.62 after its board approved a $5bn share buyback programme and announced plans to raise its cash dividend by 25 per cent.In other earnings news, Nike said quarterly profit rose 51 per cent. Shares in the athletic shoe and clothing company were flat for the week at $57.26.The week’s earnings news was dominated by the brokerage sector as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns turned in their third-quarter report cards.Goldman and Lehman surprised the market with better-than-expected earnings, up 10.2 per cent to $209.98 and 5.4 per cent to $62.70 on the week, respectively.But Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley disappointed.Shares in Morgan, which reported a 17 per cent third-quarter profit decline, were down 2.5 per cent on the week at $64.44. Bear’s earnings fell 61 per cent after fixed-income revenues plummeted but its shares ended the week flat at $117.32.Transport stocks lagged the market as crude oil set a series of record highs.FedEx, down 4.7 per cent at $104.10, cut its earnings forecast for the year due to higher energy costs and uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook.Shares in Harman International Industries plunged 21.3 per cent to $85.The company confirmed rumours that Goldman Sachs and KKR would not complete their planned $8bn purchase of the audio equipment maker.Mattel, up 6.6 per cent at $23.94, finished the week with an apology to the Chinese people for damaging the reputation of their manufacturers after the recall of around 21m toys. On a
visit to Beijing, Thomas Debrowski, executive vice-president of worldwide operations, said the majority of toys were recalled because of design flaws, not poor Chinese manufacturing.It was another volatile week for homebuilder stocks as positive news about the relaxation of regulation of mortgage lenders was overshadowed by more downbeat data on housing starts, which declined 2.6 per cent in August. But the S&P materials index recorded strong gains as investors bet on the continuing strength of the global construction boom."
403;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-21T07:39:30Z;FedEx;;FedEx burned through $3.53bn of fuel last year in its quest to deliver packages on time. With oil prices near $83 a barrel and growing demand for international shipping, that number is all but guaranteed to rise. In the US, however, the world’s largest air cargo carrier risks getting squeezed between higher fuel prices and slowing demand.Although FedEx beat expectations in the first quarter, its shares fell after the potential squeeze forced it to cut forecasts. The heady market triggered by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut has done little to boost the shares, which reacted negatively to the fear that looser monetary policy would push record fuel prices even higher.Energy costs could also create a $32bn drag on consumer spending in 2008, according to Goldman Sachs. That could hit FedEx and its arch-rival UPS with a painful double-whammy, inflating shipping expenses while helping to deflate demand. Combine that with an even bigger hit to overall consumer spending power from mortgage resets, and FedEx may be in for a bumpy ride into – and perhaps beyond – the key holiday season.FedEx based its earlier guidance on hopes of a rebound in volumes. Indeed, its critical ground and express parcel divisions have remained strong, helped by an uptick in international demand. But a drop in freight trucking profits and a shift by US customers to cheaper services may signal tougher times ahead.The real question is whether stronger exports, express shipping demand, and productivity improvements can offset FedEx’s hit from fuel. The shipper has made decisive moves into China, and bought room for manoeuvre by indicating it could slow capital spending. Its recent move to slash fuel surcharges was aimed at building market share. But with customers responding more slowly than expected, that initiative now seems ill-timed, or at least, overly optimistic.
404;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-20T20:55:02Z;Wall St lower as dollar plunges;;Wall Street suffered a sluggish day after two consecutive days of gains as the US dollar hit a record low against the euro and amid a mixed set of brokerage results.Attention was focused on Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, and Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, as they gave testimony before Congress on the subprime mortgage crisis.The S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent lower at 1,518.74. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.5 per cent at 2,654.29, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent at 13,766.70.Appearing before the House financial services committee, Mr Bernanke said delinquencies and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market “are likely to rise further”.“Global financial losses have far exceeded even the most pessimistic estimates of the credit losses on these loans,” Mr Bernanke said.But Mr Paulson told the House that in spite of a recent reappraisal of risk and weaknesses in the housing sector, “the fundamentals point to continued US economic growth”.He also said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee about 40 per cent of US mortgages, should temporarily be allowed to securitise loans exceeding $417,000 – so-called “jumbo” mortgages.His comments failed to lift the S&P homebuilder index, which endured another torrid day, closing 6.3 per cent lower at 453.53.Transport stocks also showed weakness after a disappointing earnings forecast from FedEx.In the three months to August 31, FedEx increased net income from $475m to $494m but said 2008 earnings would decline by as much as 4.3 per cent. Shares in the company closed 2.9 per cent lower at $104.45.“Recent financial market volatility and high energy costs have increased the uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook,’’ the company said in a statement.The Dow transport index fell 1.8 per cent and has fallen about 11 per cent in the past two months.Crude oil prices again climbed to record levels, closing $1.39 higher at $83.32, providing a further support to energy stocks.Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs completed the week’s round of brokerage earnings updates for the fiscal third quarter but achieved differing results.Bear reported a 61 per cent decline in earnings for the quarter from a year ago. Net income declined from $438m to $171m, while fixed-income revenue plummeted 88 per cent to $118m.Bear’s shares fell as low as $113.88 but the stock closed only 0.2 per cent lower at $115.46.“Earnings for the third fiscal quarter confirm that Bear Stearns has been hurt disproportionately relative to its bulge-bracket peers by the downturn in the mortgage markets, and by the BSAM hedge fund implosion,” said Kathleen Shanley, credit strategist at Gimme Credit.In contrast, Goldman delivered a 79 per cent rise in third-quarter profits to $2.85bn, compared with $1.55bn the previous year, beating expectations, as revenue rose 63 per cent to $12.3bn.Its shares have climbed almost 10 per cent this week but yesterday afternoon slipped 1 per cent to $203.53. The S&P investment bank index shed closed 2 per cent lower“Revenues increased across the board, as robust customer activity and solid risk management procedures offset losses on non-prime loans and loan commitments,” said Matthew Albrecht, brokerage industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.“Credit writedowns totalled $1.5bn, net of hedges, but mortgage exposure was covered by hedging positions, netting a gain for the period.”Elsewhere there was mixed news for the economy. Weekly jobless claims fell 9,000 to 311,000 and the four-week moving average fell 3,500 to 320,750.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank’s manufacturing index, a measure of regional factory activity, climbed to 10.9 in September, after a flat result the previous month.However, the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators fell 0.6 per cent in August, exceeding the 0.5 per cent fall anticipated by analysts.
405;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-20T18:41:24Z;Fedex hit by fuel costs and credit woe;;Fedex, the delivery company, on Thursday cut its earnings forecast for the rest of the year by 4 per cent, citing slowing the US economy and rising fuel costs“While the US economy is growing at a moderate pace, recent financial market volatility and high energy costs have increased the uncertainty surrounding the near term economic outlook, and weakness in the housing sector continues,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer.Fedex had previously predicted that the US economy would improve by late summer or early autumn.However, the credit market turmoil over the summer has undone that forecast, and the company now expects less than 3 per cent growth in the US economy this year.Fedex said it felt weakness in its freight delivery business amid the worsening housing slump and struggling performance in the motor industry. The company, which is viewed as a bellwether for the US economy, expects the countrt will avoid recession.The combined effects of the housing market troubles and higher fuel prices forced Fedex to cut its forecast for the rest of the year to $6.70-$7.10 a share, down from $7-$7.40 previously.“In the second quarter in particular rising fuel price is working against us versus our previous year’s earnings,” said Mr Graf.Fedex reported net income of $494m, in its first fiscal quarter, up 4 per cent from last year. Earnings per share were $1.58, up from $1.53 a year ago and ahead of analysts’ expectatations of $1.54 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 8 per cent to $9.2bn.The company said weakness in its freight transport division was offset by a strong global economy outside the US and by the weak dollar. Fedex freight saw a 30 per cent drop in operating income to $105m in the quarter as the US slump in freight transport deepened.FedEx’s parcel delivery business, its biggest earner, saw operating income rise 9 per cent to $519m. Domestic package volume fell 1 per cent but the international package business was boos­ted by favourable exchange rates and growing volumes.FedEx also said it was bringing its struggling FedEx Kinko retail division into a new division called FedEx Services along with its IT, advertising and marketing, and operations on its website. FedEx Services revenue fell slightly to $525m from $527m.
406;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-20T15:16:42Z;Tentative start on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks had a tentative start on Thursday as investors digested mixed brokerage results and the US dollar hit a record low against the euro ahead of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony to Congress.Less than an hour after the opening bell the S&P 500 was flat at 1,528.65. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,669.02 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 13,809.78.In his testimony released on Thursday morning ahead of his appearance before Congress, Mr Bernanke said delinquencies and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market “are likely to rise further.”“Global financial losses have far exceeded even the most pessimistic estimates of the credit losses on these loans,” Mr Bernanke said.In his testimony Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, told the House Financial Services Panel that despite a recent reappraisal of risk and weaknesses in the housing sector, “the fundamentals point to continued US economic growth.’’He also said the administration would be prepared temporarily to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee around 40 per cent of US mortgages, to buy and sell loans exceeding $417,000 – so-called “jumbo loans”.The S&P homebuilder index was lower on Thursday with transport stocks also trading down after a disappointing earnings forecast from FedEx.In three months to August 31 FedEx increased net income from $475m to $494m but said 2008 earnings would decline by as much as 4.3 per cent.“Recent financial market volatility and high energy costs have increased the uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook,’’ FedEx said.Oil prices remained at record levels, edging $0.18 higher to $82.11. US crude prices set a record close of $81.93 a barrel on Wednesday.Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs completed the week’s round of brokerage reports for the fiscal third quarter posting markedly different performances.Bear reported a 62 per cent decline in earnings per share for the quarter from a year ago. Net income declined from $438m to $171m while fixed-income revenue plummeted 88 per cent to $118m. Bear’s shares fell 0.8 per cent to $116.54 in early trade, after a fall of 3 per cent on Wednesday.”Earnings for the third fiscal quarter confirm that Bear Stearns has been hurt disproportionately relative to its bulge bracket peers by the downturn in the mortgage markets, and by the BSAM hedge fund implosion,” said Kathleen Shanley, credit strategist at Gimme Credit.By contrast, Goldman delivered a 79 per cent rise in third-quarter profit to $2.85bn, compared with $1.55bn the prior year, beating expectations, as revenue rose 63 per cent to $12.3bn. The shares rose 2.2 per cent to $209.92.”Revenues increased across the board, as robust customer activity and solid risk management procedures offset losses on non-prime loans and loan commitments,” said Matthew Albrecht, brokerage industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. ”Credit writedowns totalled $1.5bn, net of hedges, but mortgage exposure was covered by hedging positions, netting a gain for the period.”In other company news shares in Nasdaq surged 6.2 per cent to $38.22 after it agreed to join forces with Borse Dubai to buy OMX, the Nordic market operator.The tie-up will see Borse Dubai take a stake in Nasdaq and acquire Nasdaq’s 28 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq will take a strategic stake in Dubai International Financial Exchange and take Borse Dubai’s existing stake in OMX.Elsewhere there was mixed news for the economy. Weekly jobless claims fell 9,000 to 311,000 and the four-week moving average fell 3,500 to 320,750, helping to reassure investors alert to signs of weakness in the US labour market.But the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators fell 0.6 per cent in August, ahead of the 0.5 per cent fall expected by analysts, raising fears that economic growth is slowing.US bond yields were higher, led by the 30-year Treasury as worries over inflation being stoked by the Fed rate cut persisted. Traders were also unnerved by news that Saudi Arabia had not lowered interest rates, as its currency is pegged to the dollar.The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 5 basis points at 4.04 per cent, while on the 10-year it rose 6 basis points to 4.60 per cent.“The dollar is big talk today on the news that Saudi Arabia hasn’t lowered rates to play tag with the Fed,” said David Adder, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
407;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-09-16T21:49:06Z;FedEx gives stamp of approval;;“From the M66 to Route 66 by 10.30 next day” is the promise to northern businesses made by FedEx, which is to expand its operations in Manchester by starting its first direct express freight flight from the region to the US.Good news for Ramsbottom, Lancashire, where the less-celebrated of those two highways reaches its northern end after only eight miles. It is also a vote of confidence by the US transportation company in the economic prospects of the wider north-west.Availability of quick and important logistics connections is a badge of honour for a region. The north of England has felt under-served, even taking into account its economic underdevelopment relative to London and the south-east.FedEx has had “feeder” flights from Manchester but its other two direct services from the UK to the US use Stansted. UPS and DHL, FedEx’s well-known rivals, have built operations at East Midlands airport, the UK’s biggest “pure” freight airport, which is considered well-placed for the national motorway network and has plenty of space to expand.DHL has already this year announced improvements to its services to give better “next day” service to the US from many regional cities. TNT, a fourth “integrator”, flies from UK airports including Liverpool to a European hub in Belgium.Robert Elliott, FedEx’s president for Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa, said Manchester was a logical place to expand as one of the largest industrial areas in the UK.FedEx’s decision means companies and people accounting for 70 per cent of UK output now have access to its next-day delivery in the US, compared with only 40 per cent previously.“We just took a quantum leap in our competitive position,” Mr Elliott said. “It was the place to have the biggest impact for local customers as well as for customers downstream in the US.” FedEx says customers from north Wales to Yorkshire and the north-east will now get a next-day service to the US.Other customers in the north-west will get later cut-off times for deliveries and say the improvement should help their business.Graham Moss, warehouse and logistics manager of Zetex, a maker of semiconductors based in Oldham, said: “It will help to cut turnround times for orders to the US. The more you can shave off long lead times the better.”Paul Hillier, finance director of Character Options, the maker of toys such as Robosapien and Doctor Who spin-offs, said it could help his company – also based in Oldham – to expedite the back-and-forth process of finessing toy designs and prototypes with international partners. “That can give you more sales days in important periods leading up to Christmas, for example. There is a point in the process where things become time-critical.”A study last year by Oxford Economic Forecasting bears out the idea that business values quick access to express services. Its report on East Midlands Airport, which is owned by Manchester Airport Group, concluded access to its services was vital or very important for one in 10 companies that decides to locate to the region, with the express industry helping to catalyse the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy.The express freight industry in the UK is poised to expand by about 6.7 per cent a year – nearly three times as fast as the economy – until 2014, says the Oxford Economic Forecasting study.Manchester’s direct US air freight link is sure to be used as a lure for further inward investment. Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester council, says FedEx’s investment “tells us the level of maturity Manchester has reached in business terms”.FedEx’s expansion, adding 40 jobs, is part of a build-up of cargo services in recent months at Manchester airport. Two Asian cargo carriers have begun services there within the past year, while Air China and Aeroflot also inaugurated freight services this month at Manchester.Tim McDermott, Manchester’s aviation development director, says: “There has been a step-change in the number of dedicated freight operators wanting to come to Manchester. A lot of these have taken years to come to fruition.”Monthly cargo movements passed 15,000 tonnes for the first time in July and are 29 per cent higher than a year ago. The greater part of the movements is accounted for by imports.
408;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-08-06T19:49:32Z;FedEx views struggling Kinko’s as ‘critical’;;The head of Kinko’s on Monday defended the struggling retail chain after a poor string of results, saying it was “critical” to the future of parent company FedEx.As he announced plans to accelerate store openings in the next year, Ken May, FedEx Kinko’s chief executive, said in an interview with the FT: “Most people at FedEx understand [the importance of Kinko’s]. I know that Fred Smith [FedEx chief executive] understands it. He spends a lot of time talking to me about it. He feels like this is one of the most critical things going on at FedEx Corp.”The opening of 300 fresh outlets by next summer marks a step up in the pace of FedEx Kinko’s expansion, after the addition of 200 stores since last August. Kinko’s provides printing and photocopying, access to FedEx delivery services and sells office supplies.FedEx acquired Kinko’s for $2.4bn in February 2004 from Clayton Dubilier and Rice, private equity firm, but results at the retailer have consistently deteriorated.The company has committed to an aggressive expansion in retail outlets as it seeks to improve the reach of its core business of package delivery and to offer a challenge to the 5,800 branches of the UPS Store run by UPS, its chief US competitor.The new stores will take the total in the US to more than 2000. FedEx wants a total of 4000 Kinko’s stores, including 1000 outside the US. It currently has 159 international stores, and will add 20 next year.Analysts say that the Kinko’s shops offer a “customer contact point” that helps boost the volume of packages sent through FedEx by providing a convenient local option for customers. “We want to become the local print provider and local drop off point for every community in America,” said Mr May.FedEx now makes $840m in annual revenue for packages which are sent from Kinko’s stores, a figure which is “growing rapidly” according to Mr May.But in the last year, Kinko’s revenues fell 2 per cent to $2.04bn. Operating income has fallen for the last two years as the company has invested in opening stores, retraining staff and promoting the Kinko’s brand.Rising numbers of packages sent through its stores have partially offset lost income from falling demand for photocopying.“Kinko’s has been a challenging acquisition,” said James Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poors. “The integration has gone less smoothly and it has been less profitable than expected. But it’s a strong strategic piece for FedEx.”
409;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-08-05T21:05:06Z;Concerns over Chinese postal law;;China should improve transparency of a new law governing the country’s $6bn-a-year express delivery market, say executives at UPS, the package delivery group.An updated version of China’s Postal Law, which was promulgated in 1986, is in its ninth version and has been a source of concern for foreign and domestic courier companies pitted against China Post, the incumbent.US-based UPS, its international peers and upstart Chinese express companies are in the awkward position of having to “compete with our regulator”, Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times.Ken Torok, UPS Asia Pacific president, noted that transparency surrounding the law’s most recent drafts had deteriorated. There are concerns China could introduce a “universal tax” of 4 per cent on overseas entrants.“We would look at that as a form of double taxation,” Mr Torok said. “We are just looking for a level playing field in the industry.”Mr Torok contrasted the opacity of China’s new postal law with a more open process in India, which is also revising its antiquated regulatory regime and posts drafts on the internet.“When they do that everyone has visibility,” Mr Torok said. “We’d like to see more of that [in China].”Uncertainty also surrounds how China intends to “carve out the monopoly”. According to an earlier draft of the law, only China Post’s express delivery arm would be allowed to deliver parcels weighing less than 150g – a restriction of particular concern to the incumbent’s domestic competitors.UPS currently does not accept packages of less than 2kg for delivery in China.Last October, an increasingly vocal domestic lobby of state-owned and private courier companies that compete against China Post took issue with the proposed limit. The Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers – which represents UPS, DHL, Fedex and TNT – has also been critical of the drafting process.Booz Allen Hamilton, a consultancy, estimates China’s express delivery market will reach $5.8bn this year and $7.4bn next, making it a coveted destination for international courier companies.UPS was the first of the “big four” international couriers to wholly own its China operations, as allowed under the terms of the country’s accession agreement to the World Trade Organisation. The company bought out Sinotrans, its state-owned joint venture partner, for $100m in 2005.It employs 4,500 people in China and is building an international hub in Shanghai. UPS is now applying for trucking and freight forwarding licences in China. But it must secure national, provincial and even municipal approvals.
410;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations. Its shares fell 6.4 per cent in late afternoon trading.The second-biggest US chemical company, which sells insulation and paints to the housing and motor industries, suffered a 2 per cent decrease in sales domestically while its overseas volumes grew by 4 per cent.PepsiCo profits beat analysts’ expectations thanks to growing demand for soft drinks in China and Europe and potato chips in Russia and Mexico.An increase in international revenues helped United Airlines shrug off concerns about over-capacity and lower domestic demand to report bullish second-quarter earnings. While passenger revenues in the Americas declined slightly, transatlantic and transpacific flights generated 25.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent more revenue respectively."
411;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-07-02T22:42:16Z;Deutsche Post revives US air cargo ambition;;Deutsche Post, the German postal and logistics group, has quietly revived a plan to invest in the US air cargo industry which was dropped four years ago in the face of regulatory opposition.The company last month acquired a 49 per cent stake in Miami-based Astar Air Cargo, which in turn launched an unsolicited bid for Ohio-based ABX Air. Both companies derive most of their business from long-term contracts with DHL.The proposed deal follows years of wrangling over Deutsche Post’s role in the US air cargo business, which is subject to the same constraints over foreign ownership as passenger airlines.Deutsche Post’s DHL Worldwide Express unit agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in Astar – then known as DHL Airways – to a group of US investors in 2003 after rivals such as UPS and FedEx claimed it had broken the ownership laws.DHL’s $1.05bn purchase of Airborne Express was also subjected to similar scrutiny, and the air cargo company was spun off to shareholders and renamed ABX, while the German group kept the ground-based parcel business.Astar, which is headed by former Northwest Airlines chief executive John Dasburg, also tried to acquire ABX in 2003, and the talks were revived last December before the Miami-based group last week made an unsolicited $7.75 a share proposal to acquire its rival, citing “unusual volume and pricing activity” in ABX stock.ABX was asked to respond by yesterday to a proposal which valued the company at $454m. Its shares climbed 12 per cent in the wake of the announcement and were trading just above $8, fuelling speculation of a rival offer from management.DHL has struggled to break the dominance of UPS and FedEx in the US market, scaling back its ambitions to become what one executive described as “a viable third competitor”, though it acquired a minority stake in Polar Air Cargo to gain access to the fast-growing transpacific market.Combining its two largest US contractors – which operate a hub at the same Ohio airport – would provide economies of scale at a time when the slowdown in the domestic economy has produced gloomy outlooks in recent weeks from FedEx and UPS.DHL said it expected no problems in securing regulatory backing for the two deals involving its suppliers.
412;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-06-21T00:14:18Z;FedEx fails to deliver as economy slows;;FedEx, the package delivery group, said it expected the weak US economy to pick up in the late summer or early autumn, as it reported poor fourth-quarter earnings that undershot Wall Street expectations.“We were restrained by a slowing US economy,” said Fred Smith, FedEx chairman, president and chief executive.“The weakened industrial sector is currently limiting demand for transportation services.”Net earnings grew 7 per cent to $610m, or $1.96 per share, in the three months to the end of May.But excluding a 6 cent boost from a settlement with Airbus over the cancellation of a plane order, earnings missed the $1.96 per share expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Reuters estimates.Revenue was up 8 per cent from last year at $9.15bn.FedEx is viewed as an economic bellwether because of its extensive transport and delivery network throughout the US, with companies and individuals tending to send fewer packages as conditions worsen.“We’re looking forward to a pick-up, even if it’s a slight pick-up, in the fall,” said David Bronczek, head of FedEx’s express division, its largest.FedEx results were hit by a drop in US revenues and volumes in express delivery, as the cost of fuel rose and customers moving to cheaper services offset price increases.The company said it did not expect any improvement in express volumes this year.Operating income grew 30 per cent in ground transport, as customers shifted from more costly express delivery, where operating income grew 6 per cent.In freight transport, operating income was down 12 per cent.The domestic transport and freight industry is struggling in the US.“The environment is worse than what it was at the low point of the last recession in 2001,” said Rick Paterson, UBS analyst. “We are essentially in a domestic freight recession.”FedEx expects earnings in the next quarter to be $1.45 to $1.60 per share, and earnings for this financial year to be $7 to $7.40 per share assuming the US economy improves and oil prices do not rise.Investors were heartened by FedEx’s optimistic economic outlook and earnings prediction, which covered the consensus forecast of $7.33.“Many people thought they might reduce their guidance more than they did,” said James Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s. Shares in FedEx had risen 1.61 per cent to $109.80 by the close.Earnings growth is expected to miss the company’s long-term 10 per cent to 15 per cent earnings growth target because of soft economic growth and the cost investments, the company said. Net income for the year was $2.02bn, up 12 per cent, on a 9 per cent rise in revenue to $35.2bn.
413;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US stocks slide as oil and bonds take toll;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday, as higher bond yields and lower oil prices weighed on major sectors in the absence of fresh economic news.After a positive start, the S&P 500 index faltered and extended losses to close down 1.4 per cent at 1,512.84. Within the S&P, energy, down 2.9 per cent, utilities, lower by 2.6 per cent and financials, off 1.7 per cent led losses among the major sectors.The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,599.96.A slide in oil prices hurt energy stocks, while higher bond yields depressed interest rate sensitive stocks such as utilities and real estate investment trusts.Financials were in the spotlight for a variety of reasons on Wednesday. While Morgan Stanley said its second- quarter earnings rose 41 per cent to a record $2.58bn, its stock closed 0.6 per cent lower at $87.32. That was down from a high of $90.33 early on Wednesday as worries over the mortgage market intensified.Bear Stearns slid 2.5 per cent to $143.20 as two of the bank’s hedge funds, that hold mortgage securities, were set to be wound up, as attempts to arrange a bail-out diminished. Merrill Lynch, and other banks that had lent to the hedge funds, were in the process of auctioning collateral on Wednesday.Matthew Albrecht, brokerage analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research said Bear’s “own position in the funds is relatively small, but it may soon provide credit to cover exiting lenders, expanding its exposure”.In deal news, Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buyout. Shares in the investment manager jumped 16.6 per cent to $63.14.Meanwhile, shares in Dow Jones rose 3.2 per cent to $60.65 amid talk of another potential buyer for the media company.In spite of the selloff on Wednesday, the leading benchmarks remain sharply higher so far this year and traders believe the market has been due for a period of consolidation.Evidence that retail investors are starting to look at stocks has also increased of late. Charles Biderman, chief executive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research said from last Wednesday through to Monday, US equity funds had attracted an estimated inflow of $6bn and inflows exceeded $1bn on three out of the four trading days.“If retail investors are finally coming back to the US stock market after three years of avoiding it, US stock prices could really start shooting higher,’’ said Mr Biderman.Another source of support for stocks has been companies buying back their own shares. Home Depot rose 4.6 per cent to $40.03 on news that it plans a $22.5bn share repurchase.The home-improvement chain was one of five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that closed higher on Wednesday. The Dow fell 1.1 per cent to 13,489.34 as 25 of its members declined.As investors approach the halfway mark of the year, sector and style rotation could intensify say analysts.“The market is really trying to figure out where to go from here,’’ said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services. “Mega-cap stocks still trade at much lower multiples than smaller and mid-cap stocks.“It would be no surprise to see mega-cap and growth stocks move higher as investors rotate their portfolios,’’ he said.Indications that large companies have attracted buyers has materialised with this week’s 2.5 per cent rise in General Electric.The conglomerate set a fresh five-year high of $39.77 on Wednesday, before it closed down 0.6 per cent at $39.07. GE’s gain of 5 per cent this year lags the 8.2 per cent rise in the Dow.In other earnings news, FedEx reported 2007 fiscal fourth quarter profit rose 7 per cent, but the results missed expectations. However, the company expects a robust full-year outlook and its stock was up 1.6 per cent at $109.80.Meanwhile, Circuit City reported a $54.6m loss in the first-quarter as it cut jobs as part of a restructuring programme. The electronics retailer also withdrew guidance for fiscal 2008 as it continued to restructure and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $16.10. The stock fell 2.8 per cent on Tuesday.Shares in MGM fell 6.8 per cent to $80.60, rebounding from a low of $77.10, as plans by Kirk Kerkorian – who owns 56 per cent of the company – to privately buy the Bellagio Hotel and Casino and the $7.4bn Project City-Center seemed set to falter.MGM said on Wednesday that it had entered into a letter of intent to form a 50-50 joint venture to develop an integrated resort property on the Las Vegas Strip.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
415;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-05-22T14:53:59Z;Big four hope expansion will deliver the goods;;UPS is counting on information-related services to give the international delivery company an edge in China’s highly fragment domestic express market, a growing industry battleground.“The data that’s wrapped around the shipment is becoming just as important as the goods themselves,” said Ken Torok, president of UPS Asia Pacific. “Our strategy is to add capability and a lot of that has been around the information piece.”Services such as shipment tracking and guaranteed-time deliveries that are common in Europe and the US are still rare in China. FedEx, UPS’ US rival, will only begin offering its signature guaranteed next-day express service within China next week.The push to provide value-added logistics services come largely from multi-national retailers such as Wal-Mart who are adopting a just-in-time model for sourcing from Chinese factories, says UPS. The vast scale and the complexity of supplying huge numbers of components to manufacturers on time is creating the need for advanced services.“One of the things we are working on is the ability to intercept and re-route shipments in transit,” said Mr Torok. He said multinationals are interested in such a service, which the company introduced for US domestic shipments in March.The ability to offer sophisticated logistics services is seen as a competitive advantage the “big four” international operators – UPS, FedEx, DHL and TNT – hold over domestic counterparts. “For the local players, [these services] are still relatively new,” said Edward Tse, greater China managing director for consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton.China’s express market was valued at about $4.4bn in 2006, with $3.1bn of that accounted for by the domestic market, according to a report by Booz Allen.It estimated that former monopoly China Post still holds about 40 per cent of the domestic express market but only about a 20 per cent share of deliveries in and out of China.The report put the big four’s share of international China shipments at about 75 per cent, with DHL in the lead with nearly a third of the market and UPS and FedEx each matching China Post’s share. The overall market is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 30 per cent and reach $7.4bn by 2008.The big four are all investing to expand their presence in China. FedEx’s guaranteed service will be run out of its new domestic hub in Hangzhou, a city near Shanghai. The company is also is building a $150m Asia hub in the south-eastern province of Guangzhou and last year paid $400m to take full control of its Chinese joint venture with Tianjin Datian W. Group.UPS signed an agreement last month to invest $20m in a new international air hub in Shanghai. DHL is in the process of choosing between Shanghai and Seoul for a new hub.China’s domestic market was liberalised only last year under the terms of the country’s World Trade Organisation accession agreement. It remains fragmented, with the big four holding about the same market share as thousands of small and mid-sized local companies.The big four are also anxious about a proposed new postal law. A seventh draft of the bill, now in front of the State Council, is , believed to contain a clause that would restore China Post’s monopoly over the delivery of parcels weighing less than 150g.“Right now the priority [for the Big Four] is still on the international market because it is still growing very fast,” said Mr Tse. “But they are all seriously looking at the domestic market.”
416;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-05-16T16:32:02Z;Hidden beauty of the ‘uglies’;;"Armed with computers, freight managers can pack a truck so that only the barest minimum of space is left empty. They click, drag and hit return to determine exactly how to fill the vehicle with goods ready for market. But what about transporting the “uglies” – the boxes of different shapes and sizes containing broken and unwanted products – back to the manufacturer?“[Reverse logistics] is never quite the same as a forward logistics system, where you can optimise each truck so you might have only a spare millimetre inside,” says Martin Patten, manager of the technology programme for Europe at Cisco Systems, the networking equipment supplier. “You can’t quite do that on the way back because people might use bubble wrap or put things in bigger boxes.”Worse, products usually need to be collected from all sorts of different locations. As a result, it can cost four times as much to take something back as to send it out.For retailers and manufacturers, poorly packed, broken and misshapen packages make up an increasingly large chunk of their shipments. Those who can master the complex process of reverse logistics stand to make big savings in efficiency as well as keep their customers happy.One factor behind spiralling return rates is is the growth in online retailing. “E-tailing is driving a culture of ‘I’ll buy it and, if I don’t like it, I’ll send it back’,” says Jonathan Wright, a senior executive in Accenture’s global supply chain practice. “Up to one in five products gets sent back through the internet, which is huge.”Moreover, if that process is inconvenient, shoppers can go to other online retailers for their purchases. “If it’s not customer-friendly it’s going to hurt their business,” says Scott Harkins, vice-president of product marketing at FedEx.Mr Harkins sees the 12 per cent annual growth of the US returns business as a chance for retailers to make gains from improved efficiency. “A formal approach [to returns] to will help them reduce the cost of doing business,”
he says.New forms of reusable packaging have also generated a need for reverse logistics. Supermarkets now use plastic trays rather than cardboard boxes to bring in many goods from their suppliers; these need to be returned and, if they have handled food, to be cleaned before being sent out again.However, a more significant challenge is looming. European Union legislation now requires manufacturers and importers of electronic goods to collect and recycle their devices at the end of their lives. “The logistics after the sale of the product is now as important as it is before the sale, and that’s a huge shift,” says Mr Wright.The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive – as well as similar legislation in some US states – puts the onus on manufacturers to deal with these goods. And while for items purchased before August 2005, companies take a share of the general pool of “e-waste”, for equipment sold after that date, they must retrieve their own products.Complying with the latter obligation – known as individual producer responsibility (IPR) – has managers scratching their heads. “It’s an enormous logistics challenge,” says Kirstie McIntyre, European environmental takeback compliance manager at HP.“There’s plenty of availability for recycling,” she says. “But there’s no infrastructure and technology to deal with IPR equipment.” Even companies with supply or leasing contracts cannot simply pick up old machines when they drop off new ones, since the delivery of new products might occur at a different time from the retrieval of old equipment.“It’s a separate logistics system,” says Mr Patten. “If it was a case of taking out the old one and having it ready when we delivered the new one, we could take it away. But the reality of these projects is that some could take a year.”While companies can make their logistics systems as efficient as possible when delivering products, returns rely on consumers, retailers and other third party distributors to label and package the goods.Shippers and carriers can make things easier. FedEx provides downloadable labels on its website that can be filled out by retailers and sent to customers with goods to return. Cisco offers packaging guidelines for its customers.The next hurdle is sorting the goods, deciding which to refurbish and re-use and which to dismantle and recycle. Companies such as Cisco, HP and IBM have regional processing centres to which products can be sent for evaluation. Smaller companies, however, do not have the resources to operate such centres.“Our volumes it make it economically viable,” says Mr Patten. “If you sell 50,000 boxes to Germany every year and you recover 5,000 of them, you can negotiate a reasonable rate to do that. You can have a process and someone responsible for it. If you only sell 1,000 and recover 50 of them, how does that affect your cost model?”In Switzerland, one answer – established by the Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology – is a scheme whereby members work with recycling and logistics companies and share the cost of the process.Another option is to outsource the returns process to companies that carry it out on an industrial scale – a widely used solution in the US, where a mail order culture has traditionally generated higher volumes of returns than in Europe. About 80 per cent of US retailers have an outsourced return supply chain, says Mr Wright, compared with 10 to 15 per cent in the UK.“The savings are phenomenal,” says Peter Willems, managing director of the Support Services Division of Christian Salvesen, which handles reverse logistics. “Because if you consolidate the process, you generate economies of scale.”At Salvesen’s processing centres, arriving trucks are unloaded in less than 15 minutes. In-house software sorts the goods, deciding whether to send them back to the supplier or dismantle them for materials and parts. Waste processing is optimised, too. Salvesen’s baling equipment – the world’s heaviest – packs cardboard and sends it off to the paper mill so quickly that, in theory, a cereal packet arriving at one of its centres can be back on the supermarket shelf filled with more cereal within two weeks.Opportunities to reuse products or recover their re-usable materials are what make financial sense of the reverse supply chain. In the electronics sector, copper, tin and gold extracted from computers and other high-tech devices can be sold or used in new machines.Moreover, working equipment that has been replaced by newer models can be refurbished and resold. “It’s a good business,” says Daniel Ransdell, general manager of IBM’s global asset recovery services. “A four-year-old laptop has good market value.”However, the real value of the reverse supply chain lies in its influence on the design of new products. “There’s a massive amount of information to be gained,” says Mr Wright. “If you have the right information, you can see that there was a fundamental flaw in a product and get it fixed quickly.”This in turn reduces the cost of reverse logistics operations. After all, a product that has been re- designed and improved in the light of information gleaned from previous returns is far less likely to be packed into bubble wrap and sent back.Improved returns: how new advances can come from old productsMake the distinction. Reverse logistics, or retrieving unwanted, broken or obsolete products, should be treated differently from the forward, or delivery, side of the supply chain.Act early. Part of the efficiency of the reverse supply chain lies in what happens at the starting point – the retailer. Properly labelled returns make the next step in the chain easier to manage.Sort the returns. By using regional processing centres, companies can quickly distinguish goods for refurbishment and
reuse from goods for breaking down and recycling.Capture knowledge. Companies should design products that are easy to dismantle and use information on why goods are returned to improve those products."
417;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-05-14T16:25:49Z;A military jet that is a bit like Christmas;;Planning a military campaign is notoriously complex. But, as Lockheed Martin, the biggest military contractor, has discovered, the task pales by comparison with the challenge of preparing for the Christmas rush.Lockheed is studying the business models of FedEx, Wal-Mart and Caterpillar to help it provide parts and spares on the $300bn, 11-nation joint strike fighter project, the costliest and logistically the most complex weapons programme in history.“The military thinks in terms of wars and they need to be ready for a dramatic increase in demand and movement,” says Don Searles, a Lockheed director working on the JSF logistics programme. “But when we think of the big demand created by war in the Middle East, for example, that is just a small increase in activity compared with Christmas time for commercial shippers.”Lockheed’s decision to seek new role models aims to design a cost-effective plan to support, maintain and upgrade as many as 4,000 JSFs over 47 years.It costs at least twice as much to maintain a fighter jet as to build it. Lockheed wants to drive this sum down so that only half the JSF budget will be spent on future repair and overhaul work.The company has built and supported 4,000 F-16 fighter jets since 1973, sometimes in collaboration with foreign governments as part of export deals. But the JSF, which has involved as many as 10 other nations from the outset and three varieties of aircraft, is an order of magnitude more complex.Dan Crowley, JSF general manager, says: “When I first took this job, the then president of the company said, ‘I just want you to know if you need any help thinking about how to implement this worldwide, multinational programme, I can’t help you because no one’s ever done it before’.”Fighter jets need overhauling regularly and the Lockheed-led team building the JSF must be able to make the right spares and equipment quickly available, especially when any of the customer nations are at war.As well as taking lessons from FedEx on coping with seasonal demand surges and implementing rules-based software systems to manage the logistics chain, Lockheed decided it made sense to use commercial shippers to transport many parts rather than re-inventing the process.Wal-Mart, the supermarket retailer, has received regular visits from Lockheed’s JSF team. “Wal-Mart moves an incredible inventory round the world,” says Mr Searles. Lockheed was interested in copying Wal-Mart’s tracking system, which uses radio-frequency tagging to locate its merchandise and divert it if demand suddenly spikes.However, while Wal-Mart has the purchasing power to impose a standard approach on its supply base, Lockheed decided radio frequencies were a step too far for the JSF. “There is no market standard yet for the software, the devices and even the frequencies, when you need to reach across different nations all controlling their own electro-magnetic spectrum,” Mr Searles says.Instead, Lockheed has adopted a three-dimensional barcode system for tracking parts internationally. The 3-D approach carries more information than a standard barcode, giving a unique identity code for each part, which is then scanned when shipped, when in the transport system, when received and when fitted to an aircraft.Caterpillar, a manufacturer of earth diggers, provided a more direct inspiration. Because of the heavy demands on the company’s products, Caterpillar has built prognostic systems into the equipment that determine when a part is about to fail or maintenance is required.“Caterpillar runs a worldwide supply network based on predictions supplied by their equipment, preventing it from going out of service,” says Mr Searles. “That’s the same concept we are designing into the JSF.”Constant monitoring is crucial as the military adopts a new contracting approach, paying suppliers such as Lockheed to make fighter jets available rather than a fixed maintenance fee, a concept pioneered by jet engine makers on commercial aircraft.Mr Searles describes the JSF’s automated logistics system, which he believes could cut support costs on the JSF by at least 20 per cent, as similar to a human nervous system. “When you run or work hard, you don’t have to think about your heart running faster or veins opening – it just happens. That’s the lesson we learned from Caterpillar, FedEx and Wal-Mart, among others, to have the routine things running in the background.”
418;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-05-01T16:49:32Z;Aim needs rigour to match VC;;"Over the past few years an acquaintance of mine has metamorphosed from industrialist to stock exchange promoter. He now specialises in what he calls “venture capital on Aim”. He has taken at least four companies public in the past couple of years.His new profession explains why Aim appears to have boomed: entrepreneurs can use it to raise quoted funding for highly speculative, early-stage projects. Look through the lists of new issues: hundreds of these development-phase companies have raised billions of pounds in equity over recent years. But does anyone involved in the process really know what they are doing?Venture capital was invented in northern California in the 1940s. It requires skill and discipline if it is to succeed. In many ways it is much harder than doing leveraged buy-outs. Funding start-ups and new technology is exceedingly risky, but it has enabled the development of many of the most important companies of the past 50 years, including DEC, Intel, FedEx, Cisco and Google.Most of them, of course, are US-based. That is where most of the world’s true venture capital is managed. The failure rate is high, and the expertise needed in spotting and monitoring potential winners is immense. Finding and scrutinising the right ideas to back takes hard work, talent and experience. And such ambitious start-ups usually benefit from technical support and hands-on input from investors.Yet the institutional and private investors in Aim are mostly ill-equipped to provide scrutiny and nurturing. They tend to lack the experience or qualifications to investigate the propositions thrown at them by the City.Venture capitalists pay expert consultants to do extensive industry and technical due diligence before taking the plunge. Sometimes they even employ private detectives for background checks on management. But pension funds, insurance companies and other mainstream asset managers rely on nomads and sponsors to do their homework for them.Such advisers are invariably stockbrokers or investment banks, not professional investors in fledgling companies. The individuals involved are corporate financiers, who write prospectuses and do public company takeovers – or perhaps analysts who write buy circulars on shares. But neither is qualified to judge whether a business plan is achievable, or if it is the next giant biotech, environmental or internet winner. Their level of screening is frequently superficial: apart from anything, they are intermediaries after a fee. Indeed, they are motivated to ensure the deal proceeds because they can then book a fee – and probably their bonus.Real venture capitalists laugh at much of the stuff that floats on Aim, and are baffled by the valuations. For Aim issues, investors get a standard presentation lasting an hour and are expected to make a decision, whereas VCs spend many weeks of detailed examination before committing money. They negotiate tough subscription agreements that give them extensive legal rights. They get board representation and monitor the business as an insider.They don’t enjoy the liquidity of a traded investment, as Aim investors do. But such apparent ability to sell is often more theoretical than real and is a false comfort. Moreover, early-stage companies grow in a haphazard fashion – inevitable upsets such as profit warnings are better managed in a private company.Yet perhaps with improvements Aim has an important economic role as a public venture capital market. Of the entire private equity pool in the UK, less than
5 per cent is genuine venture capital. Most deals are management buy-outs – bigger, safer and with better fees for the executives involved. But such transactions don’t create new billion-pound companies as they do in Silicon Valley. If the UK wants to build global winners in sectors such as biotechnology, alternative fuels and high technology, entrepreneurs need access to finance. And mainstream institutional investors clearly want to participate in new growth sectors via venture capital.Aim can fulfil that role, but the exchange needs more rigour and expertise if most of the cash being subscribed for such experimental projects is not to be squandered.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.com"
419;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-04-17T00:14:10Z;Microsoft buys software innovator;;The race between Microsoft and Google to perfect voice-activated search – considered a key ingredient for mobile access to the internet – will heat up on Tuesday with the announcement of a range of new voice services from a company about to be acquired by Microsoft.The software giant’s decision last month to pay one of its highest prices for an acquisition to buy the privately held Tellme Networks underlines the importance it sees in voice-powered applications across a range of devices. While details were not disclosed, one person familiar with the terms of the deal said Microsoft had agreed to pay $800m for Tellme. The deal is due to be completed before the end of the month.Tellme, whose voice-recognition software is used to power the customer support operations of companies such as American Airlines and FedEx, said it was launching a free directory assistance website in the US on Tuesday. The service will allow visitors to search for local businesses either by name or by the nature of their business. They will also be able to make a request by voice and have information returned in visual form, for instance on the screen of a mobile phone.That echoes a Google test, begun quietly this month, that also applies voice activation and search to local directory assistance services.Eventually, technology companies hope this type of service will help to stimulate a new mobile advertising market. However, Angus Davis, one of Tellme’s founders, said his company would operate its service without advertising while it tried to perfect the user experience.Tellme claims its software is used by telecommunications companies to handle half the calls to US directory assistance. Eventually, these traditional fee-based services would give way to advertising-supported sites like the one being announced today, said Mr Davis.Microsoft’s acquisition of Tellme showed its belief in voice as “an additional interface across all devices”, he added.
420;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-03-21T20:24:52Z;US stocks spike on Fed statement;;US stocks spiked higher on Wednesday as Wall Street cheered hints from the Federal Reserve that it was no longer biased towards further rate rises.The Fed left overnight interest rates unchanged but investors’ spirits were lifted by small changes in emphasis in the committee’s statement.“The Fed included economic growth alongside inflation as something that they would make an adjustment for,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market reacted positively because it opens the door to the Fed cutting rates if there are any signs of the economy slowing.”The S&P 500 Index jumped 1.7 per cent to close at 1,435.04, a return to positive territory for the year to date.Financial and utility groups, which are most sensitive to changes in interest rates, led the rally.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, at one point fell below its opening level on February 27, the day that global equities plunged. The index closed down 8.1 per cent at 12.2.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite surged 1.4 per cent to 2,442.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 12,422.13.The statement from the Fed followed a series of strong earnings reports.Morgan Stanley was among the best performers after it reported a 70 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, a rise well in excess of analysts’ estimates. Shares in the bank rose 6.9 per cent to $81.33.Oracle shares, meanwhile, advanced 3.5 per cent to $18.17 after the software group reported robust growth across its range of products.Software group Adobe Systems rose 6.3 per cent to $43.30 on the back of better-than-expected profit.Shares in Motorola fell in electronic trading after the company said it expected to make a loss in the first quarter. Edward Zander, chief executive, described the performance of its mobile devices business as “unacceptable”. Shares in the mobile phone operator were 0.4 per cent lower at $18.74 in trading after the closing bell.The beleaguered subprime mortgage sector received a boost. Accredited Home Lenders jumped 11.05 per cent to $11.96 after Citadel, a big hedge fund, said it had bought a 4.5 per cent stake in the struggling company.Fremont General rose 16.1 per cent to $10.19 after the group said it was selling $4.4bn of subprime loans.Homebuilders were also resurgent as concerns about the housing market eased. DR Horton stock, which has suffered steep losses of late, gained 3.4 per cent to close at $23.63.

421;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-03-12T15:54:55Z;EADS hit by Airbus losses;;EADS, Europe’s biggest aerospace and defence group, suffered an 86 per cent fall in operating profits last year, as its Airbus division plunged heavily into loss.It warned that Airbus would be hit by “another substantial loss” in 2007.The group barely broke even at the net level, as net profits fell by 94 per cent from €1.68bn to €99m, despite a 15 per cent rise in turnover to €39.4bn.The sales increase followed record deliveries of commercial aircraft and a 30 per cent increase in defence turnover, which for the first time reached €10bn.The EADS results, the worst since the company was formed in 2000 from a merger of a large part of the French, German and Spanish aerospace and defence industries, were dominated, however, by the debacle at Airbus.The division, which accounts for 64 per cent of group sales, fell to an operating loss of €572m from an operating profit of €2.3bn a year earlier, a €2.9bn reverse in its fortunes.Airbus fell steeply into loss chiefly under the disastrous impact of the two-year delays in first deliveries of its flagship A380 superjumbo. The group has incurred heavy costs to rescue the project in order eventually to be able to start series production.It has been hit too by the settlement of penalty claims from its A380 airline customers and the cancellation of orders for 20 A380 cargo aircraft from FedEx and UPS, the US express parcel delivery groups.EADS said that the total financial impact of the A380 problems amounted to €2.5bn, of which €1.2bn was for extra costs and loss making contracts, and €800m was to settle penalty claims.A further charge of €500m was incurred largely to write down the assets of the freighter version of the A380, where Airbus announced last week that it had stopped development work in the face of the order cancellations and delays.It has also been forced to transfer overstretched engineering resources from the freighter version to the rescue of the passenger A380, the biggest commercial jet ever built, as well as to the €10bn development of the A350, a new family of 270-350 seat, long range aircraft.The Airbus loss was further increased by €500m of charges related to the A350, a project, which was only approved last December after long delays and where the specifications were radically changed, long after initial orders were placed, as Airbus struggled to make the aircraft competitive with the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The 787 is due to make its maiden flight in August and to enter commercial service with Japan’s All Nippon Airways in May next year, about five years ahead of the planned entry into service of the A350 in 2013.EADS said the Airbus division had also been forced to make a €352m provision to cover “the risk and technical challenges” in its A400M military transport aircraft project, where concerns are growing that the development will be delayed and over budget.EADS failed to make any dividend proposal along with the disclosure of its results but said this would be considered at the group’s next board meeting.The Airbus division has been facing strikes and protests at some of its plants in France and Germany in recent days, as the group seeks to its implement a drastic restructuring programme aimed at cutting 10,000 jobs during the next four years and at cutting costs by €2.1bn a year by 2010.EADS said that Airbus would remain heavily in loss in 2007 under the impact of the costs of the restructuring programme, further costs to support the A380 programme, potential A350 launch charges, higher research and development expenses, as well as the impact of the weakening of the US Dollar against the euro.It forecast that its combined helicopters, space and defence businesses would achieve an operating profit of close to €1bn this year.The group has abandoned its previous ambitions of maintaining 10 per cent operating margins at Airbus and said that in the medium term it was targeting “mid-single digit” operating profit margins.Airbus revenues would “most likely be affected by a deterioration of mix and of pricing for recent orders, partly due to competitive pressure.”EADS indicated that the problems at Airbus were expected to undermine the group’s profitability for the long term.It said it was committed to restoring group wide operating profit margins, “although at levels lower than the margin achieved in 2005.”Despite the grave problems in its new aircraft development programmes, Airbus production of existing programmes is at a record level driven by the rising deliveries of its A320 family of single aisle short-haul aircraft.Total aircraft deliveries rose last year from 378 to 434, still ahead of Boeing for the fourth year in succession, and EADS said that deliveries in 2007 were forecast to rise further to between 440 and 450 aircraft. Boeing deliveries are forecast to rise this year from 398 to 445.
422;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-02-26T18:13:18Z;Easy appeal of quick win will lead to losses in the end;;"Louis Gallois needs a quick win. The problems facing the chief executive of Airbus, the troubled European aeroplane manufacturer, are stacking up like delayed flights over Heathrow.Not only is the company’s A380 superjumbo still not ready to be operated by any commercial airline, but UPS, the package courier, said on Friday that it now has the option to cancel its order for 10 A380s should there be any further delays. UPS’s rival Fedex cancelled its order for 10 A380s last November, and chose to buy 15 Boeing 777s instead. Mr Gallois’s next challenge? Persuading unions to agree to extend the 35-hour working week.George W. Bush needs a quick win. Although he tried to characterise last week’s announcement of an initial withdrawal of British troops from southern Iraq as a sign of success, few people shared this interpretation of events. A bigger, less equivocal success would help lift the president’s grim approval ratings.Steve McClaren needs a quick win. His England football team travels to Israel next month for a vital Euro 2008 group qualifier in Tel Aviv. The England manager is coming under pressure to recall his superstar midfielder David Beckham into the squad. But while the global fashion icon remains a pretty good footballer, let’s face it: he’s not the Messiah.Managers are constantly being asked, or told, to deliver “quick wins”. It is a familiar phrase, made up of two of the most seductive syllables in business.Who could possibly object to the idea of solving some problem expeditiously? Quick wins boost morale and build momentum. They get critical colleagues off your back, for the time being at least. How on earth are you going to calm down the analysts and ward off that private equity bid? A few quick wins should do the trick.And yet, take a closer look at our three leaders under pressure. To what extent can their underlying problems really be settled with a speedy answer? Airbus’s A380 project has been under way for over a decade. I remember attending a rather pleasant lunch at Aérospatiale in Toulouse in 1993, during which drawings of a super-jumbo were unveiled. Had I not been enjoying the excellent hospitality and charm of the French operation that day, I might have thought to ask some sharp questions about the project’s viability. Anyway, it is now far too late to turn around the A380’s problems just like that.In Iraq, meanwhile, there are few meaningful quick wins to be had. “Freedom’s untidy . . . stuff happens,” as Donald Rumsfeld, the former US secretary of defence, observed in April 2003. It would have been better for Mr Bush had this observation been made in advance of the US invasion, which has created a situation of appalling complexity.Nor will English football’s long-term malaise be cured by a happy result in Tel Aviv next month. The national side needs not only one quick win but a further five or six, followed by a serious rethink of the way the game is run in this country.“The only problems that have simple solutions are simple problems,” says the great “systems thinker” Russell Ackoff in his new book Management f-Laws – how organisations really work. “Problems that arise in organisations are almost always the product of interactions of parts, never the action of a single part. Complex problems do not have simple solutions.”Prof Ackoff’s underappreciated insight is that businesses and organisations need to be studied and understood as complete systems. Their different units do not operate in isolation from each other. That is why so-called quick wins in one part of the system will often have inevitable and unintended consequences in another part. A call centre bolted on to a business to provide better “customer service” may turn out to do no such thing. Improvements in one area can actually make everything else worse. It is like putting a Ferrari engine into a Hyundai car: the thing is not going to work. “It is futile doing things in isolation,” Prof Ackoff says.This analysis is shared by Jamie Bonomo and Richard Balaban of management consultancy Mercer, who argue in a discussion paper that “sooner or later one-off fixes lead to a poorly functioning business design”. They suggest that two fundamental steps are required before you can set about improving the performance of a business: first, you need to form an integrated view of how the business actually makes money; and second, you need to understand not only your value chain, but also your customers’ and your suppliers’ value chains.As soon as it becomes clear that a quick fix has not delivered the simple solutions that were promised, it will be thrown onto the growing pile of previously discarded management fads. Never mind – like the proverbial London bus, another one will be along in a minute.A recent policy paper from the international aid organisation Care looked at the ongoing problem of the opium trade in Afghanistan, and came to this mature, Ackoffian conclusion: “The desire for rapid reductions in illicit crop cultivation is leading to the demand for and adoption of heavy-handed, quick-fix strategies. Such short-term strategies, however – including outright bans, forced eradication and aerial spraying – do not address the drivers behind the planting of opium poppy and have often proven to be ineffective, expensive and even counterproductive.”The next time you are tempted to call for (or are instructed to deliver) a quick win, remember those other two, slightly longer words: Afghanistan and heroin."
423;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-02-07T19:18:54Z;Airbus bullish as A380 makes first public flight;;"There was no onboard jacuzzi, no casino, no duty free shop and no gym, contrary to the wilder flights of fancy of early marketing visions.But the A380 superjumbo that took to the sky for its first public flight on Wednesday with the world’s media on boarddid have 520 seats in first, business and economy cabins. It was spacious and remarkably quiet.It’s at least two years late, is costing billions of euros more than ever imagined, and has plunged Airbus into loss, but the double-decker A380 – the biggest commercial jet ever built – could still prove the sceptics wrong and change the economics of flying in coming decades.John Leahy, Airbus chief commercial officer, is in the midst of negotiations with customer airlines over swingeing penalty payments for late deliveries. But as the aircraft cruised at 41,000 feet along the west coast of France he insisted that the A380 remained “a game-changer”.Airbus says it is confident of winning at least half of the market for large aircraft – of the size of the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747 – which it forecasts to have a global market of 1,665 over the next 20 years. To date it has 166 orders from 15 customers; it needs 420 orders to break even.Since delivery delays were disclosed last year, only one customer, FedEx, has cancelled its order for 10 aircraft, while Singapore Airlines and Qantas have increased their orders.Airbus is due to announce on February 20 the details of its controversial Power8 restructuring programme, aimed at rationalising its industrial operations and saving €2.1bn a year by 2010. It will also decide this month on a further increase in production of its A320 family of short-haul aircraft.Mario Heinen, the new head of the A380 programme, said that the industrial recovery plan was on schedule. Airbus had also met all of its technical performance guarantees for the aircraft, which should finally reach full production of around 4 a month in 2010.Mr Leahy said the A380 would be the lowest cost airliner. Despite its size, the A380 would have half the noise at take-off with 40 per cent more passengers than the current Boeing 747-400, he said.It would burn only 2.9 litres of fuel per passenger per 100kms, less than a small car like the VW Polo or Ford Fiesta – albeit only if it carried 550 passengers over 5,000 nautical miles."
424;FDX;Fedex Corp;2007-01-26T15:19:36Z;The original inbox;;"The traffic on our country road moves at a fairly steady speed, so it wasn’t until my sons were seven or eight that they were allowed to collect the mail. When they were finally permitted to make the short walk from the porch to the mailbox, it was a passage that represented not only their growing recognition of the complexities of the world outside the door but also a journey towards identity. The first time they encountered a card in the mailbox addressed to them, they understood that this was a place where news of the world arrived and, better yet, news that arrived with their names on it.Certainly, most of the mailboxes in my neighbourhood live up to this task. While many of them are standard sheet-metal or plastic, others make for a catalogue of decorative sensibilities. Architecture has a foothold here. One is in the shape of a small red barn, another is sheathed in weathered clapboards, others have shingled roofs. Some have simply been painted in cheery colours – forest green, rose pink, purple. One has a small, faux folk painting, a Holstein grazing in a pasture. Still others have incorporated objects that speak to the rural past; they are propped up in milking cans or set on an old, wrought-iron sewing stand.But even those mailboxes that have no aspiration to the decorative bear some imprint of their owner, whether through plain work-a-day efficiency or sheer, unapologetic neglect. One of my favourites is a twisted, rusty metal box, askew on an old pole; its varying hues of rust, evocative dents and precarious tilt are all testimony that the house down the driveway could have been the childhood home of sheet-metal sculptor Richard Serra.Cal Swann is an English graphic designer and professor who has documented the mailboxes of rural Australia. There, he notes, the form and decoration of boxes have become their own type of folk art. Recycled milk churns, oil drums and petrol cans can all easily have mail slots cut into them and all provide a secure, waterproof depository. In his visual catalogue of such boxes, published by Pentagram Design in London under the title Nifty Places: The Australian Rural Mailbox, one finds an oil drum reinvented as a pink pig, another as a galvanised silver elephant. Some are pure whimsy, others more steadfastly industrial. Then there are the old refrigerators that have found a second life as mail and package drop boxes. All are examples not only of rural ingenuity but of the persistent decorative sensibility that invariably attends it in an unexpected landscape.“Whatever the original motive may have been for the early settler to recycle a ready-to-hand artifact in the performance of mailbox duty,” Swann writes, “a cult has developed throughout Australia for the bizarre and often outrageous objects as mailboxes. It now has less to do with practicalities and recyling; competition is rife and efforts to make mailboxes that demonstrate individuality and humour are found in many localities.”While such ingenious folk art might be less prevalent across rural America, it does appear sporadically. Not surprisingly, in view of the fact that design innovation so often emerges from need, some of my neighbours have fashioned larger, more substantial and secure drop boxes for overnight mail and delivery. Consider the high-concept FedEx (parcel-sized) box constructed by sculptor and furniture maker John Scofield. His lavish attention to the FedEx box extends to the prose he uses to describe the receptacle he has installed outside the door of his Connecticut home. It is, he says, “the holy tabernacle of modern secular life, the vessel keeping body and soul together better than the Noah ever did, the safe refuge for papers of transit that govern one’s existential, spiritual, nay, fiscal existence – our FedEx box!”The aesthetic origins of Scofield’s box look to both a chicken house (“an assortment of out-house inspired appendages affording a pitiful degree of comfort and usefulness”) and a Roman architecture (“a temple of mail which mighty Hadrian would have installed on the Pantheon doors if he had expected any serious outstanding invoices”). In fact, the four-light barn sash for a door, traditionally used for windows in barns and unheated outbuildings, was outfitted with brass hinges and latch, and the roof shingled with cedar shakes and built at a 45-degree pitch, to discourage build-up of dirt or precipitation, and flashed with copper into the building to prevent rain from getting packages wet. An open-air attic is display space for beach stones, bones and other picturesque debris he and his family might pick up.For all its ingenuity, however, Scofield’s FedEx deliverer had only qualified appreciation for the box, relegating it to the “second nicest I’ve seen”. Another customer, it seems, had constructed a box with an electric coffee­pot and a mug inside. All of which suggests that even in this era of urgent, accelerated mail delivery, there remains a time and place for the courtesies of human exchange.Clearly, the mailbox, a little roadside cabinet printed with one’s name or address, sometimes both, is about personal identity. Inside it is the information, essential and non-essential, that defines one’s life – not only the bills and bank statements but flyers, advertisements, the series of unsolicited printed matter that in some peripheral way has an effect. Small wonder, then, that the mailbox invites attack. In rural areas, it is a rite of spring for teenagers to cruise by in cars with baseball bats and knock down mailboxes. The kids know it isn’t simple vandalism; rather, the trashed mailbox is an assault on personal identity.A friend of mine was once a caretaker for an old farmhouse in Vermont that had once been the home of poet Robert Frost. She found Frost’s old, grey, sheet-metal mailbox still intact, set at an angle on a post that had settled comfortably into the ground after so many years, his signature hand-painted in black, its sides riddled with buckshot. I haven’t any idea whether the latter came from the town critics or just some locals who might have taken issue with Frost’s idea of what makes a good neighbour but, whether they read poetry or not, they knew a good symbol when they saw one.Indeed, when Frost’s farm was bought years later by a Hollywood producer, the old box was replaced with a generic black box. Instead of putting his own name on it, the producer had the name of the farm elegantly stencilled there. You could argue about which of these two men had the greater celebrity, or whose work spoke to his times with more accuracy and resonance. But the producer’s decision on the new lettering reflects a distinct dilution of his own identity.Considering these associations and the inherently public positon of mailboxes, it seems almost odd that they are used so rarely for political statement. The US Postal Service prohibits advertising on boxes and says the post must not “represent effigies or caricatures that tend to disparage or ridicule any person”. But why in this time when anything and everything can be used as a platform to spell out one’s convictions, has the mailbox resisted, as though there is some implicit consensus that this would be inappropriate? The closest owners seem to come is with decorative stars and stripes or decals of the American flag. If there is any consistent new image or appendage, it is the security plaque that is affixed to so many boxes today. Without so much as a passing glance to decorative traditions, these square, round or diamond-shaped signs are strictly informational, naming the security company monitoring the residence. Delivering a terse message of electronic surveillance, such plaques are out of synch with the spirit of the box itself.As security becomes a greater factor in how we assess domestic comfort, it comes as no surprise to see the mailbox reinvented. In recent years in suburban areas, traditional mailboxes have been replaced by brick constructions into which the mailbox is inserted. [Impervious to baseball bats and other forms of garden-variety vandalism,] these postal fortifications also speak to recently developed concerns about mail and identity theft.For some, brick enclosures are insufficient; more extreme measures are needed. Consider, for example, a mailbox offered by a company called Mail Theft Solutions. Once mailboxes were simply associated with their owners’ names. The Defender, trademarked as the “anti-theft/anti-vandal curb vault”, is one with a name and identity of its own. Costing roughly $800, the 131lb steel box is the Darth Vader of mailboxes, constructed of welded plate-steel that its manufacturers pledge “resists baseball bats, bullets and pipe bombs”. Shaped as a substantial pedestal, the box is equipped with ingoing and outgoing shelves. A secured tray on the floor of the unit catches all the mail placed on the incoming shelf, where it then waits to be retrieved from an access door in the rear that is outfitted with a deadbolt. As one might expect, the Defender catalogues “the facts about identity theft” in its marketing, citing to prospective buyers that it is “the fastest growing crime in America affecting approximately 900,000 new victims each year”.Then there is the Secure Mail Vault, a white, powder-coated, galvanised steel box with a gracefully curved mail-slot top in the shape of a wave that looks like something designed by architect Frank Gehry but has, in fact, been so configured to prevent a burglar from reaching an arm into the vault. The vault is outfitted with an outer compartment for outgoing mail and an inner compartment to hold incoming mail that can only be accessed by a keypad, with which its owner must validate his or her identity. “Protect you and your loved ones from the dangers that linger in and around your home,” advises the promotional copy. I recall Robert Frost’s bullet-riddled mailbox and wonder whether he would have purchased something like this and which words he might have found for the notion of identity theft.Perhaps it only makes sense that the electronic age has reshaped the mailbox. Identity theft and mail fraud might be legitimate security concerns. And at a time when information of all kinds comes to us in a steady and constant electronic stream, the daily walk to the mailbox has become an outdated ritual. Yet the image of the mailbox seems to have its own tenacity. In 2004, in an effort to encourage people who lived in remote rural areas to vote using the absentee ballot, Arizona’s Democratic party sent out a flyer picturing a worn mailbox propped up on a pole along a dusty road. Without keypad or lock, the image simply conveyed a comforting familiarity. “Now it’s easier to vote than ever before,” read the copy.It only makes sense that Mail Boxes Etc still relies on that traditional nomenclature. Established in 1980 for shipping, postal and business services independent of the US Postal Service, 20 years later, the company had more than 4,000 locations and merged with UPS to become the world’s largest franchiser of such services. The company’s stated core values include “caring, honesty, fairness, integrity, trust, respect, commitment, accountability” – a laundry list of traditional community values. As well as the shape of the box and its little red flag, then, even the word “mailbox” seems to have an iconic resonance, exactly because it implies a nostalgia for an era when, despite the occasional threat of bullets and baseball bats, neighbours, passers-by and the mailman were all members of a community that conferred its own brand of security. For all the printed matter that goes in and out of these boxes day after day, their most resonant message might simply be one of implicit trust.As I drive on the country roads in my county, I can’t help but notice that there is not yet any sign of the Defender or the Secure Mail Vault. One neighbour recently repainted his blue mailbox, and another has hung hers on a trellis and planted it with a vine of clematis. None of these has locks or padlocks or electronic keypads. And I know that somewhere out there, someone is brewing a pot of coffee in expectation of a delivery from FedEx. From time to time, even the sterile aluminium or stainless-steel cluster mailboxes used in residential apartment complexes acquire a pitched roof or fluted support columns, decorative gestures that seem an effort to associate them with their roadside predecessors. And for all their instant messaging, my sons continue to take pleasure in checking the mailbox. This could be because, for the moment at least, it puts our vigilance at bay. A vestige of rural neighbourliness, it offers a different kind of security.At a time when all manner of communications equipment has been reformed and reinvented, this small container, at once conspicuous and assailable, standing in front of the house, has an undeniable tenacity in continuing to be just as it always has been. Whether a simple green plastic box, a small red barn, an old oil drum, or even buckshot-riddled sheet metal, it is a piece of communications equipment that knows its own vulnerability, that accepts all the frailties implicit in human exchange.Extracted from ‘The Uncommon Life of Common Objects: Essays on Design and the Everyday’ (Metropolis Books, $27.50)"

There were some bright spots as shares in the transport and retail areas benefited from expectations that consumers would raise their spending as the so-called oil tax of high prices was diluted.Overhanging the market were better than expected economic reports that lowered odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year. “The catalyst for a stronger stock market in 2007 was an easing and right now the Fed is not going to do anything,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.Technology shares dominated activity this week, and their new year surge was ended by earnings that failed to vindicate recent market gains as well as lower guidance on the outlook for the current quarter and broker downgrades.The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 5.3 per cent this week, wiping out its prior gain for the year.Late on Friday, stocks were rangebound, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the notable laggard for the week. Although it was up 0.3 per cent at 2,451.31 yesterday, it was 2.1 per cent down for the week.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent firmer at 1,430.50, and was unchanged since Monday. The information technology sector led losses in the index, with a decline of 3.4 per cent.Healthcare continued its good start to the year and the sector leads the S&P major groups this year with a gain of 3.5 per cent.Energy is 4 per cent lower for the year.Among semiconductor stocks, Intel set the bearish tone when it warned gross margins would narrow in 2007, following its fourth-quarter results. Intel slid 5.9 per cent to $20.82, cutting its gain for the year to 2.5 per cent. Other chipmakers down sharply this week included Lam Research, which plunged 13.3 per cent to $47.28 after the company said shipment delays would lower future earnings. KLA Tencor lost 8 per cent to $48.01 and Novellus fell 6.5 per cent to $30.61. Both suffered broker downgrades.Other high-profile technology companies also dragged the market lower. Apple slid 6.5 per cent to $88.50, as its strong fiscal first-quarter earnings were accompanied by lower guidance for the current quarter. JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral”. Cisco lost 7.7 per cent to $26.70 this week amid a string of brokerage downgrades. Symantec plunged 14.4 per cent to $17.54 as the software maker said its 2007 profit would not meet analysts’ expectations.IBM’s fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates, but its shares slid 3.2 per cent to $96.17 as analysts expressed concern about growth in its hardware business. The stock rose above $100 a share for the first time since 2002 this week, part of a 30 per cent rally in the past six months.Citigroup reiterated its “buy” rating for IBM after its results and recommended investors buy Intel and Cisco “on recent weakness”. IBM dragged on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and late on Friday it was nearly unchanged at 12,565.53. The average was barely changed on the week, after hitting a record high on Wednesday of 12,614.Transport and retail shares were boosted by oil prices nudging down towards $50 a barrel. The Dow transportation average rose 2.1 per cent this week, and is up 6.6 per cent in 2007, outpacing the Dow’s gain of 0.8 per cent.A broker upgrade for FedEx sparked a 2 per cent rise to $110.98. Rail companies rose, led by a 5.3 per cent gain to $52.98 in Norfolk Southern.Among retailers, JC Penney rose 4.8 to $82.69, helped by a JPMorgan upgrade.Motorola jumped 7 per cent to $19.27. Its fourth-quarter earnings fell as expected, but the mobile phonemaker said it would cut 3,500 jobs to reduce costs. Better news on housing helped the S&P homebuilders index rise 4.5 per cent this week. Pulte Homes rose 5.9 per cent to $33.96.Mills surged 41.9 per cent to $21.58, after the real estate investment trust agreed to be acquired for $1.35bn.General Electric fell 2.5 per cent to $36.95 after its fourth-quarter earnings included a restatement. It also purchased diagnostics units from Abbott Labs for $8.1bn.

The S&P 500 closed at a fresh six-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average set a new record close.Intel rose 0.7 per cent to $22.30, and its shares remained volatile in after-hours trade when its fourth-quarter results beat estimates after the closing bell. The shares had fallen 3.2 per cent to $21.60.Within the S&P 500, 43 companies will release fourth-quarter earnings this week. Analysts expect earnings growth to be 9.1 per cent on average compared with the same quarter a year earlier – a modest slowdown after 13 consecutive quarters with growth above 10 per cent.Companies reporting this week include Apple, which is due to release fiscal first-quarter results on Wednesday. Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Cont-inental Airlines, IBM, Citigroup and General Electric all report fourth-quarter results this week.Shares in GE rose 0.6 per cent to $38.11 after the news on Monday that it planned to buy the aerospace division of the UK’s Smiths Group for $4.8bn.Wells Fargo gained 2 per cent to $36.23 after meeting estimates with fourth-quarter earnings of 64 cents a share.The S&P 500 rallied 0.1 per cent to 1,431.90, on Tuesday. Of the 10 leading industry groups in the index, seven were positive, but a 1.1 per cent decline in the energy sector hurt overall sentiment.The S&P homebuilders index was 1.2 per cent lower. Centex – down 2.9 per cent at $51.61 said it would take a charge in order to reduce landholding values.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,497.78. Hurting sentiment in technology was Symantec, which plunged 13.13 per cent to $17.79 as the software maker said its 2007 profit would not meet analysts’ expectations. Cisco fell 3 per cent to $28.04, after shares in the group were downgraded by brokers.Broker downgrades also buffeted the semiconductor sector, with KLA-Tencor2.8 per cent lower at $50.71 and Novellus Systems off 1.5 per cent at $32.25.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 12,582.59.There was no stopping transport shares. An upgrade for FedEx boosted its stock 2.6 per cent to $111.68 and the Dow Transports Average rose 2.1 per cent. It has gained 6.6 per cent this year on the back of lower oil prices.Citigroup said clients it had surveyed expect on average a 9 per cent gain for the S&P 500 in 2007. The survey found that many investors expect the biggest companies to outperform and that sector choices favoured technology and healthcare, “with clear disdain for energy, utilities and materials”.

It has lagged the S&P 500’s 1.6 per cent rise and the 2 per cent gain made by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and this underperformance has raised a red flag among some analysts.“Nasdaq stagnation is a growing concern,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. He noted that the index “topped out ahead of the Dow and S&P back in May [when world markets suffered a severe correction], but until there is some significant sign of weakness, I’m going to keep this concern on the back burner”.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent, or 2.02 points, lower at 1,423.53. Lending strength to the index at the close were the financials and industrials sectors after the telecom and information technology groups led gains earlier in the day. Energy remained the weakest sector yesterday.The Dow settled 0.1 per cent, or 0.06 points, lower at 12,463.87, and had pulled back from a new intra-day high of 12,498.47.Limiting losses in the Dow was Hewlett-Packard, up 2.3 per cent to $41.34, its highest level since 2000. HP shares were boosted when Banc of America Securities affirmed its “buy” rating.Meanwhile, General Electric was 0.4 per cent better at $38.15, down from a new 52-week high of $38.49, when JP Morgan Securities added the conglomerate to its “recommended portfolio”.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average languished. It is now down over 6 per cent from a peak of 4,891.05 made last month – another worrying sign that the market is narrowing, according to analysts.The Dow Transports, regarded as a barometer of the economy, was buffeted when FedEx lowered its guidance for the fiscal third quarter after a 9 per cent rise in fiscal second quarter earnings. Shares in the delivery shipping company slid 1.9 per cent to $111.85.Shares in CarMax rose 8.5 per cent to $52.77, after the seller of used cars reported third quarter net income of 42 cents a share, easily beating estimates of 25 cents.Shareholders in NYSE Group approved the $14.3bn purchase of Euronext, creating the first transatlantic equity and derivative exchange.Shares in NYSE were 1.1 per cent lower at $102.19, but have still more than doubled since June.
428;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-12-13T22:07:53Z;Bush urged to break US oil dependence;;The Bush administration should act decisively to break America’s dependence on oil, said a group of leading US business executives and senior military officers in a report presented on Wednesday to the White House and Congress.The bipartisan group, which includes the chief executives of Fedex, UPS, Dow Chemicals and some of America’s best known retired generals, urged Washington to recognise that “pure market economics will never solve the problem” of US oil dependency.The report poured cold water on the Bush administration’s goal of reducing America’s dependence on foreign oil, rather than on oil in general. It urged Mr Bush and the new Democrat-controlled Congress to set up a plan to halve the American economy’s oil-intensity by 2030.George W. Bush has repeatedly identified “energy independence” and immigration reform as two of the issues most likely to attract bipartisan support following the Republican loss of control of Capitol Hill in mid-term elections last month.“Events affecting supply or demand anywhere will affect consumers everywhere,” said the report, brought out by the Energy Security Leadership Council, a think tank. “Exposure to price shocks is a function of how much oil a nation consumes and is not significantly affected by the ratio of “domestic oil” to so-called “foreign oil”.The report also warned Mr Bush, who is expected to announce new energy independence measures in his annual State of the Union address to Congress next month, that America’s oil dependence makes it acutely vulnerable to terrorist attacks.America’s transport system is 97 per cent dependent on oil. More than 90 per cent of world oil supply is controlled by foreign governments. “America must address this critical weakness.” Said P.X. Kelley, a retired Marine Corps general. “An oil supply interruption cannot be reasonably dismissed as improbable.”However, there is deep-seated scepticism about the willingness of the Bush administration, which has yet to endorse the theory of global warming, to take the tough steps most energy experts say are necessary to reduce America’s dependence on oil.Last January Mr Bush declared that America was “addicted to oil”. But Mr Bush’s announcement was not followed by any significant change in energy strategy. “There is very little reason to believe that the White House will take the tough measures necessary to make this happen,” said a Washington-based energy lobbyist. “There is no appetite, say, to impose a carbon tax or for putting a floor under the price of oil that would incentivise investors to put their money into alternative energy.”However, the US administration wants to step up co-operation with China on energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels. Energy and the environment will be among the topics addressed in Friday’s final session of the US-China strategic economic dialogue involving top officials meeting in Beijing.The dialogue is the brainchild of Hank Paulson, US Treasury Secretary, who has a strong track record as an environmentalist and is treated with suspicion by some US conservatives as a result. Lack of binding targets for China and other big emerging market countries such as India to limit their greenhouse gas emissions was one of America’s principal reasons for refusing to ratify the Kyoto accord.
429;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-12-06T22:04:49Z;Lufthansa orders Boeing 747-8s;;Lufthansa on Wednesday agreed to become the launch customer for the passenger version of Boeing’s new 747-8I jumbo jet, but insisted there was no conflict with its existing order for Airbus A380 aircraft.The German flag carrier announced orders for 20 747-8 Intercontinentals, with the first arriving in 2010, a year after its initial A380 delivery.Nico Bucholz, Lufthansa’s senior vice-president for fleet development, said the 400-seat aircraft would fill a gap between its existing range of 300-seat jets and the 500-plus offered by its A380s.Mr Buchholz declined to identify where the two aircraft would fly, though said they would be focused on long-range routes served by its existing fleet of older 747s. LufthansaBoeing has spent a year seeking the launch customer for the passenger version of the 747-8, stretching the aircraft to add more seats and adding new engines and wings to improve its economics.The US manufacturer has secured more than 40 orders for the freighter version of the aircraft, while Airbus is left with just one customer for the cargo version of the A380. ILFC, the leasing company, this week opted to convert its freighter orders to the passenger version. UPS is the sole customer for the A380F after FedEx, its rival package delivery group, cancelled its orders because of the production delays with the new aircraft.Lufthansa has previously ordered 15 A380s, the biggest order from a European carrier, but the first deliveries have been hit by severe delays of at last two years due to the production problems at Airbus and are unlikely to reach Lufthansa before mid-2009.The news came as Thai Airways on Wednesday said it would cancel its order for six A380s if talks on compensation for delayed delivery failed. Thai Airways said it would make a final decision after its board meets on December 19. Boeing launched the 747-8 programme a year ago on the basis of initial orders for18 freighters worth around $5bn from two all-cargo airlines, Cargolux of Luxembourg and Japan’s Nippon Cargo Airlines, which will take delivery of their first aircraft in 2009.The US group claims that there is growing interest from existing operators of the current 747-400, version in particular in Asia and Europe. The five largest 747-400 operators are Japan Airlines, British Airways, Northwest Airlines, Korean Air and Cathay Pacific.Recently British Airways opened negotiations with both Boeing and Airbus on purchases of new aircraft worth around $10bn during the coming decade, including the 747-8 and the A380, as it embarks on the costly process of renewing and expanding its long-haul fleet.BA, one of the most influential aircraft buyers, currently operates an all-Boeing fleet of long-haul aircraft, but it has launched a contest, which is pitting the Airbus A330, A350XWB and A380 against the Boeing 787, 777 and 747-8.Airbus is desperate to re-establish its credibility as a supplier of long-haul passenger jets after the debacle it has suffered over the A380 and the long delay in officially launching the development of the A350XWB family of long range, medium capacity jets, which finally took place last week.The first A380 is now due to be delivered to Singapore Airlines in October 2007 with full production of four a month only due by 2010.It won a small consolation prize on Wednesday from Lufthansa, which placed an order for a further seven Airbus A340-600s. Orders for the four-engined A340-600 have virtually dried up during the last two years with most airlines preferring the more fuel efficient two-engined rival 777 from Boeing.
430;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-22T22:00:32Z;Airbus says orders gap with Boeing is closing;;John Leahy, chief commercial officer of Airbus, said on Wednesday that the European aircraft maker has begun to close the gap with Boeing in the number of aircraft orders won this year, in spite of management turmoil and mounting industrial problems.According to sales data up to mid-November, he said, Airbus had won orders for 619 aircraft, the second-best sales year in its history, against 829 new orders won by Boeing.Airbus had captured a 43 per cent market share of sales of passenger jets of 100 seats and above, Mr Leahy said, compared with 57 per cent at Boeing.However, the sales by unit reported by Airbus on Wednesday disguise the severe problems that the group is suffering in the most lucrative part of the market – that for wide-bodied, long-haul aircraft, where it is struggling to compete against Boeing’s highly successful 787 Dreamliner and 777.Mr Leahy said the Airbus share of the world market this year by value had fallen to about 35 per cent, with Boeing taking 65 per cent.The board of EADS, the parent company of Airbus, is due to meet on Friday to begin crucial deliberations on whether to approve the costly development of a new long-range, medium capacity jet, the A350XWB, to compete with the Boeing 787 and 777.Airbus said that approval for the A350 programme was not expected on Friday, although a final decision was likely in the next two weeks.EADS and Airbus are facing one of the biggest strategic decisions in their history.Failure to go ahead with the A350 project would cede to Boeing dominance for a generation of the biggest segment of the world aircraft market by value – wide-bodied, long-haul aircraft of 250-350 seat capacity.However, the board is concerned the project could dangerously overstretch engineering and financial resources and put other programmes at risk. These include the badly-delayed A380 superjumbo, the A400M military transport aircraft and the development of a replacement for its A320 single-aisle jets needed for the middle of the next decade.Mr Leahy said the A380 delays – early deliveries are more than two years late – were so great that all of its customer airlines were entitled to cancel their orders, although only FedEx, the US express air freight group, had done this so far.The risks Airbus is running if it fails to develop or deliver its new aircraft programmes were starkly underlined on Wednesday by the publication of its latest 20-year global market forecast.Airbus forecast a 20-year market for 22,700 aircraft worth $2,600bn. It forecast growth in air passenger traffic of 4.8 per cent a year.
431;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-20T20:48:43Z;View from the top;;Exclusive video: Fred Smith, chairman of FedEx on the mid-terms and the US economy
432;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;View from the top: Fred Smith;;"Business leaders review the news on video on FT.com. This week Fred Smith, FedEx chairman, president and chief executive. Watch the video interviewFINANCIAL TIMES: Thank you very much for joining us Mr. Smith.FRED SMITH: Glad to be here.FT: We’ve recently had quite a political turnaround in the midterm votes. I wonder if you feel that that might lead to a wave of protectionism coming from Capitol Hill?SMITH: Well, there’s no question about the fact that a lot of the successful candidates ran on populist and even protectionist platforms, but that’s easy to do as a candidate, much harder to do as a legislator. There are tremendous amounts of vested interests in the international trading system. Over a quarter of the entire economy in the US is related to international trade. The US remains the largest exporter in the world; and while it imports a great deal, that too has given a lot of benefits to this society in terms of low product cost and a variety of manufactured goods and so forth. So I think they’ll be obviously some political rhetoric about it, but I would be very surprised if there’s any roll-back of the existing system. Whether there’s further liberalisation, that’s another matter.FT: As you enter your peak shipping season, you must have a unique perspective on the robustness of the US economy. What is your outlook?SMITH: I think the US economy is OK. I think it’s continuing to grow at a reasonable rate, not nearly as high as it was last year or the year before. The run-up in oil and commodity prices has gone through the economy like a pig in a python; the Federal Reserve, here and elsewhere, has raised interest rates; and so those interest rates sectors have responded, in the case of housing, with a significant reduction in housing turnover, and the same thing in the automotive sector. Too much capacity, too many automobiles, too many big fuel-inefficient automobiles and they are going through a correction. But I think the economy is resilient enough and flexible enough now that it can move through this with a so-called soft landing, and I suspect that the Federal Reserve, if the landing appears to be too soft, will adjust interest rates, which will help those interest rate-sensitive sectors.FT: And do you think the internet and more sophisticated supply chain managements can contribute to softening that recession if it is indeed ahead of us?SMITH: Oh, no question about it. If you look at the amplitude, the depth of economic correction since the start of this century and plotted through today one of the things you’d find is that they are becoming much more shallow; and on the horizontal axis they are becoming much shorter in duration. In large part that is because there’s so much better information available at the point of sale and so much better visibility all the way back to the supply chain. So when you have a reduction in demand, that’s quickly transmitted back through the entire business process and it makes it more flexible and much easier to adjust to temporary slowdown.FT: You recently cancelled your Airbus order. What do you see as the future of that company?SMITH: Well, I think Airbus is a great company. We operate more Airbus-wide bodies than any other company in the world. We have a wonderful relationship with them. The Airbus A380 is a great airplane and the issue is not technical at all. The issue was a production problem. And in our particular case, we have such an enormous international system carrying millions of pounds of traffic per day, as it grows the requirement for additional uplift or additional airplanes becomes very important to meeting our customer demand. So after the first delay we sort of said “Well, we’ll have to live with that” and the second and third one, that became a different matter; and we had to take care of our customers and our share-owners and that’s why we cancelled the order. But it wasn’t because we didn’t like the plane. We had to have the lift to meet our customer demand and Airbus has acknowledged that.FT: In the airline business, US Airways is now making a bid for Delta. I wonder what your perspective is on consolidation in that sector in the United States?SMITH: Well for many years people have said that the US airline industry should be further consolidated and there are some advantages of scale in that, so I suspect that it will happen. It’s very difficult to integrate the labour forces because they are mostly seniority-based and unionised labour forces. There’s often a lot of disparity in the equipment being operated, which is a very big issue for people who operate commercial airplanes, so it’s hard but I think the economic forces out there are greater now after the airline shake-out, which will force everyone involved in the process to say “we probably should consolidate the industry to some degree.”FT: You’ve recently finalised an acquisition in India and you’re close to finalising one in China. What do you see as the potential of those two emerging giants, and if you had to make a bet, where’s the greater potential, in India or in China?SMITH: Well, China has the lead because they’ve been more focused in manufacturing for a longer period of time. India has come on strong since they’ve liberalised their economy; so both of them will be very substantial growth markets. And you’ve got 2.7bn people I think, maybe 2.6bn … but very large numbers of consumers. So I think both of those economies now that they’ve been opened to global commerce will be big opportunities.FT: Thank you very much.SMITH: My prediction is that despite of all the past conflicts between Europe and the US and others over the Iraq issue, you’ll see in the coming months an understanding on a broad swath of the world that this problem has to be solved and you’ll see other countries coming to assist in stabilising the situation there, which is, I think, not obvious yet, but I think that will occur in the foreseeable future.More on Fred Smith"
433;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-16T22:56:59Z;FedEx founder credits supply-chain flexibility;;Increased visibility in corporate supply chains will help the slowing US economy achieve a soft landing, Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, has predicted.Mr Smith, who pioneered express package delivery when he launched FedEx 35 years ago, said advances in information technology had made businesses more responsive to changing economic conditions.In a video interview for FT.com, he said economic corrections had become shallower and less protracted during the past century. The current slowdown would continue the trend.“In large part that is because there’s so much better information at the point of sale and so much better visibility all the way back to the supply chain,” he said.“So when you have a reduction in demand, that’s quickly transmitted back to the entire business process and it makes it more flexible and much easier to adjust to temporary slowdown.”FedEx and its rivals had helped a global shift to “just-in-time” supply chains. Speedy and reliable delivery allowed companies to keep inventories to a minimum.Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, identified supply-chain efficiency as a source of US economic resilience.Mr Smith predicted economic growth would continue at a “reasonable rate” for the foreseeable future, “not nearly as high” as during the past two years.In a separate conversation with the Financial Times, he said transpacific freight, one of FedEx’s sources of growth, was “not as robust” as in recent years as Asian manufacturers adjusted to slowing US demand.High oil and commodity prices and rising interest rates had proved difficult for the economy to digest, he said. “But I think the economy is resilient enough and flexible enough now that it can move through this with a so-called soft landing,” Mr Smith said.
434;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-15T19:08:56Z;Wolfowitz comes to Old Europe;;"Who said the US neo-conservatives don’t play well with others? There was Paul Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the Iraq invasion and now governor of the World Bank, hanging out on Tuesday night with the lefties and Greens of the European parliament’s development committee in Strasbourg.Mr Wolfowitz listened patiently to lengthy questions about neo-liberal bank policies, his time in Suharto-era Indonesia and the Iraq war. He said that the bank could play a neutral role and help Iraqis.“They have plenty of money. What they need is advice.”Disappointingly, Wolfowitz said he was too out of the loop to offer thoughts on US policy after last week’s mid-term elections.But he did show himself to be tougher to pigeonhole than some might have thought. He said a solution in the Middle East would be difficult as long as the Palestinian people were suffering so much.Apart from this slight dig at Israel, he also broke another fundamental neo-con tenet by revealing he spoke French.“One of the many things I like about going to Africa is that I can understand the French,” he said after listening to European Union development commissioner Louis Michel’s rapid-fire delivery.“Belgians speak very fast.”Over the lineRed faces at Edelman, the financial public relations firm, after an abortive effort to introduce its commercial spinning skills to the monastic gathering that is the World Economic Forum at Davos.In a message this week to prospective clients, Edelman said: “Recently, we sent an e-mail advising you that Edelman could offer assistance to your company at the 2007 meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. This was not in the spirit of our agreement with the WEF. We would like to retract our offer and to apologise to you and the WEF for this note.”The WEF explained on Wednesday: “Any formal or substantive negotiation made either with members or with potential members of the World Economic Forum can only be done by members of the Forum’s staff and not by third parties.“This is very important as this is the only way that we can maintain our independent and non-commercial status.”Bumpy startUS President George W. Bush is having another tough week. His trip to south-east Asia for an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum got off to a rocky start even before his plane left the tarmac.Not only did Congress fail to approve a trade deal with Vietnam, the White House staff inadvertently embarrassed their boss on the internet. On Tuesday night, the
White House website displayed the flags of the three countries Bush will visit – Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia.But there was a minor problem. Instead of the actual Vietnamese flag, the White House chose to use the old flag for the Republic of Vietnam, ie South Vietnam. The White House said it would change the flag after Observer pointed out the gaffe.While Hanoi may not be happy, China will be delighted to learn that it was not the only Asian country to suffer protocol mistakes this year.When Hu Jintao, Chinese president, visited Washington, the White House introduced the Chinese national anthem as the national anthem of the Republic of China, which is otherwise known as Taiwan.Needless to say the Chinese were not impressed.Tricky timingFred Smith, founder and chief executive of FedEx, was in New York this week to be named man of the year by the French-American Chamber of Commerce.The accolade reflects FedEx’s status as one of the biggest foreign investors in France, with its main European hub located at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.But the timing of Tuesday’s gala award ceremony was somewhat awkward, coming just days after FedEx dealt a blow to French pride by cancelling its order for 10 Airbus A380 freighters in favour of 15 Boeing 777s.To his credit, Smith gamely took the stage after dinner to submit to a grilling by a French journalist. His first question, naturally, was about the Airbus deal. Surely not a sign of anti-French bias, he was asked jokingly.But Smith, addressing chamber members, made no apologies for the decision, saying FedEx could not afford to wait any longer for the chronically delayed aircraft.He stressed that FedEx remains the world’s largest user of wide-bodied Airbus aircraft but pointed out that it was not the only airline to have opted for the 777 freighter.The first customer? Air France.Man for the jobABB is racking up new infrastructure orders from the Middle East as fast as local potentates can count their petrodollars.So isn’t it about time for the Swiss-Swedish engineering group to ring up Donald Rumsfeld, who spent a decade on its board before moving to the Pentagon, to help out with the extra workload?With more time on his hands, the former US defence secretary could prove invaluable. Fred Kindle, chief executive, is already thinking about modest acquisitions now that ABB has returned to financial health: Rumsfeld’s experience in deploying minimum resources to maximum effect is near matchless.Better still, his name commands incomparable recognition in the Arab world. And when it comes to integrating acquisitions, few can rival his record."
435;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-08T15:27:01Z;Putting the house in order;;Business executives that talk about “networking” are often referring to building productive relationships with people from other organisations. However, when it comes establishing the kind of internal collaboration that will improve efficiency and foster the cross-pollination of ideas and knowledge, companies often run up against a major obstacle: the natural tendency to ignore what colleagues in other business units are doing.“We’re battling our own human nature to some extent,” says Rick Freeman of Capgemini, the consultancy. “We seem to have a phenomenal ability to forget the fact if people work together it will be better for everyone. Businesses need to teach people how to overcome that natural reflex.”While formal structures may operate in silos, the informal networks within a business hold great potential. Zia Khan, senior partner at Katzenbach Partners, a New York-based consultancy, argues that companies need to recognise the existence of two organisations within any business: the formal organisation and the informal organisation. The formal organisation consists of the structures, hierarchies and processes that are set down on paper and in job titles, while the informal organisation is made up of a complex network of relationships between employees in different departments or business units and at different levels of seniority within the company. “The formal organisation is largely based on predictions of how work will happen,” he says. “But increasingly, work doesn’t really happen that way. It’s like getting dressed according to the weather report and not adjusting when you step outside.”By contrast, the informal organisation relates to how the company actually operates. “It’s things like culture, networks, relationships and the emotional motivation people have for work that is not related to bonuses or pay – all those things that are hidden,” he says.Professor Peter Senge, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, also stresses the need to foster informal networks. “We look at ‘internal network leaders’,” he explains. “These are people who essentially connect people. They might be HR, engineers or sales people, but they’re the ones that have a sense about things going on in one part of the business that others don’t have a clue about.”Prof Senge says that companies can actively promote these networks. He cites the example of BP, which realised that while many of its refinery managers around the world were working in innovative ways, they never talked to each other. It established processes through which they could share knowledge face-to-face, and then through internal virtual communications.Technology has facilitated these sorts of communications, particularly for global companies whose teams may consist of members working in different locations around the world. For Inttra, an e-commerce portal that processes freight transactions, communications technology is a key collaboration tool since the company has more employees working outside the US, where it is based, than in it. Its global operations are in Hong Kong, its IT staff are in Singapore and quality assurance is conducted out of India and the New Jersey headquarters.Andy Barrons, vice-president of marketing, says technology allows staff to work together across borders and time zones. “A lot of it is sharing information, collaborating on documents and collecting market feedback from the commercial team. It’s about creating a community online.”For example, communal web pages known as wikis, provided by JotSpot, a small private company recently acquired by Google, can be written or edited by more than one person, eliminating the need for endless rounds of group e-mails. Calendars, contact lists and spreadsheets can be accessed from anywhere and groups of employees can jointly edit and contribute to them.But as Prof Senge points out, simply putting in place the right technology is not sufficient to spark the sharing of knowledge and best practice across a complex organisation. “That’s right on one level but if you do that without paying attention to the relational side of it, you soon realise information infrastructure is enabled or disabled by personal networks behind the scenes,” he says. “The most sophisticated organisations are working to encourage these natural personal connections.”Of course, while technology can facilitate virtual communications, face-to-face meetings remain essential, says Raj Subramaniam, senior vice-president for international marketing at FedEx. “My previous job was president of FedEx Canada, and I made a commitment to meet every single employee across the country at least once a year,” he says. “And every quarter, my officers were out in front of the employees.”FedEx – whose business units now include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Kinkos – also has what it calls its “Market Councils” where, for a given region, staff drawn from all the FedEx units working in areas such as sales, marketing and operations come together to address customer-related issues. “They’re obviously solving specific customer problems,” says Mr Subramaniam. “But they’re also building internal networks.”The need to break down organisational hierarchies and departmental barriers is acute during the launch of a new initiative. New Zealand Post discovered this in 2001 when it was preparing for the launch of Kiwibank. “They had all the right boxes, from marketers to IT systems, and they had individual plans for the bits and pieces – product specialists developing mortgage products and cheque books – but none of these plans fit together,” says Pip Peel, founder of PIPC, a project management consultancy that was brought in to manage the launch. “They hadn’t provided the coherence and cut across the corporation in a common cause.”PIPC created a single action plan, uniting the different players in the project with a single achievable goal – to launch a basic chequebook and credit card – and created a timeline through which other, more complex products would be brought in later. “It was only by having that holistic view of the programme that we could get them to realise that to get these activities right, they had to focus on what was really important.”The lesson is clear. Whether it is through setting single, achievable, goals or building on the informal networks that exist in organisations, companies need to be active when it comes to fostering internal collaboration.“There is a collaboration gene but it’s more a dormant and recessive gene,” says Capgemini’s Mr Freeman. “And the smart businesses have the ability to re-engineer themselves and create that new environment in which the recessive gene can come out.”
436;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;A380 delays push EADS into the red;;EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group, fell heavily into loss in its third quarter under the burden of the rising costs for the long delays in deliveries of the A380 and the weakness of the US dollar.It suffered an operating loss of €239m compared with a profit of €559m a year ago and said that it was still unable to give guidance on its outlook for the full year.The group issued last month a €4.8bn profits warning for the years to 2010 and announced that delays in the A380 programme had increased to at least two years.The group suffered a further blow this week, when FedEx, the world’s largest express delivery group, scrapped its order for 10 freighter versions of the A380 in favour of Boeing, the first cancellation since the series of disclosures of damaging production delays, which has cast doubts on the whole future of the cargo version.UPS, FedEx’s rival, also has orders for 10 aircraft and ILFC, the leasing group, has orders for five freighters, but Hans Peter Ring, chief financial officer said these were “all in the cancellation zone” given the delays.In the third quarter EADS fell to a net loss of €195m from a net profit of €279m a year ago.Airbus, which is 100 per cent owned by EADS since last month’s acquisition of the remaining 20 per cent stake from BAE Systems of the UK, suffered a fall to an operating loss of €350m from a profit of €410m a year ago.EADS turnover rose by 14 per cent to €8.48bn in the third quarter supported by record deliveries of Airbus aircraft, which are forecast to reach 430 this year, up from 378 in the whole of 2005.Airbus orders have fallen sharply during 2006, however, as the group struggles to re-establish credibility with its customers, with the value of Airbus orders in the first nine months dropping by 49 per cent to €14.7bn from €28.6bn a year ago.In a joint statement Tom Enders and Louis Gallois, the German and French co-chief executives, said “the struggle to reverse the A380 problems imposes a severe burden on our financial performance. This together with the dollar devaluation requires drastic measures to remain competitive.”In the first nine months operating profits fell by 34 per cent from €2.1bn to €1.4bn. Net income declined from €1.3bn to €848m with earnings per share falling from €1.60 to €1.06. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to €27.5bn.In addition to the extra costs from the A380 programme with charges of €1bn in the nine months EADS is being hit by the unwinding of its protective currency hedges, a €750m deterioration in the nine months, as it becomes more exposed to the weakness of the US dollar against the euro.It is also being hit by rising research and technology costs, as it prepares the future technologies needed to support the development of a new generation single aisle aircraft to replace the current highly successful A320 family in the next decade. The group had to undertake extensive retraining of its engineers to prepare the switch from metal to composites in manufacturing.EADS is facing too heavy losses and charges, probably amounting to at least €350m in the full year from the restructuring, including partial disposal and closure of its Sogerma aircraft maintenance and repair business. Losses at Sogerma totalled €227m in the first nine months.Mr Ring said that the EADS board was expected to make a decision “in the weeks to come” on the future of the Airbus A350XWB programme to develop a new generation family of long range, medium capacity jets urgently needed to compete against the highly successful Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft.He said the “major headaches” for the board in deciding whether to go ahead with the industrial launch of the A350 concerned the financing and engineering resources.He said the planned Power8 restructuring programme at Airbus aimed at cutting costs by €2bn a year by 2010 was “a pre-condition” and was “crucial” to the group’s ability to generate the cashflow to help fund the A350 development costs, which are expected to exceed $12bn.The board also had to be satisfied whether Airbus had the engineering resources to develop the A350 without undermining the delivery of its other programmes.In other areas of the EADS group Eurocopter, the world’s leading helicopter maker, won new orders for 471 aircraft in the first nine months, more than it has ever sold before in a full year, while the space division doubled its order intake.The impact of the problems at Airbus is overshadowing the improvement in profitability in other sectors of EADS including defence, helicopters, space and military transport aircraft.
437;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-08T03:20:57Z;A380 blow as FedEx switches to Boeing;;Airbus suffered a further blow to its troubled A380 superjumbo programme when for the first time an order for the aircraft was cancelled and Boeing aircraft ordered instead.On Tuesday FedEx, the world’s largest express delivery group, cancelled its order for 10 freighter variants of the aircraft, opting instead for Boeing 777s.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, said the A380 was a “terrific aeroplane”, but the group could not afford to wait for it any longer. FedEx had been due to receive the first freighter by 2009, but the A380’s recent production problems had pushed that back to beyond 2010.“The problem simply became that with two delays and the continued growth in the marketplace we were in danger of not being able to continue to expand our network and meet customer demand,” Mr Smith told the FT.Airbus said on Tuesday that it regretted the decision but added but it understood FedEx’s “urgent need to address capacity growth”.The Toulouse-based aircraft manufacturer insisted that there was still a strong market for its troubled superjumbo aircraft, which has recently seen two big customers increase their orders for the passenger variant.“Demand for the A380 is high as evidenced by recent repeat commitments from airlines such as Qantas and Singapore,” said an Airbus spokesperson. However, Virgin Atlantic last month said it was delaying delivery of the first of its six A380s by four years to 2013.Singapore Airlines told Bloomberg on Wednesday morning that it would keep its orders for the superjumbo.But the FedEx decision remains a severe blow for the struggling aircraft maker. Not only does it call into doubt the future of the freighter version but it makes it more difficult to meet the A380’s break-even target of 420 aircraft. The cancellation cuts the number of confirmed orders for both variants of the superjumbo from 159 to 149.Fedex was the launch customer for the freighter, which was designed in close collaboration with the express carrier. Analysts on Tuesday questioned whether FedEx’s move could jeopardise further commitments from rival logistics group UPS, which has 10 on order.“It will be very interesting to see if UPS, which tends to mirror everything that FedEx does, continues to take the aircraft,” said one leading aerospace analyst. However, he suggested that FedEx would return to place orders for the A380 after its immediate needs for extra capacity had been addressed. “They were just making a very strong point very cheaply,” he said.Mr Smith, however, seemed to exclude a return to the A380, saying it was “not in our best interest to operate too many different types of aircraft.”Industrial problems with the A380 project have delayed delivery of the world’s largest commercial aircraft by at least two years and forced Airbus’s parent EADS to issue a €4.8bn profit warning in September.Doubts over its efficiency had already led Emirates to convert its two orders into passenger aircraft. International Lease Finance Corporation, one of the world’s largest aircraft leasing companies, still has five freighters on order, but these were thought to be on behalf of Emirates.■ EADS, Airbus’s Franco-German parent, is due on Wednesday to announce third quarter results. A board meeting on Tuesday discussed whether to go ahead with the launch of the A350XWB long range aircraft, but no decision is expected before the end of the month. The aircraft is expected to cost more than $10bn, while the group is also facing heavy penalties over the delays to its A380 superjumbo.

439;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-11-07T22:03:46Z;Boeing cashes in on Airbus problems;;Boeing has shied away from overly-aggressive deals in favour of carefully-targeted sales campaigns which capitalise on the management and production problems at rival Airbus, according to aerospace bankers familiar with the company.The US group’s shares rose more than 5 per cent on Tuesday after capturing its second order in a week from under the nose of Airbus, with FedEx cancelling 10 A380 freighters in favour of the Boeing 777 cargo aircraft due to enter service in 2009. This followed a deal to sell four passenger 777s to Tam, the fast-growing Brazilian carrier that had relied exclusively on Airbus for its long-haul aircraft.Boeing’s ability to leverage the upheaval at Airbus is constrained by a determination not to raise output too quickly at a time when it is working on the new 787 Dreamliner, a stretched version of the 747 jumbo and developing designs for a replacement for the 737 narrowbody aircraft.While large customers such as FedEx would typically command discounts from the $2.5bn list price of the 15 777s, aerospace bankers said Boeing was carefully managing the sales process in an effort to push margins at its commercial business above 10 per cent next year.The company is already trimming the balance sheet of its Boeing Capital business, which had been used to provide customers with financial support and short-term leased aircraft. However, it confirmed this week that production of the 787 would be boosted from 2011 – the aircraft is effectively sold out through 2013 – though its has had to pump an extra $1bn to iron out teething problems in the 787 and 747 programmes.Bankers also pointed to Boeing’s decision not to offer any “trade-in” deals for existing Airbus orders by FedEx, a tactic which it had used in the past. FedEx remains the largest customer for Airbus widebody aircraft, with six new A300-600s arriving next year to join an existing fleet of 121 A300s and A310s.FedEx made it clear that the lengthening delays to the A380-800Fs – ordered with much fanfare in 2001 – would have left it at a competitive advantage for business between its hubs in Asia and Latin America.The 15 777 freighters have only two-thirds the payload of an A380, but FedEx is ordering 15 of the aircraft, so will gain slightly more capacity than that provided by the 10 cancelled Airbus aircraft. The express-package business also places more focus on volume than weight, and the 777 will give it an extra 2,200 miles in range over its existing fleet of 58 Boeing MD-11s.Boeing’s own 747-8 Freighter has a capacity only slightly below the A380, and is due to come into service in 2009 with Cargolux. The timing is understood to have been too tight for FedEx, which will receive its first four 777s that year. Moreover, much of the infrastructure for its MD-11 fleet is compatible with the 777, and any inaugural order for 747s would have required heavy additional investment.FedEx is also planning to spend $2.6bn in a multi-year programme to buy and modify about 90 Boeing 757-200s to replace its fleet of 727-200s, with most of the aircraft expected to come from Delta Air Lines, which is shrinking its fleet as it restructures in bankruptcy protection.
440;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-07-25T23:28:06Z;UPS battered by retail weakness;;Shares in UPS plunged nearly 16 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after the package delivery group reported disappointing second-quarter earnings and warned of a worsening economic outlook for the remainder of the year.UPS and other express delivery groups are viewed as important economic bellwethers because of their increasingly central role in global supply chains.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, said the group did not expect a severe downturn but it was becoming clear that a slowdown was under way.“Every indication says there are some challenges and headwinds out there, but we’re not saying the sky is falling in,” he told investors. “We’re saying that growth is going to moderate from the levels we’ve seen.”Mr Davis said shipments by manufacturers remained strong but some of the group’s retail customers were showing signs of weakness.Express delivery groups such as UPS and FedEx have enjoyed several years of rapid expansion on the back of soaring global trade and increasing demand for just-in-time services.But Tuesday’s results and guidance from UPS triggered a sell-off throughout the US freight transportation sector in expectation of slower growth.BNSF, the second-largest US rail operator, saw its stock fall nearly 5 per cent despite reporting a forecast-beating 28 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits.All the other big US rail companies, such as Union Pacific and CSX, have also reported strong results over the past week, but investors have preferred to focus on the uncertain outlook.UPS’s net earnings were up 7 per cent at $1.06bn, or 97 cents a share, but missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1 a share, in part because of surging fuel prices.Jet fuel prices increased by 14 per cent and diesel fuel by 11 per cent during the quarter, causing $21m in unexpected costs, according to Mr Davis.Like most freight carriers, UPS recovers some of its fuel costs through a customer surcharge, but there is a 41-day lag before increased prices are factored into the rate.Mr Davis warned that full-year earnings growth would be at the lower end of the group’s 11-16 per cent target, but stressed that demand for express delivery services remained solid.Mr Davis indicated that he did not expect a prolonged economic slowdown and forecast that UPS would return to stronger growth next year.Shares in UPS closed 10.25 per cent lower on Tuesday at $71.80 - up from an intraday low of $67.25.
441;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-07-18T21:03:19Z;Giants of the road in drive to be green;;The eighteen-wheeler truck, with a 500hp tractor pulling a 53ft long trailer, is the workhorse of the US economy – and the bane of environmentalists.Every day thousands barrel across the US interstate highway system, consuming diesel fuel at the rate of around 6 miles per gallon – compared to around 55mpg of petrol for an, admittedly, far smaller Toyota Prius, the best selling electric hybrid car.In 2003, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, heavy duty trucks accounted for around 15 per cent of of total US greenhouse gas emissions.But now Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is working on making its fleet of over 7,000 trucks just a little more like a four door Prius, supporting the development of the first-ever hybrid system for America’s largest trucks.Brian Wynne, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sees Wal-Mart’s interest as part of a “second wave” of the development of the hybrid power systems that capture and store energy generated by braking, using it to augment engine power.“The commercial applications are following after the technology has being proven in the consumer sector. Now we’ve got commercial fleet operators looking at it, and saying what’s in it for me,” he says.In the past two years, FedEx and UPS, the delivery services, have both developed limited production hybrid electric medium sized trucks to handle urban delivery routes, where the constant starting and stopping is particularly suited to hybrid technology.Prototype hybrid heavy duty garbage and utility trucks have also been produced, demonstrating, says Mr Wynne, that it is easier to make a business case for commercial trucks than it is for passenger cars – with long vehicle usage, and the ability to use stored power for specific work-related purposes. Traditionally the industry has not regarded long-haul heavy duty trucks – built for cruising efficiently at fixed speeds – as potential candidates for hybrid technologies, given their reliance on braking.But Kevin Beaty of Eaton Hybrid Power Systems, which developed hybrid applications for both FedEx and UPS, says his company has concluded from looking at actual driving conditions, that the consensus is wrong. “Just to drive across Iowa, for instance, on Interstate 80, creates lots of opportunity from braking on the downhills. And from just passenger cars entering the freeway, that causes a truck to brake, or to change lanes.”Eaton announced last month that it had developed a prototype hybrid-electric heavy duty tractor that reduced fuel consumption by 5-7 per cent, as well as saving a gallon an hour on supporting the cab while the trucks was parked.It also said it expected to be able to make a heavy duty system available “well before 2010”, estimating that it could save a truck operator $9,500 a year.Hybrid cars deliver far higher fuel efficiency rates of around 50 per cent. But a single heavy duty hybrid truck, driving 100,000 miles a year, would deliver far greater overall reduction in fuel use and emissions.Mr Beaty said the heavy duty system had evolved from work on medium-sized trucks, based in turn on technologies developed for FedEx, working in a project with Environmental Defense, the not-for-profit group that is also working with Wal-Mart.“They really put the pressure on Eaton to move quickly,” he says of FedEx. “And they pulled very hard on demand for product on a timeline …I would safely say they accelerated our work.”He also says FedEx was open about sharing information on its project – something Lee Scott says Wal-Mart will also do as part of its commitment to develop energy efficient technology.Mitch Jackson, head of FedEx’s environmental programmes, says making the technology open to others is aimed at increasing the environmental impact and reducing eventual costs through economies of scale.“We didn’t want to own the technology …we wanted clean vehicles that made economic sense,” he said.

443;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-06-23T20:33:35Z;Airbus plans for US dealt blow;;The troubled Airbus A380 programme was dealt a potential blow on Friday when an influential US congressmen said federal funds should not be used to upgrade US airports to accommodate the world’s largest passenger aircraft.John Mica, chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, claimed it could cost as much as much as $1bn to refit up to 18 airports to handle the 550-seat A380, which is due to enter service next year despite ongoing production delays.The congressman said any use of federal funds from the Airport Improvement Programme to allow A380 operations would be “patently unfair” in the wake of the controversy over European state subsidies for the aircraft’s development.However, aviation experts said such estimates were inflated, while A380-related improvements were also needed to handle new Boeing aircraft.Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and New York’s JFK are expected to be the first four US airports to handle A380s. The size of the aircraft will require the municipally-owned airports build stronger runways and air bridges, as well as enlarge some terminal facilities.Mr Mica commissioned a report on the costs from the Government Accountability Office, with the $1bn he cited relating to the 18 airports which may eventually handle the A380.“The costs have traditionally been overestimated,” said Dick Marchi, senior advisor for policy and regulatory affairs at ACI North America, a trade group. He said the GAO had assumed all of the airports would choose a more expensive path to modernise their runways, while most had so far not gone down this route.Mr Mica said he planned to introduce legislation that would bar federal funds from being used in A380-related projects, noting that no US passenger airlines have ordered the aircraft.“Until a US airline chooses to acquire and operate the passenger version of the A380, foreign airlines that operate A380 passenger service to and from the US should pay for any needed infrastructure improvements at the airports they serve,” he said in a statement.However, Mr Marchi said the runway-strengthening work would also be required for Boeing’s new 747-800 model, which holds less passengers than the A380 but has a similar wingspan.The federal airport programme gives around $3.6bn a year in grants, though much of this goes to smaller airports, and larger gateways have tended to use the bond markets for large-scale investments. Mr Marchi said federal funds accounted for around 15 per cent of capital spending at the large US hubs.While airport operators cast doubt on the practicality of Mr Mica’s plan, any efforts to thwart the A380 would impact US companies, despite the absence of any orders for the passenger model.FedEx and UPS have ordered the cargo version, and Los Angeles-based ILFC, a leasing group, has 10 orders. Moreover a large number of US companies are key suppliers of components for the A380.However, any delay to fitting out airports for the A380 comes at a sensitive time for Airbus. The programme has already run into production problemswhich will delay the first deliveries and could see Airbus – co-owned by Eads and BAE Systems – facing millions of dollars in compensation payments to customers. ILFC has threatened to cancel ordersif the production delays persist.Mr Mica’s intervention also comes amid the long-running spat between the US and European governments over launch-aid to commercial aircraft projects. The dispute is currently before the World Trade Organisation, and threatens to expand into an order for new tankers for the US Air Force on which Airbus and Boeing have rival offerings.
444;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-06-21T17:12:24Z;Market Overview: Wall Street provides positive direction;;"Wall Street provided other equity markets with positive direction on Wednesday as US shares drew support from favourable earnings news.Investors put to one side the continued uncertainty over US interest rate rises, and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season buoyed sentiment.Morgan Stanley and FedEx, two of the 11 S&P 500 companies expected to report second-quarter results this week, led the way with better-than-expected earnings.As a benchmark of business activity and corporate spending, FedEx’s results help bolster expectations for other companies.The S&P 500 constituents are expected to deliver 11.7 per cent earnings growth for the second quarter and 13.8 per cent for the whole of 2006, according to Thomson Financial.On such forecasts, the S&P 500 was trading on a price/earnings multiple of 14.5 times.At midday, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 1.7 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent.The performance spurred a recovery on European markets after early losses. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.03 per cent higher at 1276.47.European markets had earlier weakened as investors interpreted some comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank President as “hawkish”, supporting speculation for further interest rate rises in the eurozone.Testifying to the European Parliament, Mr Trichet said inflation rates were likely to remain elevated for the rest of 2006 and 2007. “We will continue to do all that is necessary again to counter inflationary risk and anchor inflationary expectations,” he said.In reaction, the yield on the 10-year bund was 1.1 basis points higher at 4.008 per cent.The equivalent yield on the 10-year US treasury fell 0.4 basis points to 5.153 per cent. The Trichet comments helped the euro make modest gains against the dollar and yen.The equity market trend was more mixed in Asia, where concerns over rising rates weighed.Tokyo was restrained by comments this week from Toshihiko Fukui, governor of the Bank of Japan, hinting at a rise in interest rates in the country from the current zero level.The Nikkei 225 Average ended flat at 14,644.26 while the broader Topix index fell 0.3 per cent to 1,505.51.In Mumbai, strong gains saw the market cross a psychologically important threshold. The BSE 30 index, or the Sensex, climbed 2.2 per cent to 10,040.14. It was the first time the index had closed above 10,000 since June 5 after heavy foreign selling of shares.David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, speculated that the US Federal Reserve might raise its benchmark Fed funds rate by 50 basis points at its policy meeting next week to 5.5 per cent.Merrill’s official forecast remains for a 25bp rise, but he said: “At the margin, we are starting to think a 50bp move could end up, helping the Fed achieve what would seem to be its two primary goals right now: pause before it’s too late for the economy’s sake; and do so without the markets second-guessing the Fed’s anti-inflation resolve.“Think about it; 50 accomplishes a lot. Inflation credibility? Check. Pause? Check. New press statement? Check. And it paves the way for a quicker return to an easing cycle later this
year, or early 2007, than the current dribs-and-drabs strategy.”"
445;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-06-21T09:29:16Z;Skills: Learn to speak the language of business;;"When Olivier Griot took an MBA at Wharton business school in 1991, the internet was in its infancy.Few students used the
e-mail addresses they were given and it was only at the end of the course that Mr Griot was able to download assignments from the school’s computer.However, while the equipment and systems have moved on, the management and other skills he learned remain highly relevant.“I’m a business guy who works in the technology field,” explains Mr Griot, who today is managing director of mobile services at Hachette Filipacchi Media US, a subsidiary of the French publishing group.“So, while I know the technology, I can’t do programming – but I can talk to a programmer and I can understand the business aspects of managing a technology enterprise.”Others requiring an equivalent understanding include technology consumers within a business, since a vast chunk of capital spending is now IT-related.This is not necessarily in the hands of the chief technology officer. In companies where IT spending is decentralised, heads of business units must also be able to make informed decisions.“Both the technology itself and the tools are permeating the organisation – and that in many cases isn’t under the CIO’s control. An increasing amount of it is local initiatives,” says Stuart Madnick, professor of information technology at MIT Sloan School of Management.“We’re trying to educate MBAs to understand the trade-offs of each approach – whether you’re going to control everything centrally or take the ‘let a thousand flowers bloom’ approach.”At the same time, companies need to equip the specialists and programmers responsible for developing systems that will give them competitive advantage.Mr Griot says that here, the MBA has its limitations. “Clearly, when is comes to the core skills, the hardcore technology knowledge, you won’t get that in a business school,” he says. “But to manage an IT staff for any company, you need general managements skills and skills in things like finance and marketing.”With technology permeating every corner of commerce and companies such as Wal-Mart, FedEx and McDonald’s using IT for everything from exchanging knowledge and enhancing logistics to measuring performance and forecasting trends, business schools have responded.Most provide not only modules that focus on the technology itself but also instruction on how to apply technology to business problems and strategies.In Mr Griot’s day, it was called Decision Science or DSci (some institutions still use this title), and at Wharton it was part of the core curriculum.“We were really pushing the envelope with Excel, using macros and programming to do some advanced financial modelling,” he says. “So leveraging technology to make the right business decision was very much a focus.”Business schools can be too quick to embrace new developments, however.In the late 1990s, a crop of
e-commerce MBA courses rapidly emerged to meet demand from budding internet entrepreneurs. With equal speed, these courses were abandoned or adapted as the dotcom crash took hold.And occasionally, students prove to be better informed than the professors.Alan Barbell, who heads Siemens’ disease management software line, says the MBA “opened my eyes to a whole different way of thinking about financial planning and project planning”.However, he was also surprised to find a professor on one of the courses explaining the futility of a project model that Mr Barbell had by coincidence worked on in his professional life and had found highly successful.Schools vary as to the depth to which students can pursue technology. Among those with the strongest IT focus is Tepper School of Business, at Carnegie Mellon University.Its “Technology Leadership” track covers areas such as information security and privacy, management of software development, systems architecture and web application development.At Sloan, Prof Madnick says the approach is to offer a menu of classes from which students can design their programme, according to how they see themselves using technology after they graduate.He says: “Some students want to get a strong technology background. Others take enough technology, so that when they go into their organisations, they have a leg up. So students can build a custom programme that matches their career needs.”However, he stresses that all MBA students need to be equipped to deal with IT, whatever their post-degree careers: “After all, what is financial services other than information technology? There are other things such as risk management but the vast majority of what they do involves applying technology,” says Prof Madnick.“If you’re head of foreign exchange, IT wouldn’t be in the title but in terms of what you do on a daily basis, it’s oozing IT.”Even those with IT in their job title must know how to speak the language of business with colleagues.“You have to be able to translate what they’re saying to you and you have to bring business cases forward for the IT drivers that will help the corporation,” says Belinda Watkins, head of network computing and IT operations for FedEx Services.“That’s one of the main reasons I chose to go back and get an MBA.”"
446;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-06-19T14:36:23Z;Alberto-Culver to spin off stores;;Alberto-Culver, the beauty company whose brands include VO5, is to separate from its Sally Beauty retail and supply operations in an unusual $3bn deal with private equity investors that will create two publicly-traded companies.The deal with Clayton, Dubilier and Rice follows the breakdown in April of Alberto-Culver’s attempt to sell its Sally Beauty retail chain to Regis, the hair salon operator.Sally Beauty operates 2,465 stores in the US, Canada, Mexico, the UK and Germany, as well as 825 Beauty Systems Group outlets. It also has a sales force of over 1,000 people that sells its products directly to hair salons.A CD&R fund will pay $575m for a 47.5 per cent controlling stake in Sally Beauty, which together with an additional $1.85bn of debt will be used to fund a $25 per share special cash dividend for Alberto-Culver’s shareholders.Alberto-Culver’s shareholders will also receive one share each in the two companies for each share currently held.Following the separation of the two companies, Gary Winterhalter, currently president of Sally Beauty, will become chief executive of the company.Don Gogel, chief executive of CD&R said the unusual structure of the deal, constructed as a tax-free spin-off of the consumer products group, demonstrated “that private equity has an enormous amount of flexibility to provide help to public companies obtain their goals”.CD&R’s previous notable investments have included buying the Herz car hire operation from Ford, and Kinko’s, which it sold to FedEx in 2004.Alberto-Culver had previously said it wanted to spin-off its distribution operations to focus on its leading brands. Following the completion of the deal, Howard Bernick, the son-in-law of the company’s founder Leonard Lavin, is to retire, to be replaced by James Marino, currently president of the consumer products group. Carol Lavin Bernick, Mr Bernick’s wife, will continue as executive chairman.The Consumer Products unit generated revenue of $1.4bn for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2006, and had pre-tax operating earnings of nearly $140m.Goldman Sachs is advising Alberto-Culver and Merrill Lynch is advising CD&R.Alberto-Culver’s share price rose 2 per cent to $27.69 at lunch time in New York.

449;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-05-17T22:10:10Z;Wall Street spooked by inflation fears;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday as inflation fears punctured an already fragile mood among market participants. All the important indices suffered heavy losses, with the S&P 500 index falling to its lowest in two months. The Dow had its worst day since 2003.Investors were unsettled by the latest consumer price inflation data, which were stronger than expected and led the market to price in a greater chance of further interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve. The data reverberated across all sectors, striking the transport, finance and energy sectors hardest.?They are finally talking about the top-line number,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to concern about both the headline index, which rose 0.6 per cent, and the core index, which was up 0.3 per cent.?The reason energy was taken out [of the core number] was because it was very volatile month to month. But for the last few years, crude has been trending up. This reaction is a shift in focus from the core to the top line.?At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.7 per cent, or 21.76 points, at 1,270.32. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent, or 33.33 points, at 2,195.80 ? its lowest level since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent, or 214.28 points, to 11,205.61, a one-month low.All sectors fell on the Big Board, with energy the biggest loser. Stocks of gasoline rose for the third consecutive week. BJ Services slumped 3.4 per cent to 34.75. ExxonMobil dropped 2.9 per cent to $60.18.The bellwether transport sector also took a hit, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average retreated from an all-time high set less than two weeks ago to fall more than 2.4 per cent in one day. It has now fallen 5.4 per cent in less than two weeks. Federal Express lost 4.8 per cent to $109.92, while Burlington Northern dipped 3.5 per cent to $76.13 and CSX shed 3.8 per cent to $68.09.Interest rate jitters afflicted the financial sector, with investment banks and brokerages particularly hard-hit. The S&P Investment Bank and Brokerage index has fallen more than 5 per cent in less than a week. Goldman Sachs fell 2.9 per cent to $148.21 and Morgan Stanleyshed 3.3 per cent to $59.99. E*Trade dropped 3.7 per cent to $24.05.Technology stocks fared less poorly, although they were still down for the day. Hewlett-Packard was a bright spot in the gloom. The shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.16 after the computer maker reported a better-than-expected 51 per cent increase in second-quarter profit. Broadcom gained 3 per cent to $37.46 after an attorney from the International Trade Commission issued a non-binding briefing arguing that Qualcomm infringed two patents of Broadcom.Applied Materials was down 5.2 per cent at $16.93 in spite of reporting a 35 per cent rise in quarterly profit.
450;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-04-30T20:29:40Z;Kremlin hires PR group to improve G8 image;;The Kremlin, not renowned as one of the world’s most media-savvy organisations, is signing up western public relations advisers for the first time to improve the presentation of Russia’s presidency of the Group of Eight leading nations.Russia’s presidential administration has signed a multi-million dollar contract with Ketchum, a US-based PR firm, to advise on communications with western media during its G8 term, which started on January 1 and lasts for 12 months, as well as the St Petersburg summit in July.The contract is a coup for Ketchum, which adds the Kremlin to clients including IBM, Kodak, FedEx and the World Economic Forum in Davos.Work will be co-ordinated by Ketchum’s Washington DC office, and a sister company, GPlus Europe, a Brussels-based public affairs group founded by Peter Guilford and Nigel Gardner, two former European Commission trade spokesmen.They face a unique PR challenge in trying to win recognition of Russia’s G8 work amid growing international suspicion of its record on democracy under Vladimir Putin, president, and of how it plans to use its oil and gas might.Moscow’s G8 presidency has been marred by the decision by Gazprom, the state-controlled natural gas giant, to cut off supplies to Ukraine in a pricing dispute on January 1, undermining Russia’s decision to make energy security a top G8 theme.It has also faced calls from John McCain, US senator, for member countries to boycott the St Petersburg summit over Russia’s authoritarian tendencies.Dmitry Peskov, deputy press attaché to Mr Putin, said the decision to hire international advisers had been taken last year. He denied that the presidency had got off to a bad start.“Russia’s presidency started well and continues to go very successfully. All our partners recognise that,” Mr Peskov said.“But it didn’t get off to a good start on the communications front. And this is connected with the misinterpretation [in the west] of what happened with Gazprom and Ukraine.“We set out our point of view, but apparently it wasn’t that effective. Perhaps if we had already been working then with some kind of communications company things would have been different.”Mr Peskov said Mr Putin had approved the decision, but it had taken time to persuade all the necessary Kremlin officials. Observers said they did not expect to transform overnight western media coverage that Moscow believes is often excessively negative. However, the Kremlin does want to gain credit, where due, for the handling of its presidency and summit.

Caterpillar rose 2.5 per cent to $76.21 and Honeywell gained 0.9 per cent to $42.66.The gains took the Dow 0.7 per cent higher at 11,317.43, while the broader S&P 500, buoyed by gains in energy stock climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,305.04. The Nasdaq Composite turned around earlier losses to trade 0.4 per cent higher at 2,303.35.Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders rose. Morgan Stanley, which topped analyst expectations with its 17 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, jumped 2.5 per cent to $61.94, while JPMorgan added 1.9 per cent to $41.99.Pharmaceutical stocks also moved broadly higher after drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb settled a key patent dispute with Canadian generic drugmaker Apotex.The deal, which would allow Bristol to retain patent protection on its blockbuster Plavix blood thinning treatment until 2011, prompted rating upgrades from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan.Bristol shares shot up 10.6 per cent to $25.24, while Eli Lilly ended the session 2.1 per cent higher at $58.49.Overall, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology index rose 1.2 per cent to become the second-best performing industry group on the S&P.By contrast, technology stocks were under pressure, with Microsoft sliding 2.1 per cent to $27.15 after it announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year.Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping
season.Shares in Hewlett-Packard slid 0.5 per cent to $33.36 while Gateway slumped 2.8 per cent to $2.36. Apple Computer, which does not use the Windows operating system, also got caught in the the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $61.67 after having risen by as much as 1.5 per cent earlier in the day.Losses on the Nasdaq were pared by Chaparral Steel, which surged 16.5 per cent to $57.50 following a strong quarterly earnings report. The robust figures set off a buying spree on metal makers. US Steel jumped 4.4 per cent to $59.86 while Alcoa gained 0.8 per cent to $29.36.On the earnings front, Nike and FedEx both exceeded analysts’ expectations with their earnings. Nike rose 2.2 per cent to $86.82 while FedEx gained 1.1 per cnet to $114.44."

453;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-02-26T22:54:57Z;Venezuela delays plan to restrict US flights;;Venezuela has delayed planned restrictions on US civilian and cargo flights until March 31 while the government of President Hugo Chávez seeks to settle a dispute with the US over access for Venezuelan carriers.The government said last week that it would ban Continental and Delta from flying to the country, and severely restrict services by American Airlines, from March 1 because a limitation on Venezuelan airlines, imposed by the Federation Aviation Administration in 1995, remained in force.The National Aviation Institute said at the weekend that it would embark on negotiations with the three US carriers, as well as Fedex, the cargo transporter, to search for an agreement.Venezuela wants the US to give it access for its airlines that is equivalent to the frequency that currently is permitted for US carriers to fly to Venezuela.Continental and Delta on Friday pledged they would continue services to Venezuela despite the Venezuela threat, which inflamed already tense relations between the countries.Officials from the two governments and the airlines met on Friday in a bid to resolve the impasse.Continental and Delta acknowledged that the final decision rested with the two governments.Venezuelan officials said the threatened move was in response to the failure by the US to lift restrictions on flights by Venezuelan carriers to the US, imposed in 1994 on safety grounds. This bars Venezuelan airlines from adding new capacity or aircraft, while US carriers have continued to build services and dominate traffic between the two countries.Francisco Paz, president of the National Aviation Institute, said last week the US had turned down numerous requests to increase flights by Venezuelan airlines. Aside from Aeropostal and Santa Barbara, President Chavez is also expanding Conviasa, a new state-backed carrier.“US authorities have failed to give Venezuelan airlines the rights they deserve in line with bilateral accords,” said the aviation institute.The US government introduced a new aviation oversight programme in 1994 which placed Venezuela in category 2, implying problems in the country’s airline safety and security systems. A number of other Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Peru, were put in the same category but have since been upgraded to category 1, allowing their airlines to expand services to and from the US.US officials made no comment on the current talks, but said the Federal Aviation Administration had worked for a decade to help their counterparts in Venezuela improve safety, and offered further technical support last year.The strained relations between Venezuela and the US have deteriorated markedly in recent weeks. Mr Chávez has started to reiterate his allegations that Washington is conspiring against his “revolution’’, while US officials have begun to step up their claims that Mr Chávez is a “problem’’ for Latin America.Venezuelan officials have also angered western oil groups by imposing a new tax and ownership regime on operators in the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter, and accused Washington of trying to block its attempts to buy military aircraft from Brazil.Earlier this year, Venezuela took state control over 32 privately operated oilfields in preparation for their conversion into jointventures that will have state ownership of up to 70 per cent. ExxonMobil was the only oil company that refused to convertto the new legal framework, resulting in its removal from a $3bnpetrochemical project with the Venezuelan government.The ban and restrictions on US carriers will add to travel difficulties between Caracas and the US, if not the rest of the world. Since the start of the year, international travel in and out of the capital has become anepic journey after the closure of a bridge that supports the main highwaybetween Caracas and the international airport.
454;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-02-15T04:10:47Z;Airlines raided in worldwide cargo cartel probe;;A worldwide cartel probe has seen European, US and South Korean antitrust officials jointly raiding the offices of British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and several other air cargo companies.Airline officials said the investigation focused on the way in which the industry imposes surcharges for items such as fuel and security, a process that some shippers said lacked transparency.The European Commission said its officials had ?carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of several air cargo carriers in several EU member states?. The Brussels-based regulator added that it had ?reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated? European rules that prohibit price-fixing agreements and other cartel abuses.The US Department of Justice said it was also investigating the industry. Some US freight operators such as American Airlines have received subpoenas and were co-operating with the authorities, though American ? which partners BA in the oneworld alliance ? said it was not the target of the investigation.?I can confirm that the antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the air cargo industry. We are co-ordinating with the EU and other foreign competition authorities,? a spokeswoman for the department said.Japan Airlines, Asia?s leading carrier, confirmed on Wednesday that officials from both the EC and the DoJ had visited one of its cargo offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and a cargo branch office New York?s John F Kennedy airport.?We will full cooperate with any investigation,? said a JAL spokesman in Tokyo. The airline said that its operations in Japan were running as usual, and that no inquiries or visits had been made by Japan?s Fair Trade Commission, the local anti-monopoly watchdog.JAL is ranked twelve in the international cargo industry, in terms of tonnes carried, by the International Air Transport Association.All Nippon Airways, Japan?s second-biggest carrier, said that its cargo operations abroad had not been questioned by officials.Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, said on Wednesday that EC and DoJ officials visited its Frankfurt, Los Angeles and San Francisco offices.?Cathay Pacific Airways is in cooperation with the European Commission and United States Department of Justine in respect of their investigation into air cargo operations?, it said in a statement.In South Korea, the local antitrust commission raided the offices of the country?s two airlines as part of the worldwide investigation. Korean Air and its smaller rival Asiana Airlines said officials from the Korean Fair Trade Commission made an unscheduled visit to their cargo offices in Seoul on Tuesday to inquire over freight shipment charges. But they said their overseas offices had not been investigated by either European or US officials.An Asiana spokesman said the KFTC officials carried out inspections into fuel surcharges on cargo shipments. A KFTC spokesman declined to comment on the details of the investigation but said that the targeted airlines could face corrective measures or financial penalties of up to 10 per cent of sales if they were found guilty of operating a price-fixing or market-sharing cartel.The EC does not reveal the names of the companies it has raided, but several groups said they were under investigation or had received ?requests for information?.BA said that it had received information requests both from the EC and the DoJ. It is understood that antitrust officials raided the British carrier?s offices at Heathrow airport and in New York, while United said that its cargo office in Frankfurt was targeted by European officials.Lufthansa, United?s partner in the Star airline alliance, issued a statement saying that cartel authorities were investigating the air cargo sector and that the group would ?fully support? the inquiries. It did not say explicitly whether Lufthansa offices had been raided.SAS, the Scandinavian carrier and another member of Star, also confirmed it was part of the investigation as did Cargolux, the Luxembourg-based group, and Air-France-KLM, though its US partners ? Delta and Northwest ? have not been notified.FedEx and UPS, the world?s largest air cargo operators by revenue, said they had not been contacted in the probe, and Deutsche Post said its carrier, DHL, was not targeted.The rise in fuel prices over the past 18 months has pushed up passenger and freight charges across the airline industry, leading operators to impose surcharges on customers.Lobby groups such as the European Shippers? Council have expressed concern about the methodology used in calculating extra fees, noting that in some cases last year the surcharge exceeded the transport cost.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, has said repeatedly that she wants to make the fight against cartels a ?priority? of her five-year tenure. At present, cartel probes normally last several years before the Commission imposes a fine. The regulator stressed on Tuesdat that the ?fact that the European Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation?.
455;FDX;Fedex Corp;2006-01-27T23:06:52Z;Paraguay faces call for crackdown on fake goods;;Chief executives of companies employing 1.6m people in the US and Europe on Thursday called for a crackdown on intellectual property violation and piracy in Paraguay, the Latin American economy most notorious for producing pirated consumer and industrial goods.Members of the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) told ministers from the US and European Union that better results could be achieved by focussing on piracy in Paraguay than by trying to achieve short-term results in China. They hope to bring pressure to bear on the country through Brazil and Argentina.“Paraguay sees piracy as a national raison d’etre. While the Brazils and Argentinas discourage it, they turn a blind eye to poor little Paraguay,” said Martin Broguhton, chairman of British Airways, and co-chairman of the TABD, which met at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.Mr Broughton said that China was “just too big” to expect pressure from western companies to bear immediate fruit but that Paraguay could be influenced both by pressure from neighbouring countries and the promise of aid or industrial development. TABD companies are to work on developing policy ideas for a crackdown.The executive board of the TABD, which include Coca-Cola, General Electric and FedEx in the US and Deutsche Bank and Philips in Europe, discussed piracy and trade with Carlos Gutierrez, the US commerce secretary and Gunter Verheugen, the EU industry commissioner and Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner.The companies called for the G20 group of developing nations to put forward a new proposal for global trade liberalisation in the Doha trade round. Talks have been stalled amid a standoff between developing nations and the EU over agricultural subsidies in Europe.The G20 countries, led by Brazil, have asked the EU to make a fresh offer on agricultural subsidies but Mr Broughton said they should quantify what they are prepared to offer in exchange. By listing the potential benefits of lowered tariffs on industrial goods and services, they might achieve more results with the EU.“They could quantify what would be on offer and then come back to Europe and say this is the prize,” said Mr Broughton. TABD companies were not optimistic about the chances of a breakthrough but the choice was between making a new offer or accepting that the Doha round was “moribund”.

But the gains were so slight, investors were left wondering if the traditional year-end rally had not run out of steam for good.Repeating a pattern seen over the past two weeks, the leading indices closed once again well off their intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent, or 28.18 points, to 10,833.73, after having moved up by as much 80 points.The S&P 500 also gave up substantial gains to end the session up 0.3 per cent, or 3.17 points, at 1,262.79. The Nasdaq Composite recouped part of its 1.3 per cent loss this week, advancing 0.4 per cent, or 9.24 points, to 2,231.66.“This was probably the best chance the bulls had this week to stage a convincing rally,” said Todd Harrison, founder of Minyanville.com, of the late afternoon retreat. “The longer that a [year-end rally] does not occur, the more likely that investors will all turn to sell their positions at the same time.”It was not supposed to end this way. The main indices had risen sharply in morning trading on news of positive corporate earnings and new deal activities.FedEx led the charge, rising 5.3 per cent to $103.70 after it exceeded market expectations with a 33 per cent jump in second-quarter profits. The shipping group also raised its full-year outlook, citing stronger shipping demand from Asia and productivity gains.The news lifted shares of other transport companies and pushed the S&P transportation index up 2.5 per cent. A flurry of merger and acquisition activity also lent the market some support.Seagate Technology announced plans to buy Maxtor, its rival hard disk maker, for $1.9bn in stock – equating to a 60 per cent premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Seagate rose 3.2 per cent to $20.23 while Maxtor surged 53.3 per cent to $6.93.Still in the technology sector, shares in Micromuse rallied 37.6 per cent to $9.92 after IBM said it would acquire the software developer for $865m. IBM inched up 0.8 per cent to $83.12.Elsewhere, Allergan, the maker of skin-smoothing treatment Botox, agreed a $3.42bn offer in cash and stock for Inamed, the breast implant maker. Allergan firmed up 0.7 per cent to $107.31 and Inamed added 1.5 per cent to $87.02.General Motors proved to be the main drag on the Dow, as its shares fell another 4 per cent to hit a new all time low of $19.05. The renewed selling came after Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, cut his stake in the group to 7.8 per cent from 9.9 per cent.Shares in Calpine, the power generator, faded another 13.9 per cent to $0.20 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Nike dropped 3.1 per cent to $85.75 after it reported slower-than-expected growth in its future orders.
457;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx ups guidance after strong quarter;;Solid economic growth in the US and Asia helped FedEx increase second quarter earnings by 33 per cent and lift its full-year earnings guidance.Fred Smith, chief executive of the US package delivery group, said he expected the positive economic trends to continue in 2006.Increased margins also contributed to the strong results, aided by greater operating efficiency and rapid growth in highly-profitable international shipments.Surging international trade has been driving expansion in express delivery companies, such as FedEx and UPS, for the past few years as corporate supply chains become more global.FedEx said its international package volume increased by 8 per cent in the quarter, compared to an average increase of 3 per cent across all shipments.Growth in FedEx’s domestic ground delivery business was weaker than expected but gathered momentum towards the end of the quarter as it entered the crucial Christmas season.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the ground business had continued to accelerate in the third quarter.Jon Langenfeld, analyst at RW Baird, said FedEx’s margin improvements were impressive but volume trends were mixed.The weakest performance came from FedEx Kinko’s, the group’s retail division, which saw operating profits decline and revenues stagnate amid falling prices for its photocopying services.Group net profits increased to $471m, or $1.53 a share, up from $354m, or $1.15 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue grew by 10 per cent to $8.09bn.
458;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-12-13T20:58:52Z;Pilots in demand at US airlines;;The major US airlines are expected to recruit about 2,500 new pilots next year, with the demand pushing up wage levels in spite of recent personnel and salary cuts at bankrupt carriers.The US commercial sector is expected to take on 10,000-11,000 new flight crew in 2006, a return to the levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, driven by the expansion of low-fare carriers and rapid growth in segments such as regional airlines and business jets.Airline labour experts said the recent focus on pilot cuts at Delta and Northwest, which on Wednesday enter their fourth month in bankruptcy protection, masks the buoyancy of the sector.“There are really two sides to the market,” said Kit Darby, president of AIR Inc, an Atlanta-based pilot recruitment specialist who estimates that half of the 16 majors, defined as companies with annual revenues of $1bn or more, are hiring.Southwest, the biggest of the low-fare operators, plans to add 460 new pilots next year, and rivals such as JetBlue and AirTran are expanding rapidly, while start-ups such as Virgin America will add to demand.However, the buoyancy of the pilot market has not improved the bargaining power of employees at the bankrupt carriers. Pilot leaders at Delta agreed at the weekend to a temporary 15 per cent wage cut while they attempt to thrash out a new contract, with management seeking steeper reductions in a bid to restore profitability by 2007.Pilots are due to vote on the proposal by the end of the year. Meanwhile, flight crew at Northwest elected by a margin of two-to-one to take a temporary cut in the face of a management threat to impose a new deal.Mr Darby said the pilots’ resolve was diluted by the recognition that their current jobs were not very portable because of different pay scales and seniority levels at more solvent rival carriers. “There really is no comparison out there to what they currently have,” he said, referring to the reluctance of pilots to return to what some refer to as the “boot camp” of retraining at another carrier.The major airlines have more than 8,000 pilots on furlough, some 12 per cent of the total roster, with more expected to join the ranks from Northwest and Delta as they shrink during restructuring.However, profitable operators such as FedEx, UPS and Southwest are lifting wage levels, and there is intensifying competition from the “fractional” operators of business aircraft, which have recently agreed to wage increases of 40-60 per cent and are expected to recruit 800-1,000 pilots next year.The tightness of the market has amplified the calls for the mandatory retirement age to be raised from 60, particularly as the bubble of military-trained flight crew who served in Vietnam is now reaching maturity.
459;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-12-12T17:30:19Z;The German experience: Long road to a successful ending;;Few embodied the conflicting goals of German privatisation – securing revenues for the state while fostering competition among companies – more than Manfred Overhaus, a civil service mandarin, who oversaw the budgets of governments on both right and left from 1993 until last year.Faced with shrinking government finances, he was instrumental in privatising Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post in the 1990s – a project ostensibly dedicated to European Union principles of free markets and competition.The greying, slender Mr Overhaus was in an effusive mood before Christmas 2001. The initial public offering of 28.7 per cent of the government’s stake in Deutsche Post had just netted €8bn for a budget creaking under the strain of financing generous welfare.Yes, he admitted, the successful flotation was due partly to Berlin’s willingness to protect until 2007 Deutsche Post’s highly profitable monopoly over delivery of standard letters. And yes, competitors were not pleased, he said with a frown that turned into smile.But the move would not block the liberalisation of postal services, he soothed. It would merely ensure Deutsche Post could compete with “global players” such as UPS or FedEx.Mr Overhaus’ justification speaks volumes about the priorities of the governments of Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schröder. Selling assets was more financing tool than ideology: free markets were good, but only once the ex-monopoly could compete with rivals.This was more fear of destroying the status quo than an expression of French-style economic nationalism. For one thing, the ministry of postal services employed 600,000 in the 1990s and their unions had immense clout.Talks about transferring job guarantees, pension rights and working conditions from a bureaucracy to the new entities started in 1990, when Klaus Zumwinkel became head of the postal service with the mandate to forge “a modern, service-orientated company”.With the communications revolution gaining speed, Telekom was to float first. But because Mr Kohl, contentiously, wanted to give the company the entire fixed-line network he needed the support of the opposition Socials Democrats. Their doubts delayed the process for four years.In 1995, Mr Zumwinkel became chief executive of Deutsche Post, a position he still holds. Ron Sommer, lured from Sony, was to prepare Deutsche Telekom for flotation.Equally important for the float were the problems of the government. Rising unemployment after unification was straining state coffers. At the same time, Mr Kohl was demanding strict EU-wide fiscal rules as a prelude to introduction of the euro.Banking on the DT flotation, Theo Waigel, finance minister, earmarked privatisation proceeds of €6.5bn for his 1996 budget. In the 14 years before, the government had collected no more than €9bn via asset sales. The flotation was a success. Investors ordered 3.6bn shares when only 690m were on offer. A share-owning culture had finally gained a foothold.It was to take four years and a change of government to bring Deutsche Post to market. Much as the Kohl government had given DT the fixed line network as a solid revenue source so it wanted to give the post the monopoly for delivering normal letters.Karel van Miert, then EU competition commissioner, objected that the post had used this moneyspinner to subsidise its loss making parcel service. A drawn-out conflict ensued, which resulted in the member states agreeing to end monopolies for letter delivery the year after next.Today, the federal government owns only a minority stake in both companies. They have had their ups and downs. DT, in particular, was hit when the dotcom bubble burst. Mr Sommer left in summer 2002.But both have grown to a size that makes them predators rather than targets. DT set Germany’s takeover record with its $26bn purchase of Voicestream, the US mobile operator, in 2001. Deutsche Post bought DHL and Airborne, the US freight forwarders, and Excel, the UK logistics company.Both employ as many as they did 15 years ago – 240,000 at DT and 380,000 at the post. These numbers mask more than 200,000 voluntary redundancies in Germany, which have in turn lowered prices for telephony and postage.

Comments from the company did not rule out further disposals but suggested a significant premium would be required for control of Express. “UPS or FedEx could pay up to €8.3bn for TNT Express,” said Andrew Beh of ING Securities, who estimated that TNT’s shares could be worth €32 if a break-up materialised.Takeover speculation helped to push VNU 6.1 per cent up to €28.60 amid reports that two consortiums of private equity companies were considering a bid for the Dutch publisher.Speculation that a financial buyer was considering a leveraged buyout pushed Degussa up 5 per cent to €39.54. Eon, the utility, must sell its 43 per cent stake in Degussa by December 31 and the potential for restructuring at the German speciality chemicals producer has increased. RAG, the German chemicals group, has stated plans to increase its holdings in Degussa ahead of a flotation in 2007.The two global leaders in the smart card industry announced plans for a merger, pushing Gemplus 3.1 per cent higher to €2.30, while Axalto added 3.8 per cent to €23.11. The deal will need approval from the EU’s Competition Commission, as the new company, Gemalto, will have more than 50 per cent of the SIM card market. The potential cost savings impressed analysts, and the company, which will have €1.8bn in proforma combined sales, was described by Citigroup as “a unique and potentially cheap way to play the future development of digital security”.The deal sent Oberthur Card Systems, the number one supplier of financial cards, up 8.7 per cent to €7.73. Andy Perkins of SG Securities reiterated a “buy” rating for Oberthur, as the financial card market is less volatile and annual growth of 20 per cent is expected over the next few years.A takeover of KPN, up 1.2 per cent to €8.46, became more likely after the Dutch government gave up its “golden share” of 165m shares. Telefónica, 1.1 per cent weaker at €12.55, could consolidate its German operations with those of KPN.Insurers were among the week’s worst performers after JPMorgan said the market had already priced in the opportunities presented after the US hurricanes, and it did not see a structural shift in underlying profitability or growth prospects for the sector. Swiss Re fell 5.4 per cent to SFr96.50, while Munich Re retreated 4.9 per cent to €114.05.

Deutsche said its sum of the parts valuation could rise to €32 from €30.5 per share by 2007.Ericsson rose 3.7 per cent to SKr27.80 after the Swedish telecoms equipment company won its biggest-ever managed services order, potentially worth SKr15bn to SKr20bn over seven-years.“We estimate Ericsson’s top line could be boosted by at least 2 per cent, with further upside provided by potential equipment sales,” said Richard Winslade of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.STMicroelectronics added 1.2 per cent at €15.74 after Europe’s number two chip maker agreed to work with Intel on a common mobile-phone memory chip in a move aimed at winning greater market share from Spansion, the main competitor.The rest of the chip sector also performed strongly after Altera’s improved guidance, with ASML 2.2 per cent stronger at €16.89 and Infineon up 1.8 per cent at €7.87.Alstom gained 3.6 per cent to €49.80 after the engineering company said it had won a €450m order for two gas turbine-fired power plants. The train company Connex ordered three Alstom locomotives on Monday with an option for 20 more.Deutsche Borse rose 1.3 per cent to €86.80 on reports that it does not plan to close its subsidiary Eurex US immediately but would look for partners instead, with the International Secutities Exchange seen as one potential partner.Bayer fell 0.7 per cent to €34.52 after the German chemicals and drugs company settled a number of US lawsuits relating to price fixing issues at its polymers business. A provision of €275m (tax deductable) will be required in the fourth quarter but Bayer warned it could incur additional costs, potentially of material importance.WestLB estimated the settlement could hit earnings by 11 per cent and downgraded Bayer from “ buy” to “neutral” as the shares are trading close to their €35.20 price target.Eniro rose 6.2 per cent to SKr93.50 after UBS raised its price target to SKr120 from SKr100 and reiterated its “buy” recommendation for the Swedish phone directory company. UBS said the recent acquisition of Findexa, its smaller Norwegian rival, was strategically sound and that the market had missed the significant enhancement in cash flows from operating synergies.LVMH rose 2.1 per cent to €75.50 after Citigroup initiated coverage on the luxury goods group with a “buy” recommendation and an €84 price target. Citigroup said currency pressures would ease and its positive view was supported by the huge appetite of Chinese consumers for luxury goods.Richemont rose 1.9 per cent to SFr53.10 after UBS said the the world’s second-biggest luxury goods group was benefiting from a major step-up in product innovation and that it would sustain industry-beating growth rates as the premium watch market remained buoyant. UBS reiterated its “buy” recommendation and raised its target price to SFr59Adecco fell 1.7 per cent to SFr59.25 on fears that a stock overhang could be created after news that the family of chief executive Klaus Jacobs was selling about SFr767m of bonds, convertible into equity if the share price rises by about 25 per cent from the current level.Finmeccanica rose 1.2 per cent to €16.17 after UBS upgraded the Italian aerospace company from “reduce” to “neutral” due to a better than expected earnings outlook.
462;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-11-03T23:52:51Z;BA and Virgin attack US concession;;British Airways and Virgin Atlantic on Thursday said a proposed concession on US rules governing foreign investment in US carriers did not go far enough.US carriers also expressed disquiet about the lack of consultation by the Department of Transportation, which aims to relax its definition of foreign control of US airlines.The Air Transport Association, the industry trade body, said it would study the proposal, but Continental Airlines yesterday blasted the move as “a blatant attempt to change the law”.The carrier said it supported a review of the existing law by Congress, but accused the DoT of being ”blinded” by the desire to secure a deal with the EU.The DoT said its move would give overseas investors a say in the running of US operations commensurate with the holdings. It plans to relax the subjective test of what constituted foreign control, a framework that has generated a number of bitter legal battles in the past – notably the acquisition of a US cargo carrier by DHL in 1993, though the German logistics group eventually prevailed despite opposition from rivals FedEx and UPS.The proposal will not change current ownership restrictions, which can only be altered by Congress. At present foreign entities are limited to holding a maximum 25 per cent voting stake in a US airline, and up to 49 per cent of the equity capital if they have a liberalised open skies deal with the US.BA said it was “disappointed” the US was not prepared to make the legislative changes to remove restrictions on foreign ownership and control.Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, urged the European Union not to give in to the US in the forthcoming EU-US negotiations to create a transatlantic open aviation area.Ownership and control issues are excluded from the current round of EU-US talks, due to start on November 14. “This is no coincidence. The US is saying to the UK, ‘These goodies are at the tip of your fingers’,” said one veteran aviation watcher in Washington, referring to the UK’s longstanding push for liberalised ownership and control rules.The new rules would apply only to countries with an open-skies deal with the US and a reciprocal investment regime.This could increase pressure on the EU to reach a deal with the US but still leave barriers in place for investors from Japan and China, both of which lack open-skies deals.
463;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-10-19T21:09:21Z;FedEx dares to keep the status quo;;Go behind the scenes at some of Manhattan’s top restaurants and the revolutionary impact of FedEx can be found staring straight back at you – in the clear, glistening eyes of truly fresh fish.Thanks to the company’s global delivery network, gourmet chefs are increasingly bypassing the traditional fish market and sourcing their best fish directly from individual fishermen thousands of miles away.Turning business models upside down in this way is something the express parcel carrier does quietly all the time. When Apple sold one million new iPod nano music players in 17 days last month, the customised models bought online barely saw the inside of a warehouse but were fed directly from factories in China into the FedEx delivery system.The efficiencies made possible by such low-inventory supply chains even play a key role in the flexibility and resilience of the US economy – most recently lauded by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.But while FedEx continues to change the world of business, a curious stasis is apparent in its own business model. Fred Smith, the former US marine who largely invented the overnight airborne delivery industry by founding Federal Express in 1971, is sitting out the latest revolution sweeping the package delivery industry.The company’s biggest rivals – United Parcel Service, Deutsche Post and TNT – are expanding into an ever-wider range of logistics services but FedEx remains doggedly focused on its core small package and light road-freight businesses.While Michael Dell now sells printers and Bill Gates chairs a software company that produces games consoles, Mr Smith is a rare example of a successful entrepreneur choosing to stick to what he knows. “We have looked long and hard at whether we want to be a big player in the contract logistics sector,” he says. “We have chosen not to do so because it is a low margin business and it is not clear to us that there is the type of synergies there that our competitors hope to find.”Mr Smith has never previously been one to cling to the status quo. So it is tempting to wonder whether, after 34 years at the industry’s cutting edge, FedEx is becoming a more conservative company, and Mr Smith, at 61, is losing his eye for the new opportunity.Deutsche Post, which owns the DHL parcel delivery network, believes that in an era of complex global supply chains, there is an opportunity for it to provide a “one-stop shop” for all the logistics needs of its corporate customers. The group already has the capability, following a series of acquisitions, to deliver anything from the lightest package to the heaviest freight by land, sea or air anywhere in the world.The German group’s offering will be strengthened further if its £3.7bn ($6.5bn) agreed takeover of Exel, the British contract logistics group, is completed as planned. In addition to co-ordinating the movement of its customers’ goods around the world, Exel does everything from managing warehouses to sub-assembling parts for manufacturers.UPS, the largest US package delivery group, has been more cautious in its expansion. But its acquisition last year of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a global air and sea freight company, suggests it broadly shares Deutsche Post’s vision.TNT, the Dutch post and package group, has also developed a powerful contract logistics and freight forwarding business.FedEx, in contrast, has limited itself to a small, home-grown supply chain services division and Mr Smith says there are no plans for a large acquisition in the sector. The group’s only serious exposure to heavier goods is through its domestic road freight division. But even that is limited to the so-called “less than truckload” segment, transporting relatively light loads over short distances.Mr Smith believes the small package and light freight markets are fundamentally different from – and more attractive than – the logistics and heavy freight businesses being pursued by Deutsche Post, UPS and TNT.The former, he says, are high-margin activities fo-cused on delivering small, high-value products, such as iPods or Louis Vuitton handbags, to their point of consumption. The latter, by contrast, is a lower-margin business, typically involving lower-value, larger-scale goods destined for earlier stages in the production process.While small package customers include many small and medium-sized businesses and consumers with weak pricing power, the heavier freight and contract logistics markets are dominated by large retailers and manufacturers with the leverage to squeeze margins. “We’ve seen no reason to get into that sector,” says Mr Smith.His scepticism about diversification is at odds, not only with FedEx’s rivals, but also with many investors. Jon Langelfeld, analyst at RW Baird, says an acquisition by FedEx in the freight forwarding sector “would be well received by investors”.Mr Smith has never been afraid to go against investor sentiment. But he insists he would not hesitate to change the strategy if the company started losing business because of its lack of logistics services. “If we start to hear people saying ‘we want a one-stop shop, we’re going to take away your small shipment business’, then we’ll have another look,” he says. “But, so far, we’ve seen very little leakage.”Mr Smith is equally cautious in his approach to international expansion. FedEx remains, at heart, a cargo airline. As such, it eagerly snaps up every additional take-off and landing slot it can secure in the plum parts of Asia and Europe. But the group is more hesitant about acquiring assets on the ground.While UPS recently joined DHL in offering a domestic parcel service in China, FedEx has stuck with imports and exports. In Europe, too, the group has shown little interest in competing domestically.Mr Smith says the reason for the caution is simple: the inter-continental express market, with its high margins and strong growth, remains a more attractive business than either China’s nascent domestic market or Europe’s fragmented and fiercely competitive road-based markets.Instead of sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into fleets of branded delivery trucks around the world, FedEx has in many places preferred to forge partnerships with local delivery companies. In the UK, for example, FedEx uses Business Post, a British courier company, to access parts of the country not covered by its own vehicles.“We would not be afraid to invest $5bn-$6bn [in an overseas acquisition],” says Mr Smith. “But we are not going to make any investments of that magnitude unless there were wonderful financial returns.”There are clearly risks to FedEx’s take-it-or-leave-it approach to geographical and sectoral expansion. If Deutsche Post’s one-stop logistics shop turns out to be a winning strategy, FedEx will have a lot of catching up to do. Likewise, opting out of European and Asian domestic markets leaves holes in its global network that DHL and UPS could exploit.Until then, Mr Smith’s simple strategy of using a hub-and-spokes air network to deliver packages with speed and reliability remains as effective today as it was when the first FedEx aircraft left a runway in Memphis 34 years ago.When you have a model that produces results, says Alan Graf, chief financial officer, it is best not to tinker. “What we haven’t done,” he says, “is just as important as what we have done.”HOW FRED SMITH TRANSFORMED A MARKET■ The idea: As a student at Yale University in the 1960s, Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, explained in an economics paper how a hub-and-spoke distribution network was 100 times more efficient than point-to-point networks. After a spell serving as a US marine in Vietnam, Mr Smith decided to apply his theory to the parcel delivery business.■ The company: Federal Express was founded by Mr Smith in 1971, with the launch of 14 small aircraft from Memphis. On its first night, the company delivered 186 packages to 25 US cities. Today, FedEx makes 6m shipments a day, using a fleet of 674 aircraft serving 375 airports in 220 countries.■ The strategy: While its biggest rival UPS dominates the US road-based delivery market, FedEx has focused on airborne express delivery. Its core business involves shuttling small, high-value products, such as electronics and luxury goods, between manufacturers, retailers and consumers at high speed with great reliability.
464;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
465;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-10-18T11:35:01Z;Patrick steps up fight against Toll’s takeover bid;;Patrick Corporation, the Australian ports operator, on Tuesday stepped up its fight against a hostile A$4.6bn (US$3.2bn) takeover bid by transport group Toll Holdings, saying an independent expert had assessed the offer as too low.If Toll succeeds with its offer - which has sparked one of Australia’s most bitter domestic takeover battles of recent years - it will become the world’s fourth-largest transport and logistics company, behind United Parcel, Fedex Corp and TNT.However, in a statement, Patrick, which also has freight operations across rail, road, sea and air, described the Toll approach as “ill-conceived and an act of desperation”. The company produced a lengthy report by Lonergan Edwards, a consultant, which valued Patrick Corp shares at $7.75 to $8.31.Toll Holdings, an acquisitive Melbourne-based logistics group, has offered 0.4 of its shares and 75c for each Patrick share and a complex special dividend from Patrick of Virgin Blue shares on a 0.3-for-1 basis. Patrick owns a 62 per cent stake in the low cost airline. Toll’s offer, made in August, valued Patrick shares at $6.70 each.Patrick said: “The value of Toll’s offer is at a 22 per cent discount to the mid-point of the range outlined by Lonergan Edwards.”Paul Huxford, a Macquarie Equities analyst, said: “The valuation released by Patrick appears reasonable.”Chris Corrigan, Patrick managing director, said: “Toll has grossly underestimated the value of Patrick and is mainly share based. They are offering funny bits of paper called Toll shares.”Mr Corrigan told the Financial Times that Toll was anxious to make a sizeable acquisition to maintain its market rating. He said: “Toll needs to grab Patrick’s high growth ports business. Toll needs Patrick if it is to escape the limitations of its dominant position in the domestic logistics sector.”Patrick on Tuesday also forecast growth in earnings before interest and taxation between 2005 and 2007 of 21.9 per cent per year. Mr Corrigan said this compared with projected earnings growth at Toll of 10.3 per cent.Toll rejected Patrick’s claims Tuesday evening, arguing that they “lacked the strategy and vision to expand the logistics supply chain into the highly-value creating Asian region”. Toll also dismissed Patrick’s growth forecasts as “unsubstantiated” as they relied on “hockey stick” estimates of future returns.The takeover battle is likely to last several more months, with both sides now awaiting a ruling next month from the competition authority. Patrick and Toll are also in dispute over their joint venture railways company, Pacific National.Toll shares rose 27c to A$11.40 while Patrick closed up 10c at A$6.62.Meanwhile, Virgin Blue on Tuesday surprised investors by upping its net profit forecast for 2004/05 to A$105m, 10 per cent above its previous guidance. The budget carrier recorded a A$159m net profit last year but has suffered from rising fuel prices and increased domestic competition.
466;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-10-06T10:52:48Z;DHL to make HK largest hub outside US;;DHL, the German express group, is investing $110m to double the capacity of its cargo handling hub in Hong Kong six years ahead of schedule, as its business in mainland China grows.The move, announced on Thursday and due to be completed in 2007, will make Hong Kong DHL’s largest hub outside the US, with capacity to move 75,000 pieces an hour.Scott Price, DHL Express chief executive for Asia Pacific, called the expansion a “very significant, long-term commitment to Hong Kong.”DHL’s investment is the latest development in an increasingly fierce competition among the world’s largest express carriers in China. In July, FedEx announced plans to spend $150m to move its Asia Pacific hub from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Guangzhou, 174km north of Hong Kong in mainland China. United Parcel Service unveiled plans to build a hub in Shanghai the same month.DHL’s move also represents a victory for Hong Kong, which is keen to further develop its logistics sector.DHL and FedEx have chosen to locate their hubs in the south to be closer to the Pearl River Delta, the string of industrial cities that were first opened to foreign investors after economic reforms began in 1978. The region now produces about a third of China’s exports and is home to Wal-Mart’s global sourcing headquarters.Mr Price said the company saw 50-60 per cent revenue growth in China last year, compared with an average of 35-45 per cent in the previous several years.“We believe that China, even at an average will still look at 7-8 per cent GDP growth over the next decade. The outsourcing of manufacturing, in particular industries like high-tech, textiles, automotive … is going to be huge,” he said.Hong Kong is one of three global “SuperHubs”, processing goods from around Asia. The others are in Wilmington, Delaware, and Brussels, although this facility is moving to Leipzig, Germany. DHL also has five smaller hubs around Asia.The group, a unit of Deutsche Post, plans to increase the level of automation as it expands the hub from 18,200 square metres to 35,000 square metres so that it can move shipments more quickly.DHL opened the facility, which cost $100m to build, last year. It had originally planned to enlarge it in two phases in 2009 and 2013.The group, which is owned by Deutsche Post, has a joint venture with Air Hong Kong, a joint venture cargo airline with Cathay Pacific Airways.
467;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-10-05T22:53:01Z;FedEx to raise express shipping rates 5.5%;;FedEx on Wednesday announced a 5.5 per cent increase in its express shipping rates for next year to take account of record fuel prices and robust demand.The bigger-than-average increase reflects continued strength in the package delivery services as global trade expands.Analysts said United Parcel Service, the largest US parcel courier, is likely to follow with a similar rate hike in the next few weeks.The increase will ease fears among investors that mounting competition between FedEx, UPS and their German rival DHL could weaken pricing.For customers, however, the higher prices will add to upward pressure on supply chain costs, amid record fuel prices and transportation bottlenecks.FedEx stressed that the 5.5 per cent increase would be offset by a 2 per cent reduction in the company’s variable fuel surcharge, resulting in an overall average increase of 3.5 per cent.By sharply increasing standard rates and reducing the fuel surcharge, FedEx is effectively locking higher fuel prices into its standard rates. This signals that the company expects fuel prices to remain high for the foreseeable future.In an interview with the FT, Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, said he expected fuel prices to ease back from their recent peaks as supply recovered following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and new refining capacity gradually came online. But he said a sharp decline was unlikely.Mr Smith said global trade continued to grow stronglty despite high fuel prices and that customers were reducing spending on transportation only at the margins.Under the new pricing structure, FedEx has increased its base fuel price to $31 a barrel and will impose a surcharge on prices above that level.The new rates, which come into effect on January 2, 2006, affect US express air deliveries. The company has not yet announced any changes to its ground rates or international prices.
468;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-09-28T21:37:39Z;Dell transfers deliveries to US Postal Service;;"Dell is to shift some of its computer deliveries from private parcel shippers to the US Postal Service, underlining the growing competitive threat posed by the government-owned organisation to companies such as United Parcel Service and FedEx.The computer maker plans to drop off some newly-bought computers at US post offices for customer pick-up rather than delivering them directly to people's homes through private couriers. companies.Any loss of business from Dell would be a particular blow to UPS, which counts the company among its 20 largest customers.Analysts have been warning for months that the US Postal Service is becoming a more powerful force in the US parcel market.The additional competition comes at a time when UPS, the world's largest parcel shipper, is facing growing competition from FedEx and German-owned DHL in its domestic market.Dell said the change in shipping arrangements would initially affect only the company's most basic products, with the majority of shipments continuing to be made through UPS. However, a spokeswoman said Dell planned to eventually offer the choice of home delivery or post office pick-up to all customers.""For many working people, it is more convenient to pick up a parcel at the local post office than it is to wait at home for a delivery,"" she said.Under the new scheme, starting next month, Dell will use an independent logistics company, APX, to ship computers to about 5,000 of the country's 38,000 post offices. Analysts said the plan appeared to be , at least in part, a cost-saving measure by Dell.UPS said it was relaxed about Dell's decision. “We continue to have a great relationship with Dell and our business with them is continuing to grow,” said a spokeswoman.She said the postal service would struggle to match the deep relationship that UPS had developed with Dell and its other large customers. “We are plugged into their customer service operation,” said the spokeswoman. “We don't believe the postal service has the technology or service levels to do that.”James Valentine, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the postal service was often overlooked as a competitive threat to UPS, despite it having the second-largest share of the domestic ground parcel market. UPS commands more than 60 per cent of the $29bn market, followed by the postal service with 22 per cent and FedEx with 15 per cent.The postal service's parcel business had been declining for years but has entered a revival revived over recent months, with parcel volume up 13 per cent in 2004, compared to 1.1 per cent growth in UPS's comparable business.“The postal service has increased its management attention on its package operations over the past 2-3 years which has improved service,” wrote Mr Valentine, in a report.Competition from the postal service could be blunted next year, when it is expected to increase its parcel prices 5.4 per cent. But Mr Valentine said the rise was not much greater than UPS's typical annual rate hike.“The postal service is the low-price leader in many markets and so its improved service is putting pressure on UPS's pricing in those lanes in which it competes,” he said. , highlighting light-weight business-to-consumer shipments.UPS has become increasingly reliant on its fast-expanding international business to offset sluggish domestic sales. Meanwhile, it It has sought to revive US growth through a n aggressive push to win more business from small and medium-sized customers.The postal service generates $65bn in annual revenues, compared to UPS's $37bn and FedEx's $30bn but most of it comes from its monopoly mail service. About 10 per cent of sales come from the two areas in which it cometes with UPS and FedEx: priority mail and parcel deliveries."

FedEx and other logistics companies are considered economic bellwethers because of their central role in global trade.“We see continued improvement in the global economy. Trade is deepening and global trade is growing faster than [US] gross domestic product,” he said.First-quarter net profit increased by a modest 3 per cent to $339m, or $1.10 a share. However, those figures were depressed by a $79m one-off charge related to accounting changes.Excluding the charge, earnings per share would have been $1.25, better than the $1.17 consensus forecast among analysts polled by Thomson First Call.FedEx had missed Wall Street expectations in the fourth quarter. The improved results were driven by double-digit revenue growth in all three of the company’s main delivery businesses: express, ground and freight.Competition has been intensifying in the package delivery industry as UPS, the biggest operator, seeks to stem losses in its market share to FedEx, German-owned DHL and the United States Postal Service.But Mike Glenn, FedEx’s executive vice-president of market development, eased fears of a price war, saying that, although there were some cases of “aggressive” pricing, the market remained broadly firm.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the city of New Orleans and part of the US Gulf coast, had “no significant effect” on results.Total sales in the three months ended August 31 were $7.7bn, up 10 per cent.Full-year earnings guidance was lifted to $5.25-$5.50 a share, compared to the $5.28 consensus forecast by analysts.

474;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-09-02T19:51:36Z;Exel and Deutsche Post rush to make deal;;Top executives at Exel are set to meet their counterparts at Deutsche Post this weekend to try and hammer out the terms of a deal with the aim of launching a bid within the next two weeks.“Both sides are trying to get a deal done as fast as possible but nothing has yet been agreed,” one person close to the situation said.The push to accelerate talks between the UK logistics company, which has a market valuation of £3.44bn, and Europe’s biggest postal group came as investment bankers scrambled to try and interest counterbidders in a potential deal.Analysts considered UPS of the US to be the most likely candidate. UPS refused to rule itself out, saying: “We look for opportunities and evaluate options for UPS continually.” At the end of last year, UPS had $5bn (£2.7bn) of cash on its books. Its rival, FedEx, could also be interested once Deutsche Post reveals its offer.Some of Deutsche Post’s biggest shareholders have already expressed reservations about it overpaying for Exel, which has been the subject of takeover speculation since the beginning of the year. “The uncertainty is very high at the moment and we are highly sceptical of a deal at the current price,” a leading German shareholder said.Deutsche Post is cash-rich and low in debt but there are concerns as to how it would finance a deal. Fitch recently became the second credit rating agency, after Standard Poor’s, to place its rating on negative outlook. The German shareholder said it was worried that the group could raise the money by issuing new shares, for which Deutsche Post already has the authority, rather than making an all-cash bid.Deutsche Post also said it could convince its shareholders of the deal’s strategic rationale.Backed by a 44 per cent stake of KfW, the state-run bank, it expected little real opposition to materialise.A deal would make Deutsche Post the world’s leading logistics company. It would dominate the field of contract logistics, which enjoys much higher margins than its current focus on mail.Deutsche Post is being advised by Morgan Stanley. UBS and Merrill Lynch are advising Exel.
475;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-07-25T21:32:21Z;Teamsters lead exit from AFL-CIO;;Two of the largest US unions broke away from their national federation on Monday in a split that threatens to divide the labour movement but may lead to more aggressive recruitment of new members.The service employees union and the Teamsters, representing transport workers, disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO, blaming its leadership for failing to prevent a decline in influence that has reduced the share of unionised workers in the US to 12.5 per cent. They hope to form a rival body based on a rebel coalition that includes six other unions and covers some 40 per cent of the AFL-CIO’s 13m members.The movement’s worst power struggle since the 1930s has wide repercussions in Washington and corporate America, especially as the rebels want to spend less on political campaigns and more on recruitment.Senator Richard Durbin, anIllinois Democrat, urged the AFL’s quadrennial convention in Chicago to maintain its unity. “There are people in corporate boardrooms who are smiling today. They think we are weakened,” he said.Yet some in business predict the split will force all unions to be much more competitive in recruiting new members, especially in the healthcare, hospitality and service industries. “This is the best thing that’s happened to organised labour and the worst thing for employers since the AFL-CIO came together,” said Bill Adams, a lawyer who advises companies on keeping out unions. James Hoffa, Teamsters president, promised a more aggressive recruitment drive in companies such as Wal-Mart and FedEx that remain largely un-unionised.A splintered union movement also poses greater challenges to companies such as the carmakers and airlines, who are desperate to reach a compromise with their various unions over healthcare and pension disputes.The split poses perhaps the greatest threat to the Democratic party, which relies heavily on unions for support and election organising. AFL-CIO leaders regard the split as a power struggle rather than a split over ideology. “It’s far easier to tear down a union movement than to build one,” said John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president. “Working people cannot afford for unions to declare ‘It’s my way or the highway’ when workers are under the biggest assault in 80 years.”Rebels denied they would weaken the movement. “We are not trying to divide the labour movement, we are trying to rebuild it,” said Andy Stern, leader of the SEIU union.
476;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-07-24T22:49:46Z;UPS purchase will strengthen position in UK;;United Parcel Service is poised to make an acquisition in the UK, strengthening the US company's position in one of Europe's most fragmented package delivery markets.People familiar with UPS said the medium-sized deal could be announced as early as Monday, although they would not identify the UK company involved. UPS declined to comment.The planned acquisition is believed to be in the package delivery sector, ruling out Exel, the large UK logistics group linked with a takeover by UPS this year.The most likely candidates are all privately-owned companies, including ANC and Lynx Express.Business Post, the biggest UK-listed company in the domestic market, said it was not involved in any deal with UPS. The Birmingham-based company has an alliance with FedEx, the other large US package delivery group, making it an unlikely target for UPS.Other companies in the sector include Target Express, Tuffnells, Amtrack Express and Nightfreight.An acquisition would underline the ambition of UPS to increase its presence in Europe, where the Atlanta-based company is challenging the dominance of Germany's DHL and TNT of the Netherlands.UPS has become increasingly reliant on international revenues to offset slowing growth and increasing competition in the US.The possible deal would signal an increase in foreign control over the fragmented UK market, which is divided between international competitors such as DHL and TNT, and smaller domestic companies.Most of the domestic companies are controlled by private equity groups which invested more than $500m in the industry in a wave of deals in the 1990s.An acquisition could be the catalyst for the long-anticipated consolidation in the domestic market.UPS would not be the first foreign group to strike a deal in the UK market. Interlink Express and GeoPost are both controlled by La Poste, the French postal group, while Securicor Omega was bought by DHL, part of Deutsche Post. TNT also has a large express delivery operation in the UK.Initial City Link, another UK parcel delivery company, is owned by Rentokil Initial, the business services group.The takeover of a package delivery company would mark a renewed focus by UPS on its core business following several deals in other parts of the logistics sector.UPS has been seeking to expand beyond package delivery into supply chain services, fuelling speculation that it could bid for Exel, the logistics group. UPS is close to completing a $1.2bn takeover of Overnite Corporation, a US truck company, and last year bought Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, an international freight forwarder.

Exporters and energy-intensive companies such as airlines were among the hardest hit.Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock average finished 1.1 per cent weaker at 11414.28, led by Japan Airlines, which fell 2 per cent, and exporters such as electronics and media group Sony, which fell 1.3 per cent to Y3,830.In Europe, the losers were paced by technology stocks on fears a global slowdown would dent consumer spending. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 was, by per cent to 1,134.4 in early trade, with mobile phone makers Nokia and Ericsson among the worst hit – down 3.5 per cent to €13.88 and 3.1 per cent to SFr25.40 repectively.“The surge in oil prices is different to last year’s,” said Leo Doyle, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. “It is now expected to last. Eventually the effect on growth will unwind but we now estimate that the 0.6 per cent drag on eurozone GDP growth this year will not improve much for 2006.”Asian currencies also weakened on higher dollar demand for oil imports. Japanese yen, Korean won and Taiwanese dollar all fell against the US dollar.Growing fears that high energy prices will eat into corporate earnings as companies prepare to report second-quarter results, have left global equities struggling in past two trading sessions.FedEx, for example, the US delivery group that has been a leading beneficiary of booming global trade, broke its winning streak by warning that this quarter's earnings would be hit by jet fuel costs despite an automatic surcharge for customers.And the metals industry, which had been enjoying its best growth for years, is now squeezed between the high cost of energy-related inputs such as electricity and coal and slowing demand from leading customers.Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel producer, last week warned it may have to shut its aluminium plant in Voerde, Germany, because of high electricity costs. Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, warned of 6,500 jobs cuts and plant closures in Germany and the US because of a drop in its prices and higher energy costs.Energy prices have hit German business on two fronts by weighing on the already feeble domestic demand while eating away at companies' margins, especially in the large industrial sector.
478;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-06-26T21:48:54Z;Industry feels pinch from rising oil prices;;Energy prices appear to have reached a tipping point for many industrial users as the hectic pace of energy inflation outstrips the capacity of companies to pass on higher costs to consumers.US, European and Asian stock markets all fell last week as oil reached $60 per barrel and corporate leaders around the world issued a series of high-profile profit warnings.Shares in energy-intensive companies such as manufacturing and transport were hardest hit. Yet even those companies that have previously minimised the pain by passing on price increases to their customers are finding it harder to do so.FedEx, for example, the US delivery group that has been a leading beneficiary of booming global trade, broke its winning streak by warning that this quarter's earnings would be hit by jet fuel costs despite an automatic surcharge for customers.And the metals industry, enjoying its best growth for years, is squeezed between the high cost of energy-related inputs such as electricity and coal and slowing demand from leading customers.Complaints from US industry will have a particular urgency this week as Congress considers an energy bill that many claim should help ease pressure on oil, electricity and natural gas prices.John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, is leading the lobbying by arguing that current problems will get far worse if policymakers do not respond soon.Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical, is particularly concerned that high energy costs in the US are making its manufacturing industries permanently uncompetitive. “In the past two years, the chemical industry's natural gas costs, alone, have increased by over $10bn at a cost of $50bn in sales lost to foreign competition,” he said.“And, since the first natural gas spike in 2000, more than 100,000 jobs one-tenth of the US chemical industry workforce have disappeared.”But across the Pacific few rival Japanese companies are immune from energy problems either. Asahi Kasei, one of Japan's largest chemical manufacturers, warned its variable costs were increasing by Y3bn ($27.5m) for every Y1,000 per kl rise in the price of naphtha, an oil product.Despite this, it has no plans to reduce the capacity of its plants or move them to China perhaps because many of the same cost pressures exist across Asia.Few companies, wherever they are, can escape rising energy prices entirely, and most will eventually look to pass costs on. Vimal Shah, chief executive officer of Bidco, a Kenyan manufacturer of cooking oils and soaps, has seen its energy and transport costs rise 20 per cent.He says: “You cannot scale back, it's not only our company that is affected, everyone is affected across the board, so in terms of competitiveness we are not better or worse off. Ultimately, it's the consumer who pays, and the consumer is going to have to spend more money.”Additional reporting by Andrew England in Nairobi

480;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-06-24T20:42:54Z;Crude price keeps Wall Street in the red;;Jitters over the upward creep in oil prices kept US equities under pressure this week as crude hit the important, and largely psychological, $60 a barrel level.Modest gains earlier in the week, on the back of a succession of positive economic news, were thrown into reverse after oil hit the record high on Thursday afternoon, and dealers, many of whom had set up automatic trading triggers, rushed to offload stock.By the end of trade on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at its owest for nearly six weeks, having dropped 1.2 per cent to 10,297.84. The broader S&P 500 index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,191.54 while the technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.8 per cent to 2,053.27.Over the week, the Dow was 2.1 per cent lower, with the S&P losing 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq was also down1.3 per cent.Compounding the effect of higher oil prices was that of attractive offers elsewhere.“To paraphrase Marilyn Monroe, gentlemen prefer bonds,” said Bob Baur, managing director of trading and economics at Principal Global Investors. “There’s been good news this week for bonds with Treasuries up 8 ticks, yields down and inflation still not a problem.”As ever, oil producers gained the most from higher prices while energy-dependent companies, particularly airlines, took a kicking.The airline index was down 3.4 per cent at 47.24, while Delta Airlines was down 3.4 per cent at $3.72. Northwest dropped 3.4 per cent to $4.88.Boeing shares were hit on Monday after Air Canada announced it had cancelled an order for 32 aircraft worth $6bn. Boeing shares were down 2 per cent at $60.59.FedEx was prominent among companies blaming high energy costs for predicted lower profits, suffering a 7.8 per cent fall in its share price on Thursday on warnings that its profits would fall in the current quarter. On Friday it was down another 0.8 per cent at $80.10.Higher energy costs will also add to the bottom line of metal manufacturers, steelmakers in particular, which were hit on Friday by news that Morgan Stanley had cut its view on the sector. Steel Dynamics, one of the two companies it downgraded, was down 2.2 per cent to $25.70.Automakers also had an unhappy week. Ford announced late on Tuesday that it had reduced its profit outlook for the year. The share price fell 4.3 per cent on Wednesday and was down another 1.8 per cent on Friday at $10.21. Its main suppliers were also pulled down, particularly Visteon, which fell 4 per cent yesterday to $6.01.The oil majors did better, with Unocal becoming the focus of much attention after it became the subject of a $19.6bn unsolicited bid by the Chinese state oil producer CNOOC. On Thursday the US oil producer said it had received a waiver from merger partner Chevron that will allow it to talk to CNOOC. Unocal was up 0.2 per cent yesterday to $65.20, while CNOOC’s New York listed shares were also up 0.5 per cent at $54.90.For Mr Baur the market falls indicated a far from disastrous retreat but simply reflected a “natural slowdown” in the economy.“We have had a lot of good news that shows the US economy is resilient – consumer sentiment ticked up, household incomes are doing very well and oil prices keep trying to go down but worldwide demand for oil is still just too strong.“There will be a slowdown but it’s a natural and expected thing,” he said.Ebay had a mixed week after the share price was set back on Monday over concerns Google was targeting its PayPal system with an alternative online payment system. It received another 5 per cent hit on Thursday with the loss of one of its key technologists, rumoured to be heading for Froogle, Google’s shopping arm.Its shares made a modest recovery after the company announced a new system called ProStores, designed to keep its high-value traders within the Ebay fold by offering them Ebay technology that can be used on other sites. The stock was up down slightly yesterday at $34.37, while Google gained 2.6 per cent at $297.25.
481;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-06-23T20:27:05Z;Earnings and oil fears take toll on Wall St;;US stocks fell on Thursday as investors balked at another surge in oil prices, compounding the effect of weak earnings announced earlier in the day.Crude oil futures surged by nearly $2 to a record $60 a barrel, increasing concerns about falling corporate profits and consumer spending.The major airlines were particularly damaged, with the Amex Airline index falling 3.7 per cent to 48.7. Delta was the worst off, sinking 6.3 to $3.85.Logistics company, Covenant Transport, also blamed higher oil prices on a predicted fall in second-quarter earnings. Its shares fell 5.6 per cent to $12.22.By the close, the S&P 500 index was at 1,200.73, down 1.1 per while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6 per cent at 10,421.44. After earlier gains the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 per cent to 2,070.66.“The market was given a slap in the face when we hit $60,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co., who believed much of the selling may have been sparked by automate triggers set up by traders. “We have had that disconect with the market largely ignoring oil prices creeping up all week. However, when a market like that changes direction it is very hard to stop the momentum.”In economic news, better-than-expected jobless figures were released showing new applications for unemployment benefits had fallen to their lowest in two months. However, the news was balanced by a separate report that said home sales slipped in May.FedEx and ATI Technologies both fell in early trading before the oil surge.Despite announcing strong growth in its fourth quarter, FedEx’s share price sank 8.3 per cent $80.77 after it also revealed that high oil prices would eat into its profits in the current quarter.The chipmaker ATI fell 7.7 per cent to $11.80 after it reduced its guidance for the fourth quarter.The market also reacted to developments in the major oil companies after the Chinese state-run oil group CNOOC said it was confident its $18.5bn cash offer for Unocal would beat Chevron’s bid. Chevron shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $57.33 while Unocal was at $65.02, up 0.3 per cent. And CNOOC’s New York-listed shares were up 3.5 per cent at $55.15.In other deal news, shares in Ameritrade Holding climbed 2.1 per cent to $18.25 on Wednesday’s announcement that it would buy rival TD Waterhouse USA from Toronto-Dominion Bank.General Electric also lost ground after the conglomerate announced plans to streamline its operations, reorganising its 11 business units into six.After initial slight gains, shares were down 2.4 per cent at $34.66.Research in Motion, the company behind the BlackBerry device, fell 1 per cent to $77.60 after earlier gains following news that the US Patent Office struck down two patents held by NTP as part of a dispute between the companies.
482;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FedEx warns on fuel price fears;;Federal Express warned on Thursday that first-quarter earnings would be affected by high fuel prices and intense competition, after increasing net profits by 9 per cent in the fourth quarter.The cautious guidance appeared to signal a slowdown in the package delivery company's momentum, after several consecutive quarters as the industry's star performer.Michael Glenn, vice-president of market development, conceded that the industry was becoming more competitive but said pricing remained “rational”.United Parcel Service, which had been losing market share to FedEx, has fought back strongly from a weak 2004 and German-owned DHL is expanding in North America.James Valentine, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said FedEx's comments were confirmation that FedEx and UPS were “using price more aggressively”. But he dismissed fears that the market was descending into a price war.All of FedEx's business units grew solidly in the fourth quarter, generating net profits of $448m, or $1.46 a share, up from $412m, or $1.36, in the same period last year.But the results missed analysts' consensus expectation of $1.48.Shares in FedEx closed down more than 8 per cent on Thursday trading at $80.77. Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, said he was optimistic about this year and forecast a double-digit earnings increase driven by steady economic growth in the US and internationalmarkets.But the forecast of first-quarter earnings per share in the range of $1.10-$1.25 and $5.20-$5.45 for the full year were at the low end of analysts' expectations.Mr Smith said the focus this year would be on controlling costs, with fuel prices expected to remain high. He said the long-term outlook for the company remained bright as globalisation increased demand for international supply chain services.● A federal mediator ordered an indefinite recess in supervised talks between United Parcel Service and its 2,500 pilots after the two sides failed to resolve a 32-month-old contract dispute during a round of talks in Washington, UPS said on Thursday, Reuters reports from San Francisco.
483;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-05-16T20:03:11Z;Observer - US;;"Noted economist seeks positionAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is a master of analysing cold, hard jobs figures and spinning them into policy. But he is not always so clinical about employment issues.On Sunday, he had words of empathy for the graduates of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who had still not found jobs.Greenspan, who delivered the commencement address to the Wharton graduates, is remarkably sprightly at 79, as his busy schedule of public engagements bears witness.And he has long been an advocate of raising the age at which Social Security benefits kick in, hoping to encourage other Americans to keep working into their late 60s, if not their 70s. Still, the law requires Greenspan to step down from the Fed early next year, when his term as a board member expires. Greenspan has no intention of slowing down, however. He used his weekend address to let it be known he will soon be available for hire.""I have more in common with you graduates than people might think,"" he told Wharton's newly minted MBAs. ""After all, before long, after my term at the Federal Reserve comes to an end, I too will be looking for a job.""Security holesCrucial bits of information do not always make its way to Greenspan as quickly as they should.When a light aircraft accidentally penetrated the no-fly zone above Washington last week, lawmakers and officials were evacuated from the White House and Capitol to be rushed to more secure locations. But Greenspan was apparently oblivious to the danger.Fred Smith, chairman of FedEx, was among a group of businessmen meeting the Fed chairman while the alert was under way. ""We were the only people in Washington who did not know we might be under attack,"" he says.Smith knows a bit about security as a former Marine and chairman of the Business Roundtable's Security Taskforce, which liaises with the government on anti-terrorism measures. Smith praises US customs authorities for having increased security without impeding trade since 9/11. He is less complimentary about the Transport Security Administration, which oversees airports.""Customs have done a good job focusing on where there is risk, in contrast to the TSA, which has squandered its resources patting down people like my 86-year-old mother before she gets on an airline,"" he says. ""I can tell you, my mother is not a threat.""Cult non-fictionObserver can't fault the Bush administration on its highbrow bedtime reading.

484;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;UPS agrees to buy Overnite for $1.25bn;;United Parcel Service on Monday agreed to acquire Overnite Corporation, a US trucking company, for $1.25bn in cash, further diversifying the group beyond its traditional parcel delivery business.The deal fills a strategic gap for UPS, which had been largely absent from the domestic ground transportation sector.FedEx, the other large US parcel delivery company, has had a fast-growing trucking business for the past few years putting UPS under pressure to enter the market.“Overnite is a perfect strategic fit for our company,” said Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive. “We want to offer our customers the broadest portfolio of transportation and logistics services available from a single source and this is an important capability that we needed to have.”The deal accelerates consolidation of the US trucking sector, less than three months after Yellow Roadway agreed to buy its rival USF for $1.37bn.Virginia-based Overnite is one of the biggest operators in the less-than-truckload (LTL) market, carrying smaller quantities of freight over shorter distances than the long-haul truckload (TL) operators.FedEx has become one of the most powerful companies in the LTL segment after Yellow Roadway, allowing it to deliver everything from small packages to heavy freight for its customers.The addition of a ground freight capability in the US appeared to complement UPS's acquisition last year of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, an international air freight operator.Both UPS and FedEx are seeking to build global transportation and logistics networks to service the increasingly complicated and lengthy supply chains of their corporate customers.There had been persistent speculation that UPS was looking to use some of its free cash flow, which stood at $3.5bn at the end of last year, on a large acquisition.The all-cash deal valued Overnite at $43.25 a share, a 46 per cent premium to Friday's closing price of $29.58. The shares soared 44 per cent to close at $42.52 on Monday, while shares in UPS closed up 1.43 per cent at $73.18.UPS said it expected the deal, which was unanimously approved by Overnite's board, to be closed during the third quarter of this year. Overnite reported net income of $63.3m in 2004 on revenue of $1.65bn. The carrier serves more than 60,000 customers in both the LTL and TL segments with operations in all 50 US states, Canada and Mexico.Bear Stearns advised UPS. Morgan Stanley advised Overnite.
485;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-05-12T20:20:25Z;Wall St lower as falling oil hits energy sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after energy companies were hit by the falling price of oil, which dropped back below the $49 a barrel mark. Investors were also grappling with disappointing results from Wal-Mart and a report showing a bigger-than-expected gain in sales across the retail sector last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,189.04, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,159.27, and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,159.27.The price of a barrel of crude oil fell $1.91 in New York, dragging shares in the energy sector down with it. Exxon Mobil, the biggest US oil producer, fell 4.3 per cent to $54.82. Marathon Oil, a rival, fell 5.1 per cent to $46.02. National Oilwell Varco, the bigggest US maker of oilfield equipment, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.63.An official report said that retail sales rose 1.4 per cent last month. The gain was twice what most economists had expected, but the country’s biggest retailer failed to get a boost from the news.Wal-Mart shares fell 2 per cent to $47.65 after the retailer said second-quarter results would probably miss forecasts. The company also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profits. Wal-Mart said unusually cold spring weather and high oil prices were partly to blame for tepid sales.Target, Wal-Mart’s chief US rival, rose 1.2 per cent after it reported higher earnings. The Minnesota-based group reported earnings of 55 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates.An undertow of economic uncertainty continued on Thursday after data showing a shrinking trade deficit pushed the leading indices modestly higher on Wednesday.Jitters over the potential impacts on hedge funds of last week’s unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of General Motors and Ford, the struggling US automakers, led stocks to fall sharply on Tuesday. On Thursday, a report showed that the number of people filing for initial unemployment benefits rose last week.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the lack of direction in the stock market was surprising given the generally upbeat tone of economic and corporate news this earnings season. “This is still a market that is looking for what can go wrong rather than what’s going to go right,” he said.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, rose 0.3 per cent to $26.75 after it reported profits up 30 per cent for the quarter, driven by strong DVD sales.Shares in UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, edged 1 per cent to $1.00 a day after the company reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss. A court earlier this week ruled that the government should assume billions of dollars worth of pensions liabilities from the struggling commercial carrier. United said the move was necessary to avert bankruptcy.FedEx, the express shipper, slipped 2.6 per cent after it reaffirmed its second-quarter guidance. The company said that it expected earnings of between $1.40 and $1.50 a share.Ford Motor, the second-biggest US carmaker, fell 3 per cent to $9.35 after it suspended sales of unsecured short-term loans. Losses sharpened after Moody’s, the ratings agency, cut the company’s debt ratings to just above junk. General Motors, Ford’s bigger rival, fell 1.2 per cent to $30.62.Shares in US airlines were mixed. Delta Air Lines rose 1.1 per cent while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.8 per cent. Investors were keeping a close eye on developments at United, the bankrupt US carrier. A court earlier this week relieved United’s parent, UAL, of billions of dollars in pension obligations.
486;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-03-17T14:32:16Z;FedEx profits up but warns on margins;;"FedEx, the world's second-largest package delivery company, increased its third quarter net earnings by a better-than-expected 53 per cent but warned that high oil prices would erode profits in the fourth quarter.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said this year's renewed increase in fuel prices was having a ""significant impact"" on margins.US light crude on Thursday rose above $57 a barrel for the first time, amid strong global demand and tight supply.However, Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, said he remained confident about prospects for the company and the world economy.""We have solid momentum in the business and customer demand is strong,"" he said. ""Economic conditions remain favourable, and we are optimistic about future growth.""FedEx has been winning a share of US ground deliveries from United Parcel Service, the market leader, while also enjoying rapid growth in international express traffic as global trade increases, especially between Asia and North America.Mr Smith said FedEx had enjoyed an ""extraordinary"" peak shipping season, in contrast to the weak Christmas period encountered by UPS.All three of FedEx's main businesses - air express, ground and freight - registered double digit percentage increases in revenues and operating profits, underlining its status as the best-performing of the big package delivery companies.However, FedEx said pricing in the domestic express and ground markets was becoming more competitive, suggesting that UPS was fighting back, while DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post, continues to expand in the US.Net profits were $317m, or $1.03 a share, compared with $207m, or 68 cents a share, last year. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected 98 cents.However, Mr Graf said fourth quarter profits would be at the lower end of analysts' expectations, forecasting earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, compared to the Wall Street consensus of $1.49.Jon Langenfeld, analyst at Baird Research, said strong growth in international express and domestic ground sales was expected but the 6 per cent volume increase in domestic express - FedEx's most mature business - was a ""positive surprise"".Mr Graf said FedEx would invest $2.3bn in the 2005 fiscal year. The company has been ordering more long-range aircraft, including up to 20 Airbus A380 superjumbos, to cope with surging global trade between Asia, North America and Europe.It has also been expanding its facilities in China, as it vies with UPS and DHL for leadership in the world's most populous country."
487;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-03-08T17:56:49Z;The battle for parcel supremacy;;"Whenever David Abney looks up from his desk on the executive floor of United Parcel Service's headquarters in Atlanta, he sees a large map of China mounted on the wall. ""I have it right in my line of sight,"" he says. ""It reminds me and visitors to my office of the size of the place and the opportunity it provides for us.""As president of the package delivery company's international business, Mr Abney is quick to stress that Europe, South America and the rest of Asia are also important markets. But the fact that only China is granted its own map shows where his priorities lie.""China is the largest and most exciting opportunity in the 30 years I've been with UPS,"" he says. ""It's not a case of 'should we' or 'can we'. If you're going to be a global company in future you absolutely have to be a player in China.""Over the past few months, UPS has committed an additional $600m of investment in China as it vies with rivals FedEx, DHL and TNT for leadership of the market. The increased spending will expand the company's distribution network and secure full control of its express delivery joint-venture in the country.China is becoming an increasingly important source of growth to UPS as the US market slows. The company's export volume out of China more than doubled last year, compared with a 23 per cent increase in the whole international business and 6.6 per cent in the US.""In the past, UPS has relied on its domestic package business to drive growth,"" says Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting, a transport consultancy. ""But last year's weak performance in the US showed it must focus more on international business - especially in China.""UPS is expanding in the country on two fronts. The first is its traditional package business, shuttling small parcels between China and the rest of the world. The second is supply chain services, handling the export of larger-scale cargo from Chinese manufacturers to overseas markets.Last December, UPS agreed to pay Sinotrans, its Chinese partner, $100m to take full control of their express delivery joint venture when Beijing relaxes foreign ownership rules at the end of this year. The deal will make UPS the first foreign company in the sector to wholly-own its Chinese operation. ""Having full control will give us more flexibility in making investments and long-term strategic decisions and will give our brand a stronger presence,"" says Mr Abney.Meanwhile, the supply chain management business announced plans last month to increase its number of Chinese warehouses from 40 to 60 within two years. The facilities distribute goods such as textiles, technology and auto parts for import and export.However, Kurt Kuehn, UPS's senior vice-president of sales and marketing, says building a network inside China is only half the challenge. Just as important is connecting it to the rest of the world. ""Anyone can build a warehouse in China,"" he says. ""But it's useless unless you can get the goods to market in North America and Europe.""UPS believes it offers a more comprehensive global service to Chinese customers than any of its rivals. FedEx lacks the international freight-handling capability that UPS secured through its acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding last year, while DHL and TNT are relatively weak in North America. ""We have the best network in the US and a powerful presence in Europe, so we can connect China to the rest of the world better than our more regionally-focused competitors,"" says Mr Kuehn.DHL and FedEx, however, both have important advantages over UPS. DHL, owned by Deutsche Post, was the first foreign package delivery company to enter China in 1986 when it formed its own joint-venture with Sinotrans.While UPS and FedEx are limited to international deliveries in and out of China, DHL is the only one allowed to make domestic shipments. This will soon change as World Trade Organisation rules force Beijing to liberalise but DHL's 37 per cent share of the local market will be difficult to catch. FedEx, meanwhile, has had the best air access to China since its acquisition of Flying Tigers, an international cargo airline, in 1989. The company will this month increase its number of weekly flights to the country to 23, compared with UPS's 18. Both companies were recently awarded an additional six landing slots in China with the promise of a further three each next year, following an aviation agreement between Beijing and Washington. ""We fly into three different Chinese cities: Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai,"" says David Cunningham, FedEx's senior vice-president for Asia- Pacific. ""Nobody else does that."" In addition to its direct flights between the US and China, FedEx connects China to the rest of Asia through its Subic Bay hub in the Philippines and this month launched a service from Shanghai to Frankfurt - the first direct cargo service between China and Europe.The battle for dominance in China is part of a global parcel war raging between the package delivery giants, with DHL challenging UPS and FedEx in North America, while the US pair take on DHL and TNT in Europe.But the companies understand that they cannot win their battles elsewhere in the world without a strong presence in China.A CORPORATE CULTURE TO DIGESTOne day in January this year, a Chinese delegation visited the Atlanta headquarters of United Parcel Service to negotiate a business deal over a lavish Chinese meal.The meeting was a disaster as UPS executives committed a series of cultural gaffes that risked causing grave offence to their guests.Blunders included using first names instead of the formal titles favoured by Chinese businessmen and handing out clocks as gifts - a symbol of impending death in China.Fortunately for UPS, the meeting was a role-playing exercise designed to familiarise its executives with Chinese business culture.About 100 company officials attended the etiquette lesson, organised by Chinese-born Shiao Dong Han, UPS’s director for international retail services.Participants learned about the importance of building personal relationships with their Chinese counterparts before getting down to business. They were also advised to always leave a little food uneaten when dining in China because a clean plate implies hunger.Despite the executives’ disastrous performance, Mr Han said UPS’s corporate culture was well-suited to business in China because the company puts a premium on hard work and loyalty - qualities that are valued by the Chinese."
488;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-02-14T07:44:08Z;Rob Carter of FedEx;;Doing more faster and betterA self-proclaimed geek and technologist, Rob Carter enthuses that he has the ideal job. Being the executive vice-president and chief information officer of FedEx, responsible for the global IT and logistics management in 215 countries and 365 airports around the globe, poses “interesting” challenges in his efforts to roll out a seamless, global logistics network.Adding in a vehicle fleet of more than 43,000 worldwide and more than 138,000 employees makes life even more interesting.Thinking globally is obviously the big picture, but on the ground Mr Carter knows that the idiosyncrasies of countries, customs authorities and even individuals need to be taken into account when setting up an express logistics system.“There is always a two-way set up to communication. I want to deliver a message about the strategy and the initiatives we have underway worldwide that make sure that technology framework is cohesive around the globe. It’s very important even though we give the teams some autonomy to meet the local market needs and to deliver technology that makes sense,” he says.What works well in Europe or the US might not have the same resonance in parts of Asia or Africa so Mr Carter deploys some flexibility, without losing sight of the FedEx goals. “We have strategies that we deploy on a global basis to make sure that investments are sound and work well together and follow appropriate standards and architecture. That message is clear, but we welcome a lot of feedback about how that’s helping them and about opportunities to improve it.” By nature, global logistics has to be an IT-based industry. This is obviously Mr Carter’s favourite part of his job. “We’re always rolling out projects, we have a very broad array of technology because every part of the business is dependent on IT, whether it’s the sorting systems in the hub, or for the tracking systems that our customers utilise or the automation that integrates all this with their supply chain. There is always a lot of interesting work going on – globalisation of shipping capabilities for customers, customs clearance, duties and tax applications, automation capabilities, the list goes on and it can be very complex to do all this on a global scale,” he says.Stripping it down to basics, Mr Carter says the essence of customs clearance is to provide detailed and accurate information about the products that are arriving or being shipped. “Our advantage is that we do all of that electronically, including all the documentation and all the forms, so it arrives prior to the arrival of the aircraft and the physical goods. And we install the technology for customs authorities around the world. We give them the ability to look at the inbound manifest of shipments. Ultimately, there are specific business rules and regulatory rules that apply and that is where IT can be applied flexibly in different markets and in different settings, as opposed to tangling all of that up in a code base.”Once the detailed data is nailed down and documented, Mr Carter appears more relaxed about the cultural habits of different authorities around the globe. “The local teams have access to the layers of information they need for their marketplace,” he says.He says that this ostensibly flexible process is actually quite complex, requiring a lot of investment and work behind the scenes to gives customers a “seamless” clearance through customs, plus visibility in the process of shipment/customs procedures through to receipt.This requires a lot of IT to make it happen. The majority of FedEx facilities are WiFi enabled, providing 7,000 hotspots across the world. Particularly in the US, customers can walk in with a laptop, go on line and conduct a transaction or track a shipment. “For business operations, we’re creating seamless applications to hand-held computers, laptops and desktops through broadband or high performance capabilities of a local area networks (Lans). Data is available through wireless Lans, cellular or GPRS networks and 3G,” says Mr Carter.He says that the most challenging aspect of his job is to link the diverse business and global aspects of the company and to present a seamless front to the customer. “FedEx Corporation is not just an overnight delivery company. It is a $27bn corporation that includes entities such as FedEx Kinkos to deliver digital and physical documents services and business services. Then there is FedEx Ground in North America, and FedEx Freight. The technologies across all these serve diverse needs, they’re not the same and yet from an architecture and alignment and investment standpoint they have to fit together.” In order to achieve this, FedEx has a large team of developers and IT personnel. “We’re a very self-sufficient IT shop. We believe IT is strategic enabler for the business so we build a lot of our own technology. Most all of the business functionality that supports our direct operations are applications that we build,” he says.FedEx also runs all its IT operations with a staff of around 6,500 IT people worldwide, half of which are support personnel running the data centres network. “We also have a group of people that many companies don’t have – our customer technology support personnel. We have millions of customers utilising FedEx technology on their premises, so we have support personnel that integrate FedEx technology and train our customers how to use it effectively,” explains Mr Carter.Mr Carter does not believe that IT strategies “flash on to a screen for a year”. His drive is to maintain high standards of cost effectiveness, speed, innovation, service levels and business alignment across the corporation and across the globe. “We can feel the results, FedEx has a world class IT team for a world class company but there are always things we can do better.”
489;FDX;Fedex Corp;2005-01-27T15:12:00Z;UPS predicts ‘solid’ growth in 2005;;"UPS on Thursday insisted its weak performance in the last three months of 2004 was an isolated blip and forecast ""solid"" growth this year, driven by surging international business, particularly in China.However, guidance for first quarter earnings was at the lower end of analysts' expectations, deepening concern that the world's largest package delivery company could be losing ground to rivals FedEx and DHL.UPS pledged to reduce annual costs by $200m and launch an initiative to win more business from mid-sized US firms in response to its disappointing end to last year.The company warned two weeks ago that its fourth quarter earnings would fall below expectations because of reduced growth in domestic ground deliveries.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, on Thursday blamed the slowdown on poor planning and bad weather, dismissing the notion that FedEx and DHL were stealing significant market share.""Although it was a challenging quarter it was just that: one quarter,"" he said.Mr Davis said UPS was interested in making further acquisitions in the logistics and freight-forwarding sectors as it seeks to diversify into a broader range of supply chain services.The comments fuelled market rumours that UPS is considering a bid for Exel, the UK-based logistics group.Mr Davis said that despite the domestic slowdown the fourth quarter had been the most profitable in the company's history, with net earnings up 1.2 per cent at $866m, or 76 cents a share. Revenues rose 10.2 per cent to $9.8bn.Over the full-year, net profits increased 15 per cent to $3.3bn, while revenue climbed 9.2 per cent to $36.6bn.International package revenue grew almost 23 per cent in the fourth quarter, with export volume out of China more than doubling.Mr Davis expected the international business's ""exceptional"" performance to continue this year, helping earnings per share grow by an expected 13-17 per cent from the $2.90 achieved in 2004.First quarter earnings per share were projected to be 70-75 cents, compared to the average 75 cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson First Call.""In 2004, we grew our ground business, we grew our air business, we grew our international business and we delivered more packages than ever before,"" said Mr Davis."
490;FDX;Fedex Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Pharmaceuticals were also in the spotlight after a new study raised fresh questions about painkiller safety.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 10,759.43 - a 3½-year high - while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,205.45. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year. FedEx, the biggest express shipper, rose 0.4 per cent to $100.53, while rival UPS climbed 1 per cent to $86.48.Railroad shares rallied as Union Pacific, the country's biggest independent rail operator, raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Union Pacific shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $65.67. Shares in Norfolk Southern, the third-biggest rail operator by market capitalisation, were up 3 per cent at $36.21, while CSX, the rail freight group, rose 2 per cent to $39.82.Railroads have seen record shipping volumes this year, driven by a booming harvest in the midwest and soaring demand for US exports.Semiconductor stocks jumped as investors welcomed a report from Gartner saying that worldwide chipmaker revenue should grow by 23 per cent this year in spite of a slowdown in growth in the second half. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7 per cent to 422.48. Intel, the world's biggest microchip company, received an additional boost following a Lehman Brothers upgrade. Intel's shares rose 3.5 per cent to $23.49. Intel's chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 0.5 per cent to $21.73.Pharmaceutical stocks remained in the spotlight after clinical studies raised new questions about the safety of two popular painkillers. Pfizer rebounded after falling more than 16 per cent following Friday's news that its Celebrex arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in patients. Shares in the drugs group rose 2.8 per cent to $24.97 after US health regulators said that Alzheimer's patients taking Celebrex in a separate study did not show elevated cardiac risk. Merck, whose withdrawn Vioxx painkiller uses an active ingredient similar to the one in Celebrex, rose 1.5 per cent to $31.98.The US-listed shares of Bayer, the German drugs group, rose 0.5 per cent in spite of warnings that Naproxen, the active ingredient in Bayer's Aleve painkiller, had increased the risk of heart attacks in the same Alzheimer's trials.Elsewhere, IAC InterActivecorp, the media and travel group run by Barry Diller, jumped 5.9 per cent to $27.41 after it said it would spin off its Expedia online travel service.Investors were also focused on financial stocks on Tuesday after earnings reports by two big US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, the biggest US investment bank by volume, rose 1.6 per cent to $54.50 as earnings beat expectations. Bear Stearns gave up early gains to fall 1.7 per cent to $102.70 after it reported sharply higher quarterly profits.Energy stocks were the laggards among the S&P 500, with Sunoco shares down 0.1 per cent to $82.88. John Herrlin, vice president at Merrill Lynch, said petroleum prices were likely to remain volatile in the short term."
492;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-11-12T13:45:43Z;FedEx ordered to repay $29m to US government;;FedEx Corporation’s express air shipping unit has been ordered by the US government to repay $29m in excess funds received under an act established after the September 11 2001 attacks, the company said on Friday.FedEx, which said it will contest the demand, will take a charge of $48m in its fiscal second quarter. That covers the $29m the government claims is owed back to the US Department of Transportation plus the write-off of $19m it had not yet received under its initial award of $119m granted about three years ago as part of the act.FedEx, which reaffirmed its second-quarter financial outlook, received the money under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which provided financial relief to US air carriers hurt by the September 11 attacks.The transportation department determined FedEx, the world’s largest air express shipper, is entitled to $72m of compensation under the act. The company had previously received $101 million.The collection of the entire $119m that was recorded in fiscal 2002 is no longer probable, FedEx said.The company said it still expects second-quarter earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. Analysts expect FedEx to earn $1.16 a share in that quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.
493;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-11-08T16:22:48Z;DHL buys controlling stake in India?s Blue Dart;;"DHL, the international logistics group, has acquired a majority stake in India's largest domestic courier company, only days after its troubled expansion in the US caused it to shake up senior management.DHL, a subsidiary of Deutsche Post, will buy 68 per cent in Blue Dart by picking up a 51 per cent stake from its three founding directors for Rs4.2bn and a 17 per cent stake from Schroders Capital, a private equity fund, for Rs1.2bn. DHL will follow with a mandatory open offer for an additional 20 per cent of Blue Dart's equity.The deal comes after Deutsche Post reshuffled its management board at the weekend with the head of DHL in the US, Asia and emerging markets being replaced.Analysts said Uwe D?rken's departure - to be replaced by John Mullen, head of DHL in Asia Pacific - could be seen as Deutsche Post trying to blame somebody for its disappointing performance in the US. The German group said earlier this year that mounting losses at DHL Express Americas meant the unit would not break even until 2006, a year later than planned.""It's a very Anglo-Saxon approach and very radical,"" said Menno Sanderse, analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""It shows they are determined.""Under the all cash deal announced on Monday, DHL will pay Rs350 for each share of Blue Dart. Blue Dart's share price rose to an intra-day high of Rs331 on the Bombay stock exchange on Monday before easing back.Market observers described DHL's valuation as generous, reflecting its desire to pay a strategic premium to prevent FedEx and UPS - which both have a presence in India's Rs15bn courier-services market - from trying to bid.The deal gives DHL a dominant share in the Indian sub-continent's premium domestic and international door-to-door delivery segment. Blue Dart has a 40 per cent share of the market, which is growing by a third annually, according to bankers involved in the transaction.Mr Sanderse said: ""DHL Asia-Pacific is very profitable so maybe it's not bad to have exposure to an operator that is only domestic…But a more cautious view would be that they have to sort out the problems in the US first.""Blue Dart and DHL already co-operate on some express and logistics services in India. People familiar with the transaction say, however, that DHL is expected to allow Blue Dart to continue running autonomously."
494;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-09-22T20:40:48Z;Oil and bank results drag down Wall Street;;"Wall Street bulls slipped on an oil slick on Wednesday and they got kicked on the way down when crude rose past $48 while a gloomy earnings report from Morgan Stanley and an accounting probe at Fannie Mae added insult to injury.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 1.4 per cent lower at 1,113.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent weaker at 10,109.18, while the Nasdaq Composite index was down 1.9 per cent at 1,885.71.Mike O'Hare, head of listed trading at Lehman Brothers, noted that volume was very light and admitted the sharp sell-off took him by surprise. ""There's a lot of complacency in sentiment, there's no volume …I wouldn't have predicted this loss yesterday when the Fed cleared the air.""Bullish expectations of a fourth-quarter rally had pushed stocks higher in the face of recent third-quarter earnings warnings.But Mark Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ""There is only so much looking forward to the fourth-quarter you can do before you need to handle the reality in front of you.""Crude oil futures rose sharply after US government data showed a decline in stockpiles that was almost twice as big as expected, due to the effects of Hurricane Ivan in the southern US.High energy prices were seen by the Federal Reserve as a reason for the economy's recent slowing growth. The US central bank reiterated that view on Tuesday in an otherwise unchanged assessment of the economy as it raised benchmark interest rates.However, the Fed has previously described the rise in energy prices as a temporary phenomenon. Both markets and the Fed are now facing an energy price spike that is less temporary than previously thought.This keeps alive concerns about profitability in corporate America in the face of high fuel costs, after some companies raised the issue with analysts.Mr Pado said: ""We knew the oil number was going to be bad, and it was at the high end of the range for inventories declines …and we're starting to see earnings warnings from a broad range of sectors, even defensives ones.""In addition, rising heating oil prices ahead of the winter months are likely to compound worries about consumer spending, which has shown signs of fatigue in line with the higher costs of running cars in the summer time.Mr O'Hare said there was evidence of money shifting away from consumer stocks and from equities into bonds, where benchmark yields fell below 4 per cent.""There this theme of the incremental dollar that's not in the consumer's pocket anymore,"" Mr O'Hare said.Among consumer stocks, Kraft Foods eased 1.9 per cent to $31.4 while Procter and Gamble was 1.1 per cent off at $54.30 Quarterly results from another two prominent Wall Street banks did nothing to allay concerns about the outlook for the markets.Morgan Stanley shares fell 7per cent to $48.72er it said quarterly revenue fell 34 per cent due to languid trading this summer.And Bear Stearns shares gave up 2.4 per cent to $87.95 after the bank's results beat estimates but investors appeared to focus more on falling profits.Shares in Citigroup, the world's largest financial services group, gave up 2.8 per cent to $44.38 are down about 5.5 per cent this week after Japanese regulators banned it from taking part in its government bond auctions until Citi improves its compliance policies. The move comes a week after it was ordered to shut down its private bank in Japan.Meanwhile Fannie Mae shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.56 after federal regulators said the mortgage company used improper accounting to manage earnings.FedEx shares followed the broad market lower, sliding 3.9 per cent to $85.21 even after the shipping group said earnings had more than doubled in the previous quarter and gave a sanguine reading of the global economy.Adding to the gloom was Interstate Bakeries, which filed for bankruptcy protection. Shares fell 37.3 per cent to $2.05 as the maker of the iconic Twinkies cakes battled $1.3bn in debt and high costs amid low demand for baked goods due to the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets.Technology stocks retreated broadly, led by Cisco Systems, whose stock was downgraded by Deutsche Bank analysts due to the uncertain outlook for its business in North America. Its shares gave up 3.4 per cent to $18.98.Lucent Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $3.31 after it said it would cut retirement benefits, highlighting its need to control costs."
495;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-08-24T06:22:59Z;FedEx raises full-year earnings target;;Federal Express delivered fresh evidence of growth in international trade and the resilience of the US recovery on Monday as it upgraded profit forecasts for the second time in two months.Bucking recent economic pessimism, the distribution company is handling higher-than-expected volumes of packages thanks mainly to China?s spreading impact on global supply chains and rising demand for home deliveries in the US.FedEx?s upbeat message contrasted with disappointing weekly sales data from Wal-Mart, the world?s largest retailer, which warned hurricanes in Florida could help wipe out any growth for the month of August.US retailers have provided mixed signals about consumer confidence, with weakening sales in June and July followed by upbeat outlooks for the year from Wal-Mart, Lowe?s, Target and Home Depot.While retailers worry about the sustainability of spending growth, FedEx sees strong demand for its ground delivery services, driven by the growing acceptance of online shopping as an alternative. Comscore, an independent market researcher, estimates online retail sales in the US are now climbing at 22 per cent a year.FedEx also believes the impact of China?s economic boom is spreading beyond Asia, causing increasing demand for express cargo deliveries in both Europe and the US.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said: ?While there are potential risks on the horizon, such as prolonged high oil costs that could impact the worldwide economy, we believe we will continue to see strong demand which will result in higher earnings.?With its 5.5m daily shipments and a pivotal role in international trade, FedEx - and other express carriers - can be a useful bellwether for economic trends, particularly as fresh volume data is analysed from its distribution hubs each night. United Parcel Service also reported strong growth from US ground deliveries in its most recent quarterly earnings statement.Mr Graf pointed to growth in FedEx?s international express, ground and less-than-truckload businesses as the main reason for lifting group profits forecasts for 2005 from between $4.20 and $4.40 per share to a range of $4.40 to $4.60. FedEx last raised its profit forecasts in June after announcing stronger-than-expected results for its fourth quarter.It also now expects to increase capital spending for the year ending May 2005 from about $1.6bn to between $2bn and $2.1bn. This month, the company invested $120m in the acquisition of a parcel consolidator, to take advantage of growth in online retailing.
496;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-08-19T17:47:15Z;Move out of range to think out of the box;;"An invitation to attend the annual summer meeting of Geopost, a France-based transport and logistics company, was sent to the top 40 executives along with some mischievous advice: bring an extra-warm sweater.Claude Béglé, Geopost's chief executive, had already begun to spread rumours that Copenhagen was not the real location. He had even encouraged loose talk of bear-hunting in Siberia.But no one suspected the truth: that the 40 managers would soon find themselves aboard a small boat in the Arctic Circle, in almost perpetual daylight, and with no means of contacting the outside world apart from the ship's radio.It sounds like a wildly eccentric way of running a company, but Mr Béglé believes he was not just being whimsical. At the time, Geopost badly needed to make some decisions about the group's structure, and to bring together what had become a diverse assortment of companies.Geopost is a recent invention, created in 1999 by La Poste, the French postal service. It has grown rapidly by acquisition, and in 2003 its revenues were €2.3bn £1.6bn, making it the third largest parcel company in Europe. At the time of the Arctic escapade, it comprised companies from France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK, all operating under their own brand names. But why were managers taking decisions about the group's structure in the Arctic Ocean rather than at the smart Hyatt hotel in Copenhagen?The short answer seems to be that it was the only way to compel the managers to work on relationships with one another, rather than playing politics and keeping in touch with their company headquarters back home. The Arctic Ocean is now one of the few places in the world where you can be sure no one can get a mobile phone signal.Mr Béglé wanted to make certain that the decisions they made were not based on office politics, but on the interests of the group as a whole. To do that, he says, he was prepared to be unconventional. “You cannot sleep because it is always light, you cannot get out of the boat, and you have an open bar. So what happens? You get drunk, you fight, you hate each other, you reconcile, you fight again, you discuss business. Four days later, we had a structure. That's maybe not in the management books, but it works.”It is not in the management books. The standard approach to integrating acquisitions is to look for synergies and economies of scale, to establish common brands and to standardise. That is the approach taken by the big players in the parcels and logistics industry - FedEx and UPS, the two US giants.FedEx recently re-branded all the companies it owns to make customers aware of the breadth of its services. Its most recent acquisition (for $2.4bn, £1.3bn) was Kinko's, the print services chain. It, too, has been re-branded, and is now FedEx Kinko's. None of this seems to have hurt: FedEx's revenue grew by 10 per cent last year to $24.7bn, and net income rose by 29 per cent.Whether Geopost's model - autonomy supported by a common culture - will succeed is still unclear. Revenue grew by 5.3 per cent this year, to €2.26bn, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up to €82.4m - including all the money spent on acquisitions.But the comparison is perhaps unfair: the two companies are at different points in their life cycles. FedEx has decades worth of brand recognition, whereas Geopost currently uses its brand only in the UK. To extend a very well-known brand to take in lesser-known brands makes sense; to replace many well-known local brands with a single unknown one sounds like folly.Mr Béglé believes that allowing acquired companies to keep their brands and identities helps Geopost retain its managers. “If you buy a company and you are too ruthless in the way you integrate it, you may lose up to half of your valuable managers, which means you lose a solid part of the enterprise value you just paid for.”They appear to have succeeded in this respect: no manager left when Parceline and Interlink in the UK or DPD, the German parcel service, were acquired.Even when there are obvious savings on offer, Mr Béglé prefers not to sacrifice the principle of independence for each company. A consultancy that offered him standardised weighing technology for the group, with a breakdown of the savings, was given a list of names to call in each company and told that each would make its own decision.But to balance this system of local autonomy, Geopost needs to promote a common culture to unite its constituent parts. It is for this reason, says the group, that it puts so much stress on its team-building activities and makes them such exotic affairs - and it shows no signs of curbing its taste for them.The Arctic excursion took place last year. In June this year, 300 of its managers met in the Sahara, to mark Geopost's southward expansion into Turkey and Tunisia. Senior managers followed this with a cruise down the Yangtze river - they are, after all, in negotiations to enter the Chinese market.Mr Béglé remarks: “Geopost has an interesting management style, which is a little bit the opposite of the others. We believe in a very decentralised management structure but with a strong corporate culture, which is the unifying element. To promote that culture, we do a lot of things - sometimes crazy things.”"
497;FDX;Fedex Corp;2004-08-08T17:40:48Z;Midnight in Memphis, new dawn in China;;High over the Pacific Ocean, flight FX 24 from Shanghai to Memphis is one of the most closely monitored aircraft entering US airspace. Every night the Federal Express cargo jet is packed with 77 tonnes of digital cameras, mobile phones and other high-value electronics that make it the company's single largest source of revenue and a significant contributor to America's ballooning trade deficit.Until recently the top priority route for FedEx was its daily flight from Tokyo, which carries express packages from all over Asia. But as with most big US companies, FedEx's attention is increasingly focused on one market: China.Corporate America's interest in the world's most populous nation is nothing new - China's dramatic economic boom has aroused growing curiosity from US boardrooms for several years. But lately the level of interest has begun to feel more like an obsession.During Wall Street's last round of quarterly earnings announcements, few large companies got very far into their conference calls with analysts before the subject of China came up. From iconic multinationals such as General Motors, General Electric and Goldman Sachs, to specialists such as Home Depot or Avon, almost every significant chief executive has Chinese expansion plans at the top of his or her to-do list.As domestic US growth shows signs of slowing and Europe's recovery remains relatively subdued, business leaders in the world's largest economy are determined not to miss China's potential contribution to the bottom line. Rising profits from China play an essential part in many analysts' financial modelling for this year and next.There are plenty of potential problems. Many smaller companies still view China predominantly as a threat. European and Japanese multinationals are queueing to claim their share of the prize. And it is not yet clear how far Beijing may be prepared to welcome foreign competition for Chinese companies in some sectors. One way to take the pulse of corporate America's love affair with all things Chinese is to watch the elaborate mating game being played out by companies such as FedEx.Express cargo aircraft are the clipper ships of the modern age, carrying 2 per cent of international trade measured by volume but 50 per cent measured by value. In the early hours of a sticky Tennessee night more than 80 of these aircraft an hour descend into FedEx's global hub at Memphis, making it the busiest cargo airport in the world. A military-style “command and control” centre ensures that, no matter how bad the thunderstorms get over the Midwest, the valuable flights from Asia are always the last to be diverted or cancelled.But the express logistics industry is about more than just ferrying cargo back and forth. A global hub-and-spoke network is designed to link hundreds of towns and cities with an overnight communications infrastructure that keeps the world's “just-in-time” supply chain taut. In developed markets such as the US, the ability to guarantee overnight shipment of parts and finished goods has allowed companies to reduce average inventory levels by a fifth over the last decade and is thought to have played a significant role in improving productivity across the economy (see charts).It is for this reason, above all else, that FedEx and rivals such as United Parcel Service and DHL are paying so much attention to China. As it becomes the workshop of the world, teeming factories along the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas represent both the start of the world's supply chain and the source of some its biggest transport bottlenecks.Growing recognition of this fact has also helped to spark interest among Chinese government officials. Despite the relatively immature state of its own competing airlines, Beijing last month signed an unusually liberal agreement with the US allowing a fivefold increase in the number of cargo and passenger flights between the two countries. A key part of this air services agreement was permission for carriers such as FedEx to open cargo hubs from 2007 and begin building the kind of logistics infrastructure demanded by companies with local manufacturing operations.The progress in opening up China's airspace illustrates an approach being taken by many of the more successful US multinationals. By targeting sophisticated markets where there is relatively little domestic competition - whether it be electricity generating equipment from GE or logistics expertise from FedEx - infrastructure providers are able to secure the kind of welcome in China that other manufacturers or service sector companies struggle to achieve.Fred Smith, FedEx chairman and chief executive, describes the lobbying process to increase access to China as considerably more straightforward than in supposedly liberalised markets such as Britain. “We had all this independent research that showed how important the fast movement of freight was to the development of the economy,” he says. “But we didn't have to make much of a sale - they [the Beijing officials] got it.”The speed at which Chinese markets for air services and the like are opening up also illustrates the value of the prize for those multinationals that can get in first. Not only is this a huge market, it is one of the last significant markets in the world to liberalise. “China is the important issue of the 21st century,” adds Mr Smith. “Its inexhaustible supply of labour and engineering talent is going to be an incredible part of the economic story of the world.”This is far from a winning situation for all concerned. Fierce battles remain, particularly over which companies should get to use the coveted new flight allocations. Some 39 weekly slots between China and the US become available between now and March for four US cargo carriers to share. Yet seven companies are demanding up to 53 flights between them. The US Department of Transportation has given them until today to make their case and is expected to make a final decision in September.With so much business at stake, operators already in China, such as FedEx and UPS, argue that landing rights should go to those most able to take advantage of them immediately. Those wanting entry counter that they should be given the chance to stimulate greater competition.Tussles over landing rights are standard fare in the express cargo business, which has lobbied for deregulation of the airways throughout most of its short life. But even by these standards, the scramble to gain a toehold in China has generated some heated exchanges. UPS, for example, has accused FedEx of seeking to hog slots that it does not need. In response FedEx has called UPS the “Don Quixote” of the case for tilting at windmills and accused its rival of seeking to create a “pseudo- hub” rather than invest in genuine infrastructure.Petty as such squabbles can seem from the outside, they are part of a great game being played out by multinationals in China. While FedEx and UPS fight among themselves, DHL - their European rival owned by Deutsche Post - is pressing ahead with opening a $100m cargo terminal in Hong Kong. Similar epic battles are being fought in the car industry, where General Motors is seeking to overtake Volkswagen's early market lead, and in the power and transport markets, where GE and Siemens compete for billions of dollars of new infrastructure orders.The outcome of this rivalry is watched keenly by cities seeking foreign investment. In the case of the express cargo industry, the economic prize sought is the location of regional distribution hubs, which can make surrounding areas much more attractive for further inward investment.FedEx, for example, has generated intense local interest by announcing talks with airport authorities in Guangzhou, the southern Chinese city at the heart of the Pearl River delta's manufacturing boom. Though unlikely to result in a completed hub until perhaps 2010, the talks are a coup for Guangzhou, which has built a new airport after years of struggling with overcrowded transport infrastructure. It also represents a challenge to Shenzhen and Hong Kong, nearby ports that have long prided themselves as the gateways to the Pearl River.FedEx insists the talks are not yet finalised, suggesting it wants to continue haggling over terms while retaining the option of going elsewhere. Both UPS and DHL hope to establish facilities in Shanghai, where the Yangtze River delta rivals its southern neighbour as China's export powerhouse.Elsewhere in Asia the competition is viewed with concern. FedEx and UPS have both invested heavily in hubs in the Philippines, where the Guangzhou talks have led to fears that China's growth may undermine FedEx's plans to expand its hub at Subic Bay, near Manila.FedEx rejects the argument, pointing out that, just as it maintains a number of different hubs in Europe and the US, there is no reason it cannot continue simultaneously to expand regional Asian facilities in Japan, the Philippines and China. Nevertheless the same hub-and-spoke system that makes the overnight cargo industry economically viable also tends to concentrate secondary economic benefits at the busiest points of the network. Memphis, for example, is Fed Ex's only hub with direct flights to all other points in the US network as well as many international destinations. Economists at the Stanford Research Institute have calculated that, as a result, 130 foreign-owned companies from 22 countries employing 17,200 workers have clustered around Memphis to take advantage of later pick-up times for overnight deliveries.It is far from easy to open a hub. The Memphis hub has been described as one of the world's most complex works of industrial choreography. Up to 5m individual packages must be unloaded, sorted and reloaded during a four-hour window so planes have time to reach their destinations by dawn. As the Chinese economy matures beyond its early reliance on labour-intensive manufacturing, infrastructure investment of this type becomes ever more important. In a world of global supply chains, sophisticated distribution centres are likely to become a sine qua non for successful economies.An assessment of the advantages that China can derive from foreign investment influences Beijing's bargaining with many multinationals. Goldman Sachs, which recently won approval for an investment banking venture in China, has even been encouraged to make a “donation” to help a troubled domestic firm. One worry for many multinationals is that different arms of the government might not view their presence in the same light, undermining whatever deals are reached. In the case of express deliveries, for example, opposition from China's state-owed postal service and its airlines remains a serious concern (see left). “The Chinese bureaucracy is big and there are lots of different interests,” says Rush O'Keefe, the FedEx lawyer leading its entry.Yet multinationals cannot afford to ignore the rewards. While growth rates in most markets are measured in single digits, FedEx boasts annual growth in China of more than 50 per cent. UPS says year-on-year growth was running at almost 70 per cent in the second quarter. In boardrooms across America, the common refrain is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.“There are hundreds of millions of people who are finding it glorious to get rich,” concludes Mr Smith in a self-conscious echo of the phrase Deng Xiaoping used to ignite China's boom. The assumption behind his enthusiasm is that it will be US multinationals that will help them do so.Checks on the postWhen DHL, the German-owned parcel carrier, launched a domestic express service in China in May, Beijing's State Postal Bureau declared it had never approved the move, writesAlexandra Harney.The reaction from the bureau - which also runs China Post, the national postal service and dominant parcel delivery company - gave an insight into a heated, behind-the-scenes debate about the regulation of parcel deliveries in China. DHL said it had all the necessary government approvals.As international express carriers begin to expand into China's vast domestic market they are running into some obstacles. The way in which these issues are resolved will have substantial consequences for the industry. China offers both rapid economic growth and a huge market at a time when many of other markets are maturing. “There aren't many countries that have a big enough geographical range and enough people that you can really have a domestic express product that will compete with the national post,” says one industry executive.So far international express carriers have enjoyed essentially unfettered access to the market - a key factor, they say, in their rapid growth in China. But in 2002 Chinese officials began revising the 18-year-old postal law, mapping out what would be the monopoly preserve of China Post. International executives, who have been allowed unusual access to the revision process, are chiefly concerned about China Post's dual role as competitor and regulator. “That is not a level playing field,” says David Cunningham, FedEx's Asia Pacific president. “We're happy to compete with anyone but we want to do it on a level playing field.”The discussions have been complicated by the fact that Express Mail Service, China Post's parcel delivery service, has seen its share of international express shipments fall to less than 30 per cent, largely because of the international carriers.At the same time, local express carriers are cropping up across China to challenge China Post at home.With the postal law in its sixth draft and the monopoly question still in flux, clashes like the one between DHL and the State Postal Bureau are not surprising. But the logic behind them is sometimes difficult to understand.China Domestic, DHL's domestic express service and the first of its kind from a foreign company, only delivers goods weighing more than 2kg. At the time that DHL started the service the draft law said foreign companies could deliver anything above 500g.Chinese officials have also countered international carriers' requests for access to the domestic market with concerns that they would deliver illegal materials such as literature from Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned in China, according to a person familiar with the talks. Chinese officials did not respond to a request for comment.A study by the US-China Business Council published last September estimated that an unrestricted air express industry would generate $3bn in additional investment and $84bn in increased manufacturing output, and create 800,000 jobs for China's export industry.Even as the debate continues, executives say they are pleased with the progress China has made in opening up its market. The latest draft of the postal law allows foreign companies to deliver anything weighing more than 350g, according to Mr Cunningham.The landmark US-China aviation agreement signed last month has also significantly widened the opportunities for international carriers. Out of the 195 additional weekly flights that will be added between the US and China over the next six years, 111 are reserved for cargo carriers. Under its 2001 accession commitments to the World Trade Organisation, China has to allow foreign companies majority ownership of freight transport companies within three years.
