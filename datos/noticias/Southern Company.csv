0;SO;Southern Company;2017-09-20T05:45:33Z;Brazil’s utility companies put out the welcome mat for China;Beijing is snapping up infrastructure assets and preparing bids for many more;When Li Keqiang, China’s premier, sought to emphasise the strength of Beijing’s relations with Brazil, he wrote of the Chinese love for Brazilian soap operas, such as the 1970s telenovela Escrava Isaura (Isaura the Slave Girl). The series, which played to enthusiastic audiences in China, traces the beautiful and modest Isaura’s tortuous battles with adversity.A similar narrative could be applied — admittedly with a great deal less romantic heat — to Brazil’s seesawing economic relationship with China. The ardour that had attended the boom in commodity exports to China from the early years of the millennium had dissipated by 2015 as an economic crash threw millions out of work.But in the same 2015 article in which he lionised Isaura, Li struck an optimistic tone. The “natural partners” would forge a new path that would transcend the reliance on commodity trade and emphasise Chinese investment in infrastructure to help Brazil avoid the “middle income trap”, Li wrote.“China is willing to participate in the Brazilian freight railway network, power grid, communications network and other large construction projects, and co-operate with the Brazilian side through the whole industrial chain in shipbuilding, chemical, oil and gas exploration and other areas,” Li added.Over the past 18 months, Beijing has started delivering, in emphatic fashion. Kevin Gallagher, professor of global development policy at Boston University, says a new phase in China’s commercial relationship with Brazil is under way. “The boom is over with respect to commodities, but there is now a shift toward infrastructure, banking and some manufacturing.”One of the clearest expressions of China’s new resolve came in June this year, when it agreed to allocate $15bn toward a bilateral $20bn fund earmarked mainly for infrastructure projects. Brazilian financial institutions are scheduled to provide $5bn to the fund, which was first proposed by Li during his 2015 visit to the country.“China has been really quick in setting up the $20bn infrastructure fund because it wants to get going [on investments],” Gallagher says. “Brazil is, of course, very hot to trot because the cost of capital is expensive for it right now. Brazil has major infrastructure gaps that won’t be filled by private capital or even development banks, so those funds are sorely needed.”The scope of Brazil’s infrastructure needs — and therefore the size of the opportunity to China’s contract-hungry engineering companies — is huge. The Global Infrastructure Hub, a G20 research initiative, estimates that Brazil will need to put $2.7tn into infrastructure by 2040, but at the current rate of investment will achieve only $1.5tn of this, leaving a shortfall of $1.2tn.Such pressures, reinforced by those of an economy in recession, have led to a more open attitude to foreigners owning and building infrastructure. China’s big state groups have seized on this, snapping up some prize infrastructure assets and preparing bids for many more, officials and analysts say.“Some countries will not allow investment from China in these sectors [basic infrastructure], but this is not the case in Brazil,” says Roberto Jaguaribe, president of Apex-Brazil, the Brazilian trade and investment promotion agency. “We are very open to infrastructure investments from China.”Jaguaribe, a former Brazilian ambassador to China, is in no doubt about the macroeconomic importance that Chinese investments represent as his country grapples to free itself from the deep recession that followed the commodity boom. “China is the biggest year-to-year investor in Brazil in recent years and we think these investments are going to go even higher,” he says.In hard numbers, China’s infrastructure-led acquisitions amounted to $5.7bn in the first four months of 2017, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of total inward investment, according to Dealogic, the consultancy. The Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce in São Paulo predicts this number could reach $20bn for the whole of 2017, up 70 per cent on 2016.The importance of Chinese infrastructure investments can be seen clearly in the power generation and transmission sectors. State Grid Corp, a state-owned Chinese power transmission company and the world’s largest utility, bought a controlling stake in CPFL Energia last year. This made the Chinese company, which already operated nearly 10,000km of power lines in Brazil, responsible for one of the largest parts of the country’s power grid.‘Brazil is very hot to trot because the cost of capital is expensive for it right nowIn power generation, the China Three Gorges Corporation bought a 30-year franchise for two large hydropower plants, the Jupiá and Ilha Solteira, for $3.7bn in late 2015. But this might be just the start of a wave of deals. Several other Chinese power companies, including Shanghai Electric, China Southern Power Grid and Huaneng, are considering bids for power industry assets set to be sold off, analysts say.In one sense, the Chinese are acting as white knights. Some Brazilian electricity companies’ debt is rising to unsustainable levels, exacerbated by the recession and a government measure in 2012 that forced companies to cut tariffs to renew their 30-year contracts with the government. A severe drought between 2013 and 2015 shrivelled the country’s reservoirs, hitting hydropower companies hard, as customers switched from hydroelectric to thermoelectric sources.The strategic dimension to this is that Beijing regards Brazil as an important ally in the developing world, a key potential market of more than 200m people and a springboard for commercial opportunities in the rest of Latin America. That Brazil is situated in the strategic backyard of the US, which has an increasingly fraught relationship with China, only increases the value of Beijing’s ties with the country.There are, however, residual concerns, says Jaguaribe. Chinese infrastructure companies should be careful to observe Brazilian labour practices, environmental and social standards as they go about acquiring big chunks of the country’s basic infrastructure, he warns. “The biggest barrier is that they can’t act abroad as they do in China,” says Jaguaribe. “Some countries let them do this, but this does not happen in Brazil.”
1;SO;Southern Company;2015-06-29T06:17:59Z;China graft probe uncovers falsified revenues at large SOEs;State auditor names groups including State Grid, Cosco and China Southern Power Grid;China’s state auditor has uncovered falsified revenues and profits in the accounts of some of the country’s biggest state-owned companies, as Beijing broadens its assault on official corruption.The National Audit Office said on Sunday that 14 state-owned groups, including well-known names such as State Grid, China Ocean Shipping Co (Cosco) and China Southern Power Grid, falsified nearly Rmb30bn ($4.8bn) in revenue and nearly Rmb20bn in profits in 2013.The revelations came in the auditor’s annual work report summarising the results of its reviews of government spending, as well as state-owned enterprises. It follows audits last year that exposed problems at China Investment Corporation, the sovereign wealth fund, Bank of China, the fourth-largest lender, and Agricultural Development Bank, a policy lender.The audit office’s more aggressive stance towards state champions is part of a huge clampdown on corruption and misuse of public funds in areas ranging from mah-jong to top company executives, more than 100 of which have been detained on suspicion of corruption since the start of last year, according to official statistics.Last week, a separate agency, the Communist party’s anti-graft watchdog, said it would probe China Railway Corp, China Aluminum Corp and People’s Daily, the official party mouthpiece, in the latest round of inspections at state companies.The state auditor blamed poor due diligence and decision-making procedures for wasting Rmb1.6bn in resources and Rmb35bn in “losses or idle assets”. The auditor said Rmb4bn had been recouped from the companies involved and 250 people penalised.The audit office statement said 56 serious cases had been handed over to “relevant departments”, probably a reference to prosecutors or the party's anti-corruption commission.Loans worth Rmb17bn from Bank of Communications, China Development Bank and China Export and Credit Insurance had violated rules, the auditor said.China Development Bank, a non-commercial policy lender that supports infrastructure and foreign development loans, violated rules on Rmb13bn in loans disbursed since 2005. Bank of Communications, China’s fifth-largest by assets, gave out Rmb3.8bn in loans to unqualified projects and companies between 2008 and 2014, the auditor said.Last week, the national auditor uncovered misappropriation of nearly Rmb17bn in funds from the state lottery programme. Funds were misappropriated through the buying and building of office buildings and hotels or embezzled, the National Audit Office said.Irregularities accounted for a quarter of the total of lottery funds received in 2012-14, the audit office said.The state-run sports and “social welfare” lotteries are the only legal form of gambling allowed in mainland China and on current rates of growth lottery ticket sales are expected to eclipse those in the US by the end of next year, making China the world’s biggest lottery market.Additional reporting by Jackie Cai and Ma Nan
2;SO;Southern Company;2010-12-21T18:51:50Z;State Grid views Brazil as another smart move;;China’s State Grid, which on Tuesday announced a $1bn investment in Brazil, often refers to itself as the backbone of its homeland.The state-owned group, which serves more than 1bn people in China and employs 1.5m, is so closely linked to the government it receives a public grading – almost always an “A” – by its state supervisor.Electricity was one of the last sectors to undergo structural reform as China moved away from a planned economy, and State Grid was born from that process in 2002. The reforms also created China Southern Power Grid and five state-owned generators.But State Grid is by far the most powerful. Headed by Liu Zhenya, a party member who has worked at the company for 40 years, State Grid has steadily consolidated its position and manoeuvred its way into near-total dominance of the country’s multi-billion-dollar smart grid plans.Named the world’s eighth-largest company by revenues by this year’s Fortune Global 500 list, State Grid had total assets in 2009 of $293.2bn. Profits, however, were a mere 4.52bn yuan ($678m). China’s electricity is plagued by a simple problem of geography – the country’s energy resources are far away from the cities that need them – and the goal of the smart grid is to help solve that.“Speeding up the building of a strong and smart grid is good for the basic transformation of China’s power development,” Mr Liu said recently. A better, more efficient grid is key to achieving the environmental goals of the next five-year plan, he said, promising that all areas of China would have basic grid connections by 2012.State Grid has said it will spend Rmb1,700bn on grid construction in the next five years and complete the smart grid by 2015. That project will make it the world’s largest consumer of copper, and therefore a key driver of copper prices.The power lines that State Grid is building will draw energy from remote corners of the country, for example channelling Tibetan hydropower into urban areas, and also reach beyond China’s borders.A Russia-China transmission line has been under discussions for years, and the company has signed energy co-operation agreements with Mongolia and Kazakhstan.The Brazil deal is a different type of venture, however. Rather than securing energy for Chinese cities, the deal is aimed at raising the company’s strategic international presence and securing a profit. “With constant breakthroughs, the company has upgraded Chinese enterprises’ global influence in the field of energy,” according to the company website.State Grid first went abroad in 2007, when it won an auction as part of a consortium to operate the national grid in the Philippines. More recent overseas efforts have been mixed: the company failed to receive Chinese government approval for a Chilean copper investment this year.“The Chinese are becoming more aggressive in making overseas acquisitions and in the future they will be major players in the international power sector,” says Brett King, a partner at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker, which specialises in power deals.The Brazilian power sector has not traditionally been a money-spinner for foreign power companies, but for State Grid the returns in Brazil probably look much better than at home, where it barely made a profit last year.
3;SO;Southern Company;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;China ready to build ‘ultra high voltage’ line;;"State Grid, China’s dominant power transmission company, is readying construction of the first of a series of 2,000km “ultra high voltage” lines to bring electricity from deep inland to the coast.The UHV lines will connect coalmining centres and possibly hydro-power stations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze in south-west China with the power-hungry coastal areas around Shanghai and Guangzhou.State Grid, which is responsible for about 80 per cent of electricity transmission in China, plans to invest tens of billions of dollars in the electrical infrastructure over the next decade, pending Beijing’s approval. This year alone the company plans Rmb202.5bn ($26bn) of capital expenditure, up from Rmb176bn in 2006, according to a spokesman.China’s large and growing power demand and the long distances between its energy raw materials inland and large consumers on the coast will probably make it the world’s largest market for new transmission technology.China is adding about 80 gigawatts of new power capacity every year, about equal to the UK’s entire installed capacity.The country plans to build about one new UHV-DC transmission line every year for the next 10 years, each costing about $1.5bn, according to Zürich-based ABB, which hopes to tender for work on the projects.The electrical infrastructure market is likely to draw heavy interest from investors in the years to come, with both State Grid and the China Southern Power Grid, which covers the remaining 20 per cent of the country, in the early stages of preparing overseas initial public offerings.State Grid’s net profits soared 87 per cent in 2006 to Rmb26.9bn, largely on
the back of huge demand and the company’s semi-monopoly position.Liu Zehong, head of the UHV project at State Grid, said the technology was ideal for China’s geography and would cut the power wastage that occurs in more indirect transmissions.“It is like a 747 flying from China to New York – it is best to go direct,” he said.The systems planned will use both direct current and alternating current, depending on where the electricity is coming from.ABB, which has tested technology for an 800-kilovolt UHV-DC system, said the lines could stretch as long as 2,500km.The engineering group said the last time voltage for such systems was increased was 20 years ago when the company built a 600-kilovolt line in Brazil, then a record.The scheme has become embroiled in controversy partly because of concerns about the vulnerability to failure or sabotage of single lines carrying so much power.State Grid has come under criticism for its size and scope of its business
activities."
4;SO;Southern Company;2006-07-06T16:12:32Z;HK gives Chinese listings the thumbs up again;;Three weeks ago, only the bravest investor would have wagered that shares in Shimao Property Holdings, a Chinese real estate company, would surge nearly 6 per cent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong stock market.Shui On, another Chinese property company, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Vincent Lo, had just postponed its $1bn initial public offering days ahead of its planned listing in Hong Kong.Shui On was caught up in worries that China’s real estate market was overheating and decided to pull its float amid global stock market jitters sparked by fears that rising US interest rates would dent Asia’s fastest-growing economies.But analysts also debated whether Shui On’s decision to abort its listing was the clearest sign to date that the China IPO bubble had burst and investors had finally fallen out of love with mainland Chinese companies.In the five weeks to mid-June, the index of H shares (comprising mainland companies listed on the Hong Kong stock market) dived 20 per cent.However, the pessimism has proved short-lived with investment bankers and company chiefs confident that there remains a large pool of investors keen to access the China growth story. The H-share index has climbed 15 per cent since mid-June.This week’s successful $500m listing of Shimao has provided a fillip to that of Greentown China Holdings, a rival property company that is planning a $400m Hong Kong IPO later this month.Other Chinese companies considering IPOs in Hong Kong include Shenzhen Energy and China Southern Power Grid, National Coal and China Merchants Bank.There is also the $12bn-plus Hong Kong listing of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the mainland’s largest lender, which is expected to float in October this year.There was no trace of pessimism in a forecast published this week by PwC, the consultancy, which predicted that mainland companies would continue to provide the lion’s share of the growing number of listings expected in Hong Kong in the second half of this year.PwC forecast that the Hong Kong exchange would welcome 70 newcomers this year, in offerings that would raise a combined HK$250bn ($32bn). Hong Kong remainsthe preferred destination for Chinese companies considering an overseas listing.Justin Haik, head of the Asia Pacific equity syndicate at Morgan Stanley, said Asian markets rose earlier this year on the back of a liquidity bubble swollen by momentum-investing hedge funds.He said: “Market levels now more accurately reflect the risks of higher interest rates in response to rising inflation and the potential for slower growth. There is an equilibrium.”Mr Haik added: “There continues to be significant amounts of capital looking to participate in the mainland growth story. Investors are particularly focused on businesses that offer exposure to rising affluence and growth in domestic consumption.”According to Dealogic, Chinese companies provided 45 per cent of all equity issuance in Asia excluding Japan, a record level.Spencer White, Merrill Lynch chief Asia strategist, said: “Investors are relieved that China’s growth trajectory has not collapsed. However the success of Chinese IPOs is contingent on sensible pricing of assets. Investors are more selective now than they were in late April.”Shimao was a case in point. It priced its IPO at about 40 per cent below its net asset value, or HK$6.25per share, the bottom of an indicated range, amid weak investor demand: the listing’s retail tranche was only 54 per cent covered.One China-focused investment banker, who declined to be named, said he expected issuance in China to pick up substantially following the summer holidays. He said: “Chinese IPOs will be very active from September to November, with levels of issuance doubling in the second half of the year compared to the first half.”He believes Nasdaq in the US and Chinese exchanges are also set to benefit from increasing levels of mainland listings. He said: “The Chinese government is encouraging companies to first seek a domestic listing, and this will have some impact on issuance flowing through Hong Kong.”Regulators in Shanghai last month restarted the market for IPOs, after it had been closed for a year. This week, Bank of China, another of the “big four“ state-owned commercial banks, began trading on the Shanghai stock exchange after a Rmb20bn ($2.5bn) domestic IPO, the country’s largest.Analysts expect several other top mainland companies to list on the exchange over the coming months.
5;SO;Southern Company;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
